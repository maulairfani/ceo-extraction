While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our lives, we saw a reinforcement of the trends that support our business.\n\nAlthough we have learned to live with the virus, in 2020, we were forced to change. We now live and work differently. We adapted to new ways of working with much less travel and many more digital meetings. The disruption of 2020 went far beyond the pandemic, with social upheaval and geopolitical tension. We saw the conclusion of Brexit, an acceleration in technologies and innovation, such as electric vehicles and 5G, as well as increasing commitments to halt climate change.\n\nFor Schneider Electric, it has been a signature year. We've changed more than we ever thought we could, while staying true to our mission.\n\n## We delivered on our purpose and mission\n\nOur first priority in 2020 was the health and safety of our people and the communities in which we operate. We supported and helped our ecosystem, our customers and partners, and all the people close to us by putting in place dedicated safety, security, and work policies. We also launched the Tomorrow Rising Fund, with more than 70 local projects supporting the response, resilience, and recovery of communities in more than 60 countries.\n\nOur purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all. At Schneider we call this, Life Is On, and never has this been more true than in 2020, as we ensured continuity for our communities supporting critical infrastructure, such as electricity and water networks, hospitals, data centers and industrial plants, pharmaceuticals, and food cold chains. We were recognized as providing mission critical services to many sectors, in more than 90 countries, and as such, were asked by authorities to keep our business running. All our teams remained committed and continued to serve customers. In a matter of days, we transitioned our customer care centers from in-office to work-from-home set ups. We were able\n\nto support our customers in reducing risk in their operations and to operate remotely with our automation and digital solutions. Our manufacturing plants remained up and running, allowing us to meet the critical needs of this crisis year.\n\n2020 confirmed that, at Schneider, great people make a great company.\n\nIn 2020, we achieved resilient business performance and, at the same time, built the future.\n\nIn 2020, we achieved four things:\n\n- 1.  A resilient business performance;\n- 2.  We shaped our future, realizing strategic acquisitions;\n- 3.  We increased our sustainability impact; and\n- 4.  We transformed how we work, to adapt to circumstances in record time.\n\n## Resilient business performance\n\nThis year of crisis has proven that the execution of our strategy, and the repositioning of Schneider Electric over the past 15 years, has made us more resilient. Compared to the global financial crisis of 2009, when our sales decreased by 15.7%, and our profitability by -310 bps versus 2008; in 2020, we were much more resilient. We have been able to achieve strong business performance, with EUR 25.2 billion in Revenues (-4.7% with the previous year), a Gross Margin at a 12-year high of 40.4%, an Adjusted EBITA margin expanding +20 bps organically, and a record-high Free Cash Flow of EUR 3.7 billion, which is a signature of our quality of execution. Both Energy Management and Industrial Automation businesses delivered very solid profitability and all geographies contributed to the rebound in the second half of the year.",

The Group's assets under management grew by 46% over this past year, and software and services, which now represent 17% of our revenue, grew 6 pts higher than the rest of the Group's portfolio. Our business related to digital solutions and EcoStruxure \u2122 , including software, controls, connected products, and services, and representing more than 50% of our total revenue, has become an indisputable catalyst for growth and is due to increase further in the future.\n\nThe accelerated execution of our long-standing strategy of more products, more services, more software, and better systems supported strong resilience. We were able to support customers across all sectors in managing their operations remotely, providing more efficiency and resiliency. We continued to engineer and deliver projects. In the second half of the year, we were back to growth and sold more services, digital solutions, and products than in 2019, thanks to our unrivalled network of partners.\n\nWe fully leveraged our global set up and our multi-local model to benefit from our global scale and adapt with speed and reactivity to the very different local COVID-19 situations. We truly believe that trusting and empowering local teams is the most efficient way to deal with the unexpected and to swiftly define local and innovative solutions. Our supply chain recovered quickly and its performance, in terms of customer-centricity, sustainability and digitization, was recognized and in 2020 ranked #4 globally and #1 in Europe by Gartner.\n\n## We shaped our future and realized strategic acquisitions\n\nThis strong performance made it possible to continue investing for the future and to provide continued dividend growth for shareholders for the 11th consecutive year.\n\nWe acted nimbly to accelerate our transformation journey. We finalized the acquisition of the Electrical & Automation business of Larsen & Toubro, building the foundation for stronger development in India and of a new global hub to serve global markets from India. We also constructed defining deals in software, with the completed acquisitions of RIB Software, to accelerate the digital transformation of the construction sector, and ProLeiT, to reinforce our automation capabilities in the food and beverage sector. We realized the strategic investment in Planon, to extend our cloudbased capabilities for construction orchestration and facility management optimization, as well as the proposed acquisition of ETAP to form a unique suite electrical design tools, and we supported AVEVA's planned acquisition of OSIsoft. As such, we are uniquely positioned to address the software needs of our customers across the life cycle of their projects and installations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020 we accelerated and prepared for the/uni00A0future.'\n\nOur customers support our solutions for an alldigital, all-electric world, transitions we enable with more products, more software, more services, and systems.'\n\nOur mission is to be the digital partner of our customers for sustainability and efficiency, as digitization becomes increasingly pervasive in buildings, in data centers, across smart grids, industries, and in homes. For years, we have continuously developed and reinforced a full offer for an all-digital, all-electric world. By combining digital and electric solutions and services, we deliver a unique efficiency value proposition based on four dimensions of integration. Firstly, we enable integration of energy and automation for energy and resource efficiency. Secondly, we connect everything from end-point to the cloud, making every installation transparent and the data available to all those who need it, from operators to the control room. Thirdly, based on a fully integrated suite of software and digital twins, we enable the integration of an installation's life cycle across all phases, from design and build, to operate and maintain. And finally, digitization allows us to connect and manage companies across sites to reach new levels of enterprise-wide efficiency.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, we relentlessly innovate for our customers, with technology and in the way we do business. We launched new innovations, such as EcoStruxure \u2122 Automation Expert and our SM AirSeT switchgear to eliminate SF 6 from our systems. In 2021, more than 20 new, innovative offers will be released. In 2020, our eCommerce business grew over 20% year-on-year, now representing 25% of our overall distribution business.\n\n## A step-change in sustainability\n\nThis year we have seen a strong call for sustainability, and a deep move towards smart and green recovery plans. We realized that, even as we continue to fight COVID-19, climate change is the next risk on the horizon - and that it is a risk that will impact everyone around the world, even more severely than the pandemic. Corporations are making ambitious commitments and the sense of emergency has increased with the COVID-19 crisis. Today, more than 370 companies have joined the UN Global Compact's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, and many other coalitions have taken shape. Governments are turning a corner, as shown by the Green Deal in Europe, China's targets to peak emissions in 2030, and the new US administration's return to the Paris Agreement. This has been strongly fostered over the past two years by growing demand from investors and shareholders to boards and CEOs, to put together science-based targets for carbon neutrality.",

We keep on progressing and consolidating our position as a practitioner and an expert in sustainability and ESG, that is, environment, social and governance. We have put more resources behind our sustainability business and advisory services to help our customers and partners navigate this landscape and to lead them on a proven decarbonization pathway that combines both strategy and action, while also positively impacting their bottom line. We have already developed strong partnerships for sustainability and efficiency and since 2018, our systems business alone has helped save 134 million tons of CO 2 for our customers.\n\nWe are grateful for the international recognition we achieved as a leader in sustainability, ranked as the world's #1 most sustainable corporation on Corporate Knights' Global 100 in 2021, recognized as a CDP A List Company for ten years in a row, trusted by numerous ESG investors all around the world, listed as one of the most ethical companies, and recognized with a Glassdoor 4.0 ranking. In 2020, we completed our Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020 program, delivering a strong performance of 9.32 out of 10 against the year-end target of at least 9 out of 10, despite the disruption caused by COVID-19. However, we want to continue to raise the bar and go even further, so in 2020, we took a new step towards our environment, society and economy goals, with six long-term commitments to sustainability, including carbon emissions (to be carbon neutral on full end-to-end footprint by 2040) and resource preservation goals (net zero biodiversity loss in our operations by 2030), substantiated by more than ten concrete detailed targets. For example, we want 80% of our revenues to be green revenues by 2025 and increase gender diversity in hiring (50%) to front-line managers (40%) and leadership teams (30%). Sustainability is a strong driver for growth.\n\n## Doing business as unusual\n\nIn 2020, we transformed faster than ever, and adopted new ways of doing things that we had previously thought impossible. We demonstrated agility, through our fast reaction and ability to adapt to the pandemic, with both our customers and internally.\n\n## We innovated to transform the way we work:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of our customer care centers across 62 locations moved to remote working;\n- \u00b7 We developed remote services in many areas; and\n- \u00b7 We organized more than 5,600 digital events, 600,000 digital trainings, and hundreds of digital smart factory tours. We held our first ever all-digital Annual Shareholders' Meeting, allowing more shareholders to participate than ever before.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u20ac25.2B\n\nRevenues\n\nI personally spoke with many more customers, employees, shareholders, investors, and partners than in a normal year. We reinforced the communication with our suppliers and distributors, and stepped up collaborative services, such as AVEVA 3D, IGE-XAO, and RIB Software's M2 platform. Collaboration and trust are a major catalyst of resilience. We swiftly changed the way we work across the Company, leveraging our multi-hub organization, further empowering our local teams, and encouraging a hybrid home/office way of working. This was possible thanks to the dayto-day experience with digital tools that our teams operating in different global sites, have acquired over the past ten years. We encourage flexible working and our employees have been working from home a few days per week for years, which helped a lot. As such, we were able to reorganize quickly when the pandemic broke/uni00A0out.\n\nThe future operating model will be more digital and decentralized: a hybrid of what we have learned and how we worked before.\n\n## 2021 Perspectives\n\n2020 was a pivotal year for digitalization and sustainability. Looking ahead, 2021 will be a year of a strong rebound and momentum in all our geographies and many sectors, with growth opportunities in buildings, homes, data centers, infrastructure, and industry. Electrification, digitization, and sustainability are at the top of the agenda of all our customers.\n\nA year of intense action and transformation in 2020 has prepared us for a continuation of strong execution in 2021. We are wellpositioned with our end-markets, our portfolio, our model, our organization, and our leadership to grow our business and deliver digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability to our customers across the life cycle. We remain focused on the deployment of our priorities and our 2021 financial target is in line with our ambition to achieve c.17% Adjusted EBITA margin by 2022.\n\nStrength resides in agility, local reactivity, and speed. Let's build on everything we learned in 2020. Crises are a powerful learning accelerator because they leave us no choice. They also remind us that we are more resilient, more flexible, and more able to change than we all imagine, attributes which are a solid foundation for innovation and growth.\n\n## Jean-Pascal Tricoire,\n\nChairman and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our strategy on page 16",

        "page_content": "## Consistent strategy drives resilient performance\n\n## What were the highlights of Schneider Electric's 2020 performance?\n\n2020 highlighted the strength of our multi-local business model and our ability to act with agility and to change the way we work all while continuing to execute on our major business transformations. We finished 2020 with Revenue of EUR 25.2 billion, down -4.7% organic, better than our external guidance and market expectations. We saw a strong uptick in activity in the second half, particularly in China, India, and the United States and with sequential improvement across geographies. Demand in certain segments, such as residential buildings, smart grids, and data centers, stepped-up amidst the pandemic. Gross Margin continues to develop well and reached 40.4%, with consistent improvement over the past five years, reflecting our focus on more products, services, and software; our consistent delivery of industrial productivity and our track-record of RMI and cost recovery over the cycle. Gross Margin was also boosted by positive net price and mix, factors expected to normalize in 2021. We improved Adjusted EBITA margin by +20 bps organic, reaching +15.6%. Recent acquisitions (L&T, RIB Software, and ProLeiT) contributed positively, with the integration process on track. As a result of this strong operational performance, coupled with an improving cost of financing, our Adjusted Net Income was down only 4.4% organic.\n\nOur Free Cash Flow reached an all-time record of EUR3.7 billion (including IFRS 16 impact), partly boosted by lower activity in 2020, showing our capacity to convert our result into cash with good control on our working capital and enabling continued strategic investments in innovation. Returning cash to our shareholders remains a priority in our capital allocation strategy and we continued our track-record of progressive dividends for an 11th year, increasing our proposed dividend by +2% to EUR 2.60 per/uni00A0share.\n\n## Could you share your medium-term ambition to increase operating profitability, what are the key levers?\n\nWe are well positioned both strategically and financially to drive strong and profitable growth across the economic cycle. First, through our consistent strategy focused on delivering efficiency, reliability, and sustainability to our customers, increasingly through digitally enabled solutions. And we are well positioned in our end-markets with a portfolio well-aligned for growth in a post COVID -19 world.\n\nIn mid-2020, we reaffirmed our medium-term ambitions: acrosscycle organic growth of +3% to +6% in Revenues, Adjusted EBITA margin of around 17% by 2022, and across-cycle Free Cash Flow of around EUR 3 billion, on average. This improvement in profitability will be achieved through a combination of organic growth, organizational simplification and efficiency, continued productivity, and portfolio optimization.\n\n## What is the outlook for Schneider Electric in 2021?\n\nOur priority for 2021 is to continue to deliver profitable growth. We expect this strong and sustainable performance to be achieved through a combination of topline growth, where we are targeting organic sales growth between +5 and +8% and Adjusted EBITA margin expansion of +60 bps to +100 bps organic. This implies\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin of around 16.1% to 16.5% for 2021 (including scope based on transactions completed in 2020 and FX/uni00A0based on current estimation).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Could you tell us more about what you think will contribute to the future success of Schneider Electric, particularly after the challenges of 2020?\n\nThough we are very committed to our shorter-term targets, we are also very focused on preparing the Group for the medium and longer term. We believe that our focus on more connected and green products, more digital offerings, and more services - including sustainability services - will enable growth in future years. In 2020, based on our ability to act with agility and our strong cash flow profile, we maintained our investments in strategic R&D and closed or proposed a number of transformational acquisitions focused on positioning Schneider Electric for longer-term success. To ensure success over the medium and longer- term, we also ensure to allocate specific time in our internal business reviews towards elements of ESG - specifically focusing on quality and safety, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and ethics within the Group as well as with our suppliers and broader ecosystem. We continue to raise the bar on our ESG commitments with our new Schneider Sustainability Impact program for 2021-2025. Our first sustainability-linked convertible bond, issued in November 2020, reiterates our sustainability commitments.\n\nWe emerged from a crisis year and we have strong plans for future efficiency, effectiveness, and growth. With our strong operating model, future-ready portfolio of businesses, and focus on innovation we are positioned to drive strong organic growth and attractive returns to shareholders in an increasingly all-electric and all-digital world.\n\n## Hilary Maxson,\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nRead more about our performance on page 8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarket Cap.

To be future ready, the Group accelerated its transformational acquisitions in both business portfolios and presence in India, with a step-change in sustainability, and focused its investment in innovation, services, and cybersecurity. The step-change seen in customer adoption of digitization and sustainability accelerated and supported software and services growth, despite lockdowns. The Group remains committed to its strategic priorities of more products, more software, more services, and more sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenues were down -7.4% (-4.7% organic), a net scope effect of -0.2%, mostly due to disposal of Pelco and Converse Energy Projects, and deconsolidation of Electroshield Samara, offset by consolidation of L&T E&A, RIB Software, and ProLeiT, and a negative exchange rate effect of -2.5% mainly driven by the appreciation of the Euro against USD.\n\n2020 delivered resilient results, with Energy Management down -4.5% organic, with strong revenue growth in residential, data center, utilities, and consumer packaged goods, and Industrial Automation down -5.3%, with discrete markets being resilient while process and hybrid markets remained challenged. Across those two businesses, Software and Services now account for around 17% of turnover, showing resilience versus Group performance and bringing both recurring revenue and customer stickiness.\n\nMost geographies were strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic over the year: North America -4.9%, Asia Pacific -4.1%, Western Europe -5.3%, and Rest of the World -4.1%.\n\n2020 delivered very solid profitability by maintaining Adjusted EBITA at the same level as 2019, despite the crisis, at 15.6%, with organic expansion of 20 bps versus 2019, thanks to pricing actions, RMI tailwind, strong productivity, and strong delivery of savings. This represents the fifth consecutive year of Adjusted EBITA margin expansion, increasing by +300 bps organic over the period covering both lower- and higher-growth years.\n\nNet Income (Group share) was EUR 2,126 million, -12% from 2019. Restructuring charges were -EUR 421 million in 2020, EUR 166 million higher than last year due to the Group's structural savings and cost efficiency plan.\n\nOther operating income and expenses were -EUR 210 million, mainly consisting of M&A and integration costs, versus -EUR 411 million in 2019. Increase of the amortization and impairment of intangibles (-EUR 207 million in 2020) was mainly linked to recent acquisitions.\n\n## Net financial expenses were\n\n-EUR 278 million, EUR 17 million higher than in 2019, mainly driven by the cost of net debt decrease, offset by a write-off of a subsidiary loan and lower dividends from equity investments.\n\nIncome tax amounted to -EUR 638 million. The effective tax rate was 22.7%, in line with expectations.\n\nShare of profit on associates decreased slightly to EUR 66 million, from EUR 78 million last year.

We are the most local of global companies, built across four hubs (Paris, France; Hong Kong, China; Boston, USA; and Bangalore, India) providing opportunities to grow within our organization, and we are continually championing diversity, equity, and inclusion to make a bigger impact on society.\n\nThe very nature of the workforce and the job market is evolving. There are up to five generations working side by side, and each generation has a varied set of expectations from their employer. This in turn is leading to a shift towards a highly personalized, digitized employee experience. We accelerated the global rollout of the Open Talent Market to drive upskilling, career development, and mentoring. This smart platform, powered by AI, helps employees take ownership of their careers and develop real and new experiences.\n\nWith 83% (1) of our employees preferring more flexibility in when and where to work, we are empowering employees to manage their unique life and work by leveraging agile, flexible, and smart ways of working to help our people effectively manage hybrid working.\n\n## Our People Vision\n\nAll this change influences how we work together and ultimately how we create value for our customers. We updated our People Vision to accelerate our business performance and transform our culture and leadership. At Schneider Electric, we are building for the future, in sync with the changes happening in our markets and with our customers.\n\nOur People Vision consists of the following:\n\nOur Employee Value Proposition (EVP) is our commitment to engage existing and future talent. It's the reason why people join, stay, and remain engaged and shows how we differentiate ourselves as an employer.\n\nOur Core Values determine who we are, what we do and define the way we work together and deliver on our EVP promise. Our values guide our choices and illustrate the behaviors we expect our employees to demonstrate.\n\nOur Leadership Expectations show how we expect leaders to drive the Group for the future. They emphasize how our leaders will transform the Group by stepping up both individually and collectively.",

We regularly survey our teams to measure employee awareness and to gather and address their feedback. Our behaviors have been incorporated progressively in all our people rituals such as recruitment (behavioral interviewing), performance evaluation, recognition, and promotion of leaders (based on our defined behaviors). We have also implemented policies to foster better work-life integration and developed frameworks to help our employees manage their own situation. The initiatives we have launched, and the ones we're continuing to build on, reflect our goal to be the best place to work, so the best people choose us and stay with us.\n\nEngaging with early career talent is an ongoing priority. Launched in 2011, Schneider Go Green is an annual competition for Business and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students around the world to find innovative solutions for energy management and automation - exposing them to our employer brand and core values. It is now an established global initiative to attract graduates for early career opportunities and ongoing talent fulfillment objectives. Over the years, the competition has become a great opportunity for students to not only share bold ideas, but also to start a career at Schneider Electric.\n\nIn ten years, Schneider Go Green has had more than 117,400 registrants, with more than 21,700 students from 172 countries submitting ideas. In 2020 alone, more than 24,400 students registered and nearly 3,000 students submitted ideas. Schneider Go Green continues to develop strong and increasing interest from students, especially in emerging economies. 2020's global winning students, Angie Redondo and Jorge Polo, from Universidad Nacional de Colombia , presented a Sustainable Fishing project to benefit the Bojay\u00e1 community, living on the Atrato River near Colombia's Pacific coast.\n\nSchneider Go Green makes you understand that technology is nothing but the bridge between people's problems and the solution they need. Go Green lets you dream that a better world is possible if we work together for it. I loved it and it enriched me as a person, and also as a professional!'\n\nToni , an Industrial Engineering degree student at Escuela Superior de Ingenier\u00edas Industrial, Aeroespacial y Audiovisual de Terrassa , was a top Schneider Go Green 2020 European finalist and is now a trainee in Spain.",

How we manage risks\n\n## 8.1 Definition and objectives of internal control and risk management\n\n## Definition and objectives\n\nThe Group's internal control procedures are designed to ensure:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 application of instructions and guidelines issued by Group Senior Management;\n- \u00b7 the proper functioning of the Company's internal processes;\n- \u00b7 the reliability of financial reporting; and\n- \u00b7 more generally, internal control helps the Group manage its businesses, run efficient operations and use its resources efficiently.\n\nInternal control aims to prevent and manage risks related to the Group's business. These include accounting and financial risks, as well as operating, fraud and compliance risks. However, no system of internal control is capable of providing absolute assurance that these risks will be managed completely.\n\n## Scope of this report\n\nThe system is designed to cover the Group, defined as the Schneider Electric SE parent company and the subsidiaries over which it exercises exclusive control.\n\nJointly controlled subsidiaries are subject to all of the controls described below, with the exception of self-assessments of the implementation of Key Internal Controls (see 'Operating Units' within 'Control procedures', session 8.5, page 46).\n\n## Internal control reference documents\n\nThe Group's internal control system complies with the legal obligations applicable to companies listed on the Paris stock exchange. It is consistent with the reference framework laid down by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (French Financial Markets Authority - AMF) on internal control and risk management.\n\nThe Group's internal control process is evolving; procedures are adapted to reflect changes in the AMF recommendations and the business and regulatory environment, as well as in the Group's organization and operations.\n\n## Information used to prepare this Document\n\nThis Document was prepared using contributions from the Group's Internal Audit and Internal Control Departments, as well as the various participants in internal control.",

How we manage risks\n\n## Senior Management\n\nSenior Management is responsible for designing and leading the overall internal control system, with support from all key participants, in particular the Group Internal Audit and Internal Control Departments.\n\nIt also monitors the Group's performance during business reviews with the Operating Divisions and Global Functions. These reviews cover business trends, action plans, current results, and forecasts for the quarters ahead.\n\nSimilar reviews are carried out at different levels of the Group prior to Senior Management's review.\n\n## Internal Audit Department\n\nThe Internal Audit Department reports to Senior Management. It had an average headcount of 19 auditors and 23 regional internal controllers in 2020. The internal auditors are responsible for ensuring that, at the level of each unit:\n\n- \u00b7 the identification and control of risks is performed;\n- \u00b7 significant financial, management, and operating information is accurate and reliable;\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations and with the Group's policies, standards, and procedures is ensured;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the instructions of the Head of the Group is ensured;\n- \u00b7 acquisition of resources is carried out at a competitive cost, and their protection is ensured;\n- \u00b7 expenses are properly engaged and monitored;\n- \u00b7 correct integration and control of acquisitions are ensured.\n\nAnnual internal audit and internal control plans are drawn up based on a combination of a risk-based and audit universe coveragebased approach. The risk-based dimension is embedding risk and control concerns identified by Senior Management, taking into account the results of past audits, the results of Key Internal Control self-assessments returned by the units, and other indicators such as the evolution of a set of financial metrics, the Corruption Perception Index, or the Employees Disengagement Index. When necessary, the audit plan is adjusted during the year to include special requests from Senior Management. The internal audit process is described in 'Control procedures', section 8.5, page 46.\n\nAfter each internal audit, a report is issued setting out the auditors' findings and recommendations for the units or function audited. The management of audited entities or audited domains is requested to define for each recommendation an action plan aiming at implementing corrective actions. Measures are taken to monitor implementation of recommendations and specific follow up audits are conducted if necessary.\n\nAudit reports and the implementation of their recommendations are distributed to Senior Management. An executive summary is sent to the President of the Audit Committee as well as to the top management. A synthesis of the main takeaways and conclusions from a selected number of audit missions is presented to the Audit Committee for each committee session (five times per year).\n\nThese reports are subject to regular exchange with the Group's auditors.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit and Internal Control has direct access to the President of the Audit Committee and meets her on a regular basis throughout the year.\n\n## Internal Control Department\n\nThe Internal Control Department, which reports to the Reporting and Consolidation Department, is particularly responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 defining and updating the list of Key Internal Controls in close cooperation with the Global Functions and other subject matter experts in line with the recommendations of the AMF reference framework;\n- \u00b7 maintaining and leading a network of around 14 local internal controllers who are responsible for supporting local management on internal control topics and acting as process owners for certain key areas such as the chart of authority and segregation of duties; and\n- \u00b7 organising and monitoring the roll-out of self-assessment campaigns and implementation of set action plans following self-assessments.\n\nThe team continues to improve the internal control process and adapt its procedures following the results of self-assessments and changes in the business environment or organization.\n\n## Global Finance Department\n\nThe Global Finance Department is actively involved in organising control and ensuring compliance with procedures.\n\nWithin the department, the Reporting and Consolidation unit plays a key role in the internal control system by:\n\n- \u00b7 drafting and updating instructions designed to ensure that statutory and management accounting practices are consistent throughout the Group and compliant with applicable regulations;\n- \u00b7 organising period-end closing procedures; and\n- \u00b7 analyzing performance and tracking the achievement of targets assigned to the operating units.\n\nThe Reporting and Consolidation unit is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 the proper application of Group accounting principles and policies;\n- \u00b7 the integrity of the consolidation system database;\n- \u00b7 the quality of accounting and financial processes and data;\n- \u00b7 training for finance staff by developing and leading specific seminars on the function; and\n- \u00b7 drafting, updating, and distributing the necessary documents for producing quality information.",

Additionally, this community partners closely with the senior business leaders. This has been done to ensure a simple structure so that technology can be close to business and to maintain consistency across all divisions of Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Human Resources Department is responsible for deploying and ensuring the application of procedures concerning employee development, promoting diversity, and well-being. The department is also responsible for establishing guidelines on rewards and compensation, hiring, on and off boarding, and learning, amongst other Human Resources-related duties.\n\nThe Procurement Department within Supply Chain is responsible for establishing guidelines concerning the procurement organization and procedures, relationships between buyers and vendors, and procedures governing product quality, level of service, and compliance with environmental and safety standards.\n\nGlobal Functions and Division also issue, adapt, and distribute policies, target procedures, and instructions to units and individuals assigned to handle their specific duties. Global Functions have correspondents who work with the Internal Control Department to establish and update the Key Internal Controls deployed across the Group.\n\n## Operating Divisions and business units\n\nThe Operating Division management teams play a critical role in effective internal control.\n\nAll Group units report hierarchically to one of the Operating Divisions, which are led or supervised by an Executive VicePresident, supported by a Finance SVP.\n\nThe Executive Vice-Presidents leading or supervising the Operating Divisions sit on the Executive Committee, which is chaired by the Chairman and CEO of the Group.\n\nWithin each business unit, the management team organizes control of operations, ensures that appropriate strategies are deployed to achieve objectives, and tracks unit performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Global Functions send updates of these reference documents to the appropriate units and individuals through their networks of correspondents.\n\nIn some cases, dedicated emails are sent out or messages are posted on the employee portal or Schneider Electric collaboration tools to inform users about publications or updates.\n\nWhenever possible, the distribution network leverages the managerial/functional organization to distribute standards and guidelines.\n\n## Principles of Responsibility\n\nSee 'Ethics & Compliance program' (chapter 2, section 2.4, page 103).\n\n## Compliance code governing stock market ethics\n\nThe compliance code sets out the rules to be followed by management and employees to prevent insider trading. All employees who have access to sensitive information are bound by a strict duty of confidentiality. It also sets restrictions on purchases and sales of Schneider Electric SE securities by persons who have regular or occasional access to sensitive information in the course of their duties (see 'Organizational and operating procedures of the Board of Directors', chapter 3, section 1.2, page 234). Such persons are prohibited from trading in the Company's securities at any time if they are in possession of price-sensitive information which has not been made public and during specified periods prior to (and until the day of) release of the Group's financial statements and quarterly information on sales.\n\n## International Internal Auditing Standards\n\nThe Internal Audit Department is committed to complying with the international standards published by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and other bodies.\n\n## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), in compliance with European Union regulation no.1606/2002.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS standards as adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Group's accounting principles reflect the underlying assumptions and qualitative characteristics identified in the IFRS accounting framework: accrual accounting, business continuity, true and fair view, rule of substance over form, neutrality, completeness, comparability, relevance, and intelligibility. The Group statutory and management accounting standards manual explains how IFRS principles are applied within the Group, taking into account the specific characteristics of the Group's activities.\n\nThe application of Group accounting principles and methods is mandatory for all Group units, for management reporting and statutory consolidation. The Group statutory and management accounting standards manual and the IFRS principles are available via the employee portal (Finance Repository).\n\n## Approval limits\n\nUnder current management practice, the Group has set approval limits for Senior Management for certain decisions. Local management will define the local approval matrix for relevant decisions within the approval limits set by the Group. Within this framework, business segment executives and functional, operational, and local management are able to approve certain decisions depending on the nature and threshold.\n\nIn addition, all transactions which by their size or nature could affect the Group's fundamental interests, must be authorized in advance by the Board of Directors, i.e. decisions relating to the acquisition or disposal of holdings or assets for amounts greater than EUR250 million, decisions relating to strategic partnerships and major changes of course in the strategy, and decisions relating to the issuance of off-balance sheet commitments that exceed the limits prescribed by the board.",

In 2020, around 100 of the Group's top managers were interviewed in addition to external financial analysts, board members, and a sample of strategic customers. Since 2016, individualized risk matrices by Operation or by Business have been created.\n\nThe risks identified through these interviews are ranked by a risk score (comprising impact and likelihood of occurrence) and level of mitigation.\n\nRisk factors related to the Company's business, as well as procedures for managing and reducing those risks, are described in 'Risk factors', chapter 1, section 9.1, page 49. These procedures are an integral part of the internal control system.\n\nThe risk matrix and the analysis of changes from one year to the next contribute to the development of an internal audit plan for the following year. Around two-thirds of the risk categories identified in the Group's risk matrix are audited by the Internal Audit Department over a period of five to six years to assess action plans for managing and reducing these risks.\n\n## Local risks related to the Company's business at the unit level\n\nLocal risks related to the Company's business are managed first and foremost by the units in liaison with the Operating Divisions, based on Group guidelines (particularly via the Key Internal Controls). Each subsidiary is responsible for implementing procedures that provide an adequate level of internal control.\n\nThe divisions implement cross-functional action plans for risk factors related to the Company's business identified as being recurrent in the units or as having a material impact at the Group level, as appropriate. The internal control system is adjusted to account for these risks.\n\n## Risks related to Solutions Business\n\nThe Solutions Risk Management Department defines and implements principles and tools designed to manage the contractual (such as limitation of liabilities), technical (such as technical discrepancy versus customer specifications), and financial risks (such as factors that may impact margin at solution execution phase).\n\nThe network of Solution Risk Managers assesses the risks and mitigations related to major projects in conjunction with the Subject Matter Experts and Tender Managers during the preparation of offers. Solution Risk Managers then provides a comprehensive, 360 degree view on project risk and mitigations to support the opportunity approval process.\n\n## Risk management by the Legal Department\n\nThe Legal Department oversee the legal affairs and manage the risks relating to legal.\n\nThe Financial Risk Insurance team contributes to the internal control system by defining and deploying a Group-wide insurance strategy, as defined in 'Insurance strategy', chapter 1, section 9.2, page 69. The insurance strategy includes the identification and quantification of the main insurable risks, the determination of levels of retention, and the cost benefit analysis of the transfer options. The Risk and Insurance Department also defines, proposes, and implements action plans to prevent these risks and protect assets.",

Some of these leaders report directly to the Global Security Department and some to local management with functional reporting to Global Security. In close cooperation with the Compliance Department and the Risk and Insurance Department, Global Security is involved in assessing the nature of risk to our people, as well as defining adequate prevention and protection measures.\n\nGlobal Security provides support to local teams for any security issues (site audit, expatriates or local employee security, security on assignments, etc.). The team also:\n\n- \u00b7 publishes internally, a table of 'Country Risks' for use in security procedures that are mandatory for people traveling, expatriates, and local employees;\n- \u00b7 provides daily coordination with the Group's worldwide partner in the field of medical and security assistance (International SOS & Controls Risks - start of contract in January 2011);\n- \u00b7 organize, as needed, psychological support in some crisis context (Eutelmed - start of contract in April 2015).\n\nIt brings its methodology to develop emergency plans (evacuation plans, crisis management plans, etc.) and coordinates the corporate crisis team (SEECC - Schneider Electric Emergency Coordination Center, created in 2009) each time that it is activated. Global Security also participates in crisis management, in managing the corporate crisis cell, and in supporting local entities (to limit the consequences of the occurrence of certain risks such as civil war, weather events, pandemics, attacks on people, terrorism, etc.). In addition, it regularly organizes Security Audits (R&D centers, head offices, sensitive plants, etc.).\n\nGlobal Security sits on the Group Operations Compliance Committee (previously named Fraud Committee) alongside Compliance, Internal Audit, and the Legal Department. Security supports internal investigators as well as contributing to the Group's methodology and procedures to conduct investigations properly; in accordance with the law.\n\n## Management of cyber and product security and associated risks across Schneider Electric\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Product Security Functions inside the Governance organization define the Company's cyber and product security strategies and approaches. The departments are accountable for protecting Schneider Electric's business operations; securing the digital assets and offers for Schneider Electric and subsidiaries; managing the Cyber Risk Register; driving cybersecurity awareness across the Company; owning the creation, maintenance, and enforcement mechanisms of cyber and product security policies; ensuring the execution of cyber and product security initiatives across Schneider Digital functions and entities; and managing the Cybersecurity Incident Prevention, Detection and Response process.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operational units undertook self-assessment of compliance with the Key Internal Controls governing their scope of operations.\n\nThe self-assessments conducted during the 2020 campaign covered more than 90% of consolidated sales and made it possible to define improvement plans in operating units, when necessary. The ultimate goal is that these evaluations should cover at least 90% of consolidated sales each year.\n\nThe self-assessments are conducted in the units by each process owner and reviewed by the respective function. Practices corresponding to the Key Internal Controls are described and the entity is either compliant or not compliant with a particular control.\n\nIf a particular unit is non-compliant with any of the controls, an action plan is defined and implemented to achieve compliance. These action plans are listed in the self-assessment report.\n\nThe unit's financial manager and entity manager certifies the overall results of the self-assessments.\n\nThe regional internal controllers carry out controls on site to assess the reliability of self-assessments and conduct diagnostic missions as requested by management.\n\n## Global Functions\n\nIn 2020, the Global Functions continued to set guidelines, issue instructions, and provide support.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \u00b7 the Global Security Department activated and led the Schneider Electric Emergency Coordination Center in response to COVID-19;\n- \u00b7 the Global Security Department has worked in close collaboration with Global Compliance on organizational resilience topics to include better alignment of Crisis Management with Business Continuity Management;\n- \u00b7 Global Security transferred the Travel Policy and general program management to Global Effectiveness to enable Global Security focus on improving Travel Security;\n- \u00b7 the Solutions Risks Management team prepared the Solution Business Policies (approve and in force) to clarify the rules to be applied when contracting for a solution project;\n- \u00b7 the Cybersecurity and Product Security Functions performed a full refresh of security policies, executed several cyber drills, completed cyber risk register assessments with an external partner, and executed cybersecurity initiatives from strategic investments such as supply chain security, insider trust, recovery, resilience capabilities, product vulnerability assessments and many others; and\n- \u00b7 the Treasury Department continued the deployment of the Treasury management system across the Group. During the crisis, Treasury organized a close follow-up of cash generations and cash forecast throughout the Group which was largely simplified by the use of common tools for Treasury and credit throughout the Group. The achievement in first half of 2020 and the large liquidity available for the Group eased additional follow-up at year end.",

A certain number of audit missions had to be cancelled or postponed and some were replaced by assignments aiming to support the Group's crisis response efforts such as a systematic review of the Group's Business Continuity Plans, an assessment of the compliance with the instructions set out in the directives related to the post lockdown 'return to office/plant' process, or a review of the customers' credit risk mitigation measures implemented across the sales organizations.\n\nThe most common findings and observations derived from these audits relate to the following topics: awareness of the Principles of Responsibilities and of the Responsibility & Ethics Dynamic program, segregation of duties and access rights to IT systems, management of price conditions, alignment with the Chart of Approval, solutions and projects bid management and margin control at the execution phase, security of payments, and business continuity related aspects.\n\nThe Regional Internal Controls team completed more than 103 on-site inspection missions in 2020 to assess the level of internal control and issued the necessary recommendations when needed.\n\n## Group Operational Compliance Committee\n\nThe Group Operational Compliance Committee defines the process to detect and manages non-compliance of ethical cases with appropriate investigation process. The governance on Ethics & Compliance is reflected in 'Ethics & Compliance program', chapter 2, section 2.4, page 103.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 9. Risk factors\n\n## Preamble - COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has significantly affected all regions in the World, with various impacts among countries. Therefore, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly different from one zone to another one. As a result of regularly evolving measures taken by governments and local authorities to contain the pandemic, impacting local and global economies, the business risks associated with COVID-19 are extremely difficult to predict.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has emphasized the impact and probability of occurrence of certain existing risks such as i) People Safety, ii) Supply Chain flexibility, iii) Talent attractiveness, workforce engagement, sales force upskilling, and recruitment of digital competencies, iv) IT systems management, and v) Counterparty risks. For that reason, Schneider Electric has decided to address the COVID-19 pandemic risk within already existing or emerging risks.\n\nA specific COVID-19 taskforce and crisis teams have been set-up throughout the organization to monitor and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Overarching principles have been set by senior management, while empowering businesses and countries to take the appropriate decisions and actions in their own environment context. Particularly, Schneider Electric is absolutely committed to provide a safe workplace for all its employees as well as for its customers and partners when interacting with them. Particular efforts have been made to formalize Business Continuity Plans and to share them with Customers as needed.\n\n## 1. Risks related to the environment in which the Group operates\n\n## 1.1 World deglobalization and fragmentation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\nStable trade is beneficial for economic growth. Trends of increased mercantilism is lending towards regionalization of trade around the United States, China, Russia, Europe, and Indian poles. Regionalized, rather than globally balanced government regulations and policies on, but not limited to, digitization, circularity, carbon, supply chain management, and others could handicap offer development efficiency through redundant efforts. These offer development duplication efforts can potentially impact Schneider Electric's profitability. In addition to the trade regionalization trend, technology decoupling, specifically between the US and Chinese poles, have been observed through increased regulations.\n\nFurthermore, this acceleration of regional versus global trade and technology policies is increasing the pressure on the supply chains of global companies in the forms of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. As such, trade wars could disrupt Schneider Electric's operations and global supply chain. The above- mentioned combination of both nationally orientated tariff and non-tariff burden could increase the cost to market and potentially adversely impact the Group profitability.\n\n## 2020 Specific events - COVID-19\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated this regionalization trend. The multiple waves of the pandemic have impacted, and are still successively impacting, the different global regions; disrupting supply chains and therefore requiring strong resilience.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk on supply chain efficiencies and tariffs impacts, Schneider Electric has implemented a multi-hub organization. The Group has R&D and supply chain activities, suppliers, and commercial networks in the main international hubs, which are North America, EMEA, and Asia. In this multi-local context, Schneider Electric can rebalance its activities across geographies.\n\nThis setup has proved pertinent as the Group has demonstrated a solid resilience in 2020.\n\nSchneider Electric uses prospective scenarios planning, focusing on geopolitics and trade. While the pace of external changes continues at a historically unprecedent scale regionally, global teams are working across stakeholders from business units, R&D, Regional Operations, and Transversal functions (i.e. Finance, Supply Chain, Legal, Marketing).\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks related to the environment in which the Group operates\n\n## 1.2 Export Controls\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\nInternational, Foreign, and National Export Control Laws and Regulations govern the transfer of goods, services, and technologies within a country or between countries and/or their nationals. Elements that may trigger restrictions and licensing requirements may include, but are not limited to, countries, parties, product, and end-uses.\n\nSchneider Electric being a Multi-National Corporation (MNC) with international operations spanning across more than 100 different countries worldwide, must constantly ensure full compliance to such laws and regulations by implementing a robust corporate export control compliance program. As any implications may result in a significant impact on the Group's businesses, results, reputation, and financial position.\n\nAlbeit that Schneider Electric's product portfolio only has a limited product range that may have dual-use goods features as well as nondual use goods (e.g. breakers) that may be used in sensitive applications; restriction or licensing requirements may apply to these products, especially if associated with political sensitive countries and destinations.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nSchneider Electric has comprehensive policies and processes to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations ('Schneider Electric Export Control Program') and to mitigate the above described risks. The Global Export Control Center of Excellence, as part of the Schneider Electric Global Legal and Risk Management Function, oversees the monitoring and enforcement of the Schneider Electric Export Control Program.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control Program may include, but are not limited to, embargo and restricted country, denied party, dual-use goods and sensitive end-use screenings; incorporation of Export Control provision in the main sales and procurement contractual template; and conducting of regular awareness and online and classroom training sessions for all relevant Schneider Electric employees.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control Program will continue its enhancement and updates to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.4 Corruption linked to B2B and project business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe exposure of the Group to corruption risk has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in new economies, especially in Asia and Africa, through organic growth and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe business model of the Group relies on a large ecosystem of partners, including more than 50,000 suppliers throughout the world representing a procurement volume in excess of EUR12 billion, and also, resellers and distributors. This ecosystem may represent a risk for the Group; being accountable for activities performed on its behalf, and in regards to potential conflicts of interest or unethical solicitations.\n\nIn addition, the Group is participating in complex projects involving a large range of partners in sectors at risk, such as oil and gas, and with end-users from the public sector in countries at risk.\n\nOver the past three years, the increase of law enforcement by public authorities, higher press coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the potential impact of corruption risks.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Schneider Electric has built a dedicated Group Compliance Team, composed of corporate compliance counsels and regional compliance officers. Since August 2020, a new Ethics & Compliance Department has been creating overseeing - among others the Fraud Examination Team.\n\nA global whistleblowing system available for employees and for external stakeholders is also managed to combat this risk. In 2020, 549 employee and 76 external stakeholder alerts have been received and managed through follow up inquiries.\n\nIn addition, the Group Ethical Charter, Principles of Responsibility, was updated in April 2019 with reinforcing guidance regarding anticorruption commitments. In August 2019, the Business Agents Policy was updated and deployed, and in November 2019, the same process was applied to the Anticorruption Code of Conduct with the new version released at this date.\n\nFurthermore, action plans related to global and regional corruption risk mapping were deployed in 2020, and internal controls and Internal Audit missions were reinforced on compliance risks with several audits performed.\n\n94% of employees exposed to corruption risks have been trained thanks to Anticorruption e-learning. The content of this e-learning is updated each year.\n\nA system built-in segregation of duties control is in place in the Group's main ERPs.\n\nAll compliance-related aspects are part of due diligence done by the Group for mergers and acquisitions and a specific M&A Compliance framework was put in place in February 2020. For detailed 2020 actions, please refer to chapter 2, section 2.4, page 105.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks related to the environment in which the Group operates\n\n## 1.5 Strengthening of chemical and resource-related regulations in the Electrical and Electronic Equipment space\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric's plants and products are subject to strict environmental laws and regulations.\n\nMany countries have increased legal requirements for the use of chemicals and resources, both in manufacturing processes and in the bill of materials of products.\n\nKey Product Environmental regulations were strengthened in 2019, especially those specific to Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE): RoHS (restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) and WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment). RoHS bans ten chemical substances used in many product categories sold by Schneider Electric: this may require substitutions and may represent a considerable risk of non-compliance. WEEE concerns the Group Extended Producer Responsibility and obliges an active role in the framework of products end life, particularly in terms of financing the collection channels.\n\nIn addition, as described in Note 21 (see 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', chapter 4, section 5, page 338), provisions of EUR259 million are set aside to cover environmental risks. These provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs (not potential penalties). The estimation of the expected future outflows is based on reports from independent experts.\n\nFrench 'Duty of Care' and country-specific initiatives (e.g. China) have reaffirmed the expectations towards engaging suppliers in environmental de-risking efforts.\n\nIn relation with Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Schneider Electric needs to critically assess environmental risks of all acquired companies' product portfolios to ensure strict environmental compliance of all their products, in every market where they are traded.\n\nLocal regulations could force a percentage of recycled content in some product categories, where neither the relevant recycled resources may be available, nor the product certified or accepted - with recycled content - by IEC, NEMA, or any other electrical standards.\n\nRegulations could phase out specific chemical substances or resources too quickly, with no suitable alternative being found in a scalable manner.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group's Integrated Management System (IMS), which covers safety, energy, quality, and environment, continues to be deployed across all industrial sites and major commercial offices.\n\nOffer Creation Process (OCP) is strict, and each step and deliverable embed ecoDesign ambitions and principles: selection of resources, identification of critical substances, life cycle assessment, and then production of REACh and RoHS report.\n\nThe Group's community of ecoDesign business partners train the R&D teams in all new and upcoming environmental regulations and assist them with precise guidance.\n\nEnvironmental and Safety compliance audits, conducted by third-party consultants or internal specialists, take place periodically across countries.\n\nSchneider Electric has been part of taskforces on the Circular Economy, playing leadership roles in multi-stakeholder dialogues in Europe, China, and the US, to discuss opportunities and hurdles: regulations, environmental impacts, protection of customers' interests, and job creation. Schneider Electric is active in France's Circular Economy Roadmap and engaged in China with MIIT on circular economy. The Group leads GIMELEC and FIEEC, and engages in discussions on circular economy relating to its sector with IGNES, ORGALIME and other various circles.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of the Duty of Vigilance program in the supply chain, Schneider Electric has performed a risk analysis through its network of suppliers and identified potential risks in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Ethical Business Conduct\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity\n\nThe occurrence of these risks with third party may result in the following impacts on Schneider Electric:\n\n## Reputation\n\nSchneider Electric's image may be negatively impacted by third party who:\n\n- \u00b7 Do not respect human rights or safety rules for their workers.\n- \u00b7 Are responsible for pollution and damage to the environment.\n- \u00b7 Are conducting business in a non-compliant or illegal manner.\n\nDisruption of supply chain may occur due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term termination of relations with a supplier.\n- \u00b7 Events resulting from a lack of safety or insufficient protective measures (e.g. fire prevention) that may affect the supply of components.\n- \u00b7 Damage to data exchanged with suppliers or digital systems (e.g. virus, malware).\n\n## Legal\n\nOver the past two years, laws regarding human rights protection, such as modern slavery matters in Australia, or the European Union's new framework on restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses, have increased. Higher coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the impact of human rights violations risks.\n\nSchneider Electric expects that the exposure will continue to grow, in reference with the current drafting of a Duty of Vigilance regulation at European level, as well as the European Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024, which sets out ambitions and priorities for the next five years in this field. In addition, the current discussions on human rights due diligence framework at United Nations level, supported by the Global Compact that Schneider Electric is part of, will certainly increase the pressure on the private sector to tackle human rights challenges in the supply chain.\n\n## 2020 Specific events\n\nIn France, in 2019, disputes began between NGOs and French companies (excluding Schneider Electric) concerning non-compliance with the duty of vigilance. A French judge made a ruling on December 10, 2020, recognizing the sole competence of the commercial court in the case of potential violation of the Duty of Vigilance law by companies, downgrading the risk exposure to a civil one. Nevertheless, NGOs will certainly lodge an appeal with the French Cour de Cassation, so the legal analysis is not yet closed.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

More specifically, human rights are managed by the Sustainability Department with the support of the Ethics & Compliance Committee in regards to risk identification through risk assessment as well risk detection, with the whistleblowing system available for employees and for external stakeholders.\n\nRegarding training, e-learning on Principles of Responsibility is mandatory for all employees and, in 2020, focused on human rights amongst other ethics & compliance topics. 93% of employees completed it by end of 2020.\n\nSuppliers are selected according to the 'Schneider Electric Supplier Quality Management' system, which includes sustainable development criteria weighing 30% of the total evaluation of a supplier.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric organized the Global Suppliers Day. During this day, the Principles of Responsibility were introduced to suppliers.\n\nAs part of the Group's 3-year sustainability plan for 2018-2020, strategic suppliers are requested to submit (themselves) to an ISO26000 evaluation. Consistent with a continuous improvement effort, these suppliers have achieved on average a +6.3 points increase between 2018 and 2020.\n\nSchneider Electric has built a supplier vigilance plan in which risky suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, the technologies, and the processes used. A three-year audit plan is then built to perform at least 350 on-site supplier audits. When non-conformances are identified, corrective actions are deployed. The suppliers are then re-audited to verify that the actions have remediated the non-conformances. As of end 2020, 94% of non-conformances from 2019 have been closed. The supplier vigilance plan also includes an internal training program for Schneider Electric Procurement teams and workshops with suppliers.\n\nSeveral actions will be launched in 2021 as part of the new SSI and SSE program, especially in regards to decent wages within the Company and our supply chain, as well as 'social excellence' programs for our suppliers.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, result in new development expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources.\n\nSchneider Electric's products are also subject to multiple quality and safety controls and regulations and are governed by both national and supranational standards. New or more stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment or costs of specific measures for compliance.\n\nThe above-mentioned costs could have a significant impact on the profitability and cash equivalent of the Group. The business reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls recently, more or less ranging from EUR10 million to EUR40 million, depending on the case.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched a specific program called Phoenix to continue to strengthen manufacturing tools and processes.

Any incident or interruption of production (i.e. natural disasters, social unrest, pandemics) at a plant could lead to shortages, compensation costs, or top line losses. Schneider Electric has identified all critical supplies that can affect its operations and delivery to its customers.\n\nThe Group large network of suppliers also create a resiliency risk as they can also be exposed to business continuity risk and impact Schneider Electric operations.\n\nFinally, the increase of circular economy regulation could increase the pressure on product traceability. Failure to comply with those regulations could result in fines, potentially impacting the Group's profitability and reputation.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group requires each of its sites to have a robust business continuity plan for any large-scale events which can severely impact the business, such as natural disasters, social unrest, and pandemics. Each of Schneider Electric's sites has an assigned business continuity leader whose role is to manage this process if something occurs and initiate a crisis management command center at a local level and, if necessary, at a global level at headquarters, led by the Global Security Officer. This process has a proven track record of success and continues to protect the Group's people and assets.\n\nIn addition, the Group launched a EUR150M resiliency plan over the next 3 years to specifically reduce time to recover if a business continuity incident shall occur in one of its supply chain critical site. It aims for those critical sites to have at least a backup production site located in a different region of the world. Redundancy is also created on critical supplies through multisourcing to improve the Supply Chain resilience.\n\nSchneider Electric is also investing in specific modelization tools to optimize its strategic inventories volume & location in order to reduce time to survive to a business continuity event.\n\nFinally, the Group's supply chain strategy team assesses the supply chain flexibility and resilience on an ongoing basis to ensure the right level of flexibility and capacity from one site to another, if there is a need due to interruption. This is well understood by the supply chain leadership. The Group has a network of more than 190 factories and 90 distribution centers globally and has built a network of 7 control towers (in each region) that monitors major events possibly impacting Schneider Electric Supply chain. Each control tower is equipped with digital capabilities to launch adequate alerts & adapt in real time the Group Supply Chain flows and provide its customers peace of mind that the Group is resilient and able to deliver a world class service.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To consult on digitization and to support agile ways of working, the Group must prioritize digital-centric positions. For Schneider Electric, the top areas of focus include: software product owners, software developers, scrum masters, agile coaches, data scientists, data engineers, UX/UI designers, integration architects, cybersecurity specialists, and security engineers. Currently, at Group level, there are approximately 8,000 digital technologists with the largest concentration of employees in India, the US, France, and China.\n\nCompetition for highly qualified management and technical personnel, particularly business technologists, is intense in the Group's industry and becomes a bigger challenge as the Group continues its trajectory of growth. In 2020, approximately 15% of global professional hires were in digital-centric roles - in line with the digital hiring composition from the prior year.\n\nFuture continued success depends in part on the Group's ability to attract, hire, onboard, develop, and retain the best qualified personnel. In addition to critical skills, workforce diversity - especially gender, generation, and nationality/race - is a priority. For example, in 2020, 45% of white collars hired globally were early-career/fresh graduates to ensure a continued supply of early-career talents. Also, at Group and country levels, more programmatic efforts are in progress to support 'senior talents' in regards to future skills development, knowledge transfer, and career assignments to leverage their expertise and experience.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group's people strategy is strongly anchored in its new people vision, which includes the Employee Value Proposition and employer branding, as well as the business and sustainability priorities of the Company.\n\nSchneider Electric's entire people strategy defines the transformation it wants to accomplish regarding business, workforce, and talent impact, including increasing diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, family leave, and flexible 'new ways of working' policies. The people strategy in 2020 puts additional focus on creating more organizational agility through flexible working, structural efficiencies, and project and agile methods of work, as well as accelerating the diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda.\n\nFor employees, underpinned by a strong focus on career and skills development, regular career development conversations are supported and anchored by annual performance appraisals and development and career reviews. Training opportunities are defined by specific roles and include technical, behavioral, and digital learning offers. Global required trainings include: ethics and compliance, cybersecurity, anti-harassment, and digital acumen. In 2019, Schneider Electric launched an Open Talent Market platform to facilitate internal job and project assignments and a new digital employee listening tool to analyze employee engagement. The Open Talent Market platform was expanded to all countries in Q2 2020 and to date, 46% of employees have engaged in the Open Talent Market platform.

While it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact of any such problems, data loss, or delays, they could have an adverse effect on inventory levels, service quality, and, consequently, on the Group's financial results.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group regularly examines alternative solutions to protect against those risks, performs regular compliance checks on service provider service level agreements, and has developed contingency plans and incident response capabilities to mitigate the effects of any information system failure.\n\nThe Group undergoes constant evolution and planning pertaining to its information systems, which encompasses but is not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 ERP transformation and the evolution of the Group's financial systems to prepare for digital offers;\n- \u00b7 Elimination of legacy IT applications and associated hardware to simplify the landscape and mitigate risks linked to obsolescence;\n- \u00b7 Ensure the sustainability of the IT landscape with ongoing focus on business continuity and disaster recovery planning for hardware and software.\n\nAll new applications are subject to certification testing, attempting to remove system vulnerabilities. These systems are housed either in Data Centers (either managed by the Group internally or by service providers) or are cloud-based applications.\n\nIn 2020, the Group continued to reduce legacy IT applications through a dedicated 'Technical Debt Reduction' program.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Payment delays were sorted out during the following months to reach normal levels by the end of the year.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nFinancial transactions are entered into with carefully selected counterparties and adapted terms and conditions are included in contracts with customers.\n\nBanking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency. Group policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules.\n\nIn addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees (letters of credit and bank guarantees) to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the amount of the provision for receivables impairment is EUR 510 million (as described in Note 16 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', chapter 4, section 5, page 330).\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial risks\n\n## 4.2 Currency exchange risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group's international operations and the particularly wide international presence expose it to the risk of fluctuation of exchange rates.\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the reporting currencies of the Group entities and the currencies of transactions can have an impact on the Group's results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. The same applies to the fluctuations between euro and the reporting currencies, in a more significant proportion.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risks is related to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and currencies linked to the US dollar.\n\nIn 2020, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to EUR 20.1 billion, including around EUR 6.6 billion in US dollars and EUR 3.7 billion in Chinese yuan.\n\nThe Group estimates that in the current structure of its operations, a 10% appreciation of the euro compared to the US dollar would have a translation effect of around minus EUR 78 million on adjusted EBITA.\n\nThe result of exchange gains and losses of 2020 amounts to EUR -36 million (as described in Note 7 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', chapter 4, section 5, page 323).\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to transactional currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. Receivables and payables of the Group's subsidiaries denominated in currency other than their functional currency are hedged primarily by means of rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency (natural hedge).\n\nMore than 20 currencies are involved, with the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, British pound, the Hungarian forint, and Russian rubles representing the most significant sources of those risks.\n\nDepending on market conditions, risks in the main currencies may be hedged based on cash-flow forecasting using contracts that expire in 12 months or less.\n\nThe financial instruments used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described in Note 23 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', chapter 4, section 5, page 341.\n\n## Key to symbols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 9.2 Insurance strategy\n\n## Why we think this is important\n\nSchneider Electric's approach to managing risks is designed to defend the interests of employees and customers and to protect the Company's assets, the environment, and its shareholders' investment.\n\n## How we are mitigating the risks:\n\n- \u00b7 We identify and analyze the impact of our main insurable risks.\n- \u00b7 In order to minimize the risks of damage and protect our production capacity, we define protection standards (including for the sites managed by third parties), organize audits of our main sites by an independent loss prevention company, and roll-out of a self-assessment questionnaire for the other Group sites.\n- \u00b7 We draw up business continuity plans, in particular for the Group's main sites and critical suppliers.\n- \u00b7 We implement crisis management tools in conjunction with the Group's Global Security Department.\n- \u00b7 We carry out hazard and vulnerability studies and safety management for our people and our equipment.\n- \u00b7 We negotiate global insurance programs at the Group level for all subsidiaries with insurance companies meeting appropriate minimum credit ratings.\n- \u00b7 We implement these global programs in countries where the Group operates in compliance with local regulations through a network of international brokers.\n- \u00b7 We optimize financing for high-frequency/low-severity risks through retentions managed either directly (deductibles) or through captive insurance companies.\n\n## Liability insurance\n\nA new insurance program has been put in place on January 1, 2020 for a period of three years. This program, deployed in more than 70 countries, provides coverage and limits in line with the current size of the Group and its evolving risks and commitments.\n\nCertain specific risks, such as aeronautic, nuclear, and environmental, are covered by specific insurance programs.\n\n## Property damage and business interruption insurance\n\nThe insurance program, implemented as of July 1, 2019 for two years, was continued in 2020. This is an 'all risks' policy which covers events that could affect Schneider Electric's property (including fire, explosion, natural disaster, machinery breakdown) as well as business interruption resulting from those risks.\n\n- 2,150 locations in 67 countries are covered under this program. Assets are insured at replacement value.\n\n## Transport insurance\n\nRisks of loss or damage to goods while in transit, including intragroup shipments, are covered by a global insurance program which was renewed in January 1, 2020 and is deployed in 38 countries.\n\n## Erection all risk insurance\n\nThe erection all risk insurance program, providing cover for damage to work and equipment for projects taking place at our clients' premises, was continued in 2020. This program is deployed in 35 countries.\n\n## Other risks\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric has taken out specific cover in response to certain local conditions, regulations or the requirements of certain risks, projects, and businesses.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nTo optimize costs, Schneider Electric self-insures certain highfrequency/low-severity risks through two captive insurance companies:\n\n- \u00b7 a captive company based in Luxembourg provides mainly Property Damage and Transport reinsurance worldwide as well as Liability reinsurance outside the USA and Canada. The total amount retained for these risks is capped at EUR20.2 million per year;\n- \u00b7 for the entities located in the USA and Canada, a captive insurance company based in Vermont (USA) is used to standardize deductibles for general/ products/professional liability, workers' compensation, and automobile liability. These retentions range from USD2 million to USD5 million per claim, depending on the risk. An actuary validates the reserves recorded by the captive company each year.\n\nThe cost of self-insured claims is not material at the Group level.\n\n## Cost of insurance programs\n\nThe cost (including tax) of the Group's main global insurance programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around EUR21 million in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainability at the heart of Schneider Electric's strategy\n\nIn this 21st century, humanity is facing the most daunting challenge in its history: the need to radically transform its economic growth model in less than 30 years or face catastrophic environmental and social repercussions. Continued growth of GHG emissions is causing the world to warm at a rate never recorded before, causing devastating effects: an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme climate events, melting glaciers, and worldwide biodiversity loss. However, solutions exist today to reverse the trend while bringing new business and job opportunities.\n\nResolutely determined to contribute to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Schneider Electric's innovative solutions aim to overcome the energy paradox: balancing the need to reduce the planet's carbon footprint with the inalienable human right to quality energy and access to digital.\n\nThe Group is convinced that on this journey for a better planet, no one should be left behind - neither the 780 million people without electricity for whom Schneider develops inclusive business models and creates solutions for clean, safe, and reliable energy, nor the 50 million energy-poor Europeans the Group supports through its Foundation.\n\nSchneider Electric has made its purpose clear: to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress, and sustainability for all. At Schneider Electric, we call this 'Life Is On'.\n\nFor 15 years, the Group has measured its holistic sustainability performance through a dashboard called Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and has set specific governance bodies to ensure that sustainability is positioned within every part of the Group's strategy from the Board of Directors level (via the Human Resources and CSR Committee) to the Executive Committee level (via the Group Sustainability Committee) and diffuses to operational levels as well. Today, Schneider Electric is a recognized worldwide sustainability leader, notably ranked #1 Most Sustainable Corporation by Corporate Knights in January 2021, and a member of several initiatives and partnerships to advance collectively on the 17 SDGs.\n\n## The Group's sustainability roadmap\n\n## 2020\n\n## 2025\n\nReach the 21 objectives of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) 2018-2020 on its five pillars: climate, circular economy, health & equity, ethics, and development.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the SSI achieved a 9.32/10 score, well above the 9/10 target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress on our Climate Pledge to reach carbon neutrality in the Group's operations (with quality offsets).\n\nReach the eleven global, and one local, objectives of SSI 20212025, as well as the 25 objectives of Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) under our 6 long term commitments (climate, equal, resources, generations, trust and local).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 was a complex and pivotal year: we faced a global pandemic that challenged the Group to keep supporting critical life infrastructures, like hospitals and power systems, while protecting our employees and partners. We responded to the needs of our ecosystem of suppliers during these difficult times and also volunteered to help those most impacted by contributing to the manufacturing of protective equipment and respirators all over the world. The Tomorrow Rising Fund, set by the Schneider Electric Foundation, has benefitted 1.5 million people in 67 countries in response to the emergency and will continue to support the recovery of the education system and build stronger resilience. We also successfully exceeded our 2020 SSI target (9.32 vs 9/10 target), with 13 programs achieving or exceeding their 2018-2020 goal.\n\nWith only 10 years left to reach the SDGs, Schneider Electric has stepped up its commitments to accelerate the transformation by making new 2021-2025 commitments to drive real and meaningful impact over the next five years.",

It encompasses continuous improvement of environmental, social, and ethical dimensions across an organizations entire value chain and stakeholders.\n\nSchneider Electric's short-term roadmap (3-5 years) is built on a consultation process involving external and internal stakeholders, called a materiality assessment, as well as dedicated internal governance mechanisms involving the Strategy & Sustainability team, employees, experts in the Group, the Executive Committee, and the Board of Directors, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.\n\nThe 2018-2020 sustainability strategy is built around five major challenges: climate, circular economy, health and equity, ethics, and development. Bold sustainability programs with concrete impact are deployed under each pillar.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric defined six new objectives for the 2021-2025 period:\n\n- 1. Act for a climate positive world, by continuously investing in and developing innovative solutions that deliver immediate and lasting decarbonization in line with our Carbon pledge.\n- 2.

The Group proposes an integrated offering of technologies and market-leading solutions tailored to customer needs, promoting the transition towards more electric, digital, decarbonized, and decentralized energy.\n\nIn fact, Schneider Electric is uniquely positioned among the 1,000+ companies taking action for climate change because it acts on both sides of the equation:\n\n- \u00b7 The solutions Schneider Electric brings to the market are directly linked to activities to mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change;\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Schneider Electric acts to reduce its end-toend CO 2 footprint, aiming for a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050, with precise steps for 2025, 2030 and 2040.\n\nThis positive contribution is measured as Green Revenues, which represent 72% of the Group's total revenues in 2020. In addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% being either strictly green or neutral.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Become carbon neutral on full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (full scopes 1,2 and 3), 10 years ahead of 1.5\u00b0C climate trajectory.

Sustainability at the heart of Schneider Electric's strategy\n\n## 1.1.3 Two complementary sustainability performance dashboards starting 2021\n\nThe execution of the Group's 2021-2025 sustainability strategy will be tracked through quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), under two complementary tools: Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and the new Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE).\n\nThe SSI is the translation of our 6 long-term commitments into a selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative programs. The programs will be tracked and published quarterly, audited annually, and linked to short term incentive plans for the managers of the Group. A notable addition to the SSI in 2021 is the local aspect, aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to unlock meaningful local impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother tool has been created to maintain a high level of commitment and transparency in the actions taken by the Group: the SSE. This new tool brings balance between the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the need to keep progressing on other long-lasting programs. In this spirit of continuous improvement, and in a holistic vision of sustainability, the SSE will track annual progress with 25 quantitative KPIs, and some additional qualitative programs.\n\nCollectively, the SSI 11 Global Impacts and its Local Impact, as well as the 25 SSE programs, are the Group's short term sustainability roadmap and our contribution to the 17 UN SDGs. More details on our contributions to each SDG are provided in our Sustainability Report, available online.\n\n| Schneider Sustainability Impact 2021-2025   | Schneider Sustainability Impact 2021-2025   | Schneider Sustainability Impact 2021-2025                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Long-term Commitments                       |                                             | 2021-2025 SSI programs                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Act for a climate positive world            | 1.                                          | Grow our green revenues to 80%                                                                                                                                               |\n|                                             | 2. 3.                                       | Deliver 800 million tons of saved and avoided CO 2  emissions to our customers Reduce CO 2  emissions from top 1000 suppliers' operations by 50%                             |\n| Be efficient with resources                 | 4. 5.                                       | Increase green material content in our products to 50%                                                                                                                       |\n|                                             |                                             | 100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses  recycled cardboard                                                                     |\n| Live up to our principles of Trust          | 6. 7.                                       | 100% of our strategic suppliers provide decent work to their employees Measure the level of confidence of our employees to report behaviors against our  principles of Trust |\n| Empower local communities                   | 12.                                         | 100% of Country and Zone Presidents define 3 local commitments that impact their  communities in line with our sustainability transformation                                 |\n|                                             | Create equal opportunities 8. 9.            | Increase gender diversity, from hiring to front-line managers and leadership teams  (50/40/30)  Provide access to green electricity to 50 million people                     |\n| Harness the power                           | 10.                                         | Create opportunities for the next generation - 2X number of opportunities for interns,                                                                                       |\n|                                             | 11.                                         |                                                                                                                                                                              |",

The main departments and managers are:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability, Access to Energy, Environment and the Global Sustainability SVP and Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer;\n- \u00b7 Human Resources and the Chief Human Resources Officer;\n- \u00b7 Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer;\n- \u00b7 Governance, Safety and Ethics and the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General.\n\nThe main identified risks are quantified on probability of occurrence and magnitude of impact by these departments. On this basis, the list is reviewed and validated by relevant SVPs, the Board of Directors' secretariat, and Internal Audit team, and presented to the Human Resources and CSR Committee and to the Group Sustainability Committee at least every 3 years, in coherence with the SSI calendar.\n\nSeven main non-financial risk categories were identified and are presented in detail on pages 78 to 81: environment and circular economy, climate, health and safety at work, human resources, anti-corruption, human rights in the supply chain, and socially responsible investments. Risks presented here are gross risks, i.e. absolute risks before a mitigation plan is implemented. The main net extra financial risks are presented in 'Risk Factors', chapter 1.9, page 49.\n\nRisks arising from the sourcing of critical materials, identified by the industry standard SASB on Electrical and Electronic Equipment, are discussed in chapter 2 pages 117 and 193.\n\n## 1.2.2 Materiality analysis\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric built its third materiality matrix (1) by questioning external stakeholders (e.g. customers, suppliers, international organizations, trade associations, experts, shareholders), and top and senior managers within the Group, including the Executive Committee. Nearly 200 stakeholders have been consulted in total (143 through an internal survey, 54 interviewed in person).\n\nParticipants were first asked what they felt were the key worldwide trends most likely to impact Schneider Electric in the future, before being asked to assess the significance of 31 issues according to a quantitative scoring scale. Then, participants were interviewed for qualitative evaluation and justification of the given scores. Participants were guided to prioritize the most transformative issues.\n\nIssues were scored according to their importance as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 1 - Medium or low importance\n- \u00b7 2 - Important\n- \u00b7 3 - Critical\n- \u00b7 4 - Chosen in top 3 most critical topics\n\nThese surveys and interviews also enabled Schneider Electric to consolidate the relationship with its stakeholders and learn about their expectations. Beforehand, the challenges were defined using a study of the sector's stakes (analysis of the different CSR guidelines, sector benchmarks, etc.) and a comparison with the 2017 materiality analysis. With the help of consulting firm Utopies, the aim is to ensure that Schneider Electric reports on the most important economic, social, and environmental challenges; identifies current and future opportunities and risks for the business; and updates its sustainability agenda with key stakeholders' expectations. In particular, the materiality matrix was one of the sources used to design the 2021-2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider Sustainability Essentials, and to confirm the topics to be addressed in the registration document.\n\n## 1.2.3 Key learnings\n\nOverall, stakeholders point to growing instability - whether environmental, social, political, or economic. This creates uncertainties for businesses, which should work on building resilience.\n\n- \u00b7 Climate is the main trend identified externally and internally. It includes the trend for energy transition and electrification, on which external stakeholders expect Schneider Electric to take the lead.",

Stakeholders also mentioned the growing expectations in providing ethical and sustainable products.\n- \u00b7 Resilience, and the move towards more local supply chains, specifically post-COVID-19 can be a manner to mitigate geopolitical uncertainty and a rise in protectionism.\n- \u00b7 Ethics in digital: the growth of digitalization and the need for stronger ethics represents both an opportunity and a risk for Schneider Electric. This covers topics such as the power of data and the ethical use required, the opportunities and dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as people's wellbeing, or job security in a transitioning world.\n- \u00b7 Resource scarcity and circular economy showed very high expectations internally.\n\nDuring the discussions, some elements where often mentioned:\n\n- 1. The vision of the Group, endorsing the link between sustainability and digital, is complex and not always easy to understand for non-experts. Schneider Electric could be more pedagogic in its advocacy.\n- 2. There are high expectations for Schneider to become a globally recognized leader for a decarbonized world, with its products and solutions, and in terms of thought leadership.\n- 3. All 31 topics are deemed important reinforcing our hollistic vision of sustainability. Issues were prioritized based on three groups:\n- \u00b7 Licence to operate - fundamental 'must have' topics such as product quality and safety, cybersecurity, etc.\n- \u00b7 Standard issues - topics which are on track, and on which Schneider Electric must remain mobilized (e.g. health and security, environmental excellence, corruption).\n- \u00b7 Key transformational topics - those which have the potential to transform markets and differentiate Schneider Electric from others (e.g. climate change engagement, circular economy, human engagement).\n- 4. The SSI is a renowned and transformative program which is a source of pride internally, and recognition externally, but which needs a new lease of life: simplified, with increased internal buy-in and awareness.\n\nThe materiality matrix below displays the results of the analysis, which can be summarized in 4 megatrends:\n\n- \u00b7 Leading climate action in our ecosystem with our partners;\n- \u00b7 Pioneering circular economy and being efficient with resources;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring a fair transition and guaranteeing high ethical, social, and environmental standards along more local value chains;\n- \u00b7 Leverage digital in cybersecure solutions to boost positive impact.\n\nThe 2020 registration document, Schneider Electric's commitments for the climate (see pages 122 to 127), and the 2021-2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact cover all these priority challenges through Group policies, improvement plans, indicators, and short-term or long-term goals.\n\n## 2020 materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 'Becoming a key player for a net zero carbon built environment' scored 3.57 (internal) and 3.46 (external)\n\n77",

That is why Schneider Electric defines specific objectives and measures its results each quarter (since 2005) in a dashboard commonly referred to as a 'barometer'. In 2018, this barometer was renamed Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). The action plans of the SSI are carried out at Group level. Schneider uses this tool to address its sustainability challenges and to improve each of the pillars of its strategy identified through its\n\nmateriality matrix. The SSI uses a scoring scale of 10 and provides an overall measure of the Group's progress on sustainability issues. The tool also enables Schneider Electric to anticipate and effectively manage its sustainability risks and opportunities by mobilizing key stakeholders around specific, measured objectives and reliable results. The barometer's monitoring systems are audited annually by an external auditor (limited assurance).\n\nEach barometer seeks to:\n\n- \u00b7 Mobilize the whole Company aro und sustainability goals (ethics, social, environmental and business);\n- \u00b7 Share the Group's improvement plans with stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Create system value.\n\nOn a daily basis, Schneider Electric proves that economic, environmental, and social interests are convergent.\n\n## Overview of the 5 barometers since 2005, and example achievements\n\n## 2005-2008:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPIs in program\n\n## >120\n\nProducts with an environmental profile\n\n## -20%\n\nNumber of lost days from work accidents per employee per year\n\n## 2009-2011:\n\n## 13\n\nKPIs in program\n\n## 70.4%\n\nof employees worked on ISO 14001 certified sites\n\n## 1,291,768\n\nHouseholds at the Base of the Pyramid got access to energy thanks to Schneider Electric solutions\n\n## 2012-2014:\n\n## 14\n\nKPIs in program\n\n## 16%\n\nCO 2 savings on transportation\n\n## 460\n\nMissions with the 'Schneider Electric Teachers' NGO\n\n## 2015-2017:\n\n## 16\n\nKPIs in program\n\n## 100%\n\nof products in R&D designed with Schneider EcoDesign Way \u2122\n\n## 98.4%\n\nof our entities passed our internal Ethics & Responsibility\n\nassessment\n\n## 2018-2020:\n\n## 21\n\nKPIs in program\n\n## 9.32/10\n\n2020 overall performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9\n\nIndicators with increased objectives in 2019\n\n## 2021-2025:\n\n## 11+1\n\nKPIs in program\n\n6\n\nLong term objectives\n\n## New tool\n\nSchneider Sustainability Essentials with 25 objectives",

Three all-hands workshops took place, and the sustainability team organized individual follow up interviews with each member to define precise and measurable programs.\n\nFor the Group, it is a guarantee of strong mobilization in the field that is consistent with actual priorities; for teams, it is the assurance of having the necessary means and visibility to improve. In each new period, the barometer update takes into account results obtained, progress still expected, the emergence of new topics and new priorities, and the experience gained. Thus, it is a powerful tool to move the Group forward on its major challenges.\n\nFour scenarios may emerge from one SSI to the next:\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans are maintained in the barometer and their targets are renewed or increased;\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans change, new and more innovative or better- adapted indicators that cover the same subject are implemented; old indicators continue to be monitored internally if necessary;\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans are removed from the barometer; this is also the case with indicators that have reached a threshold. They continue to be monitored internally if necessary;\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans to address new challenges are implemented.\n\n## 1.3.2.3 Governance and validation of the barometer\n\nThe Sustainability department presents a draft version of the new barometer to the Board of Directors' Human Resources and CSR Committee, and to the Group Sustainability Committee for validation. This latter committee includes six members of the Executive Committee: Strategy and Sustainability; Global Human Resources; Global Supply Chain; Global Marketing; Governance & Secretary General and Finance. The new barometer is then approved by the CEO.\n\n4\n\nLaunch of the three-year program\n\n5\n\nQuarterly performance reporting\n\n6\n\nAnnual external verification\n\nQuarterly results are supervised by the Group Sustainability Committee, which makes decisions on any corrective actions that may be necessary to reach objectives. This committee meets twice a year. The Human Resources and CSR Committee within the Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the Group's Sustainability Policy, analyzing in particular, the performance of the barometer.\n\nExtra-financial annual results are presented together with financial results by Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO of Schneider Electric, in order to demonstrate the Group's commitment to making sustainability part of the Company's long-term strategy. In addition, since 2014, quarterly results have been presented together with quarterly financial information to institutional investors by the Chief Finance & Legal Affairs Officer.\n\n## 1.3.2.4 A key component of the variable compensation of the Group's employees\n\nSince 2011, the barometer score is included in the variable compensation of global functions and Company leaders. In 2020, the incentives, in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French entities: Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France, and in the long-term incentive plan for the Group's key talents and critical roles. Further details are provided in section 'Compensation and benefits' pages 165 to 167.\n\n## 1.3.2.5 Active communication of sustainability performance\n\nThe results of each SSI are released through the main channels below:\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly conference calls on the Group's financial and extra-financial results to investors and the business press;\n- \u00b7 The Group's website (quarterly press releases, presentation of integrated quarterly results);\n- \u00b7 The Intranet (including a quarterly internal video featuring the CEO and the CFO on the quarter's results - these videos have strong internal visibility);\n- \u00b7 The 'webradios', which inform the internal Sustainability Fellows about performance and achievements for the quarter and provide an update on key sustainability topics;\n- \u00b7 Communications with the Board of Directors via its Human Resources and CSR Committee and the Executive Committee;\n- \u00b7 The Group's annual reports (Universal Registration Document including the statutory auditors' report, Schneider Sustainability Report, integrated report);\n- \u00b7 The quarterly internal rating for managers on monitoring the level of achievement of objectives related to variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 Customers or investors events.",

Sustainability at the heart of Schneider Electric's strategy\n\n## 1.3.3 Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020\n\nThe 2018-2020 Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) includes 21 key performance indicators covering five major challenges (climate, circular economy, health and equity, ethics, and development). Once each performance is converted into a score out of 10, the average of these scores indicates the overall performance of the SSI, with all the indicators having the same weight. Departments directly affected by the improvement plans (Human Resources, Environment, Access to Energy, etc.), each represented by a project leader, implement measures to achieve the objectives of the plans.

Please refer to pages 185 to 189, for the methodological presentation of indicators. The performance of each indicator is presented in detail in corresponding chapters.\n\nIndicator 13 and 20 scores have been adjusted for 2020 to take into account the impact of the pandemic on/uni00A0specific actions such as face to face training not being able to take place. As agreed with external auditors, a 'rule of three' removing one quarter from the calculation has been applied for the annual results for these two indicators only. This means that, in 2020 only, performance for indicator 13 is calculated against a target of 11.25 hours of training (instead of 15 hours) and performance for indicator 20 is calculated against a target of 380,000 (instead of 400,000). Note that without these corrections, the 2020 SSI score would have been 9.29/10. These modifications are important to reflect well the work of our teams in an exceptional context, but they do not significantly alter the SSI performance (0.3% change).",

In particular, the Sustainability department takes into account the comments, ratings, and evaluations from stakeholders on the Group's Sustainability Policy and programs. This feedback is integrated into the drawing up of the registration document, the Group corporate brochure (Schneider Sustainability Report), the integrated report, and new improvement plans throughout the Company program as well as during the design of the SSI every three years.\n\n## 1.4.2 Revenue breakdown\n\nEvery year for the last 15 years, Schneider Electric has published a diagram showing its revenue distribution for its various stakeholders.

aware of the major sustainability issues and be ambassadors of its sustainability commitments. To achieve this goal, an initiative was launched in 2013: the Sustainability Fellows. Relying on the internal social network, the community's objective is to make all employees aware of what sustainability is, what the main challenges linked with this topic are, inside and outside the Company, and to understand the link between Schneider Electric's strategy and climate or societal challenges. The goal is also to allow members of this\n\ncommunity to share their views in order to solve problems, improve the Company's policies and actions, or to learn about the different ways to get involved daily or occasionally. The Sustainability department acts as the community manager: from posts or polls to quarterly webradio live broadcasts. The community grew from a few hundred people in early 2013 to more than 3,700 Sustainability Fellows in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, a new network of local SSI leads will be deployed to track progress of the 3 local commitments set by Schneider Electric Country Presidents.",

        "page_content": "## 1.6 External and internal guidelines for a solid framework\n\n## 1.6.1 External guidelines\n\n## The United Nations Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThe Global Compact was launched in 1999 by UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan. It brings companies and non-governmental organizations together under the aegis of the United Nations. Parties signing the Global Compact commit to 10 fundamental principles in four areas: human rights, labor rights, the environment, and anti-corruption. By signing the Global Compact in December 2002, Schneider Electric made a public commitment to these universal values. In line with the requirements of the Global Compact, Schneider publishes an annual Communication on Progress (COP) and meets the requirements of the Global Compact Advanced Level.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Schneider Electric is committed to contribute to the 17 SDGs through its sustainability programs.\n\n## International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\n\nIn 2010, the ISO published its guidelines on organizations' social responsibility (ISO standard 26000). This standard promotes a compromise involving different players from the public, private, and non-profit sectors from around 100 countries, and a vision of how an organization should view societal responsibility. This standard legitimizes the sustainability actions undertaken by the Group since the early 2000s and provides an educational support and framework for its actions in the field. The Group has worked since 2012 to promote the adoption of the ISO 26000 principles with its suppliers.\n\nSchneider also adopts other ISO guidelines or certifications see ISO 14001 and ISO 50001, page 132; ISO 45001, page 146; ISO 9001, page 131; ISO 27000, page 109; ISO 14025 and 14021, page 143.\n\n## The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nThe GRI was established in 1997 as a mission to develop globally applicable directives to report on economic, environmental, and social performances. Brought about by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) in association with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), the GRI integrates the active participation of companies, NGOs, accounting bodies, business associations, and other stakeholders from across the globe. In 2016, Schneider integrated updates to the GRI Standards. A reference table with its indicators and those proposed by GRI is available on the Schneider Electric website.\n\n## The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n\nThe SASB Foundation was founded in 2011 as a not-forprofit, independent standards-setting organization. Schneider Electric provides information in alignment with SASB reporting guidelines for its sector (Electrical and Electronic Equipment). A correspondence table can be found in pages 192 to 193.\n\n## The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn June 2017, the TCFD, a working group led by Michael Bloomberg under G20 Financial Stability Board's (FSB) mandate, published its recommendations for companies' climate action disclosure. CEOs from more than 100 companies signed a statement of support for the TCFD recommendations and Schneider Electric's CEO was among them. Detailed information can be found in Schneider Electric's CDP Climate Change public disclosure and in this report on pages 194 to 197.\n\n## The Sciences-Based Target initiative (SBTi)\n\nScience-Based Targets (SBTs) specify how much and how quickly companies need to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in order to avoid a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C global temperature increase, compared to pre-industrial levels. Schneider Electric is part of the 1,000+ companies globally that have committed to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with prevailing climate science through the SBTi. The Group's GHG footprint is calculated following the World Resources Institute (WRI) GHG Protocol pages 202 to 203. The Group's target to achieve netzero operational emissions and to reduce scope 3 emissions by 35% by 2030 (vs 2017), was validated 1.5\u00b0C aligned by the SBTi in 2019.\n\n## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n\nThe OECD is an international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives. Schneider Electric is aligned with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Schneider Electric signed the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and established a 'Conflict Minerals Compliance program' based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict affected and high-risk areas.\n\n## International Labor Organization (ILO)\n\nSchneider Electric is a Member of the ILO Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) and adheres to the principles of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Group's Principles of Responsibility were inspired in part by the standards issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO).",

        "page_content": "## 1.6.2 Internal governance model\n\nPolicies create the backbone of an organization's compliance and security program. They ensure employees understand how to implement critical tasks and meet behavior expectations. Regulators have made clear the need for effective policy development and management programs. It is no longer enough to merely document the existence of policies and procedures.\n\nOrganizations must be able to demonstrate that employees know, understand and apply them. In other words, simply developing and publishing policies is no longer sufficient in the eyes of our stakeholders (NGOs, regulators, customers, financial partners, etc.). To that end, Schneider Electric has established a four tier form of documentation pyramidpyramid of norms, under the umbrella of our Ethics Charter called the Principles of Responsibility, organized in policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.\n\nPolicies consist in formal statements produced and supported by the leadership team, that state where the organization stands on important issues. Schneider has around 70 global policies distributed in the five pillars of the Principles of Responsibility: Human rights and people development, Ethical business of conduct, Responsible purchasing, Environment and Digitally trusted and secure. The Schneider Electric Global Policy Management Policy provides the rules to be followed for global policies.\n\nStandards assign quantifiable measures and define acceptable level of quality. They aim to make a policy more meaningful and effective. Procedures establish the proper steps to take to operationalize a policy and/or standard. Finally, guidelines provide additional guidance with a set of recommendations to clarify expectations in relation to a given procedure.\n\n## Principles of Responsibility\n\nSchneider Electric has written guidelines that promote an ethical framework and strategic roadmap in which the activities of the Group are carried out: The Principles of Responsibility, which are supplemented by policies and related directives. They are available publicly on our website in 26 languages. Further details are provided page 100.\n\n## Human rights and people development\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric drafted a specific Human Rights Policy as part of a broader program on duty of vigilance in its value chain and in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (see pages 101 to 102).\n\nThe Group's Human Resources policies cover the following topics: diversity & inclusion, health & well-being, safety, security and travel, employee engagement, family leave, antiharassment, recruiting, international mobility, training, human capital development, talent identification, total remuneration, social benefits and COVID-19. These apply to the Group and are accompanied by global processes.\n\n## Ethical business conduct\n\nIn addition to the Principles of Responsibility, different policies and directives bolster the Group's commitments in terms of business ethics and integrity. The Business Agents Policy specifies the rules to be followed when an external stakeholder is solicited to get a deal and integrates the approval process of business agents. The Internal Fraud Investigation directive indicates the commitment to whistleblower protection. The Gifts & Hospitality Policy was approved by the Group's CEO in December 2015 and was deployed locally. It is supplemented by an anti-corruption Code of Conduct detailing related processes. Other policies cover social media management, competition law, conflict of interest, export control, etc.\n\n## Digitally trusted and secure\n\nWith the speed of the digitalization, Schneider Electric developed many policies to reinforce its cyberposture and respect personal data and privacy as IT asset management and usage, acceptable use of assets, general information security, data classification, global data privacy, user access management policy, email security policy and many others. It is the pillar containing the most policies.\n\n## Act for the environment\n\nSchneider Electric's environmental policy aims to improve industrial processes, reinforce product EcoDesign and incorporate Group customers' concerns about environmental protection by providing them with product and service solutions. It is bolstered by the Energy and Environment policies. These policies apply to the Group and are accompanied by global action plans.\n\n## Responsible purchasing\n\nIn 2016, Schneider Electric renewed the charter for its suppliers, called the Supplier Guide Book. The first chapter of this book sets out the Group's sustainability expectations in five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable purchasing, working conditions, and human rights. These requirements are detailed in a dedicated document called the Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, the Group adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct for suppliers.",

Schneider Electric works for industries that account for the majority of global energy consumption but as energy consumption is not always optimized, it makes it one of the largest sources of CO 2 emissions. As a global specialist in the digital transformation of energy management and industrial automation, Schneider Electric places its expertise and solutions at the service of its customers to ensure that energy is safe, reliable, efficient, connected and sustainable. The Group's differenciation lies in its complementary actions to support its customers in their zero CO 2 journey, while aiming for outstanding environmental, social, and ethical performance. The Group works in more than 100 countries, with adaptable practices, standards, and values. The Company has defined Principles of Responsibility that apply to the entire Group and are based on dedicated organization and processes.

Close on the heels of the recovery from this health and economic crisis will be the ongoing need to urgently decarbonize our buildings, industries, data centers, and homes if we are to succeed in meeting the parameters of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nSchneider Electric research indicates that 93% of large companies are deploying energy and resource efficiency measures to reduce their overall carbon emissions, and 70% of companies surveyed for our 2020 insight report have set and publicly announced energy and/or sustainability goals.\n\nEnergy and emissions management lies at the heart of Schneider Electric's business strategy. Customers - companies, citizens, governments - all want to reduce their costs and environmental impact while constantly improving the reliability, safety, accessibility, and performance of their energy and digital solutions.\n\nTo ensure that energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets are achieved, and to facilitate the increasing share of renewable energy and clean technologies in the energy mix, Schneider Electric provides an innovative and competitive portfolio of products and software solutions to help its customers.\n\n## 2.1.2 Energy & Sustainability Services\n\nAs of this writing, more than 1,000 companies globally have committed to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with prevailing climate science through the Science-Based Targets initiative. Some of these same companies have also made public commitments to energy productivity, renewable energy procurement, or electric vehicle deployment through initiatives such as the RE100, EP100, and EV100. Deregulation of global energy markets drives even further the need for organizations to seek professional support in their decarbonization and energy procurement pursuits. Thousands of Schneider Electric's corporate customers rely on the unbiased and trusted advice and expertise of the Energy & Sustainability Services (ESS) division.\n\nThe increasing complexity of and pressures in energy and resource management calls for data-driven, integrated strategies that support organizations across their product and service portfolio. We call this holistic approach to buying energy smarter, using it more efficiently, and stewarding global resources, Active Energy Management (AEM). AEM enables Schneider Electric clients worldwide to maximize investments, deliver greater returns, and build more robust, resilient operations that can endure in the face of growing global challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPractical examples of AEM include:\n\n- \u00b7 Tracking, managing, and disclosing environmental data to voluntary or regulatory agencies and shareholders;\n- \u00b7 Managing the increasing convergence in energy procurement of conventional and renewable power;\n- \u00b7 Exploring and investing in renewable and clean technologies;\n- \u00b7 Implementing demand response programs based on real-time price or carbon signals;\n- \u00b7 Combining distributed energy resources and efficiency technology to cut costs, reach CO 2 reduction goals, and increase resiliency;\n- \u00b7 Using utility records to validate compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.\n\nSchneider Electric's ESS division helps the world's leading companies set energy and sustainability goals for themselves and their supply chain, develop a strategy and roadmap for action, collect data, and deploy solutions and programs to reduce their footprint and meet their goals.\n\n## ESS offers include:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy and sustainability consulting services, including climate change mitigation, carbon neutrality strategies, and supply chain decarbonization initiatives;\n- \u00b7 Strategic procurement programs including traditional and renewable energy, distributed energy resources, microgrids, global Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and carbon offsets;\n- \u00b7 Enterprise efficiency consulting and performance contracting to measure, manage, and reduce energy and resource consumption;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability consulting services including science-based carbon reduction target goal setting, and ESG reporting and disclosure;\n- \u00b7 Energy and sustainability certification, compliance, and reporting;\n- \u00b7 Enterprise-wide energy and sustainability data collection with integration into the AI-enabled EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor software platform (Schneider Electric's ESS division manages more than 128 million metric tons of carbon equivalent on behalf of its clients annually).\n\nBuying energy smarter. Using energy efficiently. Operating more sustainably. All worthy pursuits on their own, but much more effective when combined through AEM. As climate change and resource scarcity concerns grow, integrated energy and carbon management gives companies a holistic view of their performance and access to the data they need to refine their strategies and drive innovation and action. Moreover, companies that embrace smart grid technologies increase electric reliability and lower the risk of price fluctuations, which make for more profitable companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It has received recognition for its microgrid solutions, sustainability consulting, and EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor software, as well as being honoured as a leading ESCO and Energy-as-a-Service provider.\n\n% turnover increase vs 2017\n\n## +17.6%\n\n## 2.1.3 Partner of choice in energy transition\n\nDistributed Energy Resources (DERs) are reshaping the energy landscape. Consumers are now able to reach new heights in energy cost savings, sustainability, and resilience by investing in DERs behind-the-meter, turning themselves into prosumers.\n\nIntermittent and decentralized, DERs employ innovative power systems designed to optimize and ensure system stability, and to finance asset implementation. This calls for behavioral changes, new and smart technologies, and new business models. Today, DERs can help tackle energy challenges by creating an optimized way to access reliable, green, and resilient energy.\n\nMicrogrids are the emerging energy ecosystem that provides practical answers through a local, interconnected energy system within clearly defined electrical boundaries, which incorporate loads, DERs, energy storage, and control capabilities.\n\nSchneider Electric's microgrid management offerings consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 The EcoStruxure \u2122 Microgrid Advisor, which is a cloud-based solution that leverages powerful analytics to optimize microgrid performance in terms of sustainability, energy costs, and productivity;\n- \u00b7 The EcoStruxure \u2122 Microgrid Operation, which is an on-premise solution that ensures grid stability and energy reliability in several scenarios (islanded, grid-tied, etc.);\n- \u00b7 The Energy Control Center, which is the whole microgrid in one box - minimizing the impact on the rest of the installation.\n\nThe open, scalable EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions can be connected with Schneider Electric or third-party systems, for both new and existing infrastructures. This, combined with innovative business models to help end users navigate the landscape, optimize system design and operation, and achieves the desired energy goals.\n\nSchneider Electric's Access to Energy solutions electrify remote areas, from individual systems in homes and micro-enterprises to larger scale systems in public institutions, schools, healthcare centers, and other community buildings. Schneider Electric recently launched Villaya Emergency, a mobile hybrid microgrid, that provides cost effective clean energy to people without access to energy (see section 5.2, pages 174-175, for more details).\n\n## 2.1.4 Driving grid transformation in energy transition\n\nThe energy landscape is under transition, driven by megatrends like decentralization and decarbonization of energy generation as well as digitization across the grid. Grid operators must innovate to provide customers with reliable power, all the while running operations at maximum efficiency.\n\nSchneider Electric recognizes that the world of the prosumer and that of the electricity company, are tightly interconnected. EcoStruxure \u2122 for Electricity Companies harmonizes and unites both sides of the energy equation. It contains offers that help both supply and demand energy players to harness and capitalize on the new energy landscape.\n\nWith EcoStruxure \u2122 for Power & Grid:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group helps Power & Grid companies to build a sustainable future by providing greener power generation, building smarter grids, and serving affordable low carbon energy to consumers, while improving their profitability;\n- \u00b7 EcoStruxure \u2122 for Power & Grid makes electrical networks and generation assets smarter through digitalization. Schneider Electric's digital solutions help its customers satisfy their own customers' electricity demand without interruption, with greater grid resilience, more reliability, and better cost avoidance, integrating greener and more sustainable energy at an acceptable cost while still reducing their carbon footprint;\n- \u00b7 It integrates DER and renewable/intermittent energy sources into existing grids in a safe and optimal way. It ensures the grid stays stable and manageable as the growth of decentralized renewables continues into the foreseeable future;\n- \u00b7 It optimizes and extends the life of existing grid assets through services. Power & Grid companies are some of the most assetintensive organizations on the planet, and Schneider Electric's services, expertise, and technologies lead to substantial efficiencies and avoided downtime, which means huge cost savings for its customers;\n- \u00b7 It provides microgrid solutions for prosumers. Microgrids and energy-as-a-service are gaining popularity because they solve many different energy problems. These include, ensuring a reliable power supply, reducing energy costs, reducing CO 2 emissions, taking ownership of consumption, giving users the power of choice and control, and optimizing the energy mix according to one's particular goals.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.5 Energy efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency means using less energy for equivalent performance or service. This reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions and saves money while contributing to energy security and creating jobs. In its World Energy Outlook 2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that over 80% of the economic potential of energy efficiency in buildings and more than half in industry, remains untapped. The world has to use energy at least 3% more productively each year in order to stay below the 2 \u00b0C global warming level, and there is a big opportunity to reduce emissions with energy efficiency.\n\nImproved energy efficiency not only pays dividends by trimming consumption and costs, it also brings environmental sustainability benefits, which can deliver as much as 2.5 times the value of reduced energy usage (IEA). The good news is that most companies are working towards increasing energy efficiency.\n\nSchneider Electric has been investing in software companies to digitize the design, build process, and operation of the next generation of energy efficient buildings. These investments include: 1) our partnership with Autodesk to design the next generation of energy efficient buildings, 2) our acquisition of Rib Software to increase efficiency of build process, and 3) our investment in Planon Software to enable sustainable operation of buildings.\n\nSchneider Electric promotes active energy efficiency solutions, which consist of optimizing the entire energy cycle using energy control products, systems, services, and software. Schneider Electric is helping companies and utilities to reduce energy consumption by up to 30%, as well as optimizing their processes.\n\nSchneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture framework enables the Group, its partners and end-user customers to develop scalable digital solutions that:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximize energy efficiency and sustainability through smarter systems and real-time, data-driven decisions;\n- \u00b7 Optimize asset availability and performance through predictive analytics and proactive maintenance;\n- \u00b7 Enable smart, productive, and profitable operations through reduction of waste and downtime;\n- \u00b7 Provide mobile insight and proactive risk-mitigation through simulation, situational awareness, and digitization;\n- \u00b7 Foster open innovation and interoperability through development and partnerships with leading standards organizations and best- in-class technology leaders.\n\nFor Schneider Electric, EcoStruxure \u2122 is tailored to its end-markets, where it has decades of deep domain expertise and applied experience. EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions are deployable both onpremise and in the cloud, with built-in cybersecurity at each of the innovation levels: connected products; edge control; apps, analytics, and services.\n\nFor the residential end-market, Schneider Electric's 'Wiser' system controls, measures, and monitors home energy usage, for increased comfort and a more efficient use of energy in residential homes. Schneider Electric also offers the integration of safe recharging infrastructures for electric vehicles in home electrical systems and enables next generation efficient electric home heating.\n\n## 2.1.6 A measure of Green Revenues and Green Innovation\n\nSchneider's purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all.\n\nIn line with this purpose, Schneider Electric activities and revenues evolve, to bring more efficiency and sustainability for its customers in more than 100 markets. 2020 Green Revenue performance of the Group has increased from 70% in 2019, to 72%, mainly driven by the economic downturn of investments in the Oil & Gas sector (and therefore relatively reducing the Group's revenues in this sector). In 2021, as the economy recovers from the sanitary crisis, the Group expects this effect to lessen. In addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% being either strictly green or neutral, according to the definition (2) outlined below.\n\nSchneider has set the ambition to reach 80% Green Revenues by 2025 as part of its Schneider Sustainability Impact.\n\n- (1)   Green Revenues: Green Revenues are defined as offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to our customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. Schneider Electric's Green Revenues are split into four categories described thereafter. Activities included are:",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 Schneider Electric's Principles of Responsibility\n\nAs a global company, Schneider Electric is convinced that its responsibility goes beyond compliance with local and international regulations and is committed to conducting its business ethically, sustainably and responsibly. Schneider Electric believes that companies can make a positive impact and contribute to making the world a better place for all. The Group supports the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and their translation into tangible business actions. The Principles of Responsibility are the Group's Ethics Charter, which serves as a reference for every person and every team in the Company. Together they aid us in pursuing Schneider's objectives in a way that is meaningful, inclusive and positive. The Principles of Responsibility apply to all employees at Schneider and its subsidiaries, as well as to contractors, self-employed workers, and persons working on the Group's premises. They also serve as a source of inspiration in its relations with customers, partners, suppliers, and external stakeholders in general.\n\nThe Principles of Responsibility were inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and standards issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The new version of the Principles of Responsibility was published in June 2019 on Schneider Electric internal and external website and can be downloaded in 26 different languages.\n\n## 2.2.1 The five pillars of the Principles of Responsibility\n\nToday the Principles of Responsibility are built on the following five pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Human rights and people development: what Schneider Electric stands for in terms of human rights, diversity and inclusion, safety at work, employees development, fighting against forced labor, and zero tolerance for all kinds of harassment;\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct: Schneider Electric business is important, but the way the Group conducts this business is equally important. Schneider conducts business in an ethical, sustainable and responsible manner. With its Principles of Responsibility and its compliance program, codes and policies, Schneider addresses matters such as corruption, conflicts of interest, business agents or fair competition;\n- \u00b7 Digital trust and security: in a world becoming more digital every day, Digital Trust is a fundamental area of focus for Schneider Electric, its employees and network of customers, partners and suppliers. The Principles of Responsibility embrace this important responsibility, covering cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, and Artificial Intelligence (AI);\n- \u00b7 Act for the environment: environment is at the heart of Schneider Electric's activity, through the offers and solutions the Group brings to customers, through the sentiment of Schneider employees and culture, and through its ambition to contribute positively on climate change, environment and biodiversity issues. The Principles of Responsibility address the subjects of climate change and CO 2 emissions, resource saving and circular economy, as well as environmental preservation;\n\n- \u00b7 Responsible corporate citizenship: Schneider Electric is a community of people that interacts with other groups and communities across the planet. Schneider's ambition to make a difference is here expressed though specific programs such as Access to Energy, or the Group support to the development of local communities.\n\nIn 2021, building on this foundation, Schneider Electric will shift towards how the Group earns the trust of its internal and external stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 Adding new topics such as quality and leadership focusing on earning and keeping trust with customers, partners, teams, investors and communities around the world.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening ties to policies to ensure all employees know and understand the framework within which Schneider Electric works.\n\n## 2.2.2 Communication and training for all employees\n\nEthics and responsibility are both a team effort and an individual commitment. Management has been continuously involved in the design of the deployment plan, on communication sessions and learning tools to ensure everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the Principles of Responsibility and has the opportunity to learn and to reflect.\n\nThe new version of the Principles of Responsibility was first introduced by the CEO and the Executive Committee to the community of Top Leaders, and then cascaded by leaders throughout the organization via specific communication events (townhall speeches, conferences, seminars\u2026). A dedicated mandatory learning including interviews from Executive Committee leaders, role plays in real situations, quiz tests, and an acknowledgement of the Principles of Responsibility has been made available to employees. This training is either an e-learning for connected employees, or an in-class version for non-connected employees. At the end of 2020, the training completion rate for all Schneider Electric eligible employees was 93%:\n\n- \u00b7 Connected employees: 97% completion\n- \u00b7 Non-connected employees: 82% completion\n\nThis dedicated mandatory learning on Principles of Responsibility will evolve in 2022 to reflect the new charter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.3 Human rights\n\n## 2.3.1 Risks and opportunities\n\nHuman rights, which are a main priority for a long time, have been growing in terms of risk exposure, due to the increase of legal enforcement, geopolitical influence, and new challenges raised by social, economic and digital disruptions (e.g. forced labor, living wages or migrant workers). Schneider Electric has consistently focused on human rights and has the ambition to remain an exemplary company on this subject.\n\nSchneider Electric's review of risks and opportunities related to human rights covers the following areas:\n\n## 2.3.1.1 Fundamental human rights:\n\n- \u00b7 Respect and dignity: healthy and respectful relations at work between individuals and teams, and towards communities;\n- \u00b7 Child labor: defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO) as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development;\n- \u00b7 Forced labor: defined by the ILO as all works or services for which a person has not offered themselves voluntarily or willingly;\n- \u00b7 Freedom of association: the right for workers to join professional organizations that can defend their interests.\n\n## 2.3.1.2 Decent working conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety: potential incidents of various degrees of severity related to workplace conditions;\n- \u00b7 Security at work: physical or verbal violence that may originate from internal or external threats;\n- \u00b7 Working time and leave: ensuring employees work on a schedule that respects legal time frames, rest periods, and leave provisions, and are given the opportunity to balance personal and professional time;\n- \u00b7 Wages and benefits: paying employees a compensation that is fair in view of their profile, skills, and qualifications;\n- \u00b7 Harassment: continuous solicitation with the intention of exhausting a person or forcing that person into unwanted behaviour;\n- \u00b7 Data privacy: securing the data that individuals are placing into the Company's hands so that their privacy and freedom remain safe and protected.\n\n## 2.3.1.3 Equal opportunities:\n\n- \u00b7 Discrimination: creating a situation of inequality based on an employee's personal characteristic, at work or when hiring;\n- \u00b7 Diversity and inclusion: risk of introducing several biases that would result in an unbalanced representation of the society inside the Company, and the exclusion of some groups or communities from the Company;\n- \u00b7 Development of competencies: giving employees the opportunity to learn, maintain, and develop their skills and abilities.\n\nIn accordance with the 2017 French duty of vigilance law and its ambition to behave as an exemplary company, Schneider Electric implemented a specific vigilance plan. In 2020, Schneider Electric reviewed and updated its 'duty of vigilance risk matrix' which highlights human rights risks at its sites, as well as for suppliers, contractors, and local communities. Several actions are implemented to mitigate the highest identified risks in this matrix. For more details, see section 'Vigilance plan', pages 110-114.\n\n## 2.3.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric's human rights approach is articulated around three principles.\n\nFirst, Schneider Electric is committed to fully respecting and applying laws and regulations in all countries where it operates. Second, Schneider Electric is committed to fostering and promoting human rights throughout all its operational sites and subsidiaries worldwide.\n\nThird, Schneider Electric wishes to support human rights beyond its borders, leveraging its large network of partners and stakeholders to promote the implementation of actions that will ensure the respect of people's rights.\n\nThrough its Principles of Responsibility, Schneider Electric is taking a strong position on what values it stands for. The 'human rights and people development' pillar gives guidance on the following subjects:\n\n- \u00b7 Respect, fairness, and dignity;\n- \u00b7 Diversity, inclusion, and individual development;\n- \u00b7 Safety at work;\n- \u00b7 Health, well-being, and the way we work;\n- \u00b7 Protecting the vulnerable against labor abuses;\n- \u00b7 No tolerance for harassment.\n\nSchneider Electric has formulated a specific global human rights policy that defines its position on human rights. It is applicable to all Schneider Electric permanent or temporary employees working on Group premises. It also aims to inspire external stakeholders. For all human rights risks identified above, and based on the 'Protect, Respect, Remedy' principles, the policy provides a framework and gives guidance to employees and teams on how to behave in their daily operations or when facing a specific situation.\n\n## 2.3.2.1 Schneider Electric's alignment with international standards and frameworks\n\nSchneider Electric adheres to the following principles or guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work;\n- \u00b7 The international human rights principles encompassed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which sets out a common standard for all types of organization;\n- \u00b7 The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which formulate recommendations for companies, including for the respect of human rights;\n- \u00b7 Since 2003, Schneider Electric is part of the United Nations Global Compact. In 2011, the United Nations issued the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which precisely define the roles and responsibilities of States and businesses on these matters. Schneider Electric is committed to these Guiding Principles and to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\n## 2.3.2.2 Specific policies\n\nIn addition to its Principles of Responsibility and the global human rights policy, Schneider Electric has implemented specific global policies to provide guidance in the following areas:\n\n## Human resources\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity & Inclusion Policy: applies to the entire Company and covers all facets of diversity, as Schneider Electric wants to mirror the communities in which the Group operates. This policy is based on respect and dignity, which are the foundations for fairness and equity;\n- \u00b7 Family Leave Policy: provides a framework so that every employee, whatever the country of employment, can take some specific leave to enjoy some of life's special moments with their families. This policy was updated in 2020;\n- \u00b7 Global Anti-Harassment Policy: states Schneider Electric's commitments to have zero-tolerance for any kind of harassment or offensive behavior;\n- \u00b7 Flexibility at Work Policy: defines global Flexibility at Work pathways, mandatory and recommended, to ensure consistency and equitable treatment in the application of flexible work arrangements across business units and countries for all eligible Schneider Electric employees.\n\n## Health and safety\n\n- \u00b7 Health & Safety Policy: states the rules and guidelines applicable to all Schneider Electric employees, and also to specific populations performing specialized tasks. It is supported by learning tools, and it is the subject of an annual 'Global Health & Safety Day';\n- \u00b7 Global Travel Policy: defines the rules applicable to travelers, including the safety guidelines, procedures, and processes to ensure the safety of Schneider business travelers at all times;\n- \u00b7 Global Security Policy: defines the global scope of security applicable to all entities, locations, and activities. This policy also emphasizes the crucial role of managers to ensure security.\n\n## 2.3.3 Due diligence\n\n## 2.3.3.1 Deployment of internal actions\n\nSchneider Electric entities and subsidiaries are monitored through the implementation of Key Internal Controls. These controls are designed in coordination with the Internal Audit team and consist in an annual self-assessment covering different operational topics. Human rights and health and safety controls are included in this annual review. The results of these assessments allow Schneider Electric to benchmark the entities and to prioritize mitigation plans when necessary.\n\nInternal actions regarding respect and dignity, freedom of association, health and safety, working time and leave, wages and benefits, harassment, discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and development of competencies are described in section 'Committed to and on behalf of employees', pages 144-169.\n\nSchneider Electric is implementing training programs that are specific to the policies listed above, to raise the level of awareness of employees and give them advice on how to react or behave in specific situations. Some of these trainings are mandatory, others are part of recommended training paths. Such programs cover a very wide area of topics, from anti-harassment to well-being, or how to overcome bias and develop an inclusive culture. For more details, see section 'Learning and development', pages 153-156.\n\nSpecifically, for health and safety, the Group maintains a followup of safety metrics. Incidents are reviewed with management, corrective actions are implemented when necessary, and communications are sent to relevant teams throughout the Company. When needed, a global safety alert can be launched to draw all relevant employees' attention. Schneider Electric organizes a yearly 'Global Health & Safety Day', to inform all employees and keep the level of awareness high on this key topic. For more details, see section 'Employee health and safety', pages 146-149.\n\n## 2.3.3.2 Deployment of actions towards suppliers\n\nHuman rights are included in the integration of the sustainable purchases approach in the selection of new suppliers. Schneider Electric uses a qualification process called Schneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) to select new suppliers. It is based on an evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site audits, which include human rights and health and safety assessments.\n\nSchneider Electric's Supplier Code of Conduct states the framework in which the Group wishes to operate with vendors. Schneider Electric expects suppliers to respect the fundamental principles on health, safety, people's protection, and development as defined in this document.\n\nOther actions are implemented through the Group's vigilance plan. For more details, see section 'Vigilance plan' and section 'Relations with subcontractors and suppliers', pages 110-117.\n\n## 2.3.4 Partnerships and working groups\n\nThe Group has joined Entreprises pour les droits de l'Homme (EDH - Businesses for Human Rights), a leading French association of businesses providing its members with tools and advice on implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In 2018, Schneider Electric also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a non-profit coalition of more than 120 companies from the electronic, retail, automobile, and leisure industries, for compliance with human rights and sharing the best practices with regards to on-site auditing and monitoring of suppliers' activity, including forced-labor issues.\n\nThe Group also joined the Global Compact LEAD working group 'Decent Work in Global Supply Chain'. Schneider Electric co-leads the G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition's 'Advancing human rights in direct operations and supply chains' and 'Building inclusive workplaces' working groups.\n\nAs a result of the working group on advancing human rights, in 2020, B4IG members adopted a collective statement supporting a European framework on mandatory human rights due diligence and providing suggestions to be considered in legislation.",

        "page_content": "## 2.4 Ethics & Compliance program\n\nThe exposure of the Group to risks of non-compliance and unethical practices has been increasing for several years, due to broader externalities for the Group through its geographic expansion, participation to complex projects and large range of acquisitions, leading to the need to strengthen the effectiveness of its risk-based ethics & compliance program.\n\nOver the past years, the increase of law enforcement by public authorities, new regulations, and higher reputational risk with media exposure have led to the design of a preventive approach of several risks including corruption, fraud, violation of human rights (fundamental ones, health & safety, discrimination, harassment & sexual harassment), anti-competitive practices, sanctions & export control.\n\nAdopting a full compliance approach on that topics brings trust to our employees, customers, partners and suppliers, but also to local communities.\n\n## 2.4.1 Governance of the Ethics & Compliance program\n\nSchneider Electric has built a strong governance to lead the Ethics & Compliance program to the best standards, with responsibilities at board, executive, corporate, and zone levels.\n\nBoard level: Schneider Electric's Board of Directors oversees the Ethics & Compliance Program through a dedicated annual session of the Audit & Risk Committee during which the program, risks and improvements, and action plans, are reviewed by the Directors. In addition, the Audit & Risk Committee agreed on the Audit plan which covers several audits related to the Ethics & Compliance Program or part of its, and its members are notified of their findings and related recommendations once their finalization.\n\nThen, through the Human Resources & CSR Committee, the Board of Directors monitors the performance of the extra financial/ ESG ratings, including performance on its Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nExecutive level: Schneider Electric has put in place a dedicated governance to lead the Ethics & Compliance program to the best standards. The program is overseen by the Group Executive Committee, through the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee. This bi-annual committee is composed of seven permanent members in charge of defining the program's strategy and priorities: the Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General, Committee Chairman; the Chief Human Resources Officer; the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer; the Chief Compliance Officer; the Chief Legal Officer; the Sustainability SVP; and the Group Internal Audit & Control Officer. They ensure that the program is consistent with the Group's strategic goals. This committee sits twice a year.\n\nOperationally: the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee is assisted by the Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) and the Group Disciplinary Committee which ensure effectiveness of the Speak-up culture (a culture in which employees feel free and psychologically safe to share their ideas, opinions and concerns, without fear of retaliation) and whistleblowing system, and fair and transparent disciplinary policy. Once a year, the Board Audit and Risks Committee reviews the Ethics & Compliance program's effectiveness and the allocation of resources to the program (human and financial).\n\n- \u00b7 The GOCC detects and manages cases of non-compliance with the Ethics & Compliance program in accordance with the Group Case Management & Investigation Policy released in February 2020, and reviews monthly the effectiveness of the whistleblowing system. The GOCC is co-led by the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, the Group Internal Audit & Control Officer, the Group Compliance Director, the Group HR Compliance Officer, and the Group Security Officer.\n\n## Governance of the Ethics & Compliance program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEthics & Compliance pillars\n\n- \u00b7 Policies, processes\n- \u00b7 Risk Assessment\n- \u00b7 Due Diligence\n- \u00b7 Training & Awareness\n- \u00b7 Controls & Audit\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing\n\n## Alert Systems\n\nRed Line Green Line Internal Reporting Mechanisms",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Disciplinary Committee is in charge of levying sanctions and remediation actions on serious non-compliance cases confirmed by the GOCC. The Group Disciplinary Committee is co-led by the Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, and one rotating member.\n\nAt a zone level , regional Ethics & Compliance committees ensure implementation of the Group Ethics & Compliance program in alignment with risks identified. Operationally, they rely on Regional Compliance Officers who drive the implementation in the zone, with the support of Ethics Delegates and relevant subject matters experts at local levels.\n\nTo reinforce a cross-functional and integrated approach of the Ethics & Compliance program, in August 2020, Schneider Electric decided to create a standalone Ethics & Compliance Department, chaired by a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer acting on behalf of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, and reporting to the Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General, to drive the strategy on the Ethics & Compliance program. Together with relevant subject matter experts from the Legal, Human Resources, Finance, and Strategy & Sustainability departments, and in close collaboration with Internal Control and Audit functions, the department assesses the effectiveness of the Ethics & Compliance program. This department is composed of four teams (the Group Compliance team, the Health & Safety team, the Fraud Examination team, and the Software Licensing Compliance team) and two other contributors whose roles were created in 2020 (the Policy & Business Continuity Planning Director and the Group HR Compliance Officer).\n\nNumber of concerns received through our whistleblowing system per region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- North America\n- Middle East Africa (MEA)\n- Greater China\n- India\n- South America\n- Europe\n- East Asia Japan Pacific (EAJP)\n- Russia & Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) France\n\n## 2.4.2 Dedicated compliance policies completing the Principles of Responsibility\n\nTo ensure that the tools are provided to follow them, the Principles of Responsibility are complemented by global and local policies, providing specific answers to the different pillars, legal obligations, and local practices. On ethics and compliance matters, Schneider Electric has deployed several policies: Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct (aligned with French Sapin II law requirements), Gifts & Hospitality Policy, Competition Law Policy, Business Agent Policy, Anti-Harassment Policy, Human Rights Policy, and Export Control Policy.\n\nAdherence to policies is ensured through training programs at global level and local levels.\n\n## 2.4.3 A whistleblowing system to cover all stakeholders\n\n## 2.4.3.1 The professional whistleblowing system for employees\n\nAs a pillar of Schneider Electric's Ethics & Compliance program, the development of a strong Speak-up culture is embodied by reporting mechanisms such as reporting to the manager, the HR business partner, the Ethics Delegates, or the Compliance Officer without fear of retaliation. In addition, employees can directly access the whistleblowing system through the Red Line portal, which provides support to people if they are a victim/witness to a potential violation of the Principles of Responsibility. The Red Line is available online globally, at all times, and protects the anonymity of the whistleblower (unless there is legislation to the contrary). Since December 2019, employees can better report their concerns, by selecting a type of concern and checking the definition of it. In compliance with local legislation, this system is provided by an external, impartial third-party company and proposes alert categories, a questionnaire, and an information exchange protocol between the person issuing the alert and the person responsible for the internal investigation.\n\nOutcomes of the received concerns through the red line*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Alert non confirmed\n- Alert confirmed\n- Not considered as an alert\n- *  % calculated not taking into account cases still under investigation and not yet evaluated\n\nDistribution of confirmed alerts by type of issue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Discrimination, harassment, unfair treatment\n\nConflict of interest\n\nBribery\n\nTheft\n\nViolation of policy\n\nHealth & Saftey\n\nOther\n\nLabor practices",

        "page_content": "Each concern reported on the whistleblowing system is analyzed by the GOCC and relevant Regional Compliance Officer, and where considered necessary, investigated. Based on the findings of the investigation, the relevant managers or the Group Disciplinary Committee for the most sensitive alerts, take appropriate measures in order to sanction the party or parties involved and to remediate consequences of the misconduct (such as launch a specific audit, review a process, perform training, etc.). Each year, a detailed report on the effectiveness of the system is presented to the Audit & Risks Committee, which reviews effectiveness of the alert system.\n\nUnless there are legal provisions to the contrary, the system can be used to send any concern in every country in which the Group operates, especially regarding discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, safety, unfair competition, bribery and corruption, conflicts of interest, accounting manipulation, theft, and fraud. 625 concerns were received on the whistleblowing system, either through internal reporting mechanisms or through the Red Line in 2020.\n\nAfter first analysis, 512 concerns were considered as valid alerts. After being investigated, alerts confirmed during the year led to 108 actions including employment termination in 44 confirmed alerts and written warnings in 19 confirmed alerts.\n\nFor HR related concerns, even if investigation does not allow to qualify the situation, actions may be taken, such as assigning obligation of coaching and/or training or improving internal processes.\n\n## 2.4.3.2 The professional alert system for external stakeholders\n\nListening to external stakeholders to ensure full compliance with the Principles of Responsibility is a key priority for Schneider Electric. The Green Line, launched in 2018, is a professional whistleblowing system, available online and featuring a simple and intuitive interface. It is aimed at all Schneider Electric external stakeholders, suppliers, subcontractors, customers, and commercial agents who might be experiencing or may have witnessed any unethical situation involving or affecting Schneider.\n\nThe processing of alerts follows the same procedure as alerts received through the internal whistleblowing system and has the same confidentiality protections.\n\n76 concerns were received through the Green Line in 2020. Such concerns have been investigated in accordance to the same process described above leading to the actions described.\n\n## 2.4.4 Third-party relationship management\n\nThird-party relationship management programs are complex as each of them presents multiple risks and different oversight functions that need to be consulted on individual risk assessments. While business agents can be used for many legitimate purposes, such as to perform tasks that Schneider Electric cannot perform as efficiently, the experience has shown that using them can be very risky in terms of exposure to bribery or corruption. Therefore, a Business Agent Policy is necessary to determine legitimate business purposes only. Business agents cover all third parties retained entirely or in part to assist Schneider Electric, directly or indirectly, in its business operations, including to obtain a sales order, contract award, permits, licenses, or other business advantage for Schneider Electric. They are subject to a due diligence and approval process, which has been centralized with the Business Agent Policy in 2019 and digitized in July 2020. Several documents and information are gathered and sent to the Group Compliance team who will perform the due diligence and manage the approval process by analyzing risks of corruption, sanctions, and unethical practices. At the first level of assessment, the business agent could be approved based on the level of risk, or additional checks could be carried out if necessary. The Group Compliance team can request to validate payments to a business agent based on this assessment.\n\nOur robust network of suppliers is the foundation of our supply chain, and we extend the same level of ethical control to them as we do to ourselves. For more information, please refer to section 2.9 'Relations with subcontractors and suppliers'.\n\n## Six steps to securing long-term value creation in acquisitions\n\nTiming depends on conditions precedents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Compliance remediation is a continuous process that will extend beyond the due by closing date.",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\nM&A operations represent specific risks regarding ethics and compliance, specifically corruption and export control risks. With the support of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, a specific process was put in place in February 2020 to ensure full compliance of M&A operations with anti-corruption and export control regulations: this process was built by the Group Compliance Director, the Global Export Control Director, and M&A team, ensuring a methodology that fit with M&A processes and ways of working, as described in the figure page 105.\n\n## 2.4.5 Regular monitoring and control of the Ethics & Compliance program\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance program is an integral part of the Group's Key Internal Controls. In particular, there are two categories of specific controls that the internal controllers review in subsidiaries when evaluating the degree of maturity and the effectiveness of the program: the Principles of Responsibility and alert system, and the Business Agent Policy. Whenever an evaluation indicates points of weakness, action plans must be set up and monitored by internal auditors.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's Internal Audit program includes specific tasks related to the Ethics & Compliance program, and to activities or subsidiaries for which an evaluation of the maturity and effectiveness of the program will be reviewed. Several internal audits were conducted in 2020 resulting in recommendations related to the improvement of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nThe Audit & Risks Committee reviews the internal audits and related recommendations as part of its annual review of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\n## 2.4.6 External engagement\n\nSchneider Electric knows that corruption cannot be fought alone, so we participate in the initiatives of many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and professional associations, such as Transparency International France, a leading NGO that aims to stop\n\ncorruption and promote transparency, responsibility, and integrity across all sectors. Schneider Electric is also member of Le Cercle d'\u00c9thique des Affaires (The Ethical Business Circle), a professional association that facilitates cooperation between business leaders across France to share best practices. From a corporate governance point of view, Schneider Electric has taken part in MEDEF's 'Haut comit\u00e9 de gouvernement d'entreprise' (HCGE).\n\nTo maintain innovation in our approach to ethics and compliance, Schneider Electric became the eighth sponsor of the Master of Law and Business Ethics at CY Cergy Paris University in 2020 and will benefit from the work of the Master's Chair, led by experts in France and in the United States, as well as from listening to the students and reviewing their work.\n\n## 2.4.7 Training and awareness\n\nLocal awareness sessions on the Principles of Responsibility and our specific policies are conducted by Compliance Teams, Legal Teams and Ethics Delegates: such awareness sessions cover general overview of the Ethics & Compliance Program, or a specific policy, such as Anti-harassment policy, Competition policy, Gifts & Hospitality policy. In 2020, at least 237 sessions were organized at local level face to face or remotely.\n\nBesides training of our employees, since the beginning of 2020, as part of the integration process of companies acquired, a specific training for Leaders of the acquired company is organized on the Ethics & Compliance Program, with specific focus on what is expected from the Leadership teams to endorse the program and follow up actively completion of mandatory trainings to be followed by employees on Principles of Responsibility and anticorruption.\n\nIn November 2020, Schneider Electric organized its first global 'Ethics & Compliance Day' campaign in order to promote the Company's values on business ethics and to bring a focus on the need of a working environment that promotes a Speak-up culture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The challenges are numerous:\n\n- \u00b7 Gain and maintain the highest trust of stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Mitigate the growing pressure from public authorities through solid ethics and compliance programs, especially to fight corruption;\n- \u00b7 Attract and retain talents, especially within new generations, who consider an ethical working environment as a key element of engagement.\n\nEach year, Schneider Electric's Internal Audit Department draws up a risks matrix at Group level which is presented to the Executive Committee and used to identify all risks faced by the Company, especially with regard to ethics and compliance.\n\nFurthermore, to meet the legal obligations specified by the December 9, 2016 French law known as the Sapin II law, the Company launched a risk mapping exercise focusing on corruption risks, which was conducted in 2018 at global level and in 2019 at regional levels. In 2020, action plans were implemented in accordance with risks identified. In 2021, a new Ethics & Compliance Risk Assessment will be launched as part of the new Group's risk management framework.\n\n## 2.5.2 Group policy\n\nAs stated in our Principles of Responsibility and Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct, Schneider Electric is committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, such as the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and the French Sapin II law.\n\nSchneider Electric applies a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption and other unethical business practices and considers that 'doing things right' is a key value-creation driver for all its stakeholders. We count on our employees and third parties to promote business integrity. For doing so, we must provide them with the tools to encourage them to act right.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of the French Sapin II law, the Group released an Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. The Code was reviewed in November 2019 to take into account results of the corruption risk mapping, to incorporate principles of the former Anti-Corruption Policy, and to provide employees with examples illustrating situations they may face. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct shall serve as a handbook that anyone may consult when having doubts about appropriate business practices. It is not intended to address every issue one may encounter, but it provides appropriate examples of corruption risks and offers guidance to resolve many ethical dilemmas.\n\nAnti-corruption awareness is one component of the compliance program. We want to ensure that country leaders, managers, employees, and third parties are aware of our Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition to the compliance with all international and local regulations, all Schneider Electric employees are expected to comply with the Company's values of integrity and transparency.\n\nManagers are expected to walk the talk by complying with rules, spreading the right message in their teams, and support reporting of misconducts.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Compliance program is part of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nThe Gifts & Hospitality Policy provides guidance to employees on the ethical handling of gifts and hospitality received and given by Schneider Electric employees.\n\nA new version of the Business Agent Policy was released in August 2019 to meet legal requirements and public authorities' guidance, especially regarding risk-based approach of the due diligence, as well as internal recommendations following several audits performed on applicability of the policy in 2018.\n\n## 2.5.3 Prevention of the risks related to corruption\n\n## 2.5.3.1 Anti-corruption trainings\n\nAt Schneider Electric, we value training as it is the best way to prevent risks and misunderstandings concerning ethical topics. It allows us to raise awareness, promote responsibility, and support our employees and third parties.\n\nAs such, an anti-corruption e-learning was developed in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, the e-learning was updated through a design thinking approach, aiming to listen first to the trainees' needs and expectations and then to identify targeted employees considered 'at risk' through their job codes. This led to a curriculum of learnings, presenting three modules: a general module on the Zero Tolerance message against corruption and an explanation of the legal framework and risks, and two specific modules providing concrete examples, advice, and explanations about internal processes. The modules were supported by top leaders' videos demonstrating the 'tone at the top' on this crucial matter.\n\n## SSI#18: 100% of sales, procurement and finance employees trained every year on anti-corruption\n\nLaunched in 2018, the anti-corruption e-learning, initially mandatory for Finance, Sales and Procurement teams, was extended to 201 job codes identified at risk, representing approximatively 38,000 employees in 2020, compared to 23,000 employees in 2018. At the end of 2020, 94% of exposed employees had completed this e-learning.\n\n% targeted employees trained in 2020\n\n94%",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\nFurthermore, in-person learnings were organized in sensitive geographic areas regarding ethics and compliance challenges (Brazil, India) or in locations where a specific risk is higher (such as the export control risk).\n\nThe focus on ethics and compliance has increased this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with actions put into place such as global guidance for all country presidents on 'Ethics & Compliance considerations in the management of COVID-19', global risk-management live talks focusing on general compliance, HR compliance, and export control, and finally, weekly meetings with subject matter experts to identify and manage the main risks related to COVID-19. This close collaboration accelerated synergies between the Ethics & Compliance and Legal Departments which led to several transversal projects, launched in H2 2020.\n\n## 2.5.4 Focus on responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations\n\nIn its Principles of Responsibility, under 'responsible corporate citizenship', Schneider Electric takes a clear stance with regards to responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations. As a Company, Schneider Electric has a role to play in the public debate addressing leading issues with the global community. It is necessary that the Group states its positions clearly, participates in technical discussions, and supports responsible public policy development. However, Schneider Electric believes that this representation of interests shall be conducted in a transparent and fair manner, allowing its third parties and stakeholders to understand its activities, positions, and statements. In particular, Schneider Electric does not engage in political activity or political representation and does not make any payment to political parties in relation to its public representation. In 2020, Schneider Electric has not been involved in sponsoring local, regional, or national political campaigning.\n\nIn the US, political contributions can only be made by a corporation through a legally formed Political Action Committee (PAC) or Super Political Action Committee. Schneider Electric does not engage with Super PAC activity nor does it have a PAC in the US and therefore cannot make any political contributions in this country.\n\nDonations and lobbying activities are risks specifically addressed in the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct.\n\nSchneider Electric presents information about its lobbying activities in the French High Authority for Transparency in Public Life, in the EU transparency register, and in the US Lobbying Disclosure Act Registration.\n\nFor 2017 to 2019, the Group discloses membership fees towards trade associations, business coalitions, and think-tanks to a large extent in the sense that many organizations' fees are not primarily focusing on political campaigns or legislative activities but rather on standardization activities and industry best practices. However, as they could be referenced in policy development in the margin of their activities, we decided to include these. The following geographies are covered: Europe, the US, China, and Russia, which are where the Group is mostly active when it comes to policy and legislation.\n\nTotal contributions to such groups globally amounted \u20ac3.2 million in 2017, \u20ac2.6 million in 2018 and \u20ac5.2 million in 2019. 2020 data is not available at the time this report is published as reporting on these matters typically ends mid-year or end of year.\n\nLargest contributions and expenditures concern two main engagement topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The first is 'sustainable energy for all': Schneider Electric believes that energy management and energy efficiency are critical to move towards a new energy landscape and therefore supports a policy framework that unleashes the business and climate opportunities related to the new energy landscape. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted \u20ac0.52 million in 2019 (\u20ac0.37 million in 2018) globally;\n- \u00b7 The second is 'powering the digital economy': The Group supports the emergence of digital economy to bring new opportunities for businesses and people and therefore supports a policy framework that facilitates the digital transformation globally. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted \u20ac0.27 million in 2019 (\u20ac0.23 million in 2018) globally.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Companies are now more and more vulnerable to the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Threats to revenue and reputation due to data breaches;\n- \u00b7 System risks due to bogus system access and control;\n- \u00b7 Inherent system vulnerabilities from cloud data storage and computing;\n- \u00b7 Physical damage to machines and factories from malicious attacks.\n\nThese risks are inherent to any company operating in the digital space, but in the case of industrial infrastructures such as the ones of Schneider Electric's customers, the physical and financial damage can be particularly high and, in some cases, involve security impacts.\n\n## 2.7.2 Reinforcing the Group's cybersecurity posture and that of its ecosystem of partners and customers\n\nSchneider Electric deploys several actions to reinforce its cyberposture and that of its ecosystem of partners and customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Holding a cyber related business risk register to articulate potential vulnerabilities/attacks and define remediation activities;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and prioritizing high value assets (crown jewels) to the Company's operation;\n- \u00b7 Implementing cyber capabilities and digital locks around people, processes and technologies;\n- \u00b7 Deploying general and dedicated awareness and training programs on cybersecurity and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);\n- \u00b7 Monitoring, detecting, responding and learning from events and all those with partners and customers;\n- \u00b7 Performing reality checks via metrics, internal and external reviews, cyber crisis drills and vulnerability assessments;\n- \u00b7 Partnering with leading companies in the field of cybersecurity.\n\n## 2.7.3 Proposing cybersecurity by design\n\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity Framework and other recognized standards (ISA/ IEC 62443 and ISO 27000);\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric IoT-enabled EcoStruxure platform provides our customers with end-to-end cybersecurity solutions and services to protect a vast digital ecosystem.\n\n## 2.7.4 Personal data protection\n\nSchneider Electric believes that the global implementation of a digital strategy must reconcile economic objectives and respect for fundamental human rights, including the right to protection of personal data and privacy.\n\nSchneider Electric establishes an organization, work streams, policies, procedures and controls required by the obligations stemming from GDPR and data privacy and protection regulations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 internal data privacy policy and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR);\n- \u00b7 training and awareness campaigns;\n- \u00b7 processing registers;\n- \u00b7 online privacy policy and privacy notices;\n- \u00b7 digital assets privacy assessment process;\n- \u00b7 data breach management and notification process;\n- \u00b7 maturity assessment and audit controls.\n\nSchneider Electric has put in place a governance ecosystem including a Group Data Protection Officer, a DPO network, an implementation team, Data Privacy & Protection Champions and Steercos.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric has automated several processes including processing registers, consent management, digital asset privacy review, and has mapped key processes with the main expectations of ISO 27701. It has also rolled out new Privacy by Design Checklist and Guidelines and developed taylored training for targeted audiences. Schneider Electric has also been developing a Global Data Privacy & Protection compliance approach and addressed privacy compliance in relation to COVID-19.\n\n## 2.7.5 Training and awareness\n\nOnline training on cybersecurity is mandatory for all employees. This training helps employees to understand what are the cyber threats they may face and how they should behave to be protected from the risks. At the end of 2020, 99% of Schneider Electric employees have completed this training. Specific employee categories received mandatory training for risks linked to their activity.\n\nSchneider Electric implemented the GDPR requirements and specific training was launched to present the major challenges of this regulation. This training is mandatory for Schneider Electric employees in Europe and key functions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\n## 2.8 Vigilance plan\n\n## 2.8.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with customers, partners, suppliers, and communities, when it comes to ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group strives to have a positive impact on the planet and the environment by contributing to finding solutions to limit climate change.\n\nThe Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance. The plan includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis specific to vigilance: risks that Schneider Electric poses on the ecosystem and environment;\n- \u00b7 A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;\n- \u00b7 An alert system;\n- \u00b7 Governance specific to vigilance.\n\nIn this Registration document, Schneider Electric reviews the risk matrix analysis and some of the actions to mitigate these risks are described. When necessary, the reader will be directed to other sections of the report to get the relevant information. For more comprehensive and complete information, the full vigilance plan of the Group is available as a standalone document and can be downloaded from Schneider Electric's website.\n\n## 2.8.2 Evaluation of the main risks towards Schneider Electric's environment\n\n## 2.8.2.1 Methodology\n\nSchneider Electric developed a specific risk matrix for the implementation of its vigilance plan which is reviewed annually. The methodology is consistent with other risk evaluations maintained at Group level but focuses specifically on the risks posed by Schneider on its environment and ecosystem.\n\nIn order to enhance the existing risk matrix and cover a more comprehensive scope, in 2020, Schneider Electric worked with an external consultancy. This work led to a sharper granularity of risk categories, a reorganization of the supplier categories, and a focus on local communities.\n\nThe scope of work covered Schneider Electric, its subsidiaries and majority-owned joint ventures, its suppliers and subcontractors, as well as local communities.\n\n## 2.8.2.2 Risk categories\n\nFour risk categories have been identified: human rights, environment, business conduct and offer safety and cybersecurity. In order to be able to make a granular assessment of the risk level based on the nature of that risk and the magnitude of its impact on Schneider Electric's ecosystem, each category has been divided into specific risk areas.\n\nHuman rights:\n\n- \u00b7 Decent workplace;\n- \u00b7 Health and safety.\n\n## Environment:\n\n- \u00b7 Pollution and specific substances management;\n- \u00b7 Waste and circularity;\n- \u00b7 Energy, CO 2 and GHG.\n\nBusiness conduct:\n\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct;\n- \u00b7 Alert system, protection, and non-retaliation.\n\nOffer safety and cybersecurity:\n\n- \u00b7 Offer safety;\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data privacy.\n\n## 2.8.2.3 Risk location\n\nThe Group has studied four areas where risks may occur:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric sites: sites have been segmented based on categories that present a specific level of risk. Employees with frequent travels (sales, field services, travelers, audit, top management) have been assessed separately;\n- \u00b7 Suppliers: the level of risk differs based on the type of process and technologies used, and the Group has therefore segmented the analysis by component category. The risk level is an average assessment. The geographical location is factored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan;\n- \u00b7 Contractors: when implementing a customer project, like building a large electrical system at a customer's site, Schneider Electric is working with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil work, electrical contracting, etc.). This 'off-site' project work generates a specific level of risk for contractors. A separate 'off-site and projects execution' category for contractors has therefore been defined for the assessment.\n- \u00b7 Local Communities: Schneider Electric has identified two distinct segments: communities located around Schneider Electric sites and communities located around customer projects. Communities have been assessed against three risk categories; human rights, environment and business ethics.\n\n## 2.8.2.4 Risk evaluation and scale\n\nThe evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, with the seriousness of consequences from the risk. This is an evaluation of risk before impact of mitigation actions. After taking into consideration the impact of these mitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. Risks are assessed on the following scale:\n\n- 1 - Non-existent; 2 - Low; 3 - Medium; 4 - High; 5 -Very high.\n\nIn this 2020 risk assessment, no 'Very high' risk levels were identified.\n\n## 2.8.2.5 Key findings\n\nGlobally, the 2020 risk assessment exercise did not result in any significant variation of the level of risk versus previous year, reinforcing the relevance of last year's exercise. However, some variations are worth noting:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric sites: Cybersecurity is confirmed as a priority subject, reflecting the global evolution across countries and industries. The COVID-19 pandemic and its social, business, and economic consequences has led to a growing pressure on teams and individuals. That leads to the implementation of specific measures to protect employees and help them preserve their well-being. On the subject of CO 2 , GHG, and particles emissions the situation is stable, while the introduction of our new SF 6 -free offer is about to bring an important mitigation of the current risk.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers: risk levels tend to be more evenly spread across the different categories of risk, except in the case of suppliers' segments such as raw materials, transportation and shipping, plastics, or battery manufacturing. As supplier categories have been adjusted to better reflect the industry sector, the risk comparison with the previous year is complex. Aside this supplier categories adjustment, no specific risks increase for suppliers has been identified.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Contractors: the 2020 assessment confirmed external off-site contractors as one area that needs special attention. This is due to the specific nature of project work (civil work, installation, etc.) that implies high labor activity on construction sites.\n- \u00b7 Communities: the assessment work is still ongoing and therefore conclusions are still preliminary. Overall, it seems that communities located around Schneider Electric sites, at least for the largest sites, are not affected, or only marginally affected by Schneider Electric's presence. This is mostly due to the\n\n## Schneider Electric 2020 vigilance risk matrix\n\nThe risk matrix below summarizes Schneider Electric's risk analysis:\n\n| Very high risk                   |

so far. The following evolutions are to be mentioned:\n\n- \u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Schneider's business in several ways, like other companies. A crisis management team was set up globally, with connections to local crisis management teams in countries. This has allowed to limit the risks of illness for Schneider teams, including those working at the contact of customers. The implementation of remote working has been supported by the deployment of digital tools and the implementation of processes specific to this new way of working. Overall this was positively received by employees, but it must be noticed that lockdowns, remote management, the complexity of working from home in a sometimes unprepared environment, have created difficulties for some employees and is resulting in a higher risk on morale, fatigue, health, and overall psycho-social risks. As the consequences of the pandemic will continue to create an impact in 2021, this is an area to be specifically watched.\n- \u00b7 Ethical Business Conduct: although no formal trend has been confirmed, it is an area that is specifically monitored as the adverse business situation in 2020 may lead to increased pressure on ethical conduct, both internally and externally.\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data protection remain a point of very high attention, and Schneider is taking the subject very seriously. Several measures and trainings are implemented in order to protect employees, customers and stakeholders from threats.\n- \u00b7 The specific risk analysis conducted on communities residing around Schneider sites has not revealed particular areas of concerns. The largest industrial and office sites have been reviewed and risk level has been evaluated as low, or medium. This is mostly because Schneider sites are situated in large urban areas, and therefore have very little impact on their immediate surroundings.\n\nfact that Schneider Electric's sites are located in large, already structured industrial areas, or in cities. In regards to customer projects, the assessment shows that there may be some impact on communities. Schneider Electric is usually just one of the suppliers to the customer project, and the impacts are therefore highly variable and linked to the industrial profile of the endcustomer. A more detailed evaluation is in progress.",

This evaluation covers all natures of risks identified and considers specific parameters such as the type of industrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the geographic location of those suppliers. This allows the Group to factor in risks that may arise from a country's specific situation (social, political, etc.). These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent database (Responsible Business Alliance methodology, RBA, ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric has been a member since January 2018), with an annual evaluation. Schneider's entire network of tier 1 suppliers (52,000) is processed through this methodology. The Group identified 1,500+ 'high risk' suppliers (see graph 1) and targeted to audit 350 directly or through third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe audit plan was started in 2018. 2020 is the third year of implementation and Schneider Electric completed this schedule and planning of 350 audits before end 2020. Schneider Electric's audit questionnaire and audit methodology are fully aligned with the RBA framework. This audit plan is integrated into the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). It is to be noted that, despite the travel restrictions imposed in different countries by the COVID-19 measures, the Group managed to complete the full three-year audit plan, with a total of 374 on-site audits completed.\n\nIn 2020 only, the Group conducted 95 initial on-site audits with suppliers (audits conducted for the first time with a supplier, within the scope of the vigilance plan, see graph 2). These audits allow Schneider Electric to identify non-conformances and request the supplier to implement corrective actions. Re-audits with suppliers already audited were also conducted to review the corrective actions implemented to remediate non-conformances identified during the initial audit.",

Graph 3 gives the breakdown of nonconformances by topic and graph 4 gives them by geography.\n\nTop priorities are most serious non conformances. For each case, escalation is done at Chief Procurement Officer level. An analysis of the 133 'top priority' raised in 2020 shows the following issues are the most recurring:\n\n- \u00b7 Labor standards (53% of top priorities non-conformance issues): lack of respect of working time and resting days (time measurement systems are often insufficient); poor overtime reporting and payment; lack of formalization of working contracts;\n- \u00b7 Health and safety (34% of top priority non-conformance issues): weak emergency procedures; insufficient emergency training issues and preparation drills; insufficient fire alarm and protection systems; lack of medical response equipment; and lack of training;\n- \u00b7 Environment and management systems (13% of top priorities): lack of administrative compliance, management tools, and systems; and insufficient waste management and pollution prevention systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remediation and mitigation actions\n\nAs of end 2020, Schneider Electric has closed 94% of 2019 and 6% of 2020 non-conformances (all types) representing a cumulated rate of 71% over 3 years. Schneider Electric's approach is to help suppliers remediate the issues by sharing good practices and providing them with guidance and training. When non-conformances are not remediated (mainly top priorities), escalation to Chief Procurement Officer may lead to stop business relationship. In 2020, two relationships with suppliers have been terminated (two in 2019 and four in 2018).\n\nIn order to reinforce the coordination between Schneider Electric teams and suppliers on vigilance topics, a specific training program has been implemented. The primary target audience is the Schneider Electric Procurement team, and the training modules aim to increase their knowledge on the natures of risks, so they can integrate these topics early in the discussions with suppliers. At the end of 2020, 400+ employees have taken this training. These trainings combine in-class experience with e-learning sessions.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\nTo raise suppliers' awareness, improve their ability to identify risks earlier, and implement mitigation solutions, Schneider Electric organized face-to-face workshops dedicated to vigilance subjects. At the end of 2020, 300+ supplier teams have attended these events. These sessions include in-class face to face workshops and digital webinars.\n\n## Other actions\n\nSchneider Electric has deployed a continuous improvement program for its strategic suppliers based on the ISO 26000 standard. Schneider Electric partners with Ecovadis company to perform ISO 26000 assessments.\n\nAs of today, approximatively 700 strategic suppliers, representing 70%+ of total strategic purchasing volume, have submitted their data and obtained an average score of 57.4 pts out of 100. For reference, the average score of companies in the Ecovadis database is 44 pts, and Schneider Electric's own score is 82 pts.\n\n## 2021-2025 ambition\n\nSchneider Electric has defined new objectives for the period 20212025, as part of the sustainability strategy. Expanding from the previous plan to audit 350 'high-risk' suppliers, the Group took the objective to conduct 1,000 on site audits on high-risk suppliers and 3,000 self-assessment audits on medium-risk suppliers.\n\n## 2.8.4.3 Contractors for project execution on customer sites Project execution environment\n\nSchneider Electric's products and solutions are usually combined into larger systems such as electricity distribution and energy management in a building or production process automation in a factory. The build- up of such systems can be complex and typically involve several different parties before they are commissioned by end customers. For Schneider Electric, there are two options: to sell components through channel partners who take the responsibility to build and deliver the system; or to build and deliver the system directly for the end customer, as a project. This second option requires coordinating several project contractors (panel manufacturers, system integrators, building contractors, etc.), usually on the premises of the end customer. The common characteristics of these projects are that they happen primarily off-site (mostly on customer premises, existing or future), and they involve several different parties, global or local, each bringing their specific added value. Each project is specific, in its size, duration, and location. Therefore, the relations with contractors are specific to a contract, and not necessarily recurrent.\n\n## Vigilance plan specific to the project execution environment\n\nSchneider Electric operates with a pool of project contractors (or 'solution suppliers') from more than 8,000 companies. Not all of them may be active during a year. In the course of its supplier risk mapping exercise, Schneider Electric has identified approximately 100+ solution suppliers categorized as 'high risk'. Schneider Electric's current three-year audit plan is targeting 60+ on-site audits of these suppliers (included in the overall 350 target). Since 2018, 53 suppliers have already been audited, a bit below the ambition due to 2020 slow down facing COVID-19.\n\n## SSI#17: 350 suppliers under human rights and environment vigilance received specific on-site assessments\n\nThe three-year program ambition has been elevated from 300 to 350 specific on-site audits, and Schneider Electric is well on track to reach the new target. The 95 initial audits performed in 2019 have allowed Schneider to raise 1,200 non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 133 are assessed as 'top priority' and are given very specific attention during the re-audits of the suppliers. Schneider Electric's objective is to close 100% of all types of nonconformances identified, whatever their priority level.\n\n# Suppliers on-site assessments since 2017\n\n374\n\n## Main findings and actions\n\nThe most recurring non-conformities with high risk solution contractors are: insufficient on-site security measures to protect workers; improvement needed in working conditions; the lack of working contract formalization; and respect of working hours and resting days.\n\nIn addition to these non-conformities, specific risks related to local contract negotiation and relations with local authorities may occur.\n\nActions following non-conformities are the same as with other suppliers (re-audits, trainings, workshops). Specific measures are implemented for this project environment: Schneider Electric implements regular reviews of safety incidents on customers' sites, involving the Global Safety team and the Project Management leadership. The Group also reinforced training on anti-corruption and business agent policies for its employees involved in commercial negotiations. The project follow-up with contractors and the selection processes for contractors has been adapted to ensure vigilance topics are considered early in the project stage.\n\n## 2.8.5 Alert system and whistleblowing\n\nTo allow specific alerts to be reported with a high level of confidentiality and to be dealt with at a high level, Schneider Electric relies on an online internal system called Red Line. A similar alert system has been implemented for external cases. This system, called Green Line, is available for external stakeholders including suppliers, subcontractors, customers, and business agents. It allows alerts to be raised on issues such as corruption, theft, human trafficking, health and safety, environmental pollution, etc. Green Line is managed similarly to the internal alert system, Red Line.\n\nFor more details, see section 'One alert system to cover all stakeholders' pages 104 to 105.",

        "page_content": "## 2.9 Relations with subcontractors and suppliers\n\n## 2.9.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric has been involved in an ambitious approach to including sustainable development challenges in supplier selection and working processes. This approach is all the more important as Schneider Electric's Procurement volume represents more than EUR12 billion - and more than 52,000 suppliers.\n\nWith a complex global supply chain, there are some potential risks that Schneider Electric is committed to mitigating in the areas of health and safety, human rights, ethics, the environment, and sustainable development. Proactively managing upstream supplier risks, through Schneider Electric's Supplier Vigilance, Sustainable Development and Procurement programs and processes also improves the Group's reputation and shareholder value, and greatly lowers legislative and business risks.\n\nBy working closely with its suppliers to develop their maturity in integrating sustainability, Schneider Electric further de-risks and improves its competitive advantage by continually improving the global supply chain. Other opportunities and benefits include carbon footprint reduction and opportunities to co-innovate sustainable solutions with top suppliers and partners.\n\n## Schneider Electric's sustainable procurement strategy\n\nSchneider's strategy combines actions on large and deep coverage (multiple tiers), seeks to engage strategic & impacting suppliers, allows supply chain risks identification & prevention and drives continuous improvement on four main pillars.\n\nMinimum requirements\n\nfor all suppliers\n\nSign-off*\n\nPerformance assessment\n\n## 2.9.2 Risk identification and management\n\nSchneider Electric has a risk management system to identify and manage critical suppliers, and uses a tool, Supplier Risk Management (SRIM), to capture risks and ensure the follow-up of identified cases with an extended source.\n\nThe Group has also been performing sustainability risk assessments with its own purchasing specialists, supported by its Schneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) processes and ISO 26000 assessments for strategic suppliers.\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric is reinforcing its sustainability risk assessment by geography and type of activity as part of its vigilance plan.\n\nSchneider Electric has also launched its professional alert system for external stakeholders (Green line).\n\n## 2.9.3 Group policy\n\nSince 2004, the Group has been encouraging its suppliers to commit to a sustainable development initiative. Since 2012, Schneider Electric has wanted to place itself in a continuous improvement process as well as to follow up with its suppliers by requiring them to make progress according to the ISO 26000 guidelines.\n\nThis approach is strengthened by the General Procurement Terms and Conditions which all suppliers must abide by: each supplier undertakes to apply the principles and guidelines of the ISO 26000 international standard, the rules defined in the ISO 14001 standard, and is informed that the energy performance of its supply has been considered as part of the selection criteria.\n\nContinuous improvement for impacting suppliers\n\nISO 26000 on strategic suppliers\n\nSpecific\n\nprograms and\n\npartnerships\n\nCompliance\n\nfor targeted suppliers\n\nVigilance audits on risky suppliers\n\nEnvironment & Human rights compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * General Terms & Conditions, Code of Conduct, Global Compact\n\nPrograms\n\nPrograms tracked in Schneider Sustainability Impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Green and responsible growth driving economic performance\n\nSuppliers also commit to respect all national legislation and regulations, the REACH regulation, and the RoHS directives, and, more generally, the laws and regulations relating to the prohibition or restriction of use of certain products or substances. Lastly, suppliers are expected to report the presence and country of origin of any and all conflict minerals supplies in accordance with the requirements of the US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 known as the 'Conflict Minerals' law. In this context, Schneider Electric has a 'conflict-free' objective.\n\nSchneider Elecrtric publishes a charter for its suppliers, called the Supplier Guide Book, initially launched in 2016. The first section of this articulates expectations for suppliers on sustainable development in the following five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable procurement, labor practices, and human rights. In 2018, the Group adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct for suppliers.\n\n## 2.9.4 Due diligence and results\n\n## 2.9.4.1 Integration of the sustainable purchases approach in the selection of new suppliers\n\nSchneider Electric uses a qualification process called Supplier Approval Module (SAM) to qualify new and legacy suppliers. It is based on an auto-evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site audits by Schneider Electric certified auditors.\n\nIt includes two specific sections on sustainability. The following have been chosen as the criteria of evaluation, as the most relevant areas identified for the business of Schneider Electric:\n\n- \u00b7 People and social responsibility: training, human rights and ISO 26000, health and safety;\n- \u00b7 Environment: ISO 14001 and energy savings, EcoDesign, REACH and RoHS, conflict minerals.\n\nSchneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) includes several supplier assessment modules. The last being decisive and where sustainable development criteria account for nearly 30% of supplier evaluation. In addition, all of these criteria have a minimum level, below which a supplier cannot be selected to start business or extend business with Schneider Electric.\n\nSchneider Electric carried out 440 SAM audit decisions in 2020. In 2014, the Group launched an e-learning program which covers expectations in these fields and defines the documents and proof to be obtained from audited suppliers. In 2017, Schneider Electric digitized its supplier approval module tool, making it more efficient and consistent across the organization.\n\nThanks to this capability, all newly assessed suppliers have their action plan registered in a central database available to all in real time, making supplier interactions more fluid. These are tracked by Schneider Electric supplier leaders on a monthly or pluri-annual basis depending on the severity of the risks and classification of the supplier.\n\n## 2.9.4.2 Promotion of a continuous improvement process based on the ISO 26000 standard for strategic suppliers\n\nSustainable development is one of the seven pillars used to measure supplier performance, allowing the highest- performing suppliers to become 'strategic' suppliers. Performance resulting from the Ecovadis evaluation is one of the key points of the sustainable development pillar.\n\nThe Group has set out to engage all its strategic suppliers in a process of continuous improvement on this pillar. At the end of 2020, strategic suppliers represented c. 62%+ of Schneider Electric's purchases volume. Strategic suppliers who have passed the third-party evaluation process cover 70%+ of total strategic purchasing volume.\n\nIn 2018, the Group took on the ambitious target of achieving a 5 points out of 100 increase in the average ISO 26000 assessment score of its strategic suppliers between 2018 and 2020 as part of the SSI. In 2019, this target was raised to a 5.5 points increase. This indicator of the SSI is integrated into the performance incentive of Procurement employees receiving a bonus. The Ecovadis 26000 ratings remain one of the key aspects of Schneider Electric's supply chain and Procurement-led sustainable development strategy.\n\nThe elements of the assessment are now an integral part of the business reviews scheduled between buyers and suppliers, on a quarterly to yearly basis, depending on the suppliers. This monitoring supposes an improvement from the supplier.\n\nIn addition to the external assessments, Schneider Electric defined 'off-limit' situations which are: employee safety risks, environmental pollution and child labor.\n\nThese situations have been identified as material issues in Schneider Electric's supply chain and unacceptable for a supplier of the Group. Each buyer is expected to be alert enough to detect any problem areas related to sustainable development themes when visiting a supplier's site. Off-limit cases must be addressed immediately or escalated using the specifically defined process.\n\n## SSI#16: 5.5 pts/100 increase in average score of ISO 26000 assessment for our strategic suppliers\n\nIn 2020, the average score for strategic suppliers is 57.4/100, up 6.3 points versus 2017, and one of the top performing supply chains measured by the third-party evaluation (Ecovadis). For reference, the average score of companies in the Ecovadis database is 44/100, while Schneider Electric's own score is 82/100. This achievement is due to continued prioritization in the strategic sourcing process and desire to continually improve the environmental, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement aspects of Schneider Electric's supply chain.\n\nPoints increase vs 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+6.3",

        "page_content": "To support this approach, training was made available to Procurement teams. Basic training on the ISO 26000 standard for all purchasers is now part of the standard purchaser curriculum and more advanced training allows employees to learn how to question strategic suppliers during business reviews (whether assessed by a third party or not). For these off-limit situations, Schneider Electric favors a practical training approach, based on case studies, to ensure that purchasers have a clear understanding of situations that are unacceptable per the Group's standards. This also includes how to react if such a situation is encountered by Procurement. Potential detection may come from supplier on-site audits conducted as part of the vigilance plan leveraging RBA guidelines: a process is in place for immediate alert towards the Procurement community, including executives, for escalation and response.\n\n## 2.9.4.3 Conflict Minerals rule\n\nIn August 2012, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the Conflict Minerals rule as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As defined by the legislation, 'conflict minerals' include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, often called '3TG', which are the extracts of the minerals cassiterite, columbite-tantalite and wolframite, respectively. The legislation focuses on the sourcing of these minerals to be 'DRC conflict free' - meaning when these minerals were extracted, they did not directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. This rule requires companies to conduct a 'reasonable country of minerals' origin inquiry' and due diligence to determine whether 'conflict minerals', as defined in the rule, are used in their supply chain.\n\nAlthough the US SEC Conflict Minerals rule does not apply directly to Schneider Electric - since it is not registered with the US SEC - it is deeply concerned about social and environmental conditions in some mines that could supply metals for its products. As part of the Group's sustainable business practices, it is committed to increasing its responsible metal sourcing efforts.\n\nIn working towards these commitments, Schneider Electric has taken numerous steps including:\n\n- \u00b7 Updating its Procurement Terms and Conditions to reflect its expectations from suppliers;\n- \u00b7 Establishing a 'Conflict Minerals Compliance program' supported and sponsored by its top leadership. This program was developed based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA) and other appropriate international standards, which covers a wider scope of minerals and countries;\n- \u00b7 Identifying the use of conflict minerals in its products;\n- \u00b7 Engaging with its suppliers so that they respond in a timely manner to its requests for evidence of compliance.\n\nSchneider Electric is working with an expert third party, collecting information from its suppliers to identify the source of the minerals in question and ensure they are recognized as 'conflict-free' within established international standards such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), and others. The Group is aware of the complexity of this task, and that it will take time to collect the required information, but it is committed to contributing to this responsible sourcing initiative as well as responding to its customers' potential concerns.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 87% of the smelters and refiners identified in our supply chain were designated as conformant with a recognized third-party validation scheme or actively engaging in same (equivalent to more than 90% of the relevant spend being compliant). The remainder are either from outside the conflict zone outlined in Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act, or solely using recycled and scrap materials. When the country of origin is known to be in the conflict zone, 100% of the smelters and refiners were verified conformant. Therefore, the Group has no reason to believe that any conflict minerals the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries.\n\n## 2.9.4.4 Cobalt program\n\nMid-2020, Schneider Electric added cobalt to its conflict minerals program. Cobalt sales have been identified as potentially funding or supporting inhumane treatment, including human trafficking, slavery, forced labor, child labor, torture, and war crimes in known CAHRA. These areas are identified by the presence of armed conflict, widespread violence or other risks of harm to people. These areas are often characterized by widespread human rights abuses and violations of national or international law. The program, currently ramping up, is focusing on the responsible sourcing of cobalt used as a key element for lithium ion batteries in Schneider Electric's supply chain.\n\n## 2.9.4.5 Rollout of eco-responsible initiatives\n\nSchneider Electric is rolling out several eco-responsible initiatives with its suppliers.\n\nFor example, Schneider Electric has chosen to go further than the European REACH and RoHS regulations. The approach is rolled out in the Group over the whole product portfolio and all suppliers, regardless of their geographic origin. To support the REACH and RoHS projects, Schneider Electric has implemented a data collection process supported by a dedicated team to gather the required information from its suppliers. This has allowed it to significantly reduce its response time to collect such information and therefore be quicker to respond to its customers' inquiries. In addition to data collection, Schneider Electric put in place a review process for this data to guarantee its quality. Thanks to this process, the level of verification required for a given supplier can be adjusted in order to make the controls more stringent in cases where deviations have been detected.\n\nOn the topic of sustainable packaging, Schneider Electric engaged with its suppliers to ensure that 99% of cardboard and pallets used in the transport of goods are sourced either from recycled or certified sources, hence conserving and preserving the natural resources.\n\nAnother example is Schneider Electric's commitment to supporting the small and medium enterprises network. This support is given through an approach to work in an adapted manner with certain suppliers. In France, Schneider Electric is a major player in the International SME Pact.\n\nFinally, by the very nature of its activity, the Group continually encourages its ecosystem (including customers and suppliers) to implement energy efficient solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, 'Earth Overshoot Day' fell on August 22, later than 2019's date of July 29, however, this was driven by a COVID-19-impaired global economy and not by any major inflection towards resources decoupling. 2020 saw an increase of people conscious about the environmental challenges, and a growing number of stakeholders have now realized the urgent need to pivot global supply chains and business models towards more resource efficient alternatives. Additionally, 2020 saw many commitments towards carbon neutrality from countries as well as corporations, such as through the Group's Climate Pledge, which was announced in September 2019. Schneider Electric is determined to continue transforming its supply chain and business models towards a 'one-planet prosperity' for all. Schneider Electric is working to adopt lowest-impact operations, while inventing resource efficiency-enabling technologies for its customers. The Group wants to show there are ways for companies to 'do good while doing well'. Its environmental strategy is built on two pillars: climate and resources.\n\n## Key targets and results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020   | Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020                                                                  | Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020   | Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Climate                                     | Renewable electricity                                                                                      | 80%                                         | 80%                                         |\n|                                             | CO 2  efficiency in transportation                                                                         | 8.4%                                        | 10%                                         |\n|                                             | Million metric tons CO 2  saved on our customers' end thanks to  EcoStruxure TM  offers                    | 134                                         | 120                                         |\n|                                             | Increase in turnover for our EcoStruxure TM  Energy and  Sustainability Services                           | 17.6%                                       | 25%                                         |\n| Circular economy                            | Sales under our new Green Premium TM  program                                                              | 76.7%                                       | 75%                                         |\n|                                             | Sites labeled Towards Zero Waste to Landfill                                                               | 206                                         | 200                                         |\n|                                             | Cardboard and pallets for transport packing from recycled or  certified sources                            | 99%                                         | 100%                                        |\n|                                             | Metric tons of avoided primary resource consumption through  ECOFIT TM , recycling, and take-back programs | 157,588                                     | 120,000                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 audited indicators.\n\nThe 2017 performance serves as a starting point value for the Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020.

        "page_content": "## 3.1 Environmental strategy\n\n2020 was a year of acceleration. Acceleration of our collective realization of the fragility of the world's ecosystems, climate, resources, biodiversity, and even human lives. The magnitude of changes needed will not accept incremental year-on-year progress. What is now needed is placing a Planet-first lens onto our collective development path: are we living under the limits of one planet? As science tells us this is not the case, let us instead work backwards and define what needs to be done to preserve climate under 1.5 \u00b0C of global temperature increase, to achieve biodiversity 'No Net Loss', and to conserve primary resources. Towards that end, innovation and R&D are needed to invent solutions, technologies, and business models to help customers operate as well within the limits of one planet. Schneider Electric's environmental strategy covers many different dimensions, from supply chain to materials selection, from finance to people decision, and from business models to value-propositions, through two main perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 +1.5 \u00b0C climate compatibility: the determination to build value propositions, business models, and supply chains which are +1.5 \u00b0C compatible (i.e. allowing the fast decarbonization of the Group's operations and that of its customers and suppliers);\n- \u00b7 One-planet resource and life compatibility: to decouple resource consumption from business growth and create a circular economy, design products and industrial processes that do not alter life, water or biodiversity. Strive to push back 'Earth Overshoot Day' towards December 31rst.\n\nSchneider Electric sees itself and reviews its progress as part of a broader ecosystem: first, how the Group as a company and in its supply chain delivers progress within the limits set out above; second, how customers are helped to do the same through offers, solutions, and services; and third, how Schneider Electric helps the world at large - its cities, buildings, and infrastructure - and progresses against the same factors (climate, resources, and life).\n\n## 3.1.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nEnvironmental sustainability comes with an array of risks and opportunities.\n\nProducts environment compliance and stewardship: with increasing chemical substances regulations, raising standards from a well-being perspective, especially in the building space, and increasing questions from B2C and B2B customers on health matters, the ability to ensure compliance of several hundreds of thousands of product references has never been so critical. When such product traceability is mastered at scale, with robust processes and systems in place, clear business opportunities emerge, as digitization of such data is increasingly needed. Winners are those who can seamlessly capture underlying data from suppliers, aggregate it, and disseminate it swiftly to customers who need it.\n\nCircular innovations and business models: an obsession to avoid wastage and to reuse, repair, retrofit, or recycle, translates into cost savings. A circular mindset also triggers process innovations and opens the door to new business models, enhancing customer intimacy and thus loyalty (e.g. take-back and modernization services). High hopes are placed on circularity as a state of mind as it can transform multiple industries for the better. From a risk standpoint, some challenges may arise from a lack of stringent regulations or uncontrolled practices if used products come back into the loop without adequate controls and expertise. Schneider Electric's products are life-critical and it is paramount their circular features, including 'recycled content', carefully reflect the products' unique constraints, as well as roles in various mission-critical applications.\n\nClimate: Climate change can place a strain on specific supply chain legs should they be more exposed to exceptional climate disorders such as floods, winds, or fire. For this reason, Schneider Electric carries-out independent reviews of its industrial sites and their Business Continuity Plans (BCPs), and makes decisions accordingly. Companies who can quantify and reduce CO 2 in each of their processes and dealings, and deliberately aspire to achieve neutrality ahead of others, will have an edge over the competition.\n\nEnvironmental transparency and traceability: more and more customers, green building standards, distributors, and electricians prefer offers with green credentials. It is both a risk, if one is too lenient in this domain and an opportunity to be harnessed, if made an integral part of a deliberate approach. Many building standards and local regulations, mandate or promote offers providing EPDs (Environmental Product Declarations). There is clearly a growing premium assigned to transparency.\n\nBiodiversity and resources access: while Schneider Electric does not directly depend upon organic resources, the strain the world places onto ecosystems is also placing additional responsibility onto the Group's sector. The extraction of metals such as copper and aluminum, and the making of steel, both have a direct or indirect impact on natural ecosystems and biodiversity. When completing its first ever end-to-end biodiversity footprint in 2020, Schneider Electric purposely wanted to gauge its impacts, so it could work to address these. On an opportunity note, companies able to find alternatives to primary materials and adopt them at scale, or who can use alternate sourcing options for scarce materials sourcing, will increase the resilience of their supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3. Schneider Electric's commitments towards environmental excellence\n\nSites and property risks: ill-managed industrial processes can trigger spills and contamination of water, soil, and air, and this is a risk for both companies and the environment. However, a proactive approach towards site and property environmental risks helps preserve continuity of operations, reduce reputational and legal risk, and avoid expensive remediation steps.\n\nOperations compliance and projects execution: with 135,000 people spread across more than 1,000 sites globally, operating under 100 different national environmental regulatory frameworks, risks of non-compliance exist. These risks deal with topics such as effluent management, handling of waste, or greenhouse gases related expectations, to name but a few. When Schneider Electric runs projects for customers, its superior execution ability on environmental matters may trigger preference from its customers and give the Group an edge over the competition.\n\n## 3.1.2 Environment strategy 2030 and its pillars\n\nSchneider Electric has defined a clear environmental strategy, defining priority initiatives and related goals across environmental domains and fully aligned with the Company's sustainable and profitable growth strategy. At Schneider Electric, environmental considerations go far beyond its efforts towards the reduction of its supply chain's footprint on the planet. They are embedded into the Group's strategy, R&D, manufacturing, procurement, finance, human resources, transportations, sales, marketing, and services, the way value propositions to customers are spelt out.\n\nOther environmental risks and opportunities exist. They may be related to environmental resource productivity (e.g. reduced energy and materials consumption) which could help both reduce operating costs and reduce risks related to price volatility and resource availability. This relates to resources such as copper, steel, polyamides, or cardboard. Other risks and opportunities exist that could either tarnish or enhance employer value proposition. However, a sound environmental strategy and execution enhances the Group's reputation with analysts, rating agencies, investors, governments, NGOs, and civil society, and overall, benefits its brand reputation.\n\n| Pillar                                               | Commitment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate                                              | A CO 2  strategy has been defined, towards '+1.5\u00b0C climate compatibility', with a clear roadmap for 2030, 2040  and 2050.

        "page_content": "## 3.1.3 Governance\n\nAt Group level, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer helps determine and enforce the Group's environmental goals and underlying transformations.\n\nAcross organizational entities, environmental managers or correspondents can be found in functions such as procurement, finance, insurance, marketing, industrialization, security, mergers and acquisitions, and sustainable development.\n\nVarious governance bodies enable these communities of experts and leaders within the environmental function to meet every month or every quarter, depending on the topics and entities, to ensure consistent adoption of environment policies and standards throughout the Group.\n\nTo implement the environment policy, environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design, and marketing. This network has access to a wide range of resources including directives, standards, policies, best practices, benchmarks, and implementation guides, all of which are shared on the dedicated intranet site and databases.\n\nIn 2020, environmental performance has also been reported and discussed on a number of other instances:\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly reviews with global supply chain leadership;\n- \u00b7 Quarterly steering committees with business units, discussing progress on Ecodesign, the Green Premium \u2122 program, and product environment stewardship initiatives;\n- \u00b7 Multiple ad hoc sessions and presentations to the board Audit and Risks Committee, Board of Directors, Executive Committee, Human Resources & CSR Committee and Group Sustainability Committee.\n\nLeading experts in various environmental fields (Ecodesign, energy efficiency, circular economy, CO 2 , etc.) are identified globally. Each year, a process recognizes those individuals who have a specific expertise that the Company is eager to maintain and grow. Such experts are named Edisons, and there are ten specific domains where they were identified, one of them being environment. Each year, an environment Edison is expected to dedicate 10% to 20% of his/her time to lead a global initiative related to his/her expertise, such as development of an e-learning course, a new standard, or an innovation.\n\nThe network of leaders driving environmental transformations consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 For the design and development of new offers: Sustainable Offers Managers and leaders in each business are in charge of integrating key environmental considerations into the development of new products and producing expected environmental information for customers;\n- \u00b7 For the management of industrial, logistics and large tertiary sites: Safety, Environment and Real Estate Vice-Presidents are nominated in each region, with dedicated teams. They are responsible for implementing the Group's policies across all sites in their geographical remit. In each region, directors coordinate teams across a group of sites (clusters), as well as on-site. These environmental and safety leaders are in charge of reporting on performance as well as executing progress plans on the ground;\n\n- \u00b7 For logistics: the Logistics SVP and his/her teams within the Global Supply Chain Department are in charge of reducing and measuring CO 2 emissions from freight at Group level;\n- \u00b7 For countries and commercial entities: environment managers and safety champions are appointed in each country and are responsible for: local reporting actions where necessary; monitoring regulations, taxes, and national opportunities as applicable (e.g. national transcriptions of the WEEE in relation to end-of-life product management, and monitoring of RoHS China); the proactive management of local environmental initiatives; and relations with local stakeholders.\n\n## 3.1.4 Employee engagement\n\nTo educate all employees on environmental issues, and to give them the necessary skills, e-learning modules have been developed on topics such as the circular economy, climate and CO 2 , biodiversity, and EcoDesign. Additionally, an environment intranet site is accessible to all employees, informing them about the ongoing programs, best practices, results, goals, and upcoming deadlines.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric launched a Company-wide initiative, Act for Green, whereby each of its employees, each day of the year, can share their suggestion on how the Group can 'Green' its operations. In 2020, thanks to the suggestion of many employees, an initiative to ban the single use of plastics has been launched and 100% of the Group's sites are committed to follow this #stopsingleuseplastics program.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, on UN World Environment Day, as has been the case for each year over the last six years, Schneider Electric organized its annual 'Global Environment Day' event involving tens of thousands of Group employees, inviting them to celebrate and to share innovations in the areas of CO 2 emissions reduction and the circular economy, both internally to the Group and externally in association with local communities. This year, a special focus was made on the importance of biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3.2 Climate strategy towards net-zero CO 2 emissions\n\n## 3.2.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nGlobal climate science is clear: public and private spheres must work together to reduce global carbon emissions and halt the rise in temperature to below +1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nIn line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, Schneider Electric launched a prospective approach on climate change and energy transition two years ago, by setting up a dedicated organization in charge. The scenarios developed by Schneider Electric demonstrate that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with IPCC's 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios, is possible, and the Group is uniquely positioned to embark its ecosystem onto an inclusive, zero-carbon transition. The Group sees the energy and climate transition as an opportunity for companies who are 'part of the solution' to grow their revenues. Schneider Electric's Energy Management and Industrial Automation help customers deliver energy and resource efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, smart grid technologies unlock the potential to electrify energy usage, powered by renewable electricity.\n\nClimate risks identified in the short, medium and long term are related to climate mitigation and adaptation:\n\n- \u00b7 Volatility of energy and commodity prices and regulation strengthening will generate increasing and volatile operating and investment costs along Schneider Electric's value chain, impacting both Schneider Electric's expenditures and that of its suppliers. This can translate into an increase of the cost of goods sold and reduced margins. This risk can be mitigated by securing low-carbon and resilient sources of supply, increasing resource-efficiency, and increasing resale prices along the value chain. In addition, physical assets are retrofitted for resourceefficiency, as competition with new built efficient infrastructure will increase. For instance, energy- efficient and digital buildings provide superior comfort to users while lowering operating costs, which translates into higher asset value;\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric also considers the possible financial impacts of future CO 2 costs on its activity, looking both at operational (scope 1 and 2) and supply chain (scope 3) footprints. Given the relatively low level of the Group's scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, carbon pricing has indirect rather than direct impacts, resulting in increased costs from the supply chain, especially in the purchasing of raw materials and manufactured components containing metals and plastics. A carbon tax at EUR 30/ton of CO 2 is estimated to have an impact on the Group industrial supply chain up to EUR 280 million globally (including direct and indirect impacts);\n- \u00b7 Climate change mitigation will lead to regulation strengthening, which can disrupt markets. For instance, SF 6 -insulated switchgear can have a significant impact on climate change if SF 6 is mishandled at the end of life of the equipment and leaks into the atmosphere. Schneider Electric strives to anticipate regulation changes and launches innovate SF 6 -free solutions;\n- \u00b7 Extreme weather events, floods, droughts, and other climate impacts will increasingly put pressure onto supply chains. Shortage can translate directly into revenue loss (missed orders), increased costs (urgent shipping), and increased working capital requirements (stock management). Extreme events can also cause damage to property and assets. This risk can be mitigated by adopting a flexible and resilient supply chain, with the ability to rebalance supply and manufacturing.\n\n## 3.2.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric has been a leading contributor to the fight against climate change for the past 15 years by implementing its own energy management and industrial automation services across operations, by supporting its clients in achieving their low-carbon and efficiency objectives, and by allowing more than 30 million people to gain access to electricity. Schneider Electric aims to reduce the end-to-end emissions of its offers, by engaging suppliers and ecodesigning offers for life cycle climate and circular performance. Schneider also takes an active role in a variety of multi-stakeholder organizations to promote solutions to climate change, call for a price to CO 2 and strengthen CO 2 governance globally. Finally, Schneider contributes, since 2011, to the Livelihoods funds, which proposes innovative investment models to simultaneously address environmental degradation, climate change, and rural poverty.\n\nIn its Principles of Responsibility, launched in 2019, Schneider Electric adopts an unequivocal position regarding impact on climate change and CO 2 emissions.\n\nAt the 25th UN Climate Conference (COP25), the Group reaffirmed its ambition to be a role model in the fight against climate change, by sharply decarbonizing its own operations and by delivering services and solutions that allow its customers to reduce more CO 2 emissions than those produced by its activity. Climate ambitions are defined for 2025, 2030, 2040 and 2050:\n\n- \u00b7 Before 2025, demonstrate that Schneider Electric is carbon positive together with its customers and partners, thanks to CO 2 savings delivered by EcoStruxure \u2122 ;\n- \u00b7 On the Group's operations (scope 1 and 2): be carbon neutral by 2025 (allowing CO 2 offsets) and net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2030 (with no CO 2 offsets);\n- \u00b7 On indirect emissions (scope 3) in its supply chain and with customers: reduce emissions by -35% by 2030 (versus 2017) by actively engaging suppliers to accelerate their climate strategy and sourcing greener materials, as well as reducing offers' emissions on customers' ends;\n- \u00b7 Become carbon neutral on the Group's full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (scope 1, 2, and 3 with quality CO 2 offsets), 10 years ahead of 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory. This means that all Schneider Electric's products will be carbon neutral in 2040;\n- \u00b7 Engage with suppliers to move towards a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050 (with no CO 2 offsets).\n\nThe Group's 2030 targets (net-zero CO 2 emissions on scope 1 and 2, and -35% on scope 3) are a validated 1.5\u00b0C Science-Based Target.",

Since 2018, Schneider Electric is one of the 15 companies (out of 4,500+ signatories) to join the Global Compact LEAD initiative 'Pathways to Low-Carbon and Resilient Development' to proactively share best practices in sustainable climate strategies.\n\n## Schneider Electric's 2020 industrial carbon footprint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 3.2.3.1 CO 2 footprint\n\nSchneider Electric updates its scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint annually, and scope 3 emissions annually or every three years (depending on the source of emission). Its industrial carbon footprint (i.e. scopes 1, 2 and 3 upstream, as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, excluding use and end-of-life of products sold) enables the Group to quantify and reduce CO 2 emissions from its supply chain, adopting a cradle to gate view. Scope 3 emissions represent around 90% of the Group's industrial carbon footprint, mainly from the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and services to its suppliers. Emissions produced, saved, and avoided by Schneider Electric's products and services during their use phase and end-of-life are also quantified.\n\nThe diagram above represents Schneider Electric's 2020 industrial carbon footprint on scopes 1, 2 and 3 (excluding use of the sold products), including all greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the upstream activity of all its suppliers to the downstream logistics activity to distribute its products to customers.\n\nCoverage of reported emissions is 100% for energy, fugitive SF 6 emissions, waste, purchases, capital goods, commuting, travel, and freight (coverage is estimated using a relevant activity indicator for each source of emissions, such as spend for purchases and business travel, surface for energy and capital goods, headcount for commuting, and waste). Schneider Electric reports no GHG emissions on franchises, investments, or downstream leased assets, because these emissions are not considered relevant for its activities.\n\nIn the end-to-end carbon footprint of Schneider Electric, covering the entire life cycle of products, the use phase and end of life of the products are also taken into account. During the use phase, the emissions induced and saved by the Group's offers to its\n\ncustomers are measured using the methodology described in subsection 3.2.3.6 'CO 2 savings delivered at every layer of EcoStruxure \u2122 '. Use phase emissions from products sold were estimated in 2020 at 58.7 million tonnes of CO 2 e. End-of-life emissions from products sold were estimated in 2020 at 4.4 million tonnes of CO 2 e. The end-to-end CO 2 footprint of Schneider Electric is declared each year in the CDP Climate questionnaire, which is publicly available.\n\n## 3.2.3.2 Net-zero CO 2 emissions in operations by 2030\n\nTo deliver its net-zero scope 1 and 2 by 2030, validated in 2019 by the Science-Based Targets initiative, the Group has launched several ambitious transformations, such as the phase-out of SF 6 in its products by 2025, the switch to 100% renewable electricity, the doubling of energy productivity, and the shift to 100% electric cars in the Company fleet by 2030. The Group leverages its Power and Building EcoStruxure \u2122 IoT architectures to deliver these ambitions, monitor and optimize energy consumption, manage assets and grid infrastructure, manage distributed renewable energy resources and electricity load, monitor energy quality, and power electric vehicles. The initiatives to deliver these targets are described in section 3.4 Eco-efficient manufacturing, pages 130 to 135.\n\nThanks to Schneider Electric's energy efficiency and renewable strategies, the Group has achieved significant CO 2 emissions reduction in absolute terms in 2020 versus 2017 baseline: scope 1 and 2 operational emissions have reduced from 698,162 tCO 2 e to 287,356 tCO 2 e, which is an absolute reduction of 410,806 tCO 2 e, and a -59% decrease.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.3.3 End-to-end carbon neutrality by 2040 (scope 1, 2 and 3)\n\nIn addition to its previous commitments, Schneider Electric has added a bold 2040 milestone to its Carbon Pledge. The Group commits to become carbon neutral on the Company's full endto-end footprint by 2040 (full scopes 1, 2 and 3 with quality CO 2 offsets), 10 years ahead of the 1.5 \u00b0C climate trajectory. This means that all Schneider Electric products will be carbon neutral in 2040.\n\nBy connecting technology, business, and collaboration, Schneider Electric joins the likes of global partners, such as Amazon, Infosys, and Daimler to help deliver carbon neutrality by 2040 as part of the Climate Pledge, a jointly created initiative between Global Optimism and Amazon. The Climate Pledge was founded on the conviction that global businesses are responsible and accountable for acting on the climate crisis, together.\n\nThis milestone is set 10 years earlier than the pledge made in 2015 by all UN country members at Paris COP21, showing the Group's eagerness to accelerate the world economy decarbonization to respect the 1.5 \u00b0C targets.\n\nSchneider is already taking concrete action to:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce purchasing-related CO 2 emissions with EcoDesign \u2122 to improve the end-to-end life cycle environmental footprint of its offers, notably by reducing and substituting materials and components embedded in products. The Group aims to source 50% green materials by 2025, favoring bio-sourced, recycled, and sustainable options;\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from freight and logistics activities, by shifting from air to sea freight and optimizing fill rates and travel routes. The reduction of CO 2 intensity of freight has been part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact since 2012;\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from waste management, with its 'Waste as Worth' program. Since 2012, Schneider Electric has increased its waste recovery ratio by +12.7% to 96.3%, meaning that over 13,600 tons of additional waste was diverted from landfill in 2020 compared to 2012 - nearly the weight of two Eiffel Towers. In 2020, 206 sites achieved the 'Towards Zero Waste to Landfill' designation;\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from travel and commuting with the development of digital solutions such as messaging, web audio, video conference, and remote collaborative brainstorming tools. (see section 3.5 'Circular economy', pages 136 to 139);\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from capital goods by optimizing real estate space occupancy. Indeed, by using existing building surfaces more efficiently, it is possible to deliver more value from existing assets and limit the need to build new infrastructure. Saved surfaces translate directly into lower CO 2 emissions, as well as spared natural habitats and agricultural land.\n\n## 3.2.3.4 Towards net-zero CO 2 emissions in supply chain by 2050\n\nGoing further, Schneider Electric is committed to engaging suppliers towards a net-zero CO 2 in supply chain by 2050, in line with 1.5 \u00b0C climate scenarios.\n\nSchneider Electric is already taking concrete action to engage suppliers to reduce CO 2 emissions. By 2025, the Group aims to engage 1,000 suppliers to reduce their CO 2 emissions by 50%.\n\nBy 2050, achieving net-zero CO 2 emissions in supply chain will require Schneider Electric to work transversally with all stakeholders, from product design, to sourcing, manufacturing, and shipping.\n\nTo deliver this transformation, strategic supply chain and R&D decisions will embed carbon pricing of EUR 30-130/ton depending on time horizons. The Group also focuses on co-innovating with suppliers. In 2018 and 2019, the Group co-developed a state-ofthe-art digital CO 2 tracking solution for freight with a world-leading logistics company, enabling this supplier to commercialize a new offer on the market.\n\n## 3.2.3.5 Climate-related scenarios embedded in the Group's strategy\n\nSince 2018, Schneider Electric has built a scenario planning function and roadmap.\n\nThis exercise led to the creation of several scenarios leading to 2040, developed following an inductive methodology approach. These scenarios include critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and resources availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways, and technology developments, among others.\n\nThe consequences on the energy transition are quantified, looking at 10 regions and a number of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider Electric operates. Key findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the ones from the International Energy Agency, among others, on a regular basis.\n\nGovernance is in place, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy Officer, and this exercise is shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across the business and operations.\n\nAcross all scenarios, a key takeaway is the dominant role of:\n\n- \u00b7 Efficiency: a critical enabler for decarbonization, resiliency and security;\n- \u00b7 Electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with 2x growth against other sources of energy;\n- \u00b7 Digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic productivity.\n\nBased on these inputs and findings, and by estimating the financial impact such scenarios may have on the Group's business (as risks or as opportunities), key development areas have been identified that allow to actively contribute to the low-carbon transition. These scenarios therefore heavily drive the Schneider Electric business strategy in terms of investments (R&D, incubation, efficiency), and enable to develop its sustainability portfolio of offers.",

Schneider Electric's commitments towards environmental excellence\n\n## 3.2.3.6 CO 2 savings delivered at every layer of EcoStruxure \u2122\n\nWith EcoStruxure \u2122 , the IoT-enabled architecture, Schneider Electric helps companies become more efficient and reduce their CO 2 emissions. To demonstrate this positive impact, a new indicator was launched in 2018 to quantify CO 2 savings delivered to customers through the use of Schneider offers. From 2018 to 2020, Schneider Electric's solutions helped customers save 134 million tons of CO 2 e. In addition, new technologies were added to expand the methodology coverage in 2020: microgrids, Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS), cooling, power quality and 3 phase UPS. Overall, from 2018 to 2020, Schneider Electric helped customers save and avoid 263 million tons of CO 2 e.Only saved emissions are reported as part of the current Schneider Sustainability Impact scorecard. This indicator is audited every year as part of the extra-financial audit. 2020 audit covered five new technologies and both CO 2 saved and avoided.\n\nFor 2021 onwards, Schneider Electric is committed to extend the methodology to progressively include all relevant offers, as well as report both saved and avoided CO 2 emissions with customers and partners. From 2018 to 2025, Schneider Electric is committed to help customers saved and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 . This commitment is one of the three performance indicators of the first ever convertible Sustainability-Linked Bond launched by the Group end 2020.\n\nSchneider has created an innovative CO 2 accounting methodology to quantify CO 2 savings delivered to customers. This methodology allows to quantify CO 2 induced and saved by the Group's solutions at its customers' premises. Detailed calculation rules are defined per offer, leveraging sales data, market expertise, and technical knowledge.\n\nEmission savings are net emissions (savings are netted from use- phase caused emissions) and considered solely as savings delivered on brownfield (retrofit) projects. Avoided emissions are defined with respect to greenfield sales (new infrastructure); they are defined as a limitation of emissions increase versus a reference scenario. Avoided emissions are net emissions, they are the difference between emissions of a reference scenario and emissions with the implementation of Schneider Electric's offer.\n\nThe methodology is designed to become a shared industry standard, its principles are applicable across capital goods and consumer durables sectors. Attention was given to define rigorous calculations, with conservative assumptions. The methodology is public and was developed with an expert CO 2 accounting consulting company, Carbone 4.\n\n## 3.2.3.7 Internal CO 2 price\n\nTo lead the global transition to a zero-carbon economy, Schneider Electric calls for policymakers to define robust and predictable carbon pricing for companies, enabling companies to integrate collaterals on climate in their strategy. A high and stable price on carbon will strengthen incentives to invest in sustainable technologies and to change behaviors.\n\nAs part of its Climate Pledge, Schneider Electric is committed to embed a carbon pricing of EUR 30-130/ton (depending on time horizons) in strategic supply chain and R&D decisions. In line with the vision, an internal price on carbon is already used in several cases to embed the cost of CO 2 externality in decision making and strategy.\n\nFirst, an internal CO 2 price is used to assess the performance and resiliency of operations. The cost of CO 2 is evaluated for industrial activities, looking at CO 2 emissions from energy consumption, SF 6 leaks and road freight per region. CO 2 cost is also embedded in industrial network modelling to account for future CO 2 prices in industrial decisions. This enables measurement of the potential impact of CO 2 pricing on the Group's supply chain and review of progress against the CO 2 reduction targets. Second, an implicit price to carbon has been adopted for over 10 years, through the Group's three flagship programs to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions: energy efficiency, renewable energy and SF 6 leaks reduction. These programs are evaluated against a conventional price of CO 2 of EUR 30/tCO 2 , to assess whether the investment and reduction efforts are in line with the cost of CO 2 externality. Schneider Electric views internal CO 2 pricing as a useful tool to reinforce its governance and external commitments on CO 2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Time for Climate Impact Disclosure white paper and CO 2 Impact Methodology guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Major biodiversity loss undermines nature's ability to support people and communities, a factor which strongly improves both quality of life and business prosperity.\n\nScience clearly says that human activity takes an unsustainable toll on nature. In 2018, the world average terrestrial Mean Species Abundance (MSA) (1) was only 66%, meaning that a significant part of the species abundance of ecosystem integrity has already been lost. Under a business-as-usual scenario, this number would fall below 60% MSA by 2050, which is much beyond the safe operating zone that respects the planetary boundary, which is estimated at 70% MSA (CDC Biodiversit\u00e9). Such a high biodiversity loss undermines nature's ability to provide its contribution to people, which is vital for human existence and a good quality of life.\n\nThe fight against nature loss should be a business priority: nature is essential to global economic prosperity and individual business success. A sustainable future for people and economies will be possible if nature, climate and people are addressed in an integrated way. Indeed, climate change is among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, and yet nature is part of the climate solutions.\n\nFor Schneider Electric, biodiversity loss generates business risks. First, biodiversity loss can accelerate climate deregulation and related risks. Biodiversity loss could also have a significant impact on the increase of the cost of raw materials and, eventually, its availability. Finally, natural habitats offer good protection from extremes events, meaning that nature degradation increases business continuity risks.\n\n## 3.3.2 Group policy\n\nTo engage in a transformative change, clear and measurable international targets must be set, counterparts to both the 1.5-2\u00b0C increase climate limit and its associated carbon budget. Schneider Electric supports the creation of ambitious biodiversity targets during the COP15 for Biodiversity. Only together, businesses, finance and governments will be able to drive global systemic and transformative change, unlocking new opportunities and allowing everyone to live sustainably on a healthy planet.\n\nTo drive change, companies need quantitative metrics to estimate, monitor, and pilot the impacts of their activities on biodiversity loss or demonstrate their contribution to biodiversity restoration. Creating aggregated and standardized biodiversity metrics and protocols is a much-needed step to ensure nature is truly placed at the heart of business strategy.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric was the first company to publish the end-to-end biodiversity footprint of its activities, using the new 'Global Biodiversity Score' (GBS) tool developed by CDC Biodiversit\u00e9.\n\nWith the backup of a quantified footprint, Schneider Electric commits to achieve No net Biodiversity Loss in its direct operations (scope 1) by 2030.\n\nBy sharing its experience with other companies and choosing to publish results transparently, the Group aims to demonstrate that biodiversity footprints are a key first step to help companies define relevant and impactful biodiversity strategies, across their entire value chain.\n\nSchneider Electric calls for all companies to fast-track the adoption of ambitious biodiversity strategies, leveraging best practices from climate Science-Based Targets. In a joint effort with Marc Abadie, Chairman of CDC Biodiversit\u00e9 and Eva Zabey, CEO of Business for Nature, Schneider Electric invites all companies to 'Raise corporate biodiversity ambition & aim at no net loss'.\n\nRaise corporate biodiversity ambition & aim at no net loss\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.3.3 Due Diligence and results\n\nThe GBS gives detailed and modular results which can be split by input line (for example, by raw materials such as metal, plastic, or timber); by pressures on biodiversity (such as land use, climate change, fragmentation, encroachment); or it can be presented by scopes (in MSA.km\u00b2) like a carbon footprint. The biodiversity footprint results are expressed in MSA.km\u00b2, a metric that has all the ingredients it needs to become the international standard: synthetic, easy to understand, and widely applicable.\n\nAssessing biodiversity footprint, the occasion to accelerate corporate biodiversity strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe end-to-end assessment allowed Schneider Electric to identify hotspots around which is most effective to develop biodiversity strategy and actions.",

        "page_content": "The bar chart below illustrates Schneider Electric's dynamic terrestrial impact, with detail by pressure. The pie chart highlights the weight of greenhouse gas emissions which represents almost 70% of Schneider Electric's pressure on biodiversity. Land use accounts for almost 30% of cradle to gate's impacts.\n\n## Schneider Electric's biodiversity industrial footprint (in MSA.km\u00b2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cradle to gate terrestrial dynamic pressures on biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change is one of the major pressures on biodiversity globally and is the first of the Group's biodiversity impact. Therefore, the Group's Climate Pledge takes a renewed importance under the biodiversity light as it will have a significant impact on reducing Schneider Electric's pressure on biodiversity. The Group has identified 3 main levers of actions that will be addressed through specific actions:\n\n- 1. The Group's most important pressure on biodiversity is climate change. Given the very significant impact of its products in their use phase, it is important to underline the relevance of Schneider's solutions and technologies to support biodiversity preservation. In fact, EcoStruxure technologies leverage digital to conserve energy, water and resources, reduce climate change pressure, optimize land usage and build transparency, traceability and circularity in value chains. Its solutions:\n- \u00b7 Help customers reduce their own CO 2 emissions: 800 million tons CO 2 from 2018 to 2025;\n- \u00b7 Enable traceability and circularity in value chains, with digital monitoring of resources;\n\n- \u00b7 Foster new circular economy models, with predictive analytics and optimization of assets;\n- \u00b7 Optimize space usage with Building Management Systems;\n- \u00b7 Reduce water leaks and optimize water networks thanks to water management systems;\n- \u00b7 Design intelligent building management solutions to reduce consumption and for example to allow the automatic extinction of nighttime light pollution;\n- \u00b7 And also contribute to the access to electricity of 50 million people who are deprived of it and thus reduce their pressure on local biodiversity.\n- 2. The second largest share of the Group's biodiversity footprint lies in the upstream supply chain, mainly due to GHG emissions and land use (this latter, due to wood and metal sourcing). The Group aspires to engage and transform the value chain and to source more biodiversity-friendly resources, which will require innovations both in terms of supply chain traceability and product design. By 2025, Schneider ambitions to join hands with suppliers to:\n- \u00b7 Increase green material content in products with a first step at 50%;\n- \u00b7 Phase out single-use plastics in packaging and use recycled cardboard;\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from top 1000 suppliers' operations by 50%;\n- \u00b7 Avoid the consumption of 420,000 tons of primary resources, through 'end-of-use' offers.\n\nFurthermore, the need for increased traceability is clearly one of the central issues to solve to engage in a more virtuous procurement practice. Schneider Electric calls for the creation of raw material traceability and certification schemes to provide information all along the value chain.\n\n- 3. Schneider Electric is engaged to act locally to preserve and restore biodiversity, joining forces with other stakeholders through coalitions and partnerships. Schneider Electric and its Foundation also support NGOs that raises the awareness of the general public on nature protection (Global Footprint Network, WWF, etc.) and act for nature restoration with partnerships such as Livelihoods. By 2025, Schneider Electric will further accelerate its local engagements:\n- \u00b7 100% of sites will define local biodiversity conservation and restoration programs\n- \u00b7 100% of sites located in water-stressed areas will have a water conservation action plan\n- \u00b7 200 sites will achieve the 'Waste-to-Resource' label\n\nTogether, the fight against biodiversity loss can be accelerated. In its journey, Schneider Electric will continue to leverage its partnerships with external organizations such as CDC Biodiversit\u00e9, Livelihoods funds, or many of the VolunteerIn initiatives.",

For instance, the release of hazardous substances can be harmful for fauna, flora, and human health, as well as disrupt continuity of operations and tarnish reputation.\n\n'Resource and energy efficiency', Schneider Electric's mantra, delivers not only financial savings, but also limits the Group's exposure to commodity-price volatility and shortage risks. The risk extends to the reliability of the energy on which a facility relies to maintain production. CO 2 emissions pose a threat environmentally and are subject to additional costs as carbon taxes become implemented. Facilities and industrial assets themselves are also at risk of acute and chronic climate events which can disrupt the supply chain and endanger lives.\n\n## 3.4.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric continuously works towards a greener supply chain to protect the environment, decouple its activity from the consumption of natural resources, and innovate to build a more circular supply chain. These ambitions are embedded in the Group's supply chain strategy, namely TSC4.0 (Tailored Sustainable Connected supply chain 4.0) from 2018 to 2020, and STRIVE (Sustainable, Trusted, Resilient, Intelligent, Velocity & Efficiency) starting 2021. Flagship programs include delivering energy efficiency with the EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions, powering facilities with renewable energy, minimizing landfill waste through the Towards Zero Waste to Landfill program, sustainably sourcing packaging, and reducing CO 2 emissions generated by transportation. The Group also partners with its suppliers to extend its environmental ambitions to its upstream supply chain. These ambitions are embedded in the Group's Principles of Responsibility and the Group's supply chain strategy.\n\nBy using lean and clean eco-efficient operations, Schneider Electric can outperform competitors and avoid numerous risks. Schneider Electric believes environmental performance is a powerful tool to innovate towards a more efficient and resilient supply chain and generate bottom-line savings. By using its own EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture to achieve this ambition, the Group also showcases carbon efficient architectures to its customers.\n\n## Schneider Electric 2020 sustainable supply chain ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClean and safe facilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon light and digital\n\nResource efficient and circular\n\n- 0 serious and fatal accidents\n\n100% of applicable sites certified with ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and ISO 45001\n\n80% of electricity comes from renewable sources\n\n100% of sites deliver energy savings, leveraging EcoStruxure \u2122 Power and EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor\n\nSchneider Electric has issued two global policies that drive ecoefficiency performance, the Environment Policy and the Energy Policy.\n\n95%\n\nwaste recovery ratio\n\n200 sites on the way towards zero waste to landfill\n\n100% of regions with circular supply chain innovations\n\nRegarding eco-efficient manufacturing, it is the Group's goal to:\n\n- \u00b7 Protect the environment, prevent pollution, and limit emissions;\n- \u00b7 Continuously improve the environmental management system and meet compliance obligations;\n\n\u00b7\n\nDecouple the supply chain from natural resource consumption;\n\n- \u00b7 Invent circular business models and supply chain loops;\n- \u00b7 Embed environment in its strategy and governance;\n- \u00b7 Extend environmental ambitions to suppliers and partners;\n- \u00b7 Spread a culture of environmental excellence in the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Environmental regulatory compliance, environmental management systems, and continuous improvement are the foundation of the Group's environmental risk management and prevention program for current, former, and prospective operations.\n\nOn this topic, a number of initiatives are in place, and major ones which were again executed in 2020 can be highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7 The Integrated Management System (IMS) covers the Group's plants, distribution centers, and large offices and hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 9001, and OSHAS 18000/ISO 45001 compliance management systems. Each site is audited periodically, either externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally. Such a program is a key pillar towards robust environmental governance;\n- \u00b7 The CLEARR program (Company-wide Look at Environmental Assessment and Risk Review) was continued, with additional and updated surveys of select manufacturing sites that focused on historical and current potential environmental risks;\n\n30\n\nzero CO 2 sites in 2020\n\n150 sites in 2025\n\n-29.6%\n\nwater intensity since 2017\n\n-5% target in 2020 vs 2017\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental risks and provisions are reviewed with local and corporate finance and legal functions;\n- \u00b7 As part of mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, thorough environmental due diligence of sites is conducted where chemicals are or have been used. Any environmental risks or liabilities identified are addressed through proper risk management activities;\n- \u00b7 Risks and mitigation actions are presented to the board Audit and Risks Committee;\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric's global risk matrix embeds the biggest environmental risks (on suppliers, products, sites, and customer projects).\n\nHistorical environmental liabilities are managed on a regional level to ensure local expertise, regulatory knowledge, and cultural awareness is applied. Using external consultants, known environmental issues are thoroughly investigated, and if appropriate, remediated or otherwise managed through engineered or institutional controls to reduce potential risks to non-significant levels and in compliance with local regulations.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Schneider Electric's commitments towards environmental excellence\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric uses third-party services to assess each of its key sites' risk profile, in relation to a certain number of external risks such as fires, earthquakes, flooding, and other natural disasters. Through this process and its business continuity planning efforts, Schneider Electric endeavors to gauge related risks and anticipate possible steps which would be required. With around 200 plants globally, the footprint is balanced geographically. Roughly 60 of the Group's plants are located in areas classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. The nature of the Group's manufacturing processes (mainly assembly) allows rebalancing of manufacturing lines in a fairly prompt manner, if needed.\n\nDuring 2020, no new material environmental impacts were identified. Furthermore, no Schneider Electric sites are Sevesoclassified.\n\n## 3.4.3.2 ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification\n\nISO 14001 certification allows Schneider Electric to define and sustain robust environment governance on its sites, fostering continuous improvement to deliver environmental performance. As soon as the ISO 14001 environmental management standard was published in 1996, Schneider Electric decided to certify its sites. The Group certifies all industrial and logistics sites comprised of more than 50 employees within two years of their acquisition or creation, and all large tertiary sites of more than 500 employees. 232 sites are certified ISO 14001 as of the end of 2020, representing approximately 72% of the Group scope based on the share of site surfaces, 76.5% of the Group scope in terms of energy consumption, and over 90% of the Group scope in terms of water consumption, waste generation, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions.\n\nThe Group's environmental reporting scope and targets are based on all ISO 14001 sites. Environment reporting metrics are shown in the table on pages 200 to 203 and include energy consumption, scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions, waste generation, water consumption, and VOC emissions at ISO 14001 sites.\n\nSchneider Electric also leverages ISO 50001 certification to drive energy excellence, focusing on the highest energy-consuming sites. ISO 50001 certification is complementary to ISO 14001 certification and enables us to define and sustain robust energy governance. With the support of this certification, the sites are equipped to understand and reduce their energy footprint. The Group aims to ISO 50001-certify all sites consuming over 5 GWh per year. By the end of 2020, 150 sites were certified ISO 50001.\n\n## 3.4.3.3 Energy Action program: delivering efficiency from the inside out\n\nSchneider Electric leverages the power of its EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture to deliver energy savings and uses its own sites as showcases for customers and business partners.\n\nIn smart factories and distribution centres, the Group implements the three-layer power and building EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture, with connected meters and sensors to monitor energy consumption and quality, edge control power monitoring software to optimize daily operations, and analytics and services to benchmark performance and optimize energy and maintenance. Asset Performance Management also enables us to optimize operations and maintenance, for maximum uptime and longevity. Five of Schneider's smart factories have been designated as 'lighthouses of the fourth industrial revolution' by the World Economic Forum (WEF), in China, France, the US, Indonesia, and Mexico. With its\n\nSmart Factory and Distribution Center (DC) program, the Group has deployed advanced manufacturing technologies to over 80 smart factories and DCs in the past three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn offices, Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions Building and Workplace Advisor enables analytics of BMS data alongside space, utilization, and comfort metrics. These smart solutions enable the Group and site leaders to actively benchmark and develop occupancy and facility management strategies to ensure continuous right sizing of its footprint and site occupation to keep energy consumption and resultant emissions to a minimum, while reducing cost and improving employee experience and comfort.\n\n## Spotlight: Lexington manufacturing facility, Kentucky\n\nIn September 2020, Schneider Electric's Lexington, Kentucky facility earned the distinction of 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) Advanced Lighthouse by the WEF. The Lexington site is the third Schneider Electric factory to receive this honor for successfully adopting 4IR technologies at scale with demonstrated benefits to date. Two additional sites, Showcase-Monterrey, Mexico and Wuhan, China, have also been designated as Developing Lighthouse facilities.\n\nThe more than 60-year old Lexington facility was the first of Schneider Electric's US plants to become a smart factory showcase site. Exemplifying 'brownfield' innovation, it integrates Schneider Electric's IoT-based EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions, providing the latest in digital tools, including augmented reality, remote monitoring, and predictive maintenance, to drive energy efficiency, sustainability, and overall cost savings, while offering increasing agility and resiliency within the operation.\n\nThe Lexington plant continues to drive efficiencies within the operation, setting new benchmarks for smart factories:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and analyzing energy usage has driven energy savings of 3.4% year-on-year, contributing to $6.6 million in savings since 2012;\n- \u00b7 Leveraging AVEVA's Discrete Lean Management software has reduced unplanned machine downtime by nearly 6% through increased visibility into operations; additionally, paperwork has also been eliminated by 90%;\n- \u00b7 Optimizing with EcoStruxure \u2122 Power and Buildings has driven a 26% energy reduction, a 78% CO 2 reduction in conjunction with Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), and a 20% water use reduction.",

        "page_content": "Global, regional, and site energy reporting is delivered with the Resource Advisor software suite. Resource Advisor provides a data visualization and analysis application that aggregates volumes of raw energy data into actionable information. As a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) model, it provides reduced solution costs, increased data storage capacity, and a flexible and mobile energy solution enhanced by Schneider Electric expert services.\n\nThe Group demonstrates its energy efficiency commitment by being a member of EP100 (Energy Productivity 100), a Group climate initiative. The target is to double energy productivity by 2030 against the 2005 baseline, meaning double the economic output from every unit of energy consumed within 25 years. In 2020, the Group achieved 72% energy productivity (against a 2030 target of 100%) compared against the 2005 baseline.\n\nIn general, Schneider Electric sites are low consumers of energy compared with other industries because industrial processes are discrete and assembled. The Schneider Energy Action program uses site energy experts along with Schneider Electric's Energy and Sustainability Services (ESS) team to report and analyze energy consumption, to identify energy savings opportunities, and to deploy actions. Since 2005, Schneider Electric has fixed annual objectives for energy efficiency each year, as part of the Schneider Energy Action program. The Group met or exceeded its energy efficiency goals during the previous three Company programs (2009-2011, 2012-2014, and 2015-2017), by achieving 10%, 13%, and 10%, respectively, totaling over 30% reduction from 2009 to 2017.\n\nThe 2018-2020 Company program aimed to reduce energy consumption by a further 10% over three years compared to 2017. At the end of 2020, this program enabled the following achievements:\n\n- \u00b7 10.3% reduction in energy consumption compared to 2017 (climate and level of production standardized) for the 224 sites with the highest consumption, covering 80% of the total energy consumption published by the Group;\n- \u00b7 About EUR 10 million and 130 million kWh were saved in 2020 compared to 2017 baseline, thanks to the 10.3% energy savings;\n- \u00b7 About EUR 15 million was invested, of which EUR 14.4 million was capital costs and EUR 0.6 million was operating costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.4.3.4 100% renewable electricity by 2030\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric joined RE100 and committed to source 100% of electricity from renewables by 2030, with an intermediary target of 80% by 2020. In 2020, the Group sourced 80% of its electricity from renewable sources, up from a starting point of 2% in 2017. To deliver its target, the Group leverages four complementary tools: green tariffs, renewable certificates, power purchase agreements, and on-site generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis commitment entails many benefits. First and foremost, going green is deeply aligned with the Group's strategy. Schneider Electric wants to be one of the corporate players who shape the future energy landscape, having its own sites producing and consuming renewable electricity. Second, renewable sourcing is an important pillar to drastically cut CO 2 emissions from the Group's operations, following a 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory in line with Science-Based Targets. Third, because it makes good business sense. In a lot of cases, renewable supply enables savings on electricity costs. It is also a way of diversifying energy supply risks and reduces exposure to the volatility of market prices. Also, in some developing countries, microgrid technologies coupled with renewables can enable the securing of power supply and reduce downtime risks. Fourth, because the Group wants to demonstrate the value add of its own technologies and solutions, by showcasing EcoStruxure \u2122 Microgrid IoT architecture on its own sites. Sites leverage Schneider Electric's connected inverters, Molded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCB), and transformers to connect on-site solar panels to the grid and use the energy and microgrid software to manage energy production and consumption. Schneider Electric also leverages the expertise of ESS consulting teams to deliver this transformation.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric was recognized as the 2020 Clean Energy Trailblazer by The Climate Group's RE100. This is the first year of the RE100 Leadership Awards, which recognizes companies going above-and-beyond to accelerate a clean energy future. Schneider Electric was awarded the honor based on its wide-ranging commitments, including the Company's own CO 2 reduction targets, CO 2 savings delivered by EcoStruxure \u2122 technologies to customers, clean energy advisory services, and Access to Energy program, providing energy access in underserved communities globally.\n\nSchneider Electric's factory for transformers and medium and low voltage switch gear in Vadodara India generates approximately 1 GWH per year of onsite solar electricity\n\n<!-- image -->",

Schneider Electric's commitments towards environmental excellence\n\n## 3.4.3.5 Towards 100% electric vehicles in the corporate car fleet\n\nAs part of Schneider Electric's climate strategy, we investigate opportunities to improve accessibility of sites, with commuting shuttles, secure bicycle storage, personal lockers and changing areas, and pedestrian-friendly access paths connecting to local routes. Schneider Electric also promotes flexible working to avoid thousands of unnecessary or avoidable trips generating travel-led emissions by enabling employees to connect remotely, to work from home and at/from customer sites.\n\nAt the end of 2019, Schneider accelerated its efforts to cut CO 2 emissions from transport with the commitment to switch to 100% electric cars by 2030. By 2025, we aim to switch 1/3rd of the Company car fleet. The Group demonstrates this commitment by being a member of EV100, a global initiative bringing together forward-looking companies committed to accelerating the transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and making electric transport the new normal by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.4.3.6 Reduction of SF 6 emissions\n\nAll Schneider Electric manufacturing plants and R&D laboratories handling SF 6 gas in their processes are managing the reduction of SF 6 emissions during the different phases of their activities. Notably, the seal testing processes of the products are mainly done with helium instead of SF 6 . This method ensures that no emissions are coming from non-compliant enclosures during the production time.\n\nThe SF 6 leakage rate has been systematically decreasing. It globally fell from 4% in 2008 to 0.14% by the end of 2020. This SF 6 leakage reduction enabled savings of 7,754 tons of CO 2 equivalent in 2020 versus 2017. A worldwide community of SF 6 experts are sharing best practices for processes, including procedures, equipment, and training. In 2019 and 2020, Schneider Electric implemented advanced Emissions Monitoring Systems in five manufacturing sites in Spain, France, China, and Turkey. This technology allows for continuous measurement of SF 6 concentration in enclosures around devices and piping network. In case of deviations, alarm notification is automatically sent to maintenance teams.\n\n## SSI#1: 80% renewable electricity\n\nIn just three years, the renewable commitment greatly transformed our electricity sourcing strategy. The Group has accelerated the installation of onsite solar panels, coupled with EcoStruxure \u2122 metering and power architectures. In 2020, over 40 sites are equipped with onsite solar capacities.\n\n% renewable electricity in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n80%\n\nThanks to this global activity and to the commissioning of efficient equipment, Schneider Electric has exceeded the 0.25% target set for 2020.\n\nBy 2025, Schneider Electric intends to phase out SF 6 from its products, offering a comprehensive portfolio of SF 6 -free offers. In 2019, the Group launched a breakthrough innovation, with new SF 6 -free medium voltage switchgear technology. 2020 saw multiple projects running in customer installations around the world. In the coming years, Schneider Electric will continue to deploy new solutions to monitor and reduce SF 6 leaks in its processes, while innovating with breakthrough SF 6 -free technologies.\n\n## SF 6 leaks reduction trend\n\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.4.3.7 CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nSchneider Electric utilizes a robust transport network to connect its factories and distribution centers, and to deliver to its customers. The related CO 2 emissions are part of the scope 3 emissions of the Group's carbon footprint as this activity is performed by transport suppliers. From 2015 to 2017, CO 2 emissions intensity from transportation was reduced by 10%.\n\nThe 2018-2020 Company program aims to further reduce CO 2 intensity in transportation by 10% in 2020 compared to 2017. By the end of 2020, performance compared to 2017 is a decrease of 8.4% of transport-related CO 2 emission.\n\nCO 2 emissions from air and sea transport decreased by 34% versus the 2017 baseline. Schneider Electric reaped the benefits of a better ocean container loading factor of 65% in 2020 versus 63.4% in 2017. More significantly, reductions in air freight and subsequent shift to ocean over the same period made a significant contribution to CO 2 reductions. Regarding domestic freight in 2020, CO 2 emissions from road and air domestic modes increased by 31%.\n\nTo continually improve CO 2 emissions performance and the quality of the reporting, Schneider Electric has been co-innovating with a third-party provider to standardize CO 2 emissions reporting, with worldwide coverage of all transport modes. This requires transport providers to supply accurate reporting each month on the freight carried for Schneider Electric.

        "page_content": "The collaborative work to reduce CO 2 emissions with the Group's forwarders will continue, mainly by optimization of the transport footprint and piloting advanced low carbon transportation technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles. By 2025, Schneider Electric aims to reduce CO 2 intensity of transportation by 3% every year, meaning 15% over 5 years.\n\nSome evidence of Schneider initiatives to mitigate the impact of transport CO 2 emissions are:\n\n- \u00b7 25% less air and express freight, the highest CO 2 emissions modes of transportation, used in 2020 compared to 2019. Lower emissions modes of transportation were utilized - with this volume shifting to ocean and other multi-modal alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of reusable packaging with a closed-loop freight flow between factories, enabling to sharply improve the loading factor of trucks\n- \u00b7 Multi-modal (rail and truck) transportation utilized from France to China as well as China to France to replace air travel;\n\n## SSI#2: 10% CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nAs part of its efforts to reduce the CO 2 intensity of transportation, Schneider Electric is piloting low carbon transportation technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles. For instance, in the East Coast of the USA, electric terminal trucks are used by a final mile transport partner to move containers between the Distribution Center and the Port's Terminal.\n\n% CO 2 efficiency in 2020 vs 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.4%\n\n## 3.4.3.8 Water consumption\n\nDue to the nature of most of its industrial processes (manual and automatic assembly), water consumption is not generally a critical resource for Schneider Electric, and the Group has a minimal impact on water quality. The topic was considered not very material by both internal and external stakeholders during the sustainability materiality analysis. In 2020, water management and performance information was disclosed in the CDP Water program, and Schneider Electric was awarded an A- rating.\n\nSchneider Electric's ambition is to reduce water intensity (in m 3 of water consumption per euro of turnover) by 35% in 2025 versus 2017, with a focus on sites with high water consumption and within severely water-stressed areas. In 2020, water consumption intensity was 76 m 3 per million Euro of revenue, an evolution of -29.6% against the 2017 baseline.\n\nThe Group provides a breakdown of water consumption per source, with details on water consumed from the public network, groundwater, surface water (lakes, rivers, etc.), and other sources of water (rain, recycled water, etc.). At Group level, water is primarily used for cooling and sanitary purposes and, in a few select sites, for processes such as surface treatment. Water drawn for the sole purpose of cooling and immediately released without alteration is also monitored separately. For industrial water use, water discharge is subject to appropriate treatments to reduce pollutant potential and subject to a monitoring plan.\n\n## 3.4.3.9 Conditions of use and release into the soil\n\nSchneider Electric sites are mainly located in urban or industrial areas. None of the Group's businesses involve extraction or land farming. In 2020, Schneider Electric manufacturing sites conducted their annual review of pollution risks as part of ISO 14001 monitoring. At our sites, no significant spills or discharges were reported in 2020 with known harmful impacts on soil pollution.\n\nHazardous materials are stored, handled and used in compliance with regulations and with appropriate pollution protection mechanisms. As part of the Towards Zero Waste to Landfill program, additional focus was brought on hazardous waste, with efforts to eliminate, substitute or improve treatment (see section 3.5 'Circular economy', pages 136 to 139).\n\n## 3.4.3.10 Discharge into the water and air\n\nBecause Schneider Electric is mainly an assembler, its discharge into the air and water is very limited. Schneider Electric manufacturing sites are carefully monitored, as part of ISO 14001 certification. Discharges are tracked locally as required by current legislation. At our sites, no significant spills or discharges were reported in 2020 with known harmful impacts on water or air pollution.\n\nEmissions of NOx and SOx and particles into the air are monitored at the site level in accordance with applicable legal requirements; monitoring of these emissions is verified via ISO 14001 audits. These emissions are not consolidated at Group level.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to preventing adverse health and environmental impacts from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, and for this, works to reduce VOC emissions from industrial activities by 10% every three years. VOC emissions are primarily linked to production. VOC emissions decreased from 29kg/Million EUR in 2017 to 18kg/Million Eur in 2020 (-39%). The Group engages with each of its industrial sites that contribute the most to VOC emissions, and that together concentrate over 80% of the Group's VOC emissions, in a Pareto law approach. For these sites, environment, health and safety, and industrialization teams join hands and actively collaborate to ensure conditions of use are strictly adhered to and health and environmental risks are known and mitigated. These top VOC-emitting sites also investigate opportunities to reduce and phase-out concerned chemicals from industrial processes wherever possible.\n\nFinally, CFC and HCFC emissions are monitored locally, in accordance with applicable regulations. These emissions are mainly due to the operation of air conditioning systems and are not directly linked to Schneider Electric industrial activities. These emissions are not consolidated at Group level.\n\n## 3.4.3.11 Noise, odors and light\n\nAll Schneider Electric sites comply with local regulations on noise and odor. Given the nature of its activities and distribution model, Schneider Electric does not have any light pollution externality.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5 Circular economy\n\n## 3.5.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nThe risks that Schneider Electric sees are around the perception of 'one size fits all' for circularity, the temptation to see it through a waste or recycling lens and the focus on developing the related guidelines, governance and standards based on this perception.\n\n- \u00b7 Product durability versus shorter-term waste loops: all resources are not equal in their thermal, mechanical, or electromagnetic profiles. For the industrial sector, the biggest impact of the circular economy will come from the promotion of reparability, upgradability, 'retrofitability', extension of lifespan, and of related 'product second- and third-life services'. Schneider Electric's products are highly technical in nature with a long lifespan and are highly unlikely to end up as ocean plastic waste, yet a risk that the emerging regulations may be too 'resource-/waste-centric' is seen. To meet quality and safety expectations, and adhere to stringent electric and electronic equipment standards, recycled materials are sometimes not available in either quantity and/or quality. The Group actively advocates sector-specific approaches.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the safety of people and assets through qualified and certified services: while promoting services to extend the products' life, Schneider Electric grows the ranks of certified experts on its products (through thousands of Field Services Representatives). Leveraging the circular economy, there is a fantastic opportunity to enable more repair, retrofit, and recycling services, provided concerned product categories are adequately maintained and serviced by qualified and certified experts.\n\nThere are opportunities to leverage the circular economies, both externally with customers and internally in operations. Schneider Electric's value propositions have long delivered resource efficiency, allowing customers to 'do more with less'.\n\nSchneider Electric's deeply ingrained belief in the circular economy helps create a win-win-win-win ecosystem: good for the planet, good for customers (lower Total Cost of Ownership, lifespan of assets, etc.), good for the Company as a business (customer intimacy, stickiness, etc.), and good for its people (meaningful jobs, pride to take part in saving resources and energy, etc.).\n\n## 3.5.2 Group policy\n\nFor Schneider Electric, circular economy is an all-encompassing strategic transformation, rather than an isolated initiative (such as incorporating recycled materials in some products). It is core to the lasting success and touches everything Schneider Electric does, detailed under three main channels:\n\n- \u00b7 Circular business models and value propositions for customers: through circular capabilities such as local models of reuse, retrofit, repair, refurbish, and take-back, and by unleashing the potential of IoT, connecting and digitizing products (predictive maintenance, performance optimization, leasing, pay-per-use, performance contracting);\n- \u00b7 Circular resources and product development: starting at the product design phase to minimize resource usage and maximize reuse, recycled resources, and recyclability;\n- \u00b7 Circular supply chain: zero-waste and circular excellence in operations and sites with strict targets on waste reduction, reuse, and recovery.\n\nSchneider Electric has been part of task forces on circular economy, playing leadership roles in multi-stakeholder dialogues. For example, the Group is active in France's Circular Economy Roadmap and engaged in China with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) on circular strategy, leading AFEP, Gim\u00e9lec, FIEEC, IGNES, and ORGALIM discussions for its sector on circular economy, publishing articles and speaking at conferences (Greenbiz, Gartner, WEF, SCM World, peer-to-peer, EthicalCorp, and WindEurope, among others).\n\n## 3.5.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 3.5.3.1 Circular business models and value propositions\n\nMost of Schneider Electric's new products are digital, connectable, ensure full product life cycle management and predictive maintenance, and guarantee optimum performance, enabling the Group to move towards customer-intimate models like subscription, performance contracting, and leasing.\n\nThe first focus, before considering end-of-life, is to prolong the lifespan of products. These solutions, using up to 60% less materials than using entirely new equipment, enable pull-through and constant payback, increased customer stickiness, and longterm relationships.\n\n## SSI#8: 120,000 metric tons of avoided primary resource consumption through ECOFIT \u2122 , recycling and take-back programs\n\nExample of a Circular Economy winning offer: In a customer project highlighting the combination of business and sustainability benefits, Schneider Electric helped Arcelor Mittal prolong the lifespan of its equipment thanks to EcoStruxure and connectivity, give a second life by refurbishing MV Switchgears and Dry-type transformers and responsibly recycle oil transformers - thus keeping products and components in use at their highest possible utility, in a true circular economy approach.

Currently available for the French market, it is planned to be deployed more extensively in the near future.\n\n## 3.5.3.2 Circular resources and product development\n\nMandatory criteria for circularity have been embedded in the EcoDesign Way \u2122 principle and all new offers are designed with these criteria in mind. The Group also considers itself best-in-class in providing product circularity information digitally via the MySE App and on the website (end of life instructions are available for more than 100,000 products).\n\nSchneider Electric is also one of the few companies in the industrial\n\nsector to be part of the European Plastics Pact as well as recycled plastics commitment in the French Circular Economy Roadmap. The Group has committed to doubling the quantity of recycled plastics in its products by 2025. In 2020, the Group was at 22% of the 2025 target. Various actions are underway such as updating an internal repository of circular materials examples and important proof-of-concepts with suppliers and partners.\n\n## 3.5.3.3 Circular supply chain\n\nThe Group has an obsession for zero-waste in its operations. The supply chain supports the other channels as well as focusing on efficient production, distribution, and packaging in operations.\n\nSchneider Electric also strives to purchase circular resources for its supply chain. As of end 2020, 99% of its transport packing (cardboards and pallets) is from recycled or certified sources.\n\n## SSI#7: 100% cardboard and pallets for transport packing from recycled or certified sources\n\nClear communication with regional suppliers and real-time adaptation of part numbers in internal Schneider Electric systems are some underlying critical actions to achieve this result. Studies are also being launched to increase the life cycle of pallets, hence reducing the need to purchase additional ones.\n\n% from recycled or certified sources in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99%\n\nWith these three complementary channels (3.5.3.1, 3.5.3.2, 3.5.3.3), the Group is able to have an ecosystem focus by aligning with its customers' expectations all the way to embarking its suppliers.\n\nEmployee engagement and a circularity mindset:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric was among the first companies to codevelop a circular economy e-learning with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Since 2016, more than 4,000 employees have attended this training;\n- \u00b7 Release of version 2.0 of Circular Materials Playbook - an internal repository of best practices, live examples, and inspirations for recycled materials used in products (focusing on plastics) and packaging;\n- \u00b7 In its supply chain (84,000 employees), circular resource management is an integral part of the Schneider Performance System maturity assessment, from reuse maximization to zero landfilling.\n\nExternal participation, co-development, and knowledge sharing:\n\nThe Group has taken important strides in partnering and codeveloping circular economy pilots with customers and suppliers, as below:\n\n- \u00b7 Winning the Philips Supplier Innovation event with a value proposal of greater efficiency through new generation technology and sustainable business models (ongoing collaboration);\n- \u00b7 Partnering with BASF, the largest chemical producer in the world, to develop a new product prototype using recycled plastics.\n\nSchneider Electric continues to be a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and is involved in various co-projects to develop partnerships and solutions for the challenges faced in further implementing the circular economy in business operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Member\n\nSome white papers and partnerships for circular economy to which Schneider Electric contributed:\n\n- \u00b7 Enabling a Circular Economy for chemicals with a mass balance approach;\n- \u00b7 Remanufacturing: Designing new products for many lives;\n- \u00b7 Making manufacturing sustainable by design;\n- \u00b7 The need for sector-specific circularity;\n- \u00b7 Partnership with Accenture for the Circulars Accelerators program.\n\n## Recognitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Being the winner of The Circulars award in 2019, Schneider Electric was invited as a panelist at WEF, Davos 2020 for the launch of the Circular Economy Handbook.

Schneider Electric's commitments towards environmental excellence\n\n## 3.5.3.4 Waste as Worth program: Towards Zero Waste to Landfill sites\n\nBecause waste is a major source of pollution but also a potential source of raw materials, waste management is a priority of the circular economy strategy. At Schneider Electric, waste is considered as a resource. The Waste as Worth program includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The goal of achieving 200 industrial sites sending Towards Zero Waste to Landfill (1) by 2020. Progress on this target is published quarterly in the Schneider Sustainability Impact and the Group is proud to mention that 206 sites received this label by the end of 2020;\n- \u00b7 The implementation of specific actions to reduce and reuse materials, focusing notably on thermoplastic, metal, and packaging;\n- \u00b7 The maximization of value recovery from metal waste.\n\nIn order to deliver Schneider Electric's commitments, a waste pyramid has been defined as part of the Waste as Worth program. Priority is put on reducing waste volume, through better product and industrial process design. Waste is then reused in the Group own industrial processes when possible or recycled through third parties. Finally, waste is recovered through energy conversion. The Waste as Worth program aims at drastically reducing waste left over from this virtuous circle and sent to landfill or burnt without energy recovery.\n\n## SSI#6: 200 sites labelled Towards Zero Waste to Landfill\n\nSchneider Electric is driven to maximize the value of its resources, considering waste as a resource and ensuring its waste stays within a circular system. Beyond avoiding landfill and looking at traditional recycling solutions, Schneider Electric strives to move up the waste hierarchy and find Reduce and Reuse solutions for its resources. This inspired the circular innovation initiative in 2019 and continuing into 2020. In addition to delivering tremendous environmental benefits and strengthening relationships within the supply chain, the program has delivered over 1M\u20ac in savings across hundreds of projects, including reusing incoming pallets and cardboard for outgoing shipments and creating an internal website for the exchange of industrial and office equipment between sites to avoid scrapping.\n\nSites towards zero waste to landfill in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Waste Pyramid\n\nTowards zero waste to landfill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric generated around 125,000 tons of waste in 2020, most of it being solid waste. Continuous improvement plans have been deployed to manage this waste, in line with the ISO 14001 certification. In 2020, the Group recovered 96.3% of total waste reported (recovery ratio includes material and energy recovery). This recovery ratio has increased from 81% to 96.3% since 2009, thanks to site by site waste management action plans.\n\nThe Group also focuses on generating value from waste, with a focus on improving waste segregation. This enables the Group to ensure that waste recycling potential is maximized, both in terms of quantity and quality of recycled material. In 2020, the Group notably recovered 99.99% of reported metal waste.\n\nFinally, Schneider Electric is committed to ensuring the potential adverse impacts of hazardous waste on environment and health are mitigated. Two main levers are investigated as part of the Waste as Worth program: first, all sites generating hazardous waste ensure visibility of handling and end-of-life treatment paths and seek to add value to waste as much as possible (through material or energy recovery) while neutralizing its hazardous nature. Second, top hazardous waste generating sites work to reduce the volumes of waste generated in the first place, notably by implementing 'Best Available Techniques' (BAT) in their industrial processes. Such BAT processes come along with superior performances from a resource efficiency perspective, and/or chemical substances use, and/or emission reductions. By 2025, the ambition is to reduce hazardous waste intensity by 30% against the 2017 baseline.\n\nIn 2020, hazardous waste generation intensity was 0.3 tons/million EUR of revenue, an evolution of -27% versus 2017.\n\n206",

        "page_content": "Starting in 2021, the ambitious Towards Zero Waste to Landfill (TZWL) program will evolve further into the Waste to Resource program. This new program will focus more heavily on better circular solutions (reduce, reuse) while relying less on traditional landfill diversion solutions (such as recycling and waste to energy). The new program will require diverting 99% of all non-hazardous waste from the landfill while placing a limit on the amount of allowable waste to energy usage, and encouraging reduction and reuse activities. 100% of Hazardous waste will still need to be handled according to Schneider Electric expectations, just as in the TZWL program. Schneider targets to have 200 sites meeting this new ambitious requirement by 2025.\n\n## 3.5.3.5 Green IT (Information Technology)\n\nConscious of the growing environmental footprint of IT, as well as the social impact linked to minerals resources, Schneider Digital has launched a Green IT initiative in order to measure and optimize the environmental footprint of Schneider Electric's information systems.\n\nThis footprint was measured using the Club Green IT framework. In 2018, Schneider Electric participated in the 'WeGreenIT' study conducted under the patronage of World Wide Fund for nature (WWF) by Club Green IT, following a generalized LCA screening methodology. WeGreenIT results show that the yearly resource footprint of IT per end user is 800 kg of CO 2 , 5,740 kWh of primary energy, 14,000 liters of water, and 3 kg of electronic waste, placing Schneider Electric in the average of the 18 participating companies representing 880,000 end users.\n\nAn action plan has been engaged to optimize this environmental footprint on the different components of IT.\n\nFor end user equipment, the Group has updated its IT Asset Management (ITAM) Policy and standards with a strong focus on standardization, sustainability, and circular economy enablement. This notably focusses on sustainable hardware decommissioning through proper ITAM - Asset Recovery approach. Leasing services (mainly in Europe and North America) and Employees' PC Purchase programs (mainly in Asia Pacific and China) enable second life for retired PCs. Responsible Recycling (R2) compliant vendors are prioritized for Schneider Electric IT Asset Recovery Services. Refurbishing laptops to give them a second life has extended their life cycle by one to two years, and the amortization of manufacturing CO 2 emissions can be cut by up to 50%.\n\nCarbon footprint reduction is also an integrated part of requirements for IT vendor selection processes. Consequently, new PCs are between 15% (desktops) and 30% (laptops) more energy efficient than the corresponding old replaced equipment at the end of its life cycle. By holding the Group's IT vendors to sustainability requirements, the annual CO 2 emissions have been reduced by 1,000 tCO 2 and annual energy consumption by 100 MWh.\n\nIn 2021, the Group aims to implement a framework to track sustainability KPIs when it comes to IT infrastructure, similarly to the existing program with IT assets. For instance, in North America, the release of the Canon Printing dashboard allows site leaders to review local usage and change printing habits. The dashboard tracks cost savings and environmental savings on CO 2 , trees, and gallons of water.\n\nOptimization of the Group data center footprint is done using two levers: the rationalization of on-premise servers and the move to cloud. In 2020, the journey to the cloud has been accelerated, partnering with providers who have made commitments to sustainability and carbon neutrality. With this effort, approximately 38% of the Group overall IT footprint has been migrated to the cloud in 2020 with the goal to increase this to 60% by the end of 2021.\n\nThe hosting of the Schneider Electric Infrastructure for Europe & Global applications is provided by IBM for both its Montpellier and Grabels data centers. Both locations are ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certified for the environmental management of IT. Those two IBM datacenter sites hosting Schneider Electric workloads, were awarded by the European Commission Participant status in the EU Code of Conduct (CoC) for Energy Efficiency in Data Center program.\n\nThanks to the rationalization of the Group's application landscape, 480 applications have been decommissioned in 2020, bringing the total to over 3,500 since 2017. This allows Schneider Electric to reduce datacenter footprints as those applications are replaced by applications running on more efficient infrastructures.\n\nRegarding the network footprint, as the move to cloud has an effect on network energy consumption itself, Schneider Electric has launched different initiatives to optimize application hosting between edge or cloud. A standard hybrid architecture, allowing to host locally on virtual machines some network intensive applications while having a cloud DRP with the best service level has been defined using the Schneider 'smart bunker' solution. In addition, Local Area Network (LAN) LIFI capability have been tested functionally. LIFI is an emerging technology using LED as an access point with potential dramatic energy savings compared to WIFI, and an added health benefit as no radio waves are emitted.\n\nFinally, different collaboration solutions are being implemented for messaging, web audio, and video conference. This roadmap has been expedited by COVID-19. Innovative digital solutions allowing virtual teams to work in an agile way were implemented in 2020 including remote collaborative brainstorming tools, electronic whiteboard, and telepresence robot. Last year, international travel were replaced with digital interaction including hosting large scale internal and external events virtually. New collaboration solutions aiming at reducing paper and email exchanges and further leveraging cloud data storage are deployed, and a new communication solution, cloud based, for messaging, web audio, and video conference has been implemented.\n\nAs part of the Group's IT Disaster Recovery program, a significant investment was made in 2020 in modernizing the IT infrastructure. Over 2,000 of Schneider Electric's own EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions were deployed throughout its facilities to reduce the energy and CO 2 footprint of the IT equipment, with the rollout of EcoStruxure \u2122 Power Monitoring Expert, Building Operation, and Building Advisor already underway.",

Initially, efforts were focused on compliance, then on transparency. Over the last few years, additional efforts have been made to develop a more customer-centric program, helping Schneider Electric offers to differentiate themselves from the competition.\n\n## 13 years of product stewardship with Green Premium \u2122\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PEP EoLI RoHS REACH\n\n## 2008\n\nGreen Premium ecolabel introduced to provide transparent information on regulated substances and to share the environmental information of Schneider products\n\n## RoHS REACH\n\n## EcoDesign Way \u2122\n\n2007 European Union\n\nadopts REACH\n\n## 3.6.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nThe main risks Schneider Electric identifies for product stewardship come from the increasing complexity of the environmental pressures worldwide from markets and regulations. This complexity is directly linked to a 'regionalization' of these environmental pressures (California Prop 65 and China RoHS are some examples of regulations being more regionalized) while global resources are limited. Moreover, the multiplication of distribution channels, especially e-commerce, could amplify the risk of non-compliance due to the regionalization of environmental pressures.\n\nWith increasingly stringent environmental regulations year after year, there is a risk for Schneider Electric to have key materials and substances that could be utilized to deliver high performance to be regulated themselves. This would limit the innovation potential of products that would fall within the regulation radar with possible restrictions.\n\nBy its customers' side, Schneider Electric has observed a multiplication of external repositories to leverage product environmental performance, some being specific to a single customer. As such, there is a risk for Schneider Electric products not to be systematically referenced externally.\n\nProducts are at the very end of a customer journey. As such, they crystalize a lot of expectations for customers and all Schneider Electric stakeholders. Schneider Electric has identified a risk to face contradictory recommendations due to regulations overlap (e.g. substances restriction versus circularity performance).\n\nTo circumvent the risks stated earlier, Schneider Electric relies on the completeness of the Green Premium \u2122 program, enabling it to cover all relevant product-oriented environmental topics. Relying on the ecoDesign Way \u2122 process and tools is also key to embed environmental performance as soon as possible into the new product development process. This enables Schneider product development teams to innovate while delivering more Green Premium \u2122 products that will differentiate themselves from those of competitors thanks to higher environmental performance.\n\n## 2015\n\nEcoDesign Way \u2122 launched - internal EcoDesign approach embedded in the offer creation process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Updated Green Premium\n\n## 2018\n\nUpgraded Green Premium eco-label to include customer value propositions for services, solutions and products\n\nThe multiplication of environmental regulations requires a lot of information to be shared with the supply chain and updated regularly. Only the best in class suppliers will be able to answer this challenge and it is an opportunity for Schneider Electric to put in place a strong interraction with those suppliers and ensure that future restrictions will be anticipated. (also see section 2.9 'Relations with subcontractors and suppliers', pages 115 to 117).\n\nSchneider Electric is reinforcing a worldwide approach of environmental product stewardship directives fed by a regional and local environmental steward network, and strengthening its influence position towards regulators through Schneider Electric professional associations.\n\nFrom the customers' side, Schneider Electric. is relying on the 'Check a Product' platform, a public website providing all relevant product environmental information. Thanks to 'Check a Product', Schneider Electric is in a good position to be well referenced in external databases such as the future SCIP (Substance of Concern in Products) database or customer's prescription tools.\n\nIn a commitment to go one step further, Schneider Electric is taking the steps necessary to digitize the environmental information of offers. Within a fully digitized environment, Schneider Electric can provide a streamlined and efficient process to be well referenced in external third party databases and in the customer's own prescription tools.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Differentiation (external labels recognition, customer preference)\n\nIn 2020, the main objectives for the Green Premium \u2122 program were to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure compliance with the latest regulations within a difficult context;\n- \u00b7 Develop new 'circular' and 'resource' performance differentiating claims;\n- \u00b7 Prepare the digitization of environmental information, especially toward the SCIP Database for declaration;\n- \u00b7 Expand the environmental value propositions for customers;\n- \u00b7 Prepare the future of product stewardship for the years to come.\n\nOn circular performance, we have embedded into Green Premium \u2122 new circular value propositions such as the 'takeback' claim. For example, customers who have purchased one of the APC Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) have access to complimentary recycling when the battery in the product reaches its end of usable life. In 2020, this service collected around 8,000 tons of batteries globally for recycling.\n\nGreen Premium \u2122 information, including environmental claims and external labels, is digitally available 24/7 for customers in the technical data sheet of the online catalog, in the mySchneider mobile app, and on the 'Check a Product' website.\n\n## 4. Well-being performance\n\nWe help our customers to best protect their people from environmental risks.\n\n## 3.6.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 3.6.3.1 Green Premium\u2122\n\nLaunched in 2018, the updated Green Premium \u2122 program is designed to deliver customer valued sustainable performance around five value propositions:\n\n- \u00b7 A brand promise of compliance and digital transparency, with offers that comply with RoHS and REACH regulations, an environmental disclosure, and a circularity profile;\n- \u00b7 A minimum of two environmental performance claims selected from any of the performance pillars;\n- - Resource\n- - Circular\n- - Well-being\n- \u00b7 Obtaining recognition from an external organization.",

EcoDesign Way \u2122 is fully embedded into Offer Creation Processes (OCP) mandatory deliverables and encompasses all involved functions: Marketing, Quality, Design, Supply Chain, and Project Manager.\n\nThe EcoDesign Way \u2122 scorecard is fully aligned with all Green Premium \u2122 value propositions. Moreover, several initiatives were launched to embed EcoDesign Way \u2122 earlier in the OCP with strong inputs from the Future Offer Manager in order to foster innovation and increase EcoDesign's positive impact.\n\nIn 2020, focus was put on embedding EcoDesign criteria at an early stage of the OCP. For instance, a simplified Life Cycle Assessment tool was deployed to assess the environmental potential of incubated projects. A key objective for the upcoming years is to embed EcoDesign in systems and solutions and better integrate it into agile development methods.\n\n## 3.6.3.3 REACH\n\nThe implementation of the European Court of Justice decision in case C-106/14 (O5A: once an article, always an article) is fully deployed in the compliance tools, and most of Schneider Electric REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) declarations towards its customers are in that format, which is perfectly in line with the entry in force of the ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) SCIP (Substances of Concern In Products) database. The high level of supplier declarations collected allowed Schneider Electric to stop using a worst case approach, instead being able to give more relevant information to the customers, and allowing the Group to better target substitution actions.\n\nIn the frame of the Waste Framework Directive, ECHA was mandated by the EU commission to put in place a SCIP database (database containing information on substances of concern in articles) for 2021.\n\n2020 was dedicated to actively following the development and testing of the SCIP trial versions, giving feedback and constructive remarks to ECHA with the support of the Group's professional associations. The SCIP database has been available since the beginning of November 2020 and Schneider Electric has begun to manually upload relevant data with the objective of covering information on its main products by January 2021, which is the official opening deadline. Schneider Electric is proud to be one of the first companies undertaking this duty. 2021 will be dedicated to automating the upload process thanks to a new compliance tool under development.\n\nAlso, in 2020, several requests from the customers for pushing digitized compliance information in their compliance systems have been answered. This is currently a manual process that will be enhanced in 2021.\n\nSchneider Electric is also very active in the development of data exchange formats on substances through FIEEC and IEC2474, formats that will be crucial for targeting substances of concern to be substituted with safer options.\n\nSchneider Electric also participated in some EU consultations, providing technical and economic information to support regulatory evolutions on chemicals.\n\n## 3.6.3.4 RoHS\n\nIn 2020, no major evolution of the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) directive was planned. The four RoHS phthalates substitution process is almost finished and will be closed by the mid-2021 official deadline for the very few remaining special cases. The Green Premium \u2122 objectives to apply RoHS on a worldwide basis (in all product categories) have been achieved. Main RoHS exemptions concerning lead in some metal alloys and electronic technologies are undergoing a renewal process. Nevertheless, Schneider Electric innovation teams permanently study the alternative solutions available on the market or under development, in order to propose technical solutions to avoid the use of exemptions whenever possible to the design teams.",

As Environmental Disclosure is mandatory to enable Green Premium \u2122 to work, Schneider Electric relies on Product Environmental Profile (PEP) to fulfill this requirement. A PEP is defined as a product-oriented 'summarized' version of a full LCA. It relies on Product Category Rules (PCR) or Product Specific Rules (PSR). At Schneider, there are two types of PEP available:\n\n- \u00b7 Certified - a type III Environmental Declaration in compliance with ISO 14025. The certified PEP is externally reviewed by an accredited verifier and published by a program operator according to the rules provided by this operator (e.g. PEP Ecopassport). In January 2020, 336 certified PEP were published on the PEP Ecopassport association website;\n- \u00b7 Internal - the internal PEP follows the exact same rules as the certified one. However, an internal PEP is reviewed internally and therefore cannot be registered through an independent program operator. A process of accreditation for internal verifiers guarantees the good level of internal PEP verifications (training done by an external consultant). Verifiers check PEPs from other lines of business than their own, thus ensuring independence. Internal PEPs comply with the ISO 14021 selfcompleted-declaration;\n- \u00b7 In 2019, 77.3% of Schneider's product revenue was covered by a PEP, including 33.9% of ISO 14025 type III declarations and 43.4% of ISO 14021 type II self-completed declarations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4.1 Step Up\n\nThe profile of the Company has changed tremendously in the past ten years and the same has happened with its external environment. The new Schneider Electric that has been created is much bigger and well-balanced across geographies and end-markets. It provides a unique portfolio of products, systems, services and software to customers through different go-tomarket channels and consolidating many acquisitions. The Group has identified that this new Company requires a different type of leadership. Schneider has embarked on a People transformation, which is embedded in the Company program called 'Step Up'. Step Up is the People strategy and the common roadmap to transform leadership and culture.\n\nThrough Step Up, the ambition is to create:\n\n- \u00b7 a new Schneider Electric that consistently achieves high growth by innovating for customers and beating the competition;\n- \u00b7 a more engaging environment for employees;\n- \u00b7 an attractive company for talent through an Employee Value Proposition (EVP).\n\nAll of this while delivering a best-in-class digital experience to employees, supported by simple and agile processes.\n\n## 4.1.1 Schneider Electric's People Vision and Our Core Values\n\nGreat people make Schneider Electric a great company. This is our People Vision. To transform our culture and create a great place to work for, we launched our new People Vision in 2018, composed of our Employee Value Proposition, our Core Values and our Leadership Expectations.\n\nOur Core Values define the way we work together.\n\nCustomer First. Above and beyond for Our Customers. We surprise and delight customers as we would be nowhere without them. So, not only do we put ourselves in their shoes, but we also anticipate their needs and go the extra mile. We champion our sales people, because they are the face of our Company. Whatever our role, we have an impact on the customer's experience.\n\nDare to Disrupt. Constantly in Beta. Innovation is our middle name. Good is never good enough, and that's why we are constantly experimenting, taking risks and disrupting the status quo. We think fast, and we act even faster. Setbacks don't hurt us. They motivate us. That's why we are not afraid to make our bets bigger, and our decisions bolder to power the digital economy through energy management and automation. We, at Schneider, ensure Life Is On.\n\nEmbrace Different. Different is Beautiful. We are 100% committed to inclusion. 'Exclusion' is not even in our vocabulary. We believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere. This means welcoming people from all walks of life, ages and cultures, embracing different perspectives and calling out bias when we see it. So that every person feels uniquely valued and safe to be at their best. To us, a stranger is simply a friend we haven't met yet.\n\nLearn Every Day. #Whatdidyoulearntoday. To stop learning is to stop growing. We are genuinely curious, never done with learning. To us, there is no such thing as knowing it all or having all the answers. We believe in life-long learning. Every minute of every day brings a new chance to listen, open up our minds, and widen our horizons. We are never too experienced to learn.\n\nAct Like Owners. All in. Together. Entrepreneurs at heart, we take responsibility and ownership of everything we do. This is not somebody else's company. It's ours! We are individually empowered and collectively driven to collaborate and beat the competition together. In the end, we do what is right for Schneider first - always with integrity and honesty.\n\n## 4.1.2 Organization\n\nSince 2009, the Human Resources (HR) department has been structured around three principal roles to better respond to its missions:\n\nHR Business Partners assist managers on a day-to-day basis in setting out their business strategies and in assessing the human resource requirements needed to meet business targets. They also play a pivotal role in anticipating skill requirements and employee development, and in the management of employee relations.\n\nHR Solutions creates and develops comprehensive solutions for the organization's strategic challenges in key areas, such as compensation, benefits, human capital development, learning and performance management. Regional teams are leveraged to effectively support the Group's globalized operations.\n\nHR Services handles the logistics and administrative responsibilities relating to payroll, sourcing, mobility and training programs, mainly through shared service centers designed to optimize efficiency and costs. Since 2015, the Group has put in place an HR Excellence initiative with the objective of creating HR teams ready to make the Leadership & Culture vision a reality while supporting the growth of the business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## 4.2 Employee health and safety\n\n## 4.2.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nAt Schneider Electric, risk assessments and strategic action plans are performed, based on the primary risks associated with the workplaces. These plans include opportunities to reduce serious and fatal incidents, maintain legal compliance, provide safe working conditions, and encourage employee engagement in the safety processes throughout the organization.\n\nThe plans are built on the Top 5 Hazards found in every aspect of the Company, which include driving, electrical, falls, powered industrial trucks (PIT), and fixed powered machines (FPM).\n\n## Injuries based on the Top 5 Hazards since 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2.2 Group policy\n\n## 4.2.2.1 Safety is a value\n\nSafety is a value on which Schneider Electric will not compromise, and this extends to employees, customers, partners, and those working on their behalf. Included in the Principles of Responsibility is a chapter on Safety at Work which reinforces the Group's commitment to provide a healthy and secure workplace for all. In addition, Schneider Electric's ambition is to achieve the highest standards of safety excellence. Schneider Electric is committed to invest in its people and its workplace as stated in its Group Safety and Occupational Health Policy, stating 'the ambition is to be the standard for safety excellence worldwide.'\n\nThe Safety and Occupational Health Policy establishes the commitment that Schneider Electric has made to maintaining safe and healthy working conditions, to fulfil legal obligations, to engage employees in safety processes, and to continually improve the health and safety program, and is the cornerstone of its certified Safety Management System. The policy includes the Group's Health and Safety Vision and Mission as such:\n\n## Vision:\n\nTo be the standard of excellence and the benchmark for health and safety within the industry.\n\n## Mission:\n\nTo protect occupational health and safety of employees, customers, contractors, and visitors, in the Group's locations, at offsite locations, and while travelling\u2026\n\n- \u2026to preserve Company license to operate through robust EHS compliance and risk management\u2026\n- \u2026to provide employees safe, pleasant, and efficient workplaces for enhanced well-being and effectiveness\u2026\n- \u2026to enhance our brand image and contribute to world sustainability through employees' behavior and innovation.\n\nIn 2020, as part of its improvement efforts, Schneider Electric successfully achieved re-certification for ISO 45001 Safety Management System as part a fully integrated management system certified through Bureau Veritas. This certification is in place for over 200 manufacturing, logistics, and R&D locations.\n\n## 4.2.2.2 EHS strategy\n\nThe Schneider Electric global safety strategy includes 'S.A.F.E. First' at the core. Developed as a personal reminder to pause and reflect on safety before beginning any task, the program empowers employees to perform S.A.F.E. First checks and if 'Unsafe? Stop Work!'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSelf\n\nCheck\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS.\n\nA.\n\nF.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric had to deal with the global COVID-19 pandemic, in which the Group responded through local responders' teams, provided personal protective equipment to all its employees, and implemented audits to ensure that control measures were in place worldwide. The field services teams were recognized as critical workers as they supported hospital, laboratories, and data centers during this period.\n\nThe Group has also internally surveyed the employees on related topics to COVID-19, in which 78% expressed that they were satisfied with workplace health and safety measures implemented.\n\nThe global safety strategy also takes into consideration the five guiding principles that help to determine actions to be taken as part of a work task. They are:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring employees are qualified for the work task before performing work;\n- \u00b7 Empowering employees to stop work if unsafe;\n- \u00b7 Reporting opportunities for improvement;\n- \u00b7 Resolving and sharing solutions to problems;\n- \u00b7 Encouraging employees to care about their own safety and the safety of their co-workers and customers.\n\n## 4.2.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 4.2.3.1 Annual EHS Assessments\n\nTo ensure successful implementation of the strategy, annual Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Assessments are performed in industrial sites worldwide. The EHS Assessment is a global process in which a site is evaluated to identify opportunities and to recognize excellence. At regional and global levels, EHS teams consolidate site results to identify and prioritize actions to support site performance, training needs, and cross-site mentoring opportunities. The EHS Assessment uses the same structure as the Schneider Performance System (SPS) (Company performance standardization tool) for simplified user-adoption and to enable further alignment to SPS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActivity\n\nCheck\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFacility\n\nCheck",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## Other key attributes\n\nEach quarter, the Group focuses on a key safety topic to bring attention to both workplace and human factors that have caused serious injuries at Schneider Electric. The campaign includes a dedicated web-portal to access tools, videos, training materials, apps, games, posters, and leader-led topics to further promote the importance of safety worldwide. The four quarterly safety campaigns culminated with the annual 'Global Health & Safety Day' celebration held on October 16, 2020. During 'Global Health & Safety Day' we emphasized the importance of being healthy and safe, especially while performing essential work in the midst of the pandemic. A special emphasis was placed on the importance of performing 'SA.F.E. First Checks' to ensure that each employee is mentally focused and physically well before starting any new task. This was one of our most popular employee engagement activities with personal commitments and pledges to commit to personal health and safety.\n\n## 4.2.3.3 Recognition and awards\n\nSchneider Electric was the recipient of several awards for occupational health and safety programs in 2020. This includes Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Gold Awards for both Safety and Fleet. The RoSPA Awards recognize achievement in health and safety management systems, including practices such as leadership and workforce involvement.\n\nSchneider Electric was proudly represented during the Campbell Institute Executive Summit, organized by the National Safety Council Congress & Expo, where we achieved 274 awards in categories such as 1 million hours worked with no Occupational Safety & Health Admnistration (OSHA) reportable, Perfect Record (no OSHA recordable), Safety Leadership (5yrs with no lost time accident) and Superior Performance (10 years with no lost time accident).\n\nSchneider Electric also received a Bronze 2020 Stevie award for Most Innovative Use of HR Technology During the Pandemic Europe.\n\n## 4.2.3.4 Future evolution of safety at Schneider Electric\n\nSafety is a never-ending journey towards excellence. Schneider Electric goals and initiatives are to be the standard in safety excellence worldwide. This pursuit begins with Group employees, starting with leaders. Safety is leadership led, and the Group's ambition is to progress the entire community towards full empowerment as defined in the 'S.A.F.E. First' Human Factors training, Safety Culture Assessment, and leadership action plans, which were developed in 2020 and ready for implementation in 2021.\n\nThis journey begins with the understanding that we, as humans, are prone to error. Schneider Electric is committed to enabling employees to identify (get involved), report (get engaged), and resolve to protect themselves and colleagues from injury (be empowered). The next evolution of safety is one that will transform the global community throughout the supply chain and at every level of the organization including partners, contractors, and suppliers. The intent is to use technology and innovation to enable Schneider Electric employees to be more empowered to detect and address unsafe conditions or behaviors. The future of safety at Schneider Electric starts with acknowledging that safety is a value on which we will not compromise, a belief shared by every employee, partner, contractor, and supplier.\n\n## SSI#10: 0.88 medical incidents per million hours worked\n\nSuccess for this program in 2020 is attributed to a number of factors including the launch of the the Safety Culture Assessment and the continual focus on 'S.A.F.E. First' program, a 33% increase in safety employee engagement compared to 2019. Together with leadership rolemodelling, Schneider Electric continues to strive to have a deeply embedded 'S.A.F.E. First' culture.\n\nMedical Incident Rate in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0.58\n\n## 4.2.4 Well-being in our DNA\n\nWell-being has been a strategic priority since 2015. 2020 tested our ambition and maturity, showing how the Company managed this unprecedented situation through global actions to help employees find the best strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications.\n\nSchneider Electric's well-being ambition is to create an environment where employees are empowered to manage their unique life and work by making the most of their energy.\n\nThe holistic view of well-being (physical, mental, emotional, and social) and the joint effort between the Company, leaders and employees, are key for the success of the program. The current strategy tackles two areas of impact:\n\n- \u00b7 Empowering individuals - through training and awareness actions to encourage well-being practices for managing self and teams.\n- \u00b7 Enabling environment - through policies and programs like the Global Flexibility@Work Policy, Global Family Leave Policy, Mindfulness at Work and Workplace of the Future.\n\nResponse to the 2020 pandemic:\n\n- \u00b7 Four global webinars, including topics on how to manage emotions and mental health and how to strengthen teams during uncertain times: 900+ participants.\n- \u00b7 Global mindfulness practice sessions in English and French: 2,900+ participants.\n- \u00b7 'Here for each other' global Yammer page.

The new global standard comes in response to employees' feedback in the Company's latest global employee survey in which a large proportion of employees stated that they prefer a hybrid work model (mix of WFH and 'work from office'). Additionally, the policy addresses hybrid work holistically, providing employees with mental health resources and training on best practices.\n\n## 4.2.4.2 Mental health:\n\nSince 2019, mental health is part of the global well-being agenda, raising awareness within the organization about its importance and aligning with the World Mental Health Day.

The Group is working to become the 'best company' to work for, and constantly strives to provide the environment and motivation for its employees to take control of their own career progression, through access to learning and development and the latest job opportunities, and through readily available resources. Measures are in place to minimize the impact of employee turnover, performance, and disengagement on Company productivity and performance. See further information in chapter 1, section 'Principal risks', pages 64 to 65.\n\n## 4.3.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric places a strong focus on the effective management of talent at all levels. There are two aspects to talent management for Schneider Electric - for all employees and for high potential talent.\n\nThe Group ensures all employees have the tools and processes in place to set clear goals and have a development plan to guide their performance, development, and learning in their current role as well as for future potential roles. The process is enabled by an integrated HR information system called TalentLink. This system allows data management and analytics in the areas of strategic workforce planning and talent management; it also improves the matching of resources to demand regarding learning in different parts of the Company. In 2020, a one-stop-shop career development platform called Open Talent Market was launched to our employees to create an internal talent market leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to match the supply and demand of talent throughout Schneider Electric. This creates better transparency around job and project opportunities, ensuring employees can drive their career and develop to their fullest potential at Schneider Electric.\n\nFor high potential talent, an annual talent review process operates across the Company to help ensure that high potential individuals are identified and realize their full career potential. Structured succession planning for critical roles helps to accelerate individual career development while maintaining continuity for the organization. In selecting and developing talent, an important consideration is also to foster diversity such as gender and nationalities (new economies as well as mature economies). Towards the end of the talent review process across the entities, there is an aggregated review with the Executive Committee to discuss the overall health of the leadership pipeline and succession strength for top positions.\n\n## 4.3.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 4.3.3.1 Employee engagement and OneVoice\n\nSet up in 2009, the OneVoice internal survey was designed to measure employee satisfaction. In 2012, the survey evolved to include employee engagement to derive a more holistic view of employee expectations, commitment, and sentiment on the ground.\n\nEmployees are asked to fill out a questionnaire evaluating their engagement and measuring the drivers of engagement such as diversity, learning and well-being. This process helps the Group identify key avenues for improving major employee engagement factors.\n\n## SSI#14: 90% of white collar employees have Individual Development Plans (IDP)\n\nSchneider Electric's collective future success depends on the ability of each employee to perform, develop, and grow their careers. Since 2017, the Group has set the ambition for all white collar employees to have at least one development discussion with their manager every year. To achieve the ambition, we have integrated the performance and development process to enable broader conversations on how development can drive higher performance. The launch of the Open Talent Market platform to all employees in 2020 has further strengthened the development culture by offering internal project and mentorship opportunities for everyone everywhere. The number of white collar employees with an IDP has increased from 32% in 2017 to 92% in 2020.\n\n% white collar employees with an IDP in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n92%\n\nIn the context of COVID-19, it was decided to not run the 'usual' OneVoice survey in 2020. The Company kept measuring the level of engagement of its employees asking the same 6 questions based on the traditional model and added a specific set of survey questions linked to the pandemic. The level of employee engagement recorded in 2020 was 69%, which is the highest since 2012 when it was at 55%, demonstrating a strong commitment of our employees toward the organization. This Employee Engagement Index is also registered in the SSI. It enables Schneider Electric to compare itself with the best employers in the industry and the best employers in key regions of the world.\n\n## Key highlights for 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of employees surveyed in June 2020, including a specific set of questions linked to the Covid-19 situation;\n- \u00b7 A high participation rate of 68% but with a decrease of 16% compared to 2019;\n- \u00b7 One single platform for all Human Resources surveys for continuous listening of our employees;\n- \u00b7 3,729 managers receiving a dedicated report;\n- \u00b7 More than 50,000 verbatim analyzed;\n- \u00b7 One action taken from the survey is the implementation of a new Global Flexibility@Work Policy offering the option of working from home two days per week for all eligible Schneider Electric employees.",

The role of the managers is key and 90% of the employees recognize the good support received during time of crisis. Managers are also actively involved in this process: following communication of the results, managers, with the support of their HR Business Partner, organized feedback sessions with their team to foster dialog and build relevant action plans, based on both qualitative and quantitative results.\n\nSchneider Electric looks very closely at these action plans to ensure they are seriously followed and recorded in the survey platform and that good practices can be shared across the organization. In 2020, the Company increased focus on action plans being implemented at three different levels: global, local, and team. Each country's laws and regulations are different and what is decided globally must be adapted taking into consideration those external parameters.\n\n## SSI#9: 70% scored in our Employee Engagement Index\n\nOne of the most impressive increases observed in the Employee Engagement Index was in Mexico was 73% (+14 points). The main reason for such a significant increase is top management communication, always sharing open, honest, and transparent messages with their teams. The country leadership team held monthly all-employee virtual open lines which helped keep a high level of trust. The second reason is that managers focused on putting actions in place to increase collaboration among teams, having formal and informal sessions to solve common issues and empowering employees to make decisions as they adopted new ways of working. And the third reason is the global safety measures implemented by country and location which were very much appreciated by employees as it showed a proactive response to COVID-19. Site managers helped make employee safety the highest priority on their agendas and took action accordingly.\n\n% scored in 2020\n\n69%\n\n## 4.3.3.2 Employer Branding\n\n## Our Employee Value Proposition (EVP)\n\nThe Group is looking to establish a strong name as an employer and communicate this around its EVP, which is our promise to current and future employees.\n\nWe are driven by our meaningful purpose and continuously create an inclusive environment where employees are empowered to be at their best and innovate.\n\n- \u00b7 Meaningful: Schneider's purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all. At Schneider, we call this Life Is On. Our mission is to be your digital partner for Sustainability and Efficiency. We adhere to the high standards of governance and ethics;\n- \u00b7 Inclusive: we want to be the most diverse, inclusive, and equitable Company, globally. We value differences and welcome people from all walks of life. We believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere;\n\n- \u00b7 Empowered: freedom breeds innovation. We believe that empowerment generates high performance, personal fulfilment, and fun. We empower our people to use their judgment, do the best for our customers, and make the most of their energy.\n\nOur EVP continues to evolve in line with the business. Making the emotional connection as to 'Why Schneider Electric?' is fundamental in the ability to not only attract the best talent and be an 'employer of choice', but also to have it resonate as authentic with employees as a form of encouragement, motivation, and inspiration.\n\n## Flagship program: Schneider Go Green\n\nLaunched in 2011, Schneider Go Green is an annual global competition for business and Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) students around the world to find innovative solutions for energy management and automation - exposing university students to our employer brand and Core Values. It is now established as a global initiative to attract female and male graduates for early career opportunities and/or ongoing talent fulfilment objectives. Over the years, the competition expanded its scope to become a great opportunity for students to not only share their bold ideas, but also to start their career at Schneider Electric.\n\nStudents are asked to present their bold ideas on efficient energy solutions for a better and more sustainable future. Working in pairs with at least one female participant, students are required to propose creative and viable solutions for critical energy management and automation in different categories such as: access to energy, buildings of the future, grids of the future, and plants of the future - all with measurable sustainable impact.\n\nIn 2020, the competition pivoted to digital format for the first time, firstly with a pre-show for aspiring participants and then the global final, where finalists pitched their ideas online to a panel of judges, made from senior leaders across Schneider Electric. On September 10, 2020, the winning team was announced: Team Groon, two students from Colombia, who proposed a sustainable hybrid cooling system impacting a small community of fisherman in Bojaya, Colombia.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Schneider Go Green has had over 117,400 registrants and more than 21,700 students have submitted ideas from 172 countries. In 2020 alone, more than 24,400 students registered and nearly 3,000 students submitted their ideas, proving that Go Green continues to be consistent in developing strong and increasing interest from students for this contest, especially from emerging economies.",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## University partnerships\n\nSchneider Electric continues to focus on key relationships with a core selection of partner universities throughout the world. Relationships have primarily been developed with universities which offer specialization that aligns with the Group's business needs - most commonly in engineering, energy management, technology, and business. Relationships with universities are maintained at a local and global level. As the external market changes, the pathway to attract and engage young talents has also been adapting. This year, university relations has enhanced to be more digital. A selection of initiatives is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 Sharing of Schneider Electric's business acumen - for example Global Virtual Student Experience, guest lectures, and speaking engagements;\n- \u00b7 Sponsorship initiatives;\n- \u00b7 Collaboration on innovation projects - for example the Go Green competition and Hackathons;\n- \u00b7 Virtual office site and Innovation Summit tours;\n- \u00b7 On-campus and virtual recruitment events;\n- \u00b7 Digital and face-to-face speaking engagements and networking opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Mentoring relationships.\n\nA major pilot in 2020 was the Global Virtual Student Experience to adapt to the ways we can engage students through the challenges of 2020. The student experience is designed to offer students who may not be ready to apply to job opportunities, a chance to learn more about Schneider Electric and learn key career building skills at the same time. The web pages attracted 69,000 views in 15 days and more than 6,900 students applied. This pilot, given the level of interest from students that Schneider Electric does not currently engage or attract, showcases Schneider Electric's employer brand recognition.\n\nSchneider Electric has a wide range of career paths available to students pursuing the start of their career at Schneider Electric, including projects and services, industrial/manufacturing, general management, marketing, and sales. This is supported by development programs around the world that are structured to help support the acceleration of early career talent through a robust training and development path including graduate programs, internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops.\n\nThis approach has enabled strong talent pipelines to be established to attract future talent with key target skills and create greater awareness of Schneider Electric as an employer of choice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our employer brand, social media, and recognition\n\nSocial media plays a central role in Schneider Electric's employer branding - enabling it to engage extensively with talent to showcase the Company as an employer and the diversity of its business. Schneider Electric also greatly values the opportunity social media gives to have open dialog and receive feedback.\n\nIn particular, our achievements included:\n\n- \u00b7 The Financial Times recognized Schneider Electric as a 'Diversity Leader', ranking #28 out of 850 companies and 2nd in our industry for 2021;\n- \u00b7 2020 Universum 'Top 50 World's Most Attractive Employers', ranked #48, as recognized by 235,000 IT and engineering students globally;\n- \u00b7 Fortune recognized Schneider Electric as one of the 'World's Most Admired Companies' in 2020;\n- \u00b7 Forbes recognized Schneider Electric USA as one of 'America's Best Large Employers' in 2020;\n- \u00b7 Great Place to Work certified Schneider Electric in the US again for 2021;\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric's Glassdoor rating is on a steady growth, up to 4.1 at the end of 2020, recognizing both Schneider Electric France and Schneider Electric USA as a 'Best Place to Work' for 2020.",

While that fact remains constant, the learning landscape is quickly changing in response to disruption and rapidly evolving development needs of employees. Many factors are contributing to this need for change:\n\n- \u00b7 Digitization and the Fourth Industrial Revolution are creating new fields and markets requiring rapidly changing skills;\n- \u00b7 Careers are becoming more open in a transparent marketplace: Employees are being hired for skills to perform project-based work;\n- \u00b7 Shift towards a digital/human and gig economy workforce is creating a strong demand for a harmonized mix of hard and soft skills.\n\nSkill needs are becoming increasingly complex and upskilling and reskilling are becoming the norm. This external landscape shift and internal growth demand led Schneider Electric to redefine its learning strategy for 2020. Learning and career development remain at the heart of Schneider Electric.\n\n## 4.4.2 Group policy\n\nAt Schneider Electric, #LearnEveryDay is in our DNA. It is embedded in our belief in the power of life-long learning. Learning facilitates continuous innovation for customers, keeping the Company ahead of the game, individually and collectively. The Group's learning priorities are crisp and simple:\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerate digital and personalized learning as part of learning culture, in the flow of work and life;\n- \u00b7 Accelerate Schneider Essentials learning for all connected employees and deploy a digital program for leaders to enhance their business and finance acumen;\n- \u00b7 Accelerate learning for critical roles and transform how to skill, upskill, and reskill for the future including digital, agility, innovation, sales, and EcoStruxure \u2122 .\n\n## 4.4.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 4.4.3.1 Learning culture\n\n## Learning never stops\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group responded quickly to provide immediate learning resources and support for employees, managers, and top leaders. A learning page was created with content on virtual work, digital well-being, and function specific resources for all employees. For managers, additional content on managing virtual teams, business continuity, and a guide to the new normal were created using Schneider Electricspecific scenarios. For top leaders, there was a focus on crisis management and leading in times of ambiguity. In addition to learning resources, weekly LiveTalks were organized over a 10week period, with external speakers and internal leader dialogues. These covered a variety of business and personal topics including mitigating risk, China leadership sharing, managing emotions in uncertainty, and leading in a crisis.\n\n## Unleashing internal knowledge\n\nThe Group actively promotes a learning and teaching culture by developing its internal trainer capability. This was critical during the pandemic, with internal trainers delivering over 80% of formal training. There has been a strong focus on equipping internal trainers to develop and facilitate virtual classroom training, including using tools such as Klaxoon for additional interaction and engagement. A Global Virtual Internal Trainer Conference was organized in September with the purpose to recognize, develop, and connect internal trainers. Activities included testimonials of appreciation, a video expo of trainer best practices; facilitation\n\ntechniques and capability building sessions on how to engage the modern learner, StoryCrafting, and creating 'wow' learning experiences. There are currently over 6,000 identified internal trainers who collectively delivered over 16,000 sessions in 2020.\n\n## Learning environment\n\nThe Company aspires to create an inclusive environment for the development of its employees, focusing on completion of a specific number of hours of learning for a subset of employees to the inclusion of all employees, including workers in factories and distribution centers. The Group objective regarding that population is:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of workers to receive at least 15% of training hours per year; and\n- \u00b7 in parallel, 30% of worker training hours to be completed digitally.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, Schneider has engaged a program to connect workers to the Schneider Electric network, either from a computer kiosk installed in our facilities called 'Digital Learning Corner', or from their mobile phone via a secured authentication process. This required the deployment of training content tailored for the workers, both in terms of subject matter and language.\n\n## SSI#13: 100% of workers received at least 15 hours of learning, and 30% of workers' learning hours are done digitally\n\n122 digital learning corners were set up across the world.

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## 4.4.3.2 Digital learning\n\nBecause Schneider Electric wants to achieve its business goals and stand out from the competition, it must invest in its people and prepare them for the future with the right set of skills, at the speed of change. The innovations conducted in the past three years in digital learning are solid steps in that direction.\n\nTo support the rapid changes in the Company, Schneider Electric implemented an open learning ecosystem comprised of interconnected platforms. The Learning Management System administers instructor-led training, compliance, and reporting. The learning experience platforms provide easy access to consume, share, and create formal and informal learning content on mobile and desktop devices. Together these systems and platforms provide a relevant, intuitive, and effective one-stop-shop experience, powered by digital.\n\nThe Group progressed on its journey to transition towards a more digital learning catalog. Over the last six years, the number of available digital training hours rose to 39%, mainly through business-driven action plans. The Group was successful in:\n\n- \u00b7 Deploying a large catalog of e-learning in 13 languages to all Schneider Electric employees;\n- \u00b7 Offering TED videos in line with transformation and business priorities;\n- \u00b7 Integrating specialized learning providers for digital awareness;\n- \u00b7 Procuring software and IT solutions in order to embrace constant changes in the world of learning;\n- \u00b7 Creating dedicated digital libraries for procurement and finance functions.\n\nThis year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent cancellation of classroom training, the Group saw a massive increase in the utilization of learning platforms. This shift resulted in a 34-point increase in the digital hours consumed, from 44.4% in 2019 to 78% in 2020.\n\n## My LearningLink\n\nAt the center of this ecosystem is My LearningLink (MLL), Schneider Electric's global learning platform which integrates e-learning, webinars, social learning, classroom learning, assessments, and full certification paths. All academies and country-level courses are registered in MLL and the Group continues to see a rise in numbers each year. In 2020 there were:\n\n- \u00b7 200,000 sessions opened per month;\n- \u00b7 More than 20,000 modules of learning content available in up to 13 languages;\n- \u00b7 More than 130,000 employees with access to the system;\n\nManager approval is not required for employees to register for online courses. Employees are actively encouraged to take responsibility for developing their skills and competencies.\n\nMore than 41,000 employees visit MLL every month. In November 2020, a learner survey answered by 1,200 employees revealed a satisfaction score of 4.4 out of 5 for the overall learning experience at Schneider Electric, up 0.2 points from 2019.\n\nMLL is also used to deliver online training content to Schneider Electric's partners. The mySchneider Partner Portal is deployed in 140 countries and provides a customized learning experience with targeted training content that is most relevant to the partners' business. The training portal is accessible to over 750,000 Schneider Electric partners who have completed 150,000 courses since its inception in 2015.\n\n## Innovative content and modalities\n\nRetention of learning is a key focus area for the Group who has adopted a framework for designing and developing training in a manner that ensures learning is reinforced beyond the initial learning experience. This framework is known as the 'Sticky Learning Experience' and is based on neuroscience. The Sticky Learning Experience is deployed:\n\n- \u00b7 Internally via a central design and development team called the digital learning factory;\n- \u00b7 In the content bought from off-the-shelf libraries;\n- \u00b7 In the tools used to train our learning development teams.\n\nIn 2020, the Group trained 262 people using the Sticky Learning Experience framework. The Group has also deployed tools to facilitate swift development by subject matter experts via user generated content. These tools enable the Group to be agile and meet the everchanging learning needs of the business. Among those learning tools are Klaxoon (gamified and mobile), BlendedX (mobile and blended programs), CoorpAcademy (gamified, social, and mobile), and Uptale (Virtual Reality).\n\nIn addition to these platforms, the Group buys content off-the-shelf on skills and topics that are not Schneider Electric-specific. This content is a combination of micro-learning for all employees and more targeted libraries for specific audiences.\n\nSchneider Electric uses Microsoft Yammer as its social media platform and has more than 49,000 active users. Yammer provides a digital environment for sharing knowledge and experiences on different topics. It is an incubator for communities and the Company currently has 200 communities of practice as part of the communities@work program. These communities promote a new way of working, with a strong culture of sharing where members can learn from each other.\n\n## Upskilling for the digital world\n\nThe Group recognizes job skills are rapidly becoming outdated. Roles requiring digital and human skills are growing due to the rise of AI, automation, and digitization. It is imperative that 'Learn Every Day', as one of the Company's Core Values, is truly embedded across the organization with a sense of urgency to ensure sustainable careers and a resilient, future-ready business through purposeful renewal of skills. To support this ambition, the Group has identified key technical/functional skills, digital skills, and power skills for each business and function and common skill focus areas across the organization.",

        "page_content": "Agility is one of the priority skills. In 2020, the Group organized a 'Customer & Agile Learning Week' to share best practices of agile implementation. The Learning Week showcased how agility is at the heart of creating value for customers and partners. A custom learning page was launched containing agility content and has provided learning opportunities to 3,000 employees since September 2020. There is also an active global agile Yammer community of 1,000+ employees who share knowledge and best practices across the organization.\n\nDigital knowledge is also identified as a priority skill. This focus will continue in support of the 2025 Schneider Sustainability Essentials. The goal is for >90% employees to undergo digital upskilling through the Digital Citizenship program. The Group is committed to growing employee digital citizenship and launched 'Boost Your Digital Knowledge,' a smart learning solution designed to help employees know how to become more digital. The learning solution covers nine pillars of digital knowledge aligned with the most needed digital future skills in Schneider Electric including data science, digital economy, digital technologies, and cybersecurity.\n\nThese initiatives complement learning solutions in businesses, functions, and entities to upskill employees for a digital world.\n\n## Mobile enabled learning on the go\n\nThe Group continues to find ways to bring learning into the flow of work and life by making content available via mobile devices. The mobile learning journey began three years ago with pilots of a platform called EdCast. EdCast enables learners to easily connect to several sources of content, bundle them in pathways, and curate them for a specific group on an open and mobile application. A leadership program called 'License to Lead' was piloted with top executives and a 'Digital DNA' program targeted to 3,000 people in the Schneider Digital department. These programs continued in 2020 and resulted in active monthly usage of 30% for 'License to Lead' and 20% for 'Digital DNA', which were below expectations. These numbers demonstrate that providing a cutting-edge learning platform is not enough to create a sustainable learning habit and improving this is a focus in 2021.\n\nA mobile version of the My LearningLink global learning platform was piloted in 2020, with plans for a Company-wide launch in 2021.\n\n## 4.4.3.3 Learning paths and building great professionals Learning paths for key roles\n\nTo promote a culture of learning based on the 3E model (10% education, 90% informal exposure and experience), learning paths are available for a large majority of existing roles. 90% of the roles are covered with recommendations of training, including actions for exposure and experience. The learning paths are widely used during the employee development process and enable each employee, during conversations with their manager, to receive profiled recommendations based on their current role and explore development opportunities for future roles.\n\n## Leadership development\n\n2020 saw the growing impact of the leadership transformation within Schneider Electric with a resilient and effective leadership community able to support their customers and teams in the unprecedented disruption and challenges of COVID-19. The Company leadership expectation of 'free up your energy' began to pay dividends as leaders quickly developed strategies to adapt to the circumstances and empowered and trusted their teams to work remotely. Despite the impact of COVID-19, there was still a critical focus on developing leaders at all levels throughout the Company. 2020 had three core focus areas for leadership development:\n\nFirst: build a consistent, globally scalable, and business-focused frontline and middle management development system, called 'Building Great Leaders', which launched successfully and was adapted to be delivered digitally and virtually. This program has a 'red thread' of the business challenges leaders face every day and the learning experience is built around that set of challenges. This makes it both practical and highly engaging. 650 managers completed the program in 2020 with the goal over the next two years to provide development for more than 1,200 leaders per annum;\n\nSecond: a new, 100% digital, immersive learning experience was deployed on Schneider Electric's three core business models (transactional, software and services), called 'Leadership for Profitable Growth'. The goal is to educate and enable the 'top 1,000' leadership communities to be able to contribute to the growth ambition of Schneider Electric. By the end of 2020, 450 leaders completed the five-week program which featured a business simulation, testing the ability to make commercial, financial, and strategic decisions and applying that knowledge to the Schneider Electric business environment. By July 2021, all top 1,000 leaders will have completed the program and it will be progressively cascaded to other leadership levels to build financial acumen throughout the Company;\n\nThird: continue to build a robust pipeline of future ready talent by providing leadership learning for our high potential talent. In 2020, 450 early career leaders completed their 'Transforming Schneider Leadership' program including actionable projects for innovation and digital transformation. Additionally, 116 early career women in leadership roles completed our inaugural 'Schneider Women Leader's Program,' and while the program could not be completed with the envisioned face-to-face summit event due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Company was able to create a highly engaging virtual summit which brought these women together digitally, along with mentors, coaches, business school faculty, and some of our most senior women within the Company.",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## Academies to support business priorities\n\nFunctional academies are in place to partner with the business in identifying learning needs and spotting gaps in core and future competencies for relevant employee populations. The academies work closely with a network of learning solutions and internal consultants, territory talent and learning leads, and HR business partners to build learning and development content for each job code. They also promote education, exposure and experience paths to meet the needs of all employees.\n\nThe Global Supply Chain (GSC) Academy provides every employee, from senior executives to factory workers within the GSC function, with the opportunity to learn and develop their functional knowledge, capability, and competencies in multiple areas: safety, manufacturing, supply chain planning, logistics and environment, customer satisfaction and quality, purchasing, and industrialization. In 2020, the GSC Academy focused on delivering digital learning to approximately 50,000 employees located in plants and distribution centers, allowing all employees to learn every day in local languages.\n\nThe Human Resources Academy equips HR employees with skills of the future with a focus on digital competencies, from basic application skills through advanced expert level topics, including dedicated programs on digital awareness and digital citizenship for all employees.\n\nThe Marketing Academy focuses on customer centricity and digitization to innovate, targeting 4,500 marketers and all employees involved in Schneider Electric transformations.\n\nThe Offer Creation Academy addresses the needs of the Offer Creation Process (OCP) to ensure the right competency levels of R&D employees globally. The range of learning options covers the entire OCP life cycle, addressing skills such as project management, design and testing, R&D processes, and software tools.\n\nThe Sales Excellence Academy is set to prepare the global salesforce for the challenges of digital business and commercial transformation in line with business strategies. It develops learning paths for sales leaders, account managers, channel managers, and sales specialists (about 16,000 employees) to impart knowledge, skills, and behavioral changes to sell directly to customers and through partners. By the end of 2020, 25% of the targeted population will embark upon the consultative selling approach journey, introducing a customer centric approach to engage with and solve customer challenges. The global health crisis sparked innovation in addressing engagement with customers during the crisis. The Sales Excellence Academy launched an internally developed digital certification training in less than two months' time. Ultimately, the offer helps salespeople to change the way they engage with customers from only in-person to a blended approach, leveraging the optimal of digital virtual and in-person. Only five months in from the launch, 1,700 salespeople had reached their certification.\n\nSolutions University offers a comprehensive learning portfolio including certifications for sales and account management and EcoStruxure \u2122 for segment, tailored to the organization's needs and performance environments. The Solutions University's aim is to support the solutions, services, and digital business growth with a special focus on strategic accounts. At the end of 2020, Solutions University delivered 1,400 segment certificates to end-user sales and solutions architects.\n\n## Schneider Essentials\n\nIn 2019, for the first time, three courses were assigned to all connected employees of the Company. The aim was to create a strong culture of common 'must-knows' on compliance and cultural topics.\n\nIn 2020, four courses were assigned to all employees as part of the Schneider Essentials second campaign. The courses were assigned via My LearningLink. Automated monthly e-mails were sent to employees and their managers to remind them of the courses left to complete. The 2020 completion rate for all employees was 94%. The decrease compared to 2019 can be explained by the difficult environment linked with the pandemic, especially for factory workers. The Schneider Essentials campaign will be carried out again in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's diversity and inclusion ambition is to offer equal opportunities to everyone everywhere. Schneider Electric wants its employees - no matter who they are, or where in the world they live - to feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best. The Group believes that diversity and inclusion is a business imperative as greater engagement, performance, and innovation is generated through diversity of people and an environment of inclusion.\n\n## 4.5.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric's overall aspiration to improve the lives of people everywhere in the world by developing sustainable energy solutions for its customers extends to its diversity and inclusion ambition. The Group's Diversity Policy was first written in 2006 and broadened at the end of 2013. With the new People Vision launched in 2018, Schneider Electric's Global Diversity & Inclusion Policy follows two major commitments which incorporates the Group's ambition:\n\n- \u00b7 Embrace different; and\n- \u00b7 Build a culture of inclusion.\n\nAt the Group level, diversity and inclusion focuses on five areas of diversity:\n\n- \u00b7 Gender;\n- \u00b7 Nationality, ethnicity, race;\n- \u00b7 Generation;\n- \u00b7 LGBT+; and\n- \u00b7 Disability.\n\nWhile diversity and inclusion is increasingly driven by local and regional regulations, with which the Group complies, other countries where Schneider Electric operates are encouraged to tackle additional diversity and inclusion challenges specifically relevant to their markets and tailored to their local needs.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\n## Overall Workforce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.5.3 Governance\n\nThe Global Diversity & Inclusion Board is a group of top leaders from all markets and is sponsored by the Executive Committee. The board acts as a sounding board for the global diversity and inclusion strategy as well as internal and external diversity and inclusion champions. Board members are nominated by the Executive Committee to serve a two to three-year term.\n\nThe Group's leaders are accountable for diversity and inclusion through the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), the Group's transformation plan and steering tool for sustainability. The SSI is also factored into every manager's short-term incentive plans.\n\nThe Group has operations in over 100 countries, with employees representing over 150 nationalities. All Schneider Electric entities develop diversity and inclusion action plans while meeting local regulations and addressing country-specific situations. Diversity and inclusion leaders have been appointed in more than 30 countries/zones and entities of the Group to lead these actions plans. This global Diversity and Inclusion Network convenes bimonthly to share best practices.\n\n## 4.5.4 Due diligence and results\n\n## 4.5.4.1 A strong focus on gender diversity\n\nSchneider Electric's diversity and inclusion strategy places strong emphasis on gender diversity, based on the strong conviction that building a gender balanced Company that is equally inclusive of men and women is both the right thing to do and critical to diversity of thought, to unleash innovation and deliver the best sustainable energy solutions to customers.\n\n## United Nations partnerships\n\n'HeForShe' is a United Nations Women solidarity movement for gender equality. It invites men and boys to build on the work of the women's movement as equal partners, crafting and implementing a shared vision of gender equality that will benefit all.\n\nSince June 2015, Schneider Electric has been engaged as a HeForShe IMPACT 10x10x10 Champion and made three commitments to be achieved by end of 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Increase the representation of women across the pipeline - 40% at entry, and 30% in top positions by 2020;\n\n## Frontline management\n\nTotal New Hires\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Female\n- Male\n- * Total New Hires for 2020 is All New Hires.\n- Leadership - Vice Presidents and above\n\nFrontline Management - junior and mid-level management whose direct reports are individual contributors only.\n\nLeadership\n\n15\n\n<!-- image -->",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n- \u00b7 Implement a worldwide pay equity process reaching 95% of our global workforce by 2020; and\n- \u00b7 Involve Group leaders and establish a dedicated executive-level governance body to drive gender equality across Schneider.\n\nSchneider Electric has also renewed its commitment to gender balance with the new 2021-2025 SSI gender balance KPI 50/40/30 - women representing 50% of all new hires, 40% of frontline managers, and 30% of senior leadership.\n\nIn addition to being involved in HeForShe, Schneider Electric has also committed to the Women's Empowerment Principles, which are seven principles guiding businesses on how to empower women in the workplace, marketplace, and community. In 2019, Schneider Electric became the first multinational company to achieve 100% commitment to the UN Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) across its global leadership team, and all new country leaders make this commitment as part of their onboarding process.\n\n## Building a gender-balanced leadership pipeline\n\nAs of end of 2020, women make up 24% of the senior leadership and 25% of managerial positions. To build a robust gender balanced leadership pipeline, the Group has engaged in several actions.\n\nBecause they are a key internal leadership talent pool, Schneider Electric has been focusing on hiring and including more women in sales and technical roles. As of end of 2020, women made up 21% of STEM roles with a hiring rate of 34%. Similarly, as of end of 2020, women made up 19% of the sales population with a hiring rate of 24%.\n\nIn 2019-2020, the Company revitalized its commitment to gender equity in leadership roles and launched the Schneider Women Leaders' Program (SWLP) - a global program with a common cause - enabling more women at their mid-career point, to build the skills and confidence to step up their leadership capability and impact.\n\nThe SWLP program is an award-winning nine-month coaching and virtual workshop experience, culminating in a three- day virtual global summit, bringing the graduating women together with senior Schneider leaders and well-class business school faculty. The initial cohort included 116 women across all regions. 236 women have benefited from this targeted leadership development, accelerating the preparation for even more women as the Company steps up its targets for women in mid-level leadership roles by 2025.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs) also play a large role in empowering women locally and helping drive efforts to advance women in leadership. As of the end of 2020, local ERGs have contributed to the Group's efforts towards gender equality and inclusion in more than 40 countries.\n\n## 4.5.4.2 Nationality, ethnicity and race inclusion\n\nTo continue to reinforce the 'equity and equal opportunities' strategy and to reinforce its reputation as the most global of local companies, Schneider Electric ensures that its leadership footprint is in line with its business footprint. 41% of Schneider Electric's revenues comes from the new economies and 34% of the leadership team is from the new economies. 85% of country presidents are either local or regional. Schneider also has a global commitment on ethnicity and racial equity, with countries in the lead to drive ambition and actions. The goal set for racial equity and inclusion means:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee population is reflective of the communities operated by Schneider Electric, including at the leadership level;\n- \u00b7 Employees have equal opportunity for growth and training;\n- \u00b7 Everyone feels safe, valued, and respected for who they are, to be their authentic self.\n\n## 4.5.4.3 Generational inclusion\n\nSchneider Electric is also committed to the development and inclusion of the Company's multi-generational talent pool. In order to achieve this goal, employees have career development discussions and training opportunities at all stages of their career, as well as mentoring and reverse mentoring programs and networking opportunities. Leveraging the richness of its multigenerational employees' experiences results in greater innovation, equity, and preparedness to build the solutions for tomorrow.\n\n## Generation breakdown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Baby Boomers\n- GenX\n- GenY (Millennials)\n- GenZ\n\n## 4.5.4.4 LGBT+ inclusion\n\nIn March 2018, Schneider Electric committed to the UN Free and Equal Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex People, standing up for equal rights and fair treatment for LGBT+ people everywhere.\n\nBy adopting these standards, the Group pledges to respect and stand up for the human rights of LGBT+ workers, customers, and members of the public; to support our LGBT+ employees and to prevent discrimination, including workplace discrimination, against LGBT+ people.\n\nIn October 2020, Schneider Electric held its global LGBT+ Awareness Month. Each week video testimonials, podcasts, and educational materials were provided to all employees interested in learning and hearing from their LGBT+ colleagues.\n\nIn addition to signing the UN Free and Equal Standards, across the globe, Schneider Electric has also made public statements of support to advance LGBT+ inclusion: Schneider Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and France have all signed LGBT+ equality charters. In June 2019, the Company announced the launch of a global LGBT+ Employee Resource Group (ERG): Schneider LGBT+ and Allies. The Group is open to all - LGBT+ people and allies alike - with an interest to further inclusion in the workplace.",

In January 2021, Schneider Electric joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) Global Business and Disability Network and signed their charter, committing to promote and include persons with disabilities throughout their operations worldwide. During 2020, the Company also held a weeklong global awareness campaign for people with disabilities, educating employees about the diversity of disabilities and actions that can be taken to be allies for building an inclusive environment for people with disabilities.\n\n## 4.5.4.6 Inclusive policies\n\nSchneider Electric recognizes that diversity without inclusion does not work. Policies and practices have been developed and applied with an inclusive mindset so that everyone can feel that they are uniquely valued and belong.\n\n## Multi-hub business model\n\nSchneider Electric wants everyone, everywhere in the Company to have the same chance of success irrespective of their race, ethnicity, nationality, or location. To deliver on this ambition, the Group created a multi-hub model and systematically relocated global jobs to four hubs: Paris, Boston, Hong Kong, and Bangalore. Not only has this model helped to attract and develop local talent, it has been instrumental in the expansion of the business with localized decision-making.\n\n## Gender pay equity\n\nEqual pay for equal work is a core component of the Group's compensation philosophy. Since 2015, as part of its HeForShe commitments, Schneider Electric has developed and implemented a Pay Equity Framework. This is a common global methodology to identify gender pay gaps within comparable groups of employees and lead a country-driven approach to address gaps with appropriate corrective actions.\n\nThe Group exceeded its ambition, which was to extend the Pay Equity Framework to 95% of its global workforce by the end of 2020: as of the end of this year, the framework has been implemented in all countries, covering 99.6% of Schneider Electric's total workforce.\n\n## Global Family Leave Policy\n\nWith its industry-leading Global Family Leave Policy, Schneider Electric supports employees with personal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to manage their 'unique life and work' so that they can be at their best.\n\nWhile the Group's countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy details per statutory/market requirements, the policy sets global minimum standards:\n\n- \u00b7 Fully paid parental leave (primary parent - 12 weeks, secondary parent - 2 weeks);\n- \u00b7 Care leave (for sick/elderly relatives - 1 week); and\n- \u00b7 Bereavement leave (1 week).\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the Company achieved the goal of 100% of all benefit eligible employees having access to this global policy.\n\n## SSI#12: 100% of employees are working in countries that have fully deployed our Global Family Leave Policy\n\nWith the introduction of the Global Family Leave Policy (GFLP) in 2017, Schneider Electric Turkey employees now feel more comfortable and secure knowing that Schneider Electric is supporting them during their most important family moments. With GFLP, employees have a solution to care for their families' special needs, without having to use their annual leave or take unpaid leave.\n\nAs of 2020, all employees of Schneider Electric Turkey have access to GFLP, covering over 1,550 employees. This inclusive policy implementation was a real game changer, especially for blue collar employees. It was well received by unions and has been recognized as very progressive and ahead of many employers in Turkey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.5.4.7 Tackling biases and discrimination\n\nSchneider Electric has developed a comprehensive education approach on hidden bias to build inclusive teams and leaders at every level:\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and hidden bias coaching session for senior management teams (N-1 & N-2 of Group Executive Committee);\n- \u00b7 Leadership skills series on inclusive leadership (coaching and e-learnings) for all people managers; and\n- \u00b7 Overcoming hidden bias e-workout for all employees.\n\nThe Company has also built in reminders to check hidden bias and mitigate them through inclusive tips into its major human resource programs, including performance and salary review processes.\n\nIn addition to raising awareness on hidden biases, in 2018, through the launch of a Global Anti-Harassment Policy, Schneider Electric reinforced the Group's position on zero-tolerance on harassment, setting clear and consistent expectations of workplace conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\nThe policy defines harassment, including sexual harassment, and outlines the roles of employees, managers, and witnesses in creating a workplace free of harassment, and highlights the different reporting channels available to all, while maintaining confidentiality and protection against retaliation. The policy defines a global minimum standard; where local legislations define additional standards beyond the global policy, Schneider Electric entities comply with them.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric's Principles of Responsibility were launched, in alignment with the Company's Global Anti-Harassment Policy. Mandatory annual e-learning on the Principles of Responsibility was rolled out to all employees.\n\nIn 2021, the Group will introduce a mandatory e-learning for all employees on 'Building a Culture of Respect'. This e-learning will focus on how each employee has a role and a responsibility to speak up if they experience or witness an act of harassment to ensure a culture of respect and inclusion for all.\n\n## 4.5.4.8 External recognition\n\nThe Group's longstanding commitment to gender equality and inclusion was globally recognized multiple times in the past couple of years (see pages 94-95):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Schneider Electric was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, for the fourth year in a row.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric was recognized by the Financial Times as one of the Top 30 Diversity Leaders 2021 in Europe, ranking 2nd in its industry and 27th globally.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric was ranked in the Top 50 for the Universum's Diversity & Inclusion Index, which recognizes the most diverse and inclusive employers of the world.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric was ranked 1st in the industrial sector and 31st globally in the Equileap Gender Equality Global Report and ranking.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric was selected as winner of the 2019 Catalyst award for Attracting and Retaining Women in Schneider Electric India, an initiative that is an integral part of the global Company's diversity and inclusion transformation.\n\n## 4.5.4.9 Focus on France\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nIn 2018, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France (SEI-SEF) signed a new collective agreement setting concrete ambitions and action plans to advance gender balance, combat gender stereotypes, and close pay gaps within the organization. During 2020, the company continued its commitment to making gender equality a reality at work. A strong focus has been put on work-life balance, parenting support measures, and women development. In 2020, almost 100% of men who were eligible for the three weeks secondary parental leave took it at the birth of their child. In addition, to compensate for any potential pay gaps generated during the primary parental leave, every employee returning from this leave had a salary review based on the average salary increase during the period for the same job and qualification.\n\nSEF continued to partner with Elles Bougent (an association of women engineers), C G\u00e9nial Foundation (a foundation promoting STEM jobs), and MEDEF (union of employers) to promote technical roles in schools, with a focus on gender diversity. As of the end of 2020, through this network, 120 women in the Group in technical roles had exchanged with over 2,200 pupils at schools, on Schneider Electric sites or virtually.\n\nLastly, in 2019, a one-year mentoring program was launched with an initial group of 17 high potential women paired with senior leaders. The focus of this program is to increase both the promotion of female talents and their access to leadership positions. To further broaden the development of women, a new program called 'How Women Rise' was launched at the end of 2020. This program aims to enroll 500 women over two years.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nIn June 2018, SEF signed the LGBT+ Charter designed by L'A u t r e Cercle ('The Other Circle'), a non-profit advocating for LGBT+ inclusion in the workplace. Schneider Electric France's (SEF) LGBT+ and Allies network was launched in 2018. The company has committed to participate in 2021 World Pride in Copenhagen and contribute in a conference with L'A u t r e  C e r c l e on 'LGBT+ in the workplace in 2031'.\n\n## Gender diversity - France\n\n## Overall workforce\n\nTotal New Hires\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrontline management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Female\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Male\n- * Total New Hires for 2020 is All New Hires.",

In 2020, the company remained committed to the recruitment of people with disabilities, with the addition of 17 new apprentices and eight new permanent workers.\n\nIn 2020, SEF also put a strong focus on raising awareness of invisible disabilities, including cognitive disabilities, mental illness, and diseases, like diabetes or cancer. The company's campaign included webinars and educational materials, as well as a specific web series on how to reconcile cancer and work. In addition, in order to facilitate better communication and build inclusion in the context of pandemic, all employees with hearing disabilities as well as their co-workers were fitted with 'inclusive masks' that allow visibility of the lower face.\n\n## Generational and socio-economic inclusion\n\nSEF supports employment of students and young professionals from diverse social backgrounds. Through the company's association '100 chances - 100 jobs', personalized career opportunities are offered to 18-30-year-olds without higher education qualifications or degrees. The ambition is to provide at least 60% of candidates with jobs and/or skills training opportunities. As of end 2020, 7,100 young people have been supported. (For more details see subsection 'Social interrogation of disadvantaged young adults in France', page 183).\n\nIn addition, partnering with Tous en Stages association ('Internships for all'), SEF encourages its suppliers and vendors to empower high school students with internships. Virtual internships were tested in 2020, allowing young college students from lower socio-economic districts to learn about different roles and jobs at the company. In 2021, the company is targeting to increase internships from 540 in 2019 to 800.\n\n## Inclusive policies\n\nSEF Family Leave Policy exceeds the Group's minimums by providing up to 21-days secondary parental leave. In addition, the company offers a six-month 80% part-time option (with 90% pay) upon return and 160 childcare spaces. SEF also supports employees' work-life balance through flexibility at work policies:\n\n- \u00b7 More than 5,500 employees subscribed to teleworking;\n- \u00b7 Flexibility for employees as caregivers (specific leave, donation of days between employees, support of internal social workers);\n- \u00b7 Voluntary time off per year for assignments within associations sponsored by the Schneider Electric Foundation.\n\nSEF has raised awareness about the Global Anti-Harassment Policy and has committed to the government-led #StOpE initiative against sexual harassment, along with more than 100 other companies. Starting in 2019, SEF established a network of 50 referents to address sexism, sexual harassment, and LGBT+ phobia cases. These individuals have been equipped and trained to be one of the first points of contact for employees who are victims of such behaviors. In 2020, more than 60 unions members were also trained on sexism, harassment, and LGBT+ phobia prevention.\n\nThrough its internal campaigns on inclusion and mental health, the company increased the awareness of the role of these referents and emphasized the importance of each employee's role to build an inclusive and safe environment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## 4.5.4.10 Focus on the United States\n\n## Leadership investment and Employee Resource Groups\n\nSchneider Electric US established a US Diversity & Inclusion Council in 2020, in an effort to have more focus on diversity topics at the leadership level and better leverage the executives sponsors of Employee Resource Groups (ERG). The council took the decision to make 'Overcoming Hidden Bias' e-learning mandatory for all US employees and going forward, a part of the global Company's Schneider Essentials training package.\n\nSchneider Electric US's ERGs played an important role in 2020 to support, listen, and learn from its employees. With psychological safety at the center of their focus after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the national and local chapters from seven different affinity groups stayed closely connected to the US employees' needs. From Black History month, to International Women's Day, Hispanic Heritage Month, LGBT+ awareness, Veterans Day, and People with Disabilities, the ERG teams created meaningful learning and interpersonal connection despite the remote work environment of 2020.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nSchneider Electric US continues its relationship with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) as a member of the Corporate Partnership Council. In addition to its participation in the virtual career fairs to engage with early career and experienced female talent, the organization created an internal community of SWE members. This new employee community is focused on advancing engagement and participation with SWE to support our female talent's development and exposure while also investing in university talent. The company is committed to SWE's mentoring program for university students and hosting local and national speaking opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric US explored new channels to connect with women in business and expose them to the opportunities at the organization. These new channels included featured content, thought leadership sharing, and job posting on platforms like Power to Fly, Professional Diversity Network, and The Muse.\n\nIn January 2020, the Women in Schneider Electric (WISE) ERG began deployment of a workshop, which was transitioned to a virtual format in March, to support women in reflection, career development planning, best practice sharing, and accountability. This program has expanded to 'Women in Energy', a new external LinkedIn network powered by Schneider Electric.\n\n## Gender diversity - the United States\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Total New Hires for 2020 is All New Hires.\n\n## Generational and socio-economic inclusion\n\nSchneider Electric US supports employment of students and young professionals from diverse social backgrounds and invests in organizations and programs that support their education, development, and exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 SWE Corporate partner;\n- \u00b7 National Association of Black Engineers (NSBE) Affiliate partner;\n- \u00b7 Investment in Historically Black Colleges & Universities;\n- \u00b7 Virtual student experience to engage and provide meaningful and valuable learning experience in place of traditional internship program during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric US is committed to the development and inclusion of its multi-generational talent pool through career development discussions and training opportunities at all stages of their career, as well as mentoring and reverse mentoring programs and networking opportunities.\n\nTo support its employees nearing retirement, Schneider Electric US offered a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) to 1,200 eligible employees. 40% of eligible employees chose to enroll and receive the following early retirement benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 Separation Award: Six months lump sum payment based on current base pay as of the separation date;\n- \u00b7 Benefits: Up to 18 months of medical and dental COBRA premium payments, the first 12 months fully paid by the company and then six months paid at 50%;\n- \u00b7 Incentive: Prorated incentive pay out based on separation date;\n- \u00b7 Full year PTO entitlement paid to each employee enrolling.",

        "page_content": "## Ethnicity and race inclusion\n\nIn response to recent very visible racial injustices in the US, Schneider Electric US launched a rapid response team to look critically at what the organization was doing to be a part of the solution. Schneider Electric US immediately took symbolic actions including a $75,000 donation to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) via the Schneider Electric Foundation and added Martin Luther King Jr Day as an additional US Holiday starting in 2021.\n\nRecognizing the critical need for supporting all employees, especially its black and brown colleagues, Schneider Electric US held a townhall on Racism & Allyship with external speaker Michelle Silverthorn, Founder & CEO of Inclusion Nation, where over 5,000 employees attended the live session virtually.\n\nThis townhall included vulnerable stories shared by some of Schneider Electric US's employees. Senior leaders and the rapid response team members have also executed countless employee and team discussion sessions, as well as launched educational toolkits, learning playlists, and manager workshops.\n\nSchneider Electric US recognizes more work needs to be done. Their ambition for racial inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee populations are reflective of the communities they operate, including at the leadership level;\n- \u00b7 Everyone has equitable opportunities for growth and training they are aware of learning and development programs and have the opportunity to be selected;\n- \u00b7 Everyone feels safe, valued, and respected for who they are they can be their authentic self.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nAs part of the global LGBT+ Awareness Month, senior leaders from the US hosted an all-employee event with its LGBT+ & Allies ERG to provide insight to the challenges faced by members of the LGBT+ community in the workplace. A panel of employees shared their stories and insights on how everyone can act as allies every day through small acts.\n\nSchneider Electric US's inclusive policies, such as the Global Family Leave Policy, ensure that LGBT+ employees and their partners are fully covered. Some of the benefits offered to support the US transgender community include fertility/infertility care, surrogacy, gender reassignment surgeries, and accessible counselling and psychological care through our Employee Assistance Program.\n\n## Inclusive benefits\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted everyone, everywhere. Recognizing this, and with the health and safety of all its people in mind, who are managing an evolving work and life balance, Schneider Electric US introduced several new inclusive benefits in 2020.\n\nIn April, the company launched a Voluntary Part-Time program. Employees were given the opportunity to voluntarily reduce their hours for a short-term period of their choice in one month increments from June through September 2020. This program maintained an employee's full-time benefits and paid time off benefits. 1,000 employees participated in this voluntary part-time program followed by an additional 4,000 employees through a targeted part-time program from April through to the end of the year.\n\nTo continue supporting employee flexibility, Schneider Electric US now offers a full suite of New Ways of Working benefits and perks for 2021 and beyond. These new benefits include: complimentary Care.com membership including five days company-subsidized back-up care for dependents, elderly, or pets; the opportunity to enroll in temporary voluntary part-time hours for three, six, or 12 months at a time; and the chance to purchase additional paid time off to suit each employee's needs.\n\n## Diversity for business: supplier diversity program\n\nSchneider Electric US's supplier diversity program strives to identify, include, and engage qualified diverse suppliers to support the company's goals and provide a level of excellence to all stakeholders. The program is in pursuit of qualified Small Business Enterprise (SBE), Veteran (VET), Minority-Owned Enterprise (MBE), Women-Owned Enterprise (WBE), and Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) suppliers that provide quality products and services at competitive prices.\n\nAs of end of December 2020, 10.9% of Schneider Electric US's suppliers were diverse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## 4.5.4.11 Focus on Greater India (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) Gender inclusion\n\nSince 2015, Schneider Electric Greater India has been implementing a successful holistic approach to build a genderbalanced leadership pipeline. This longstanding focus and multidimensional approach to gender diversity has been recognized globally by the 2019 Catalyst Award.\n\nTo accelerate gender diverse hiring at entry level, Schneider Electric Greater India focuses on campus engagement by leading actions such as Schneider Electric's leaders being guest lecturers, student on-site visits, and college visits and partnerships. For middle level roles, the Mid-Level Infusion project encourages hiring mid-level women from different industries in business roles. For senior level roles, systematic industry mapping ensures that the company attracts potential women leaders.\n\nIn addition, through a program named 'Her Second Innings', Schneider Electric Greater India strives to leverage an untapped talent pool, by hiring women who are looking to re-enter the workforce after a career break. To further build a sustainable female leadership talent pool for the future, along with continuing its robust mentoring program, a sponsorship program was started in 2020.\n\nLastly, the leadership development program 'URJA' (which translates to 'Energy' in English) is designed to harness the leadership skills of mid-career women employees identified as solid potentials. As of end 2020, more than 500 women have participated in the program.\n\n## LGBT+ and disability inclusion\n\nAs inclusion starts with awareness, in 2020, Schneider Electric Greater India celebrated Pride month in June and the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December. Over 600 employees from all parts of the Company took part in these events. Employees increased their awareness through engaging in virtual discussions, with community members and their allies, and in Yammer conversations on LGBT+ and disability inclusion.\n\n## Social impact\n\nAs part of the Schneider Electric Greater India President's personal commitment to the Women Empowerment Principles (WEPs), the organization introduced the Prerna Awards to promote gender equality beyond the workplace. As of end 2020, seven women entrepreneurs with small or medium-sized enterprises have been recognized for empowering women through creating new jobs or making their mark in a male dominated sector.\n\nSchneider Electric Greater India has also developed the Jagriti initiative, which aims to educate school children on gender stereotyping, with employees facilitating these sessions. From 2016 to 2020, 10,000+ children have participated.\n\n## Inclusive policies\n\nAs of end 2020, Schneider Electric Greater India was fully aligned with the Group's Global Family Leave Policy, and in some cases exceeding Group minimums. Employees are also provided with discounted day care centers near office locations.\n\nSchneider Electric Greater India also supports employees through additional leave and flexibility at work policies:\n\n- \u00b7 Advanced sick leave, in case of prolonged sickness;\n- \u00b7 Sabbaticals, for family care at critical times;\n- \u00b7 Voluntary time off, for community volunteering activities;\n- \u00b7 Flexible work policy, with flexible timing for arrival and departure from the office, Work From Home (WFH) in times of exigency, and part-time options.\n\nAs part of Schneider Electric's New Ways of Working, Schneider Electric Greater India announced its work from home infrastructure support policy for all white collar employees. Starting in October 2020, employees working from home can be reimbursed for home broadband internet and for purchases of home office set-up (UPS for WiFi router, desk, and chair).\n\n## Gender diversity - Greater India (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Total New Hires for 2020 is All New Hires",

To support Schneider Electric's mission to create a great place to work and to cater for the diverse needs of its global existing and future workforce, the Company is committed to providing a competitive, inclusive compensation and benefits offering, which attracts, motivates, and retains talent.\n\n## 4.6.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric take its responsibility as a leading employer seriously, and ensure its diverse global workforce is treated in a fair and ethical way. Its inclusive reward portfolio is designed to support employees to be at their best, and it goes beyond pay and benefits. It's a meaningful mix of programs to engage employees, including recognition to celebrate great work, incentives to reward high performance, an award-winning employee share ownership plan, and benefits to suit employees and their dependents.\n\nSchneider Electric ensures that all compensation and benefits decisions and policies are based on these above principles and follow local statutory and collective agreements.\n\nSchneider Electric believes in rewarding, recognizing, and differentiating fairly employees who contribute to the success and live the values of the Company. By putting recognition at the center of a high-performance ambition, employees feel engaged and motivated to do more. Delivering high performance is rewarded by competitive market pay, incentive programs, employee shareholding, and opportunities to grow careers within Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Group offers a portfolio of benefits to care for employees' needs at each life stage. Its diverse and multi-generational workforce is provided with meaningful choices covering a holistic range of well-being, flexibility, and financial protections to provide peace of mind to employees and their dependents.\n\n## 4.6.3 Due diligence and results\n\n## 4.6.3.1 Compensation\n\n## Our job architecture and compensation process\n\nThe company has implemented a global job architecture to support HR processes and programs and to enable Schneider Electric to engage, develop, and move talents across different businesses and geographies. The job architecture provides alignment to market practice and organizational structure to ensure the reward package offered for a role is fair and competitive. This helps working towards creating greater transparency for career development and progression.\n\n## Pay competitively and pay-for-performance\n\nSchneider Electric employees are empowered to receive ongoing feedback, recognition, and coaching from their managers, and their individual performance is assessed in a fair manner based on their goals and behaviors. In line with the Group's pay-forperformance philosophy, the compensation structure typically includes fixed and variable (incentive) elements. Compensation programs and decisions are based on individual performance and behaviors, Company performance, and competitive market positioning.\n\n## Equal pay for equal work\n\nAt Schneider Electric, the basic foundational principles of fairness, equity, ethics, and transparency are fully embedded in our values. Through reward policies and processes, employees are compensated fairly and equitably for the skill set they possess and value contributions as a business imperative. Over the past five years, proactive actions have been taken to not only close existing gender pay gaps, but to prevent gaps from being created in the first place. At the end of 2020, a Pay Equity Framework has been implemented in all countries, covering 99.6% of Schneider's total workforce and exceeding its SSI ambition.\n\nTo ensure accountability and transparency, Schneider Electric conducts quarterly reviews of compensation gaps and actions, both at country and global levels, leveraging analysis from HR data, which covers all key drivers of the employee life cycle from hiring, performance assessment, and salary adjustment to career moves.\n\n## SSI#15: 95% of employees are working in a country with commitment and processes in place to achieve gender pay equity\n\nSchneider Electric has made significant progress in systematically identifying and addressing pay gaps. Today 99.6% of the Company's employees across the 110+ countries where Schneider Electric operates are covered by the global pay equity review framework. Furthermore, the pay equity adjustment is fully integrated into the annual global salary review process, thereby helping managers to make fair and equitable compensation decisions. The pay equity principles are also leveraged during the promotion and hiring processes.\n\n% employees covered in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99.6%",

        "page_content": "## 4. Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## Living wage\n\nIn line with its Human Rights Policy and Principles of Responsibility, Schneider Electric believes earning a decent wage is a basic human right. Schneider Electric is committed to paying employees in the lower salary ranges at or above the living wage to meet their families' basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nIn 2018, Schneider Electric started working with an independent advisor - Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) - to implement its living wage commitment. Schneider Electric has initiated a global process to analyze wage levels and employment practices against local living wage standards set by BSR. At the end of 2019, the analysis had covered 63 countries, reaching 99% of the Schneider Electric footprint. Moving forward into 2020, the COVID-19 crisis highlighted even more strongly the need for a safety net to guarantee a minimum income level for employees. Given the complexity to evaluate and mitigate the macroeconomic impact of the crisis, the Group did not run a gap analysis this year. However, Schneider Electric reiterated its commitment to pay 100% of employees at least a living wage as part of its fair and equitable policies.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the commitment will be audited annually with the support of an independent third party. Schneider Electric also continues to be part of leading companies' coalitions such as G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG), OECD, and the UN Global Compact (Decent Work in Global Supply Chains Action Platform). These global coalitions work together to implement living wage standards within their workforce and their entire ecosystem.\n\n## Short-term incentive\n\nFor employees, the annual short-term incentive is linked with the overall Company performance and individual objectives. It is designed to encourage and motivate employees to deliver on collective ambitions through accountability and collaboration, driving better performance collectively and individually. To promote a superior sales culture, Schneider Electric offers levels of differentiated reward for sales people, focusing on results.\n\nWith a strong sustainability component, annual short-term incentives for the Group's executives and c. 58,000 eligible employees focus on what matters to Schneider Electric. Since 2011, sustainability performance criteria have been embedded in the incentive goals for Group executives. They are directly linked to the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) targets.\n\nFrom 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has increased from 6% to 20% in the collective part of the annual incentive highlighting further the importance of sustainability on Schneider Electric's business agenda. In France, since 2012, the SSI has also been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France. The reduction in the occupational accidents severity rate is also considered in the profit-sharing incentive plans of 27 other French entities.\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nSchneider Electric's long-term incentive plan offers share ownership opportunities to the Group's key talents and critical roles to align their rewards with the interests and experience of Schneider Electric shareholders. Similar to the short-term incentive, a portion of the award under the long-term incentive plan is subject to the achievement of sustainability objectives. From 2020, the long-term sustainability performance is measured through the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI), a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and different from the SSI criteria included in the annual incentive plan. See more details on SSERI in chapter 3.2 (Compensation Report) pages 264 to 299.\n\n## Recognition is in our DNA\n\nEvery day, Schneider Electric employees are making important contributions to help the organization achieve its mission and key business results. The global recognition portal 'Step Up' gives employees a way to formally recognize and celebrate people who consistently demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond. Schneider Electric creates a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues and encourages the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'thank you'.\n\nDuring 2020, Schneider Electric employees continued to deliver and contribute every day. Throughout the year, the recognition culture remained strong, with many employees continuing to utilize the dedicated platform to appreciate and recognize colleagues. In 2020, over 240,000+ recognition moments were recorded, acknowledging Schneider Electric employees living the Core Values around the world.\n\n## 4.6.3.2 Benefits\n\nCompany provided benefits represent a considerable business commitment by Schneider Electric everywhere in the world. Schneider ensures that all employee benefits are locally and globally compliant, as well as market relevant. Because employee benefit plans vary significantly between countries due to different levels of social, tax, and legal regulations, Schneider Electric's benefits portfolio is primarily country-driven and aims at providing similar benefits within a country territory.\n\n## Global benefit standards\n\nSchneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global benefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. These standards cover healthcare, family leave, and life cover and are audited in the SSI.",

        "page_content": "One of Schneider Electric's underlying benefit objectives is to ensure all its employees are equipped to manage their basic health and well-being and to provide adequate security to employees and their dependents. Health and well-being are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its sustainability mission. The Company has a commitment to strive, at a minimum, that 90% of Schneider Electric's employees have access to a comprehensive well-being at work program - translated into a dual standard of access to healthcare and well-being training programs (detailed further in subsection 'Well-being in our DNA', pages 148-149). Access to an inclusive and comprehensive standard of healthcare coverage (outpatient, hospitalization, key health risks/chronic conditions, maternity, children) is defined by local regulations and employment agreements. Schneider Electric also supports its employees with personal time off at critical life stages and this is fully deployed in 100% of countries (detailed further in subsection 'Global Family Leave Policy', page 159). In addition, the Group commits to provide financial security to employee dependents, in the event of an employee's death, in the form of a minimum standard of life assurance coverage of at least a multiple equivalent to one year's salary.\n\nSchneider Electric has reaffirmed and enhanced its existing global benefit standards outlined above for all our employees worldwide, for the duration of the crisis. This included a global extension of care leave from one to two weeks for our employees to care for their dependents diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n## Employee Share Ownership\n\nThe World Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the Group's recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of the Company, at preferred conditions.\n\nIn March 2020, the subscription was cancelled, and focus turned towards short-term priorities, starting with employee health and safety. WESOP will return in 2021 for 40 countries.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the employee shareholding represented 3.6% of Schneider Electric SE's capital and 6.1% of the voting rights. 70% of the Group employee shareholders were located outside of France, of which 13% are in China, 11% in India and 9% in US. This also includes employee shareholding resulting from the long-term incentives grants.\n\n## 4.7 Social dialog and relations\n\n## 4.7.1 Description of risks and opportunities\n\nSocial dialog and freedom of association must be seen within the wider context of Ethics & Responsibility. As a global Company, Schneider Electric is convinced that its responsibility goes beyond compliance with local and international regulations and is committed to conducting its business ethically, sustainably and responsibly.\n\nThe Company is constantly interacting with all the stakeholders throughout the world: its borders are expanding, its environment is changing ever faster, its activities are becoming globalized and its social responsibilities are growing.\n\nThe challenge is to gain and maintain the highest confidence of its stakeholders. To support each employee in this approach, the Group emphasizes the importance of placing responsibility at the heart of its corporate governance.\n\nThe Group currently has around 135,000 employees worldwide. Following the Group's various acquisitions, it has been able to integrate this exceptional professional and cultural diversity.\n\n## 4.7.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric considers freedom of association and collective bargaining as fundamental rights that must be respected everywhere and therefore in its Principles of Responsibility commits to complying with local laws in every country where it operates.\n\nIn its Human Rights Policy, Schneider confirms that it considers freedom of association as the basis of a regular dialog between a company and its employees. To that purpose, Schneider respects the individual right of its employees to freely join, participate in or quit labor organizations to assert and defend their interests. Subsequently, Schneider guarantees that any employee wishing to do so shall be protected against any internal measure limiting his or her freedom of association such as discrimination of any kind, pay loss or dismissal. Schneider also recognizes the importance of dialog with freely appointed employee representatives, employee representative bodies (such as Works Councils or employee forums) or organizations (like trade unions) and supports collective bargaining.\n\nIn addition, Schneider joined the Global Deal initiative in 2017. The Group is promoting social dialogue as a means to foster decent work, quality jobs, increased productivity and, by extension, greater equality and inclusive growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4. Committed to and on behalf of employees\n\n## 4.7.3 Due diligence and results\n\nSocial dialog is managed at country level by the HR leaders with the employee representative bodies and unions, and at transnational level with the European Works Council (EWC) which covers most of geographical Europe. Social dialog is also taken into consideration by the Group's social reporting system, where local HR teams report on the presence of trade unions, works councils and Health and Safety Committee every year.\n\nIn 2014, while changing the corporate form of its parent company, Schneider Electric SA, into a European company ( Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne ), Schneider Electric negotiated an agreement with employee representatives of European countries about the involvement of these countries' employees in the Company's decision-making processes, thus reaffirming its commitment to promoting social dialog at international level.\n\n## 4.7.3.1 European Works Council (EWC)\n\nThe changes that were made in 2014 to the European Works Council in the framework of Schneider Electric SA's transformation into a European Company significantly enhanced the intensity and the impact of social dialog at European level. This European channel for dialog aims at enabling management to make more efficient decisions by giving employee representatives the opportunity to be informed of such decisions and to understand their reasons, as well as to put forward proposals to supplement or improve them.\n\nIt has also fostered the emergence of a strong identity, combining different cultures and having the common aim of working towards social and economic progress within the companies in the Group at European level. The EWC covers all European Economic Area countries (hence all EU member states) and Switzerland, for a total of 43,000 employees.\n\nMoreover, in respect of the spirit of European participation, signed in 2014, and agreed by a large majority of negotiators, a new EWC has been set out with extended powers and resources, and the participation of European employee representatives at board of directors' level has been introduced. It replaced the previous EWC.\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric and IndustriAll Europe signed an innovative Europe-wide agreement, the European agreement on the anticipation and development of competencies and employment with respect to the Schneider business strategy. This agreement is a great opportunity to create a governance for jobs and skills at the Company by anticipating impact and evolution in business in line with current market trends and the Company's ambition. It sets clear objectives for boosting employees' employability, and for enriching the workforce by diversity and digital generation recruitment and reinforces constructive social dialog at European and local level within the Company.\n\nIn 2020, the unprecedented situation disrupted our social dialog at each level of the organisation. This allowed active social dialog at a European level throughout the year, as well as in-depth discussion on key topics. Close-knit social dialogue was maintained with the appropriate employee representative bodies and reinforced our willingness to associate with them more closely in overcoming the crisis. Thus, the company met the European Works Council 23 times, including two digital plenary sessions. The June plenary session was devoted to the appointment of a second employee representative at the Board of Directors of Schneider Electric SE by the EWC.\n\nThe digital November plenary session hosted presentations and discussions on the Company's strategy with Executive Committee members including Schneider Electric's CEO.\n\n## 4.7.3.2 Group Works Council, France\n\nSchneider Electric is organized in France through more than 25 legal entities. However, with 80% employee coverage, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France SAS set the tone for social dialog in France mainly through the Central Works Council and the Group Committee. In 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a series of problems that we were able to resolve through our proven practice of social dialog. Many subjects have been discussed in various forums across the country, from the implementation of health measures to the temporary unemployment scheme through a massive extension of home working following the two lockdowns decided by the French government in March and November 2020.\n\nIn parallel with the health crisis, social dialog has been deployed on other fronts, particularly the management of psychosocial risks for which a Group collective agreement was signed during the first half of the year. The continuous adaptation of manufacturing capacities and the upgrading of skills (so-called GPEC programs) within the Front Office and the Global Supply Chain (support functions) have enabled the company to constantly adapt its skills to the organizational and market challenges to come. During this unprecedented 2020 financial year, social dialog has been a key factor in the resilience of the company in France.\n\n## 4.7.3.3 Social dialog in the United States\n\nIn the US and more generally in North America, regular communication takes place with both union and non-union employees on key business topics and trends affecting their jobs. Company officials meet with key international union leaders on an ongoing basis, and formally on an annual basis, to advise and discuss competitive issues impacting the Company's business, and to ensure alignment with the Company's business strategies/ challenges. In 2020, a common decision with unions was made to extend the contract by one year due to COVID-19 and all of the uncertainty. Local Company officials also meet with location union representatives regarding information targeted to local issues as related to safety and operational strategies.\n\n## 4.7.3.4 Social dialog in Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, Schneider Electric leaders conduct regular communication with employees on topics related to their jobs: this communication takes place in different ways, including large communication meetings and small group conversations. There is also continuous communication with the union leaders and delegates of four national unions which represent unionized employees. Schneider Electric informs them of internal and external issues impacting the Company's results, listens to their concerns and looks for alignment with the Company strategy and challenges. Schneider and the unions review the collective contract every year.",

        "page_content": "In 2018, Schneider Electric Mexico was certified by CEMEFI as a Socially Responsible Company. The mission of CEMEFI is to foster and enhance the culture of philanthropy and social responsibility in Mexico and strengthen the organized and active participation of society in solving community problems. Different topics are evaluated during the certification process, including active labor relations points. In addition to this, each unit/plant proactively leads its own social actions, for example in 2018 the Plant in Tlaxcala state got the Gilberto Rincon Gallardo Inclusive Company Distinction from Federal Labor Authority, for applying a labor inclusion policy for people in vulnerable situations.\n\n## 4.7.3.5 Social dialog in China\n\nSchneider Electric China has over 30 legal entities and more than 100 sites. During 2020, the company fostered active social dialog with joint group efforts. During and post pandemic, Schneider Electric has taken the initiative to provide masks, disinfectant and other prevention materials both for all sites to ensure workplace safety and production resumption. With Labor Unions collaboration, it set up a check if COVID-19 Consolation Fund for impacted employees and their families. Well-being initiatives were also deployed in different offices too. The company has leveraged mobile channels to host nationwide activities such as online walking marathons, photography competitions, E-gift cards as well as wellness virtual trainings. The HR department and Unions have revised the 2020 Employee Handbook, Collective Agreement and passed a new Female Employees Right Protection Agreement to further upskill and reskill employees' job competencies, Schneider Electric China has established its Digital Learning platform, providing mobile access to all employees and external business partners. Moreover, Schneider fulfils its social commitment through Corporate Social Responsibility programs. For instance, the funds raised by the 'Tomorrow Rising Fund' has supported 10 Schneider Electric China Bibo partner schools in poor counties.\n\n## 4.7.3.6 Social dialog in India\n\nSchneider Electric India has a strong culture of social dialog with all employees, unionized and non-unionized. In 2020, Schneider Electric India maintained engaging in equitable industrial relations across its plants and associated establishments.\n\nIndustrial harmony has been achieved through a time-tested collective bargaining process involving unions or through worker representative committees. In some of the plants where there are no recognized unions, this bargaining process is conducted with elected employees on committees such as Welfare (Works Committee), Health & Safety, Canteen, Sports and Transport, etc., including a special committee for women employees and a prevention of sexual harassment committee (fully compliant with the prevention of sexual harassment governance as per local laws), duly represented by employees and external women with specialist knowledge of the subject and with legal backgrounds. These committees provide a platform for employees to represent their concerns, collective grievances and workplace-related issues to the management. All employee engagement programmes are run through these committees with the active participation of every employee.\n\nThe process of social dialog also includes monthly employee communication at plants level, as well as through Quarterly Town Hall communication on Company performance, strategy and challenges. During the pandemic, special provisions were made within factories, including planned employee transportation, medical check-up camps, accommodation facilities near the factory, daily attendance incentives, insurance, adherence to strict sanitization and social distancing protocols and health monitoring on ground. Most of the ideas came through mass communication meetings and employee committee discussions. Special sessions were organized for employees' family members on the world standard safety procedures at the workplace which boosted confidence and encouraged employees to return to work. For driving positive mental well-being, the company leveraged the existing Employee Assistant Program (Saathi) for employees and family members, which became a huge support system. Employees regularly connected with counsellors, read articles on relevant health topics and attended webinars to augment their health preparedness. Campaigns on virtual engagement and collaboration, and leaders connecting in formal and informal settings further ensured that a physical and psychologically safe environment for employees was created.\n\nDigital learning, which has been a priority for many years, was further encouraged during this time. Employees utilized internal virtual global academies with learning interventions on a wide range of topics from leadership to sales to technology, and more.\n\n## 4.7.3.7 Social dialog in Turkey\n\nIn 2020 the company saw great benefits of the policies that were deployed in 2019. The Employee Assistance Program (AVITA) which has the full coverage of the country and all employees, has been a great support to them and their families. 24/7 consultancy has been provided by experts in every field that the employee and/or their family might feel the need to research or seek help. Schneider also organized online sessions on 'How to maintain our wellbeing going though the pandemic' and also parental support sessions on 'How to support our kids', which were received with great appreciation.\n\n2020 also unfortunately saw a serious earthquake in the Aegean part of Turkey where the company has a large plant and a sales office. No employees were hurt during the earthquake, but some did have to leave their house due to the damage while some needed support for the structural strengthening of their building. All Schneider employees came together and provided financial support to those employees in need, supported by a series of psychology sessions too. Thanks to the Schneider Electric Foundation, a campaign was also launched to support children living in tents as a result of the earthquake.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "17 2\n\n## 5.2 Access to Energy program\n\nSchneider Electric launched its Access to Energy program in 2009, with a unique approach combining three dimensions that enrich each other:\n\n- \u00b7 A training & entrepreneurship program aimed at developing skills in the electricity trades and supporting entrepreneurs in this area, in particular women, in order to promote sustainable and inclusive local development.\n- \u00b7 A social and inclusive business, with products and solutions for rural electrification (collective and individual, such as solar lanterns, solar home systems including Pay As You Go feature, solar water pumping systems, microgrids including plug and play containerized solutions, etc.), creating local jobs in distribution, energy services, agriculture, etc., and promoting in particular women's empowerment.\n- \u00b7 Impact investment funds to support local economies in gaining access to energy and reducing energy poverty.\n\nTo date, Schneider Electric has provided energy access solutions to 30 million people, invested in 25 companies, trained more than 281,000 underprivileged people and supported more than 2,800 entrepreneurs. It targets enabling 80 million people access to electricity by 2030, and 1 million people trained, 10,000 trainers trained, 10,000 entrepreneurs supported by 2025.\n\n## 5.2.1 Organization\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Management\n\nThe program is managed by the Sustainability Department; the program's management team is divided into equivalent numbers in France and India:\n\n- \u00b7 An Access to Energy program strategy and performance manager;\n- \u00b7 Two business development directors in charge of marketing of Access to Energy solutions, one for the Asia Pacific zone and one for the Africa, Middle East and South America zone;\n- \u00b7 An offer creation director;\n- \u00b7 An impact investment director who manages or supervises Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA) and Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEA-Asia) and who participates in the governance of the Energy Access Ventures (EAV) funds and Livelihoods Carbon Fund;\n- \u00b7 A training & entrepreneurship director;\n- \u00b7 Access to Energy correspondents in key countries (India, Myanmar, Indonesia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, DRC, Cameroon, Madagascar, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, China, Pakistan, etc.). Their involvement may be part-time or fulltime. They contribute their knowledge of the local context (organization of civil society, local authorities, the private sector, etc.) and guarantee that the project is aligned with local needs. Their presence is of crucial importance for the long-term oversight of projects in which Schneider Electric is involved.\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Rollout\n\nTo achieve its goals, the Access to Energy program operates through its local presence in the countries concerned by energy access issues. With rare exceptions, all projects initiated benefit from monitoring by employees of Schneider Electric entities operating in the countries concerned. These employees constitute a network of key contact people for the design, management and monitoring of electrification projects.\n\n## 5.2.2 Impact investments\n\nIn July 2009, Schneider Electric created an impact investment structure in the form of a variable-capital SAS (simplified joint-stock company), Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA), certified as a social and solidarity-based company (ESUS) with a minimum capital of EUR 3 million.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the following amounts were managed by SEEA:\n\n- \u00b7 EUR 3,000,000 in capital invested by Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 EUR 3,200,000 invested by Schneider Energie Sicav Solidaire (including EUR 500,000 in capital), a mutual fund managing the employee savings scheme for Schneider Electric employees in France;\n- \u00b7 EUR 200,000 of capital invested by Phitrust Impact Investors;\n- \u00b7 EUR 500,000 of capital invested by Mutuelle d'Entreprises Schneider Electric (MESE).\n\nCreated with the support of Cr\u00e9dit Coop\u00e9ratif, the fund's mission is to support the development of entrepreneurial initiatives worldwide that will help the poorest populations obtain access to energy. It invests in specific projects:\n\n- \u00b7 Helping jobless individuals create businesses in the electricity sector;\n- \u00b7 Developing businesses that fight against energy poverty in Europe by promoting energy efficiency and offering efficient housing;\n- \u00b7 Developing businesses that provide access to energy in rural or suburban areas in emerging countries;\n- \u00b7 Supporting the deployment of innovative energy access solutions that use renewable energies for underprivileged people.\n\nThe SEEA fund brings together different stakeholders by encouraging Schneider Electric's employees and business partners around the world to play an active role in this commitment. At the end of August 2020, 6,280 (past or present) Group employees in France showed their interest in the Access to Energy program by investing EUR 42.3 million.\n\nThe aim of the SEEA fund is to promote development while protecting the assets under management. Accordingly, it has adopted strict management rules, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Always invest in partnerships with recognized players;\n- \u00b7 Never take a majority stake; and\n- \u00b7 Always provide efficient company support (help develop a business plan, technical advice, etc.) to deliver the optimum social impact while minimizing risk.",

        "page_content": "In 2018, the Solar Home Systems (SHS) range grew with the launch of Homaya Hybrid, designed to enable access to quality, affordable and especially uninterrupted power.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric launched a pay-as-you-go solar home system that is fully compatible with all mobile payment platforms and does not require a mobile network connection: Homaya PayG.\n\nVillaya Microgrids are solar-powered microgrids configured to meet collective needs, both villages and businesses, in remote sites. They are either 100 % solar or hybrid, with no power limitation. In 2018, a new offering was launched with containerized solutions to facilitate the deployment and implementation of microgrids in the most remote areas.\n\nIn April 2018, Schneider unveiled EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access, an affordable, flexible and open platform that uses analytics to improve the profitability and efficiency of electricity microgrids. Based on Villaya, EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access combines the software tools EcoStruxure \u2122 Energy Access Advisor and EcoStruxure \u2122 Energy Access Expert. This solution is used for realtime monitoring and analytics of site performance and household consumption. It also improves operational efficiency and drives the deployment and upgrade of microgrids.\n\n## 5.2.3.2 Electricity for emergency\n\nWhether due to the geopolitical context, natural disasters or climate change, emergency situations continue to rise in an increasingly uncertain world. With nearly 80 million forcibly displaced people in 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has seen an unprecedented number of people uprooted by war, violence or persecution worldwide. According to the NGO Oxfam, an estimated 23.5 million people were forced to leave their homes in 2016 due to extreme natural disasters. Since 2016, Schneider Electric has committed to offering energy access solutions in emergency situations and has been working closely with the UNHCR to find solutions that are suited to the specific needs of refugees or displaced persons. In 2018, Schneider and the UNHCR signed a memorandum of agreement to seal their commitment with the deployment of Mobiya lamps in refugee camps over a three-year period. Schneider has provided camps in Jordan, Uganda, Kenya, Chad, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe with modern energy systems and services. Such systems and services range from Mobiya lamps to microgrids - including with connection to EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access - energy dispensers, solar street lights, and training in electricity trades.\n\nSchneider Electric consolidated its emergency solutions with the launch of Villaya Emergency, a collective solar electrification solution that is easily deployed thanks to a system that combines the Group's most appropriate solutions with the expertise of innovative start-ups. The system devised produces a minimum electrical power of ten kilowatt-hours - enough to provide electricity to a village, a health center or individual or collective spaces in refugee camps - thanks to a system of solar panels that are easy to deploy and move. The solution is installed in a standard container to facilitate multiple trips to any part of the world within the shortest possible time.\n\n## 5.2.3.3 Electricity for women\n\nIn developing countries, women are the primary beneficiaries of access to electricity in their homes, relieving them of long and painful domestic activities. Access to electricity, including with mini-grids, can significantly increase women's empowerment, particularly in female-dominated, labor-intensive agricultural and food-processing activities.\n\n- \u00b7 In the village of Donvagne in the Ivory Coast, Schneider Electric has equipped the women cooperative with a 25 kW solar mini-grid powering a mill, kneaders and refrigerators. Cooperative members and entrepreneurs from the village have been trained by Institut Europ\u00e9en de Coop\u00e9ration et de D\u00e9veloppement (IECD).\n- \u00b7 In Nigeria, Schneider partners with Solar Sister NGO, whose network of women entrepreneurs distributes Mobiya solar lanterns. These women entrepreneurs sell the lamps to vulnerable and underprivileged women.\n\n## 5.2.3.4 Electricity for education\n\nFor Schneider Electric, professionals must be supported by training in energy management from educational institutions through to vocational and continuing education worldwide. In partnership with the Access to Energy Training & Entrepreneurship teams (see next section), an affordable range of Access to Energy Education teaching models and teaching tools has been developed to meet the needs of training organizations, particularly in emerging countries. The training offering covers the management of high and low voltage electrical distribution, building management, global energy management and process and machine management.\n\n## 5.2.3.5 Electricity for agriculture\n\nElectricity can make a real difference to the lives of farmers and ensure food security through irrigation, food storage and processing, or linking to the market to ensure better prices, while allowing people to be the agents of their own transformation.\n\nIn India, the 'Energy for livelihoods' initiative is transforming the lives of farmers, in particular women, through the innovative Villaya Agri-business solution. This project promotes sustainable livelihood activities in the farming, agri-enterprises, food processing, livestock, handicraft and other micro-enterprises.\n\n## 5.2.3.6 Electricity for health\n\nSustainable and reliable electricity is a prerequisite for enabling effective health services, especially in the fight against pandemics such as COVID-19. Providing local infrastructures with modern energy also contributes to socio-economic recovery through a better health, a greater capacity to work and enhances rural appeal.\n\nIn Nigeria, the COVID-19 isolation facility of the Eleme General Hospital in Rivers State needed a reliable system to provide uninterrupted power supply to its medical equipment. Schneider Electric supplied a solar mini-grid and power storage.\n\n## SSI#19: x4 turnover of the Access to Energy program\n\nIn West Africa, a tripartite contract signed with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) and the African Biofuel and Renewable Energy Company (SABERABREC) provides for the delivery of 'multi-energy' power plants for the agricultural sector, supplying electricity and heat for irrigation, fish farming or drying, processing or pasteurization activities. In the long term, these plants will benefit some 100,000 people in eight countries.\n\nTurnover vs 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nx1.64",

        "page_content": "## 5. Schneider Electric, an eco-citizen company\n\n## 5.2.4 Training & Entrepreneurship\n\nThe key challenge of training in the energy sector is to provide underprivileged people with the knowledge and skills to be able to carry out a trade in a safe and responsible way, providing them and their families with the means for satisfactory subsistence. It will also give them the ability, should they wish, to sell and maintain energy access offerings and to create their own small business in time. Furthermore, they are a vital and indispensable element for all responsible and sustainable rural electrification policies.\n\nSchneider Electric's strategy, backed by its Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France, for training to underprivileged populations in the energy sector, includes three key priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Basic training over a few months, which is free and accessible to many people and adapted as much as possible to the local situation. These training courses lead to the issuing of a certificate of competence by Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 Single or multi-year trainings leading to qualifications, in partnership with local Ministries of Education, or even under bilateral agreements; and\n- \u00b7 The training of trainers to support the effective and quality rollout of training down the line.\n\nCapitalizing on the results of its trainings, the Access to Energy Training & entrepreneurship program decided to go further by supporting social and informal entrepreneurs in the energy sector. Job markets in emerging and developing economies are strongly influenced by the importance of the informal sector, sub-activity or multi-activity in order to accumulate sources of income. Training in the specific skills needed by the entrepreneur - start-up support, support, and financing - are key to creating sustainable activities. In particular, Schneider Electric tries to support women's entrepreneurship in the energy sector, integrate them at every step of the energy access value chain, and find the right partners to create a supportive ecosystem.\n\nThese actions are always implemented in partnership with local players and/or national or international non-profit organizations (NGOs, governments, etc.). They systematically work with Schneider Electric's local subsidiary. The actions may be accompanied by funding for investments in materials and missions of the volunteers of VolunteerIn, which, if the need arises, enables the transfer of expertise.\n\nIn 2020, training was severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in the closure or suspension of several training courses. With its commitment to education and young people, Schneider Electric and its Foundation launched the Tomorrow Rising fund in April 2020. Thanks to this fund, we were able to support embattled centers and launch new programs. This included launching three new training centers: one in Nepal with Don Bosco, another in Ecuador with the UESMA training center and ACTEC, and the third in Morocco with IECD. In total, more than 600 young people were trained in energy trades in the three centers.\n\n## 5.2.4.1 Examples of actions supporting women\n\nIn Mali, Senegal and Niger, within the 'Women's Entrepreneurship in Renewable Energy' EU project, Schneider Electric provides technical training in solar energy and support for entrepreneurship to 7,000 women entrepreneurs in partnership with Plan International .\n\nIn the Ivory Coast, Schneider assists in the training of 1,250 young people in solar and electrical trades, including 60% women, and supports entrepreneurs, in partnership with International Rescue Committee and MasterCard Foundation.\n\n## 5.2.4.2 Examples of actions towards Entrepreneurs\n\nSince 2017, 52 technical laboratories in electricity and energy management have been upgraded in Pakistan's Punjab province. 6,200 youths have been trained and 1,890 have become entrepreneurs. This project was financed by Schneider Electric and implemented in Pakistan by Muslim Hands Pakistan (as the lead agency) in partnership with the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) Punjab and Punjab Vocational Training Council (PVTC), to improve and expand vocational training in Pakistan's dynamic energy sector.\n\nSince 2018, Schneider Electric and Initiative France have launched a program to support entrepreneurship in energy businesses in Burkina Faso. They have provided support to nearly 80 informal entrepreneurs in the energy sector. The program includes a training course to acquire the technical skills of the profession, financing solutions with the granting of interest-free honor loans, and the setting up of a business creation financing system. Initiative France draws on the four Initiative platforms in Burkina Faso to contribute to the financing and support of entrepreneurial creation or development projects in the country. Schneider and the partner training centers in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, under the aegis of Fondation de France, provide technical training to entrepreneurs. The Schneider Foundation finances interest-free honor loans and support to entrepreneurs. As the honor loans are paid back, other entrepreneurs take their place. In addition, a mentorship program can also be set up to support entrepreneurs in their strategic thinking.\n\n## SSI#20: 400,000 underprivileged people trained in energy management\n\nIn Indonesia, the Center of Excellence for electricity, automation and renewable energies trains technicians and senior technicians in electrical energy, industrial automation, and renewable energies. The aim is to reinforce the links between education and industry, raise the level of the workforce with high-quality practical training, enhance the company's expertise, rapidly modernize vocational training systems, and promote the professional integration of the youth. The purpose of this partnership is also to renovate 184 vocational school laboratories across the country in partnership with the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture and the French Ministry of Education and Youth. More than 5,500 students have already benefited from this partnership since 2019.\n\nPeople trained worldwide since 2009\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Center of Excellence will be equipped with the latest technical facilities for the professional training of trainers in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency. A network of eight peripheral centers across Argentinian using the Center of Excellence for technical training in Buenos Aires as a model will be also created. The MECCyT plans to train 500 trainers in three years and 800 students per academic year at the Buenos Aires Center of Excellence.\n\n## 5.2.4.4 Testimonies of people trained\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric continued to promote Tomorrow Rising, a five-episode docuseries made up of concrete testimonies. It presented the stories of four students who are building tomorrow's energy world each in their own way:\n\n- \u00b7 Y\u00e9y\u00e9 is the narrator and her ambition is to become a respected engineer. The documentary follows her from the beginning of her training in Lagos, Nigeria, to her diploma;\n- \u00b7 Pierre, in Senegal, has been trained to be a teacher and is now fighting to improve the future of youth in his country;\n- \u00b7 For Vitor, in Brazil, Schneider's training has been a genuine lifeline helping him build a career in electricity;\n- \u00b7 Lastly, in India, Gurdeep, an ambitious young entrepreneur installs solar panels and employs young people, like him, benefitting from Schneider Electric training.\n\nSince starting the program in 2009, 281,737 people have been trained in more than 46 countries.\n\n## Access to Energy Training & Entrepreneurship key figures and 2025 targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBreakdown of people trained by geography since 2009\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Schneider Electric, an eco-citizen company\n\n## 5.2.4.5 Impact assessment of training actions\n\nIn 2019, the Schneider Electric Foundation launched a global initiative to assess the social impact of training actions in the energy sector. With its partner KiMSO, the Group built a guidebook intended to support its local partners in assessing, in a standardized way, the social impact of their training activities. The pilot phase was carried in several centers. The rollout program was shelved because of the health crisis, leading to the temporary closure of many centers. KiMSO is a social impact assessment consulting firm that helps charities, NGOs and Foundations to understand, measure and value their impact on key stakeholders.\n\nThe project covers both social impact assessment and results chain analysis.\n\nSocial impact consists of the direct or indirect, intended or unintended, effects of an organization's actions on its stakeholders (i.e., beneficiaries, users, volunteers, partners) and on society in general.\n\nSocial impact assessment refers to the process of monitoring, analyzing, and managing those social consequences, which can be both positive and negative. This is an evaluative process aiming at a answering the following key question: what changes thanks to us?\n\nResults chain analysis establishes causual relationships from the resources used to conduct a program to the long-term effects following the end of the program. It sets out a logical and plausible outline of how a sequence of inputs and outputs interacts with individuals' behavior and conditions to generate outcomes.\n\n## 5.2.4.6 Outlook\n\nThe large-scale expansion of the training projects initiated in 2013 will continue with the objective of training one million people, providing support to 10,000 entrepreneurs, and training 10,000 trainers by 2025.\n\nNabil Zorkot\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.3 The Schneider Electric Foundation\n\nAt a time of growing inequality and climate emergency, ensuring fair access to energy is an imperative prerequisite for sustainability. All over the world, the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France, gives all young people the means to build solutions for a better life by supporting local initiatives that combine education, technology, social innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n## Inequalities everywhere, at all levels\n\nWhether it is income inequality, unequal access to education, quality of life, gender inequality, intergenerational inequality, or the gap between the rich and the poor, there are inequalities at all levels and everywhere worldwide. According to data from the World Inequality Database, collected by 150 researchers worldwide, the world's richest 1% owned 20% of the global wealth in 2020, while 50% of the world's poorest people shared 9% of global wealth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2018, an American consumed 24 times more energy on average than a Senegalese. It is estimated that more than 50 million people in Europe are experiencing energy poverty (according to the EU Energy Poverty Observatory). They suffer the consequences of poorly insulated housing - difficulties in paying their energy bills, extreme temperatures, diseases linked to unhealthy living conditions, difficulty providing lighting for children to do their homework, etc.\n\n## The climate emergency and COVID-19 are going to exacerbate these inequalities\n\nIncrease in agricultural product prices, difficulties in access to water, and forced migration, are all consequences of climate change that will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Although extreme poverty has declined over the past 40 or so years, the COVID-19 crisis has seriously set back this progress. In December 2020, a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warned that the pandemic was going to plunge 32 million more people into extreme poverty.\n\n## 5.3.1 The Schneider Electric Foundation gives all young people the means to build solutions for a better life\n\n## 5.3.1.1 The Foundation fully in line with the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nFor more than 20 years, the Schneider Electric Foundation has been deploying the Group's philanthropic activities in coherence with its sustainability commitments. It contributes directly to the achievement of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), and more specifically SDGs 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 17.\n\nIn 2020, there were more than 130 projects, 35,000 young people receiving support, through 7,048 days of volunteering. With an annual budget of EUR 4 million, the Schneider Electric Foundation contributes to the partnerships that are completed by more than EUR 16 million in support from Schneider Electric's entities. Group employees are also involved in these partnerships. In total, more than EUR 20 million has been invested to help local communities worldwide.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.1.2 A foundation under the aegis of Fondation de France\n\nFondation de France is a non-profit organization that, since its creation in 1969, has been the bridge between donors, founders, and field structures in order to support projects in a range of general-interest areas. It supports other foundations (779 in 2020), whose operations are governed separately, but who are legally part of Fondation de France. It is responsible for ensuring that their actions comply with its by-laws and the legal framework of the sponsorship. The Schneider Electric Foundation's Executive Committee determines the major focuses of its actions and the projects it supports. It then informs Fondation de France of its decisions, and Fondation de France verifies the projects' compliance and implements them.\n\n## 5.3.1.3 An organization that combines internal (Group) and external expertise\n\nThe composition of the Schneider Electric Foundation's Executive Committee was renewed in 2019 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Chairman: Jean-Pascal Tricoire;\n- \u00b7 Members: Monique Barbut (external expert), Agn\u00e8s Bouffard (employee representative, Schneider Electric), B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte FaivreTavignot (external expert), Christel Heydemann (Schneider Electric), Yoann Kassi-Vivier (external expert), David Lechat (employee representative, Schneider Electric), Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Mourier (external expert), Philippe Pelletier (external expert) and Luc R\u00e9mont (Schneider Electric).\n\nIts missions are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Define the strategic directions of the Foundation;\n- \u00b7 Validate the activity report and financial report;\n- \u00b7 Decide on the allocation of budgets by program;\n- \u00b7 Validate commitments exceeding EUR 200,000.\n\nOne to two executive committee meetings are organized each year.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation organization has been reinforced with the creation of the zone/cluster foundation committee in 2019. This committee is made up of zone/cluster Presidents and aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Share a quarterly activity report;\n- \u00b7 Validate the commitments/Partners to join;\n- \u00b7 Specify the respective contribution levels (financial or in-kind donations, skills); and\n- \u00b7 Follow up on projects.\n\nThis committee meets three times a year.\n\nThe members of the operational team are:\n\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches, General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Patricia Benchenna, Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Brigitte Antoine, Employee Engagement Leader;\n- \u00b7 Morgane Lasserre, Administrative Assistant.\n\nLastly, the Foundation's Selection Committee is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches, General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Patricia Benchenna, Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Fran\u00e7ois Milioni, Program Director, Training & Entrepreneurship.\n\n## 5.3.2 Give all young people the means to build solutions for a better life\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation supports innovative initiatives all over the world that enable the most vulnerable, especially young people, to access the energy needed to succeed and build the world of tomorrow. To be relevant and effective, i.e., to have the greatest possible impact and respond specifically to the needs of the people concerned, it is essential that these initiatives combine education, technological innovation, social innovation and entrepreneurship. These initiatives cover three main areas.\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Vocational training for the youth, underprivileged persons and entrepreneurship support\n\nTraining is the historical mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation. The energy sector, and more particularly electricity and renewable energies, offers a lot of potential, especially in areas where access to energy is difficult and growing. Passing on skills to young people, and giving them the means to support their families could, in the long term, boost the local electricity and electrotechnical sectors. This will improve their quality of life and create sustainable jobs. That is what the Training & Entrepreneurship program set up in 2009 is all about.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation encourages and provides long-term support for vocational and entrepreneurial training organizations. These include associations and electrical profession educational institutions. The vocational training and entrepreneurship program captures 63% of the funding allocated by the Foundation. All of these actions are monitored and measured on a quarterly basis within the scope of the Schneider Sustainability Impact and of indicator 20, '400,000 underprivileged people trained in energy management by 2020.'\n\nSince 2009, 281,737 underprivileged people have been trained in more than 45 countries. The goal is to train 1 million people by 2025.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Tackling energy poverty\n\nIn Europe, the Schneider Electric Foundation supports the implementation of information and awareness-raising campaigns, and supporting actions that target households faced with energy poverty with:\n\n- \u00b7 Multiparty programs that make it possible to better understand the phenomenon of energy poverty, to bring about solutions, and to connect players;\n- \u00b7 Projects to support families affected by energy poverty; and\n- \u00b7 Projects that seek to develop social innovations and social entrepreneurship.\n\nRegarding the last point, the main idea is to give priority to longterm and therefore future economically viable solutions. This will demonstrate that tackling energy poverty can not only lift people out from difficult situations resulting from substandard housing, but that it can also create jobs and generate economic value while protecting the environment. For example, since 2015, the Schneider Electric Foundation has been supporting R\u00e9seau Eco Habita t, a network that helps those most in need. In the Hauts de France region, R\u00e9seau Eco Habitat has succeeded in implementing an economically viable model, enabling the renovation of housing units using bio-sourced materials. About a dozen jobs have been created as a result, not to mention jobs for the artisans and renovation companies involved. This model is going to be replicated in other regions in France, thus extending its impact. Like R\u00e9seau Eco Habita t, the Schneider Electric Foundation supported and/or financed more than 20 projects in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Schneider Electric, an eco-citizen company\n\nOne of the objectives of the program to tackle energy poverty also includes supporting initiatives in their change of scale, in particular by enabling them to obtain longer-term financing from Schneider Electric's solidarity investment fund, SEEA, like R\u00e9seau Eco Habitat in 2020.\n\n## 5.3.2.3 Raising awareness of sustainability and the use of reliable, affordable and clean energy\n\nContributing to meeting the United Nations SDGs also involves, amongst other things, raising awareness among as many people as possible, especially young people, about the challenges of the fight against climate change and of sustainability.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation therefore invests in emblematic and international programs by making available its knowledge of energy systems management, through donations in resources and/ or knowledge. It has made a four-year commitment to the Solar Impulse Foundation, which selects 1,000 solutions that contribute to the achievement of at least five SDGs:\n\n- \u00b7 Clean, accessible water for all (SDG 6);\n- \u00b7 Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7);\n- \u00b7 Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9);\n- \u00b7 Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); and\n- \u00b7 Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).\n\nThe selected solutions must meet the following criteria: technical feasibility, environmental benefits and economic viability. Schneider Electric employees are mobilizing their skills to analyze the various solutions within their field of expertise.\n\nThe Solar Sound System project by Atelier 21, a Foundation partner, obtained the Solar Impulse Efficient label. It offers sound systems for events powered by renewable energies (solar or bike-powered). With seven systems in place in France and Switzerland, Solar Sound System has set up solidarity projects in Haiti, Brazil, India, Taiwan and Cameroon and has projects in Reunion, the United States and South Africa.\n\n## Tomorrow Rising fund key figures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n74 projects in 67 countries\n\n1,500,000\n\nbeneficiaries\n\n10,000\n\ndonors\n\n4,100,015 euros\n\n## Recovery:\n\nBertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, will then promote this portfolio of solutions to corporate and political leaders worldwide. At the end of 2020, more than 850 solutions had already received the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label. These included insulating blocks made from hempcrete, wind turbine floats or a web-based pallet exchange platform.\n\n## 5.3.3 Responding to the COVID and post-COVID emergency\n\nIn April 2020, the Schneider Electric Foundation set up the Tomorrow Rising fund in response to the COVID-19 health crisis. The purpose of this global initiative is to provide local responses to meet the challenges of the emergency, to promote the recovery of education and training of the most vulnerable young people and to boost resilience.\n\n- 1 Response: an initial response to the emergency. Food bank, first aid, COVID health kits, maintenance of access to education, etc. For example, a project in China to help lowincome students in technical schools to cope better with the crisis (SDG 1 and SDG 4);\n- 2 Recovery: support to the Foundation's partners in resuming their activity and helping them to roll out new activities, in particular, the establishment of new partnerships to provide training in energy trades to young people. For example, a project in Brazil to provide young people with tablets and Internet access (SDG 4 and SDG 10);\n- 3 Resilience: the ability to continue to train and awarenessraising actions using digital technologies.\n\nIn October 2020, more than 74 initiatives, contributing to 1,500,000 beneficiaries in 67 countries, were identified by the Schneider Electric Foundation delegates and validated by the Schneider Electric chairman of each country concerned.\n\nThe first recovery projects have already been launched in Morocco, Ecuador, Lebanon, and Brazil and more than 5,000 days of volunteering have been deployed.\n\n## Resilience:\n\nContributing to the urgent restart of the education system to prepare the future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpening of training centres from last quarter 2020 to 2nd quarter 2021:\n\nMorocco,\n\nNepal,\n\nMalawi,\n\nKenya,\n\nLebanon,\n\nBrazil,\n\nSri Lanka\n\n4,773 volunteering days since April 2020\n\n- +1,000 digital missions available on VolunteerIn in Argentina, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, France, India, Kazakhstan Kenya, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Vietnam, US, etc.\n\nVolunteering on a regular basis, with time and skills",

Women represented 665 of the candidates trained as electricians in 2019. 28 new electricity and renewable energy training centers were opened. 144 trainers were recruited in the program to improve the training given. 'Start-up tool kits' were distributed to 500 students.\n\n6,000 families living in remote rural villages or slums received aid from SEIF. For example, as part of the 'Slum Lighting' program, 368 households in the slums of Bangalore and 632 isolated families in the state of Andhra Pradesh received solar lighting and mobile phone charging equipment.\n\nSchneider Electric employees carried out 207 training assignments as part of the Schneider Electric VolunteerIn initiative. They shared their knowledge and skills with young people training as electricians. Most of these assignments were carried out remotely via a digital platform.\n\nLastly, during the COVID-19 crisis:\n\n- \u00b7 SEIF gave financial support to 10,000 electricians during the lockdown;\n- \u00b7 SEIF provided reliable power supply for the medical equipment of ten 'COVID' hospitals;\n- \u00b7 SEIF has contributed 50 million rupees (EUR 555,000) to the Indian Government's Care Fund.\n\n## 5.3.5 Support grassroots initiatives: a network structure that acts locally\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation's network structure is an original and very powerful means for engaging local, human and lasting sponsorship. This network includes Schneider Electric employees, non-profit associations, public institutions such as the Education ministries of the countries concerned and government agencies such as ADEME in France.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation:\n\n- \u00b7 Has established partnerships with 160 NGOs and associations in 72 countries, such as Muslim Hands in Pakistan, Ashoka in Europe, etc;\n- \u00b7 Works with ministries of education in 13 countries including France, Cambodia and South Africa.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation works almost exclusively with local structures. It is a guarantee of reliability and efficiency because only organizations that work most closely with the communities to be supported know their specific needs and constraints and can provide the appropriate solutions. The creation of the zone/cluster committee, in 2019, made up of Schneider Electric zone directors is a step in that direction.\n\nOver and above financial, material or logistics support for projects, the actions of the Schneider Electric Foundation aim to create bonds among partners, encourage structures to work together, and build relevant and innovative solutions with all stakeholders to raise the challenges of sustainability.\n\n## 5.3.6 Group employees, spearheading the Schneider Electric Foundation's actions\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation strongly focuses on the involvement of Company employees in all the actions it implements. Whether they are Foundation delegates or employee volunteers, they are the link between the Company, the Foundation and the supported organizations. In 2012, the Schneider Electric VolunteerIn NGO was created to organize volunteer missions benefiting the Foundation's partners. Wherever the Company is based, Schneider Electric VolunteerIn empowers people to be actors and ambassadors of societal commitments in the fields of education, access to energy, and the fight against energy poverty. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Employees volunteer their time and make their skills available;\n- \u00b7 Partners look for skills to support their activities, specify their needs and support volunteers in carrying out their mission;\n- \u00b7 The Schneider VolunteerIn association as well as the Foundation delegates coordinate, connect and organize the process and cover costs related to carrying out missions, in particular abroad;\n- \u00b7 The Schneider Electric entities host the volunteers when the mission takes place outside their country of habitual residence.",

        "page_content": "## SSI#21: 15,000 Volunteering days thanks to our VolunteerIn global platform\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric employees increased their engagement with the Schneider Electric Foundation. The pandemic raised a lot of fragilities in our society. In this difficult period, volunteers at Schneider Electric have accelerated their contribution to initiatives aiming at access to food, to education and to health. Mainly through digital/ remote missions, they proved their capacity to adapt and to help the most vulnerable; above all the youth in need of support, coaching, advices\u2026With a total 7,048 volunteering days in 2020, the final objective of 15,000 volunteering days has been overcome with a total of 18,469 during the period.\n\nVolunteering days since 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Schneider Electric VolunteerIn Executive Board is composed of Schneider Electric leaders and members of the Sustainability department involved in the Access to Energy program:\n\n- \u00b7 Olivier Blum (Chairman, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer);\n- \u00b7 Michel Crochon (Vice-president), Fran\u00e7ois Milioni (secretary, in charge of the Training & Entrepreneurship program);\n- \u00b7 Christophe Poline (treasurer, in charge of the SEEA solidarity investment fund);\n- \u00b7 Emir Boumediene (member, volunteer representative);\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches (member, Senior Vice-President Sustainability).\n\nThe executive board met 3 times in 2020.\n\n## 5.3.6.1 100 delegates in 80 countries to catalyze the Schneider Electric Foundation's actions\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 100 volunteer employees, also known as delegates, covering 80 countries. Their role is to select local partners in the fields of vocational training in the energy sector, entrepreneurship, the fight against energy poverty, and raising sustainability awareness. They inform the employees of their entity, as well as the Foundation. They follow the progress of the projects after they have been launched. Each proposed project is subject to a review process based on administrative and financial data by the Schneider Electric Foundation and by Fondation de France before funds are released.\n\nThe delegates manage a digital platform, VolunteerIn, that groups together all the missions proposed by the Foundation locally and internationally. Available in eight languages, the platform can be accessed from anywhere in the world and enables employees to apply for volunteer assignments for the benefit of the Foundation's partners and their beneficiaries.\n\nFinally, the delegates coordinate the organization of the Schneider Electric Foundation's campaigns for international mobilization such as the Tomorrow Rising fund. This showcases local initiatives to a global audience. They also engage in campaigns organized following natural disasters.\n\nEach year, around 35,000 employees in 50 countries take part in these campaigns.\n\n## 5.3.6.2 Standardize measurement to improve the impact and coherence of actions in favor of sustainability\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation is a ground-breaker in the measurement of the social impact of the actions that it supports. The idea is to enable its partners to better fulfill their missions by identifying areas for improvement.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation is assisted in particular by KiMSO, a social impact assessment consulting firm. A first study was conducted in 2018, as part of the fight against energy poverty, to draw up an innovative methodology to assess the social impact of missions. This methodology is placed at the disposal of project sponsors. Cler, the Energy Transition Network, has used this methodology.\n\nMore recently, KiMSO conducted an impact study of the Tomorrow Rising project. From now on, all training projects with a budget in excess of EUR 20,000 will be systematically assessed.\n\n## 5.4 Territorial positioning and impact on economic and social development in France\n\nWherever it operates, Schneider Electric makes a strong commitment to community partners and civil society through positioning itself in a way that is indispensable for a global enterprise that wants to keep in touch with the labor markets of its industrial locations. Numerous projects under way and on the drawing board demonstrate Schneider Electric's desire to be engaged, notably in the area of employment, and to contribute fully to local economic development.\n\n## 5.4.1 Business creation and takeover support in France\n\nFor more than 26 years, Schneider Electric in France has supported employee projects to create businesses or business takeovers through Schneider Initiatives Entrepreneurs (SIE), through a dedicated structure ( Pass Cr\u00e9ations ) demonstrating the Group's commitment to its local labor markets: promoting actions to support local economic development, and proposing and supporting volunteer employees in reliable career paths that are external to the Group. It comes resolutely within the development of a spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\nSIE provides support for Schneider Electric employees at all stages of business creation, as well as afterward, with a follow-up period of three years. Sustainability rates at three years remain above 85%.\n\nSIE's dedicated team of seasoned managers and young work/ study participants are responsible for reviewing the financial, legal, technical and commercial aspects of business creation or company purchase projects to ensure they are viable and sustainable.",

        "page_content": "Since 1994, 1,830 projects have been supported, and 1,597 of them have resulted in the creation or takeover of a business: these include electricians, bakers, organic trades, consultants, asset managers, florists, etc., creating more than 3,885 jobs (employees recruited by the founders to support company growth).\n\nThe SIE structure is represented directly or indirectly in local business networks and enhances the quality of services offered through partnerships with associations such as R\u00e9seaux Entreprendre, France Initiative and other local structures.\n\nThanks to SIE's expertise in entrepreneurship, it is regularly called upon to develop training courses in this field. SIE is highly active in the promotion of spin-offs (business creation and takeover support for employees), in particular through the DIESE association made up of other major groups.\n\nSince 2008, SEI teams have showcased and rewarded the six most creative projects for company creation or takeover by employees of the Group through the Vivez l'Aventure competition. This competition and the prize-giving bring together many managers from the Group as well as political and economic figures. This event is an opportunity to reaffirm the important role this scheme plays in the Group's values and strategy.\n\n## 5.4.2 Economic development of territories\n\nThe SIE teams manage many actions to contribute to local economic development, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Specific missions within the fabric of the local SMEs (small and medium enterprises) carried out by Schneider Electric senior experts or missions in the framework of skills-based sponsorship ( Aliz\u00e9 system );\n- \u00b7 Pass Comp\u00e9tences, which allows experienced managers to take long-term assignments with SMEs. These experts invest in structuring and strategic development projects for SMEs;\n- \u00b7 Support for organizations dedicated to the creation of activities and companies ( R\u00e9seau Entreprendre, France Initiative , etc.); and\n- \u00b7 A club of companies that brings together the main French industrials (CIADEL) to support actions in favor of the local economy by their combined means and shared experiences.\n\nOther organizations such as ADIE (Association for the Right to Economic Initiative) are also financially supported by the provision of seconded employees under a skills sponsorship scheme.\n\n## 5.4.3 Giving support to associations and NGOs\n\nSIE supports employees who want a career path external to the Group within the framework of a skills-based sponsorship system called Pass Associations . This system enables employees to work on defining projects with partner associations or NGOs for one or two years. It encompasses all types of professions, and there are some thirty effective assignments each year.\n\nThese specific systems are valued and taken into account in human resources processes and management in France.\n\n## 5.4.4 Revitalization of local employment pools\n\nThe pilot SIE structure was used to implement the revitalization actions put in place during the industrial development of certain local labor markets. The involvement of teams in local economic networks optimizes the allocation of resources where they are most needed under these agreements.\n\n## 5.4.5 Social integration of disadvantaged young adults in France\n\nDiversity of backgrounds, cultures, profiles and experience is always a source of wealth, sharing new ideas and innovation. In priority urban areas, there is a huge amount of talent that is eager to grow. Recognizing this, Schneider Electric believes that companies have a role to play. It is their duty to act, particularly in the heart of the markets in which they operate.\n\nConvinced of the need to better support young people entering the workforce, Schneider Electric is involved in different ways: training, work/study programs for young adults from underprivileged backgrounds entering the workforce, partnerships with schools and associations, financial support for young students, and participation in technical or general training courses. Such is the scope of the initiatives implemented by Schneider Electric. These actions complement the partnerships established within the framework of the Schneider Electric Foundation.\n\nThe unemployment of young people, especially those living in priority employment neighborhoods is unacceptable and efficient actions have been put in place to reduce this scourge, regardless of the economic, social, or industrial situation.\n\nSchneider Electric is involved in three major programs. Two of them are sponsored by the French Government: paQte (priority neighborhoods under the City Policy, QPV)) and the ' La France, une chance. Les Entreprises s'engagent ' program. The third program, ' Le Collectif pour une \u00c9conomie plus Inclusive ,' is sponsored by companies.\n\nThis group was initiated by the CEO of Danone at the end of 2018. Schneider Electric joined the group and has developed the 'Inclusion focus' in France in ten cities (Aubervilliers, Strasbourg, Rouen, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lille, Toulouse and Grenoble). Within this framework and in conjunction with state employment stakeholders (the French Public Employment Service, Youth Employment Centers and Maison de l'Emploi) , it organized Neighborhood-oriented Forums, e-forums during the pandemic and coaching sessions for the youth.\n\nLastly, there is the '100 opportunities - 100 jobs' system, which takes in more than 1,000 young people primarily from priority neighborhoods (QPV) and helps them to find long-term employment or training in some 40 cities in France. It is a real public/private partnership that brings two worlds together for work.\n\nThe '100 opportunities - 100 jobs' system was implemented for the first time in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne in 2005, and by the end of 2020 more than 8,000 young people had been involved with 68% achieving positive exits, fixed-term contracts or interim contracts longer than six months, permanent contracts, or a qualification or diploma training.\n\nIn 2020, the program was deployed in Mantes La Jolie, Argenteuil, Les Mureaux and Provins.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5. Schneider Electric, an eco-citizen company\n\nSchneider Electric works to help inhabitants of the disadvantaged neighborhoods identified in the City Policy (QPV) and is naturally in line with the PaQte (Pact with Neighborhoods for all Companies) with respect to the four pillars of Raise Awareness, Train, Recruit, and Buy.\n\nIn 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic, specific actions were put in place to take in junior secondary school students 'remotely' for their one-week observation internships, in partnership with the association, Tous en Stages . In certain cases, some students were able to do their placements on site.\n\nSchneider Electric in France includes integration clauses in contracts to encourage suppliers to become committed to an approach of vocational integration of persons who are outside the job circuit. Schneider Electric in France challenges employment agencies to put in place temporary occupational integration contracts (CIPI) and interim open-ended employment contracts (CDI-I), which accompany the unemployed toward long-term employment and encourage temporary work that integrates people.\n\nFinally, Schneider Electric has partnered with many other structures or associations: \u00c9cole de la Deuxi\u00e8me Chance , les Entreprises pour la Cit\u00e9 , FACE, T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, Fondation de la 2 \u00e8me Chance , EPA, La Cravate Solidaire , la Varappe , etc.\n\n## 5.4.6 Schneider Electric School\n\nIn 1929, Schneider Electric founded its own school - Paul-Louis Merlin - in Grenoble, to address the difficulty of recruiting skilled labor in the energy industry and help young people in precarious situations to access promising jobs. Today, it still focuses on vocational training in Schneider Electric areas of expertise, with innovative training approaches and close alignement with actual industry practices.\n\nStudents leave with qualifications enabling them to continue in higher education or take employment in innovation-rich energysector fields such as renewable energies, home automation and smart buildings as well as energy management.\n\nIn 2019, to reinforce the link with the Group, the school changed its name to \u00c9cole Schneider Electric and a new vocational training has been added in the frame of the creation of its CFA ( Centre de Formation d'Apprentis ).\n\nThe CFA begun its first academic year in September 2020, with an intake of 70 apprentices studying for a vocational diploma in domotics and communicating buildings as well as a professional bachelor's degree in connected buildings and smart energy management.\n\n@EcoleSchneiderElectric\n\n<!-- image -->",

Methodology and audit of indicators\n\n## In this section:\n\n- 6.1 Methodology elements on the published indicators\n\n185\n\n- 6.2 Concordance of indicators with the French Non-Financial Performance Declaration\n- 6.3 Sustainability Accounting Standard (SASB) Correspondance table\n\n## 6.1 Methodology elements on the published indicators\n\nSchneider Electric has drawn up a frame of reference with reporting methods for Schneider Sustainability Impact's (SSI) indicators and for Human Resources, safety and environmental data.\n\nThis frame of reference includes the scope, collection and consolidation procedures and definitions of this information. As it is engaged in a process of constant improvement, Schneider Electric is gradually supplementing this work to adapt its frame of reference for sustainable development indicators to changes in the Group. This document is updated every year.\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to continuous improvement, Schneider Electric asked Ernst & Young to conduct a review in order to obtain a 'limited' level of assurance for certain Human Resources, safety and environmental data indicators, and all of the key performance indicators from the SSI (see Independent verifier's report on pages 198 to 199). The audit work builds on that conducted since 2006.\n\nAs a general rule and subject to any particular exception to be set out in the universal registered document:\n\n- (i)  Schneider Electric reports extra-financial data at Group level for all entities over which it has operational control, within 2 years of acquisition;\n- (ii) Data is consolidated over all fully integrated companies within the scope of financial consolidation, including joint ventures over which the Group exercises exclusive control;\n- (iii) Units that belong to Group companies which are fully consolidated are included in reporting on a 100% basis;\n- (iv) companies accounted for by the equity method are not included in the reporting.\n\n## 6.1.1 Human Resources, safety and environment indicators\n\nThe Human Resources (HR), safety and environmental data come from our HR Analytics for the HR data, Resource Advisor for Environmental data and GlobES (Global Environment and Safety) for the safety data. Its consolidation is placed respectively under the Global Human Resources and the Global Supply Chain functions. Data reliability checks are conducted at the time of consolidation (review of variations, inter-site comparison, etc.). Details for data coverage are specified in tables pages 200 to 213 for each topic and are generally well above 80%.\n\n190\n\n192\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6.4 Task-force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) correspondance table\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndependent third party's report on the\n\nconsolidated non-financial statement\n\npresented in the management report\n\n198\n\nThe safety data of the sites are included in the Group metrics after one complete calendar year following their creation or acquisition. A site joining the Group in year n will be included in the metrics on January 1, n+2, except in exceptional circumstances when an agreement stipulates that the safety data will not be included for two years.\n\nThe scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001-certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All production and logistics sites with 50 or more FTE employees must obtain ISO 14001 certification before the end of the third full calendar year of operation or membership of the Group. Administrative, R&D and sales sites with 500 FTE employees or more also have to obtain ISO 14001 certification. Other sites may seek certification and/or report on a voluntary basis. A difference can be thus recorded with respect to the scope of financial consolidation.\n\n## 6.1.2 Indicators from the Schneider Sustainability Impact\n\n## SSI#1 80% renewable electricity\n\nThis indicator measures the share of renewable electricity in Schneider Electric electricity supply, on the scope of environmental reporting (industrial sites >50 employees and tertiary sites >500 employees certified ISO 14001). Five different types of renewable sourcing are taken into account: renewable electricity produced onsite and consumed onsite, renewable electricity produced onsite and sold to a third party, renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs), green tariffs and renewable certificates (depending on the country, REC, iREC, GO, etc.).\n\nElectricity purchased with no specific renewable electricity claim is not taken into account, even if the electricity mix of the supplier includes a share of renewable power.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#2 10% CO 2 savings in transportation\n\nThis indicator includes emissions from the transport of goods purchased by Schneider Electric, covering 75% of the Group's total transport costs.\n\nThe measurement of CO 2 equivalents combines the impact of the following greenhouse gases: CO 2 , CH4, N 2 O, HFCs, SF 6 , PFCs, NOx and water vapor.\n\nTwo methods, developed in partnership with a specialized firm, are used by carriers to measure CO 2 equivalent emissions: energybased method (calculation based on fuel combustion - preferred method) and activity-based method (calculation based on the mileage and the weight of transported goods - accepted method).\n\n194",

Methodology and audit of indicators\n\nCurrent year data are corrected based on carbon intensity of previous year, so that gains in carbon efficiency take into account changes in business activity. 2018 is the first year of the 2018-2020 triennial strategic plan.\n\nThe target by the end of the program is to reduce our CO 2 emissions by 10% in 2020 compared to 2017 baseline.\n\nCalculation methodology and reporting in the SSI of the transport CO 2 KPI:\n\n- \u00b7 In 2018: 2018 reduction vs 2017\n- \u00b7 In 2019: 2019 reduction vs 2017\n- \u00b7 In 2020: 2020 reduction vs 2017\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#3 120 million metric tons CO 2 saved on our customers' end thanks to our EcoStruxure offers\n\nThis indicator measures CO 2 savings delivered by Schneider Electric offers to customers. CO 2 savings are calculated for sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers' lifetime. Emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with Schneider Electric's offer and emissions in the reference situation.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator has been increased in 2019, former target was 100 million metric tons CO 2 saved due to the extension of the methodology to new offers.\n\nThe methodology distinguishes 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions: saved CO 2 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO 2 emissions compared to previous years, and avoided CO 2 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emissions. Brownfield sales correspond to the situation where the offer sold replaces or upgrades an existing system, leading to a change of GHG emissions of installed infrastructure versus the previous year. For 'saved' emissions, the 'brownfield reference situation' is defined as the situation before the new solution is sold and installed at the customer's site. Only 'saved' CO 2 emissions are published in this indicator but both 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions can be calculated with the methodology.\n\nThe calculation of CO 2 impact of offers over their lifetime is based on sales data per product range. Market data and expert assumptions are used to determine the use-case scenario of offers and the associated CO 2 impact. This methodology is associated to typical uncertainties of CO 2 corporate accounting methodologies, and conservative assumptions are preferred.\n\nMore methodological details can be found in our website that has been made public in 2019.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#4 25% increase in turnover for our Energy & Sustainability Services\n\nEnergy and Sustainability Services (ESS) is a global Division of Schneider Electric and has its own node in the Group reporting system (see Active Energy Management section pages 97 to 98).\n\nEvery year all Group entities perform a restatement of their outside Group Sales in order to neutralize all the changes of perimeters (internal and external). Thanks to this exercise, the year on year growth of the sales is at constant perimeter and is also at constant rate.\n\nThe measurement is taken directly from the Group reporting system.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#5 75% of sales under our new Green Premium program\n\nBeginning in 2018, the scope of Green Premium has been expanded to cover all Schneider offers including services and solutions in addition to products.\n\nA product is declared Green Premium \u2122 when it meets all the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 It complies with the European RoHS Directive;\n- \u00b7 It has information available concerning the presence of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) under the European REACH regulation and refers to the two most recent lists;\n- \u00b7 It does not contain any REACH SVHCs past the sunset date;\n- \u00b7 It has a Life Cycle Analysis (ISO 14044) with an Environmental Disclosure available for customers (ISO 14025 Type III or ISO 14021 Type II) providing a material assessment, a recyclability rate and the calculation of environmental impacts including the consumption of raw materials and energy, the carbon footprint and damage to the ozone layer;\n- \u00b7 It has a guide that identifies and locates the sub-assemblies or components that require a particular recycling process, referred to as the circularity profile; and\n- \u00b7 It complies with a minimum of two performance claims or one external label, as listed in the Green Premium Playbook.\n\nThe indicator measures the share of sales made with a Green Premium \u2122 offer from sales figures. For the 2020 final KPI, 2019 sales figures where used.\n\nThe Green Premium \u2122 eligible scope for 2018-2020 covers all Schneider Electric businesses: Energy Management, Industrial Automation and Services, except Video Products, Residential and Thermal Control and ETO (engineered to order) Low Voltage Equipment.\n\nThe Green Premium \u2122 program was expanded in early 2018 to include additional environmental performance claims, the deployment is phased for 2018-2020, starting with product offers only.\n\nThe total eligible turnover, obtained from our product sales consolidated at Product Reference, has been extended in 2019 to include Solutions, Services & Software. It amounts to 18.91 billion euros in 2020.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#6 200 sites labeled Towards Zero Waste to Landfill\n\nA site achieves Towards Zero Waste to Landfill, if it recovers, by weight of its annual waste production, more than 99% of its metal waste and more than 97% of its non-metallic waste, as well as 100% proper handling and treatment of hazardous waste. Proper handling and treatment of hazardous waste means that hazardous waste shall be handled as per Schneider Electric's requirements and local regulations, whichever is the most restrictive.\n\nWaste is considered as recovered if it is sent to a waste provider for recycling or disposal in any manner except landfill and incineration without energy recovery.

The list of eligible certificates/documents is continually updated to make it exhaustive and to cover countries' specificities.\n\nA global campaign is being run in all global supply chain regions to progressively move the spend to recycled or certified sources with sponsorship from top management.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#8 120,000 metric tons of avoided primary resource consumption through ECOFIT\u2122, recycling and take-back programs\n\nThis indicator quantifies all industrial activities that contribute to the Circular Economy model, such as repair, reuse, refurbish and recycling, thus avoiding waste, material and energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and/or water depletion.\n\nThe scope includes worldwide activities across all businesses (Energy Management, Industry, Services) and relevant product families (LV/MV Equipment, Transformers, UPS-es, Inverters, protection relays, PLCs etc), with offers like ECOFIT \u2122 , take-back programs and recycling.\n\nThe indicator is calculated as the sum of primary resources consumption avoided by each activity, with calculation method varying per activity. When available, exact weights are reported. Otherwise, average weight for each category of device is used for calculations.\n\nEach activity reports quarterly, half-yearly or annually, depending upon the activity. The verification is done based on ERP/logistics systems extracts, sales datasheets or third-party certificates.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019, former target was 100,000 metric tons of avoided primary resources consumption.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#9 70% scored in our Employee Engagement Index\n\nDuring the OneVoice employee engagement surveys, Schneider Electric employees are asked a series of questions; six of them are used to generate the Employee Engagement Index (EEI). The EEI is a standard international index.\n\nOur bi-annual surveys moved from twice a year to once a year since 2018, to free up HRBPs and Managers' energy and allow time to deep dive into the results and build impactful action plans. All employees are surveyed; Open-Ended Contracts and FixedTerm Contracts with an active status in our HR system (excluding trainees and interim employees). Employees are surveyed via email, for those who have a professional mailbox, or via kiosks installed in the plants (or via an IT room), for other employees. the survey's feedback is held in an external platform to protect employees' confidentiality.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#10 0.88 medical incident per million hours worked\n\nThe Medical Incident Rate (MIR) is the number of work incidents requiring medical treatment per million hours worked (i.e. average hours of 500 employees working for one calendar year), including injuries and occupational illnesses. Incidents may or may not have resulted in a day off.\n\nAll incidents reported on Schneider Electric sites are counted (including therefore incidents affecting Schneider Electric employees and other employees working under the supervision of Schneider Electric, i.e. temporary workers). All Schneider Electric sites are taken into account. Medical incidents do not include: visits to a physician or other licensed healthcare professional solely for observation or counseling; the conduct of diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays and blood tests, including the administration of prescription medications used solely for diagnostic purposes (e.g. eye drops to dilate pupils); or first aid.\n\nThe focus of the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) is on the identification and evaluation of workplace hazards. The resulting corrective actions assist in the elimination of recurring incidents and the prevention of injury. The Group has used the MIR as a key performance indicator on a global basis since 2010.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was 1 medical incident per million hours worked).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#11 90% of employees have access to a comprehensive well-being at work program\n\nThis indicator measures the number of employees having access to our combined commitment for a well-being at work program.\n\nThe first pillar of the program is the access to medical coverage. Schneider Electric ensures that it provides its employees with access to a standard level of healthcare coverage, irrespective of level, and provides access to healthcare coverage for their eligible dependents. Access to cover is defined by local regulations and employment agreements, i.e. collective and/or labor agreements. Cost of the standard level of healthcare cover may be borne by the Company and/or the employee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 6. Methodology and audit of indicators\n\nThe second pillar is the awareness and training piece. Empowering Schneider Electric's employees to manage their unique life and work by making the most of their energy through learning and practice. At Schneider Electric there is a holistic approach to Well-Being which comprises of: Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Social well-being. Employees have access to trainings provided by the Global Well- Being team, and/or local training that has been reviewed and approved by the global team.\n\nThe indicator covers all countries where Schneider has active Open End Contract employees under Schneider compensation and benefit frameworks, including DVC and NDVC. Also including China Fixed Term Contract active Schneider employees.\n\nThird party contractors, joint venture and recent acquisition are excluded.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#12 100% of employees are working in countries that have fully deployed our Global Family Leave Policy\n\nThis indicator measures the percentage of employees who work in countries that have fully deployed our Global Family Leave Policy (GFLP).\n\nUnder the GFLP, countries must meet the global minimum standards of the policy, which includes fully paid leave for primary parental leave (12 weeks) for both natural birth and adoption, secondary parental leave (2 weeks) for natural birth and adoption, care leave for immediate family members that require elder care or care for a serious health condition (1 week) and bereavement leave (1 week).\n\nAll permanent employees globally and fixed-term contracts in China are included. Interim workers, other fixed-term contracts, trainees, and apprentices are excluded.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#13 100% of workers received at least 15 hours of learning, and 30% of workers' learning hours are done digitally\n\nSchneider Electric workers - shop floor employees in plants and distribution centers - need to get connected to digital tools and digital training resources in order to develop themselves, grow in the Company and develop their career. Eligible worker scope represents 97% of Schneider total workers population (interim staff and interns as well as people joining after January 31 of the year are excluded).\n\nFor this, the ambition is that each worker will do a minimum of 15 hours learning each year, and also, 30% of all workers' learning hours will be done digitally, using resources provided to all in the digital learning corners that Schneider Electric is setting in all its plants and distribution center.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was 12 hours learning).\n\nIndicator 13 score has been adjusted for 2020 to take into account the impact of the pandemic on face to face training not being able to take place. As agreed with external auditors, a 'rule of three' removing one quarter from the calculation has been applied for the annual results. This means that, in 2020 only, performance for indicator 13 is calculated against a target of 11.25 hours of training (instead of 15 hours). With the 15-hours threshold, indicator score would have been 86.6%, instead of 90%. These modifications are important to reflect well the work of our teams in an exceptional context, but they do not significantly alter the overall SSI performance (0.3% change).\n\nThe indicator is the average of the completion of the two ambitions.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#14 90% of white collars have individual development plans\n\nAll white-collar employees are required to participate in an annual development discussion with their manager that is linked to the annual performance review. This should result in the updating or creating of an individual development plan. During 2020, 92% of white collar employees created or updated an individual development plan with at least one specific development goal.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#15 95% of employees are working in a country with commitment and processes in place to achieve gender pay equity\n\nThis indicator measures the percentage of employees who work in countries where there is an operating gender pay equity plan, i.e. measurement of pay equity and, if pay gaps, corrective actions in place.\n\nSchneider Electric uses a common global standard methodology to identify gender pay gaps within comparable groups of employees and uses a country driven approach to address gaps with appropriate corrective actions.\n\nAll permanent employees globally and fixed-term contracts in China are included. Supplementary workers, other fixed-term contracts, trainees and apprentices are excluded.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#16 5.5 pts/100 increase in average score of ISO 26000 assessment for our strategic suppliers\n\nThe objective is to motivate strategic Group suppliers to roll out and monitor improvement plans conforming to ISO 26000 guidelines. An assessment of stategic suppliers is carried out by a third party. The assessments are monitored during business reviews with Schneider Electric buyers, with a view to continuous improvement according to the guidelines of ISO 26000.\n\nThe Group has set to engage all its strategic suppliers in a process of continuous improvement on this pillar. At the end of 2020, about 700 strategic suppliers representing c. 70% of total strategic purchase volume have submitted their data. Sustainable development has become one of the seven pillars used to measure supplier performance since 2011. ISO 26000 assessments that result in a score lower than 25/100 are not taken into account, as these fall under the category \"beginner\" and are excluded automatically.",

        "page_content": "The ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was a 5 pts/100 increase).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#17 350 suppliers under Human Rights and Environment vigilance received specific on-site assessment\n\nThis indicator measures the number of on-site audits performed, regarding Environment, Health & Safety, Labor (human rights) and Management System pillars. The targeted suppliers are defined leveraging a third party methodology and the audit referential is from recognized best industry practices RBA alliance (Responsible Business Alliance, previously EICC). Audits performed by third party companies are also included in the calculation.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was 300 on-site assessments).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#18 100% of sales, procurement, and finance employees trained every year on anti-corruption\n\nLaunched in 2018, the anti-corruption e-learning, initially mandatory for Finance, Sales and Procurement teams, was extended to 201 job codes identified at risk, representing approximatively 38,000 employees in 2020, compared to 23,000 employees in 2018. The indicator scope excludes c. 3,200 FTC employees in China with eligible job codes. At the end of 2020, 94% of exposed employees had completed this e-learning.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#19 x4 turnover of our Access to Energy program\n\nThis indicator tracks the growth rate of the Access to Energy program's annual turnover, based on the actual 2017 turnover.\n\nIt covers the sales in Africa and The Middle East, Asia and South America of all products and solutions which contribute to providing access to modern energy for populations living in rural and peri-urban areas: individual lighting, individual and collective electrification, energy services and training equipment and training contracts. Sales are aggregated every quarter based on invoicing data from operational entities.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#20 400,000 underprivileged people trained in energy management\n\nThe deployment of professional training programs in energy management dedicated to underprivileged people enable these people to acquire skills to pursue a career that offers them, as well as their families, the means for a decent standard of living. These courses are defined according to a local reference and justifiable by the partner.\n\nIn partnership with local and international NGOs and local authorities, the Schneider Electric Foundation and the Company's local entities provide direct and indirect contributions to professional training centers. The objective is to help them improve the level of vocational training courses with diploma or certification in energy management. The minimum duration of these courses is three months (or totaling 100 hours).\n\nContributions may be (cumulative possible):\n\n- \u00b7 funding of electrical and didactic equipments, donation of request equipment, first generation, for practical work;\n- \u00b7 knowledge transfer through trainer training, and support for future entrepreneur training.\n\nAs a technical partner, Schneider Electric does not pay operating expenses.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was 350,000 people trained).\n\nIndicator 20 score has been adjusted for 2020 to take into account the impact of the pandemic on specific actions such as face to face training not being able to take place. As agreed with external auditors, a 'rule of three' removing one quarter from the calculation has been applied for the annual results for these two indicators only. This means that, in 2020 only, performance for indicator 20 is calculated against a target of 380,000 (instead of 400,000). These modifications are important to reflect well the work of our teams in an exceptional context, but they do not significantly alter the overall SSI performance (0.3% change).\n\nThis indicator is audited annually by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI#21 15,000 volunteering days thanks to our VolunteerIn global platform\n\nSchneider Electric employees' volunteering activities mainly take place in vocational or educational NGOs (vocational and technical training, schools, universities, etc.), and companies supported by the Schneider Electric Access to Energy Fund and more globally in all organizations referenced by the Schneider Electric Foundation delegates in their countries. They principally benefit disadvantaged young people or underprivileged families and are organized depending on the personal or professional skills of the volunteers and the needs identified by the supported organizations (specialized or non-specialized needs).\n\nMissions are posted on a dedicated digital and multilingual platform called VolunteerIn enabling Group employees to apply for volunteer missions among the Foundation's partners.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric employees worldwide increased their engagement with the 'Tomorrow Rising Fund' launched by the Schneider Electric Foundation to support emergency and longerterm reconstruction activities related to COVID-19, creating new partnerships. In this difficult period, volunteers have accelerated their contribution to initiatives aiming at access to food, to education and to health mainly through digital missions which were promoted to help the most vulnerable and above all the youth in need of support, coaching, advices etc.\n\nOne day of volunteering is counted when a staff member dedicates five hours of his or her time to one of these partner organizations. The indicator also includes the training missions organized abroad for a period of five days minimum.\n\nThe ambition for this indicator was increased in 2019 (former target was 12,000 volunteering days).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is also one of the pillars of the Group's Ethics Charter (Principles of Responsibility). Overall, transformations linked to climate change are a source of opportunities for Schneider Electric, the main risk being to fail leading by example and thereby lose traction with customers, investors, new talents and collaborators in the company. Concrete climaterelated programs to either grab opportunities, or mitigate risks are deployed every 3 to 5 years in our Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and complement the Group's Climate Pledge - our short-term (2025), mid-term (2030) and long-term (2040, 2050) objectives, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.

The carbon footprint of the group gives a good indication of the localisation and magnitude of climaterelated risks and opportunities, and is also used to monitor progress. Its industrial carbon footprint (i.e. scopes 1, 2 and 3 upstream, as per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, excluding use and end-of-life of products sold) enables the Group to quantify and reduce CO 2 emissions from its supply chain, adopting a cradle to gate view. Scope 3 emissions represent around 90% of the Group's industrial carbon footprint, mainly from the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and services to its suppliers. Emissions produced, saved, and avoided by Schneider Electric's products and services during their use phase and end-of-life are also quantified.\n\nEmissions calculations are done with GHG Protocol methodology. The carbon footprint methodology is compliant with ISO 14069 principles. The results are calculated in tons of CO 2 equivalent, taking into account all greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe Group has launched several concrete programs aiming at either directly or indirectly reducing GHG emissions, under the Climate, Circular Economy and Resources pillars of the SSI. These programs are presented under SSI 2018-2020, SSI 2021-2025 and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) 2021-2025 pages 74 to 75 of this document). They cover actions concerning the Group's operations (e.g. energy efficiency, renewable electricity procurement, fleet electrification, circular offers), suppliers (e.g. CO 2 reduction program, green materials program) and customers (SF 6 free offers, measuring CO 2 savings on customer's end thanks to Ecostruxure TM ).\n\nThe overall performance of the SSI represents 20% in the short-term incentives for 60,000+ employees worldwide (collective share) and 25% for the long-term incentives (LTI) for 2,300+ top leaders. A new criterion has also been designed in 2019 to replace the SSI in the LTI to integrate CDP Climate Change score (Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index, SSERI).\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric is committed to embed a carbon pricing of EUR 30130 /ton (depending on time horizons) in strategic supply chain and R&D decisions, to assess the performance and resiliency of operations as well as to assess whether the investment and reduction efforts are in line with the cost of CO 2 externality.\n\nSchneider Electric is a signatory of the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative aimed at setting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with the global effort to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Climate ambitions are defined for 2025, 2030 and 2050:\n\n- \u00b7 Before 2025, demonstrate that Schneider Electric is carbon positive together with its customers and partners, thanks to CO 2 savings delivered by EcoStruxure \u2122 ;\n- \u00b7 On the Group's operations (scope 1 and 2): be carbon neutral by 2025 (allowing CO 2 offsets) and net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2030 (with no CO 2 offsets);\n- \u00b7 On indirect emissions (scope 3) in its supply chain and with customers: reduce emissions by -35% by 2030 (versus 2017) as part of the Group's validated 1.5 \u00b0C SBT targets, by actively engaging suppliers to accelerate their climate strategy and sourcing greener materials, as well as reducing offers' emissions on customers' ends;\n- \u00b7 Become carbon neutral on the Group's full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (scope 1, 2, and 3), 10 years ahead of 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory. This means that all Schneider Electric's products will be carbon neutral in 2040;\n- \u00b7 Engage with suppliers to move towards a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050 (with no CO 2 offsets).\n\n<!-- image -->",

UP = Unpublished. NA = Not Applicable.\n- (1)  The CO 2 emissions linked to energy consumption are considered estimates, because the indirect emissions are calculated on the conversion factors per country. Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions from energy consumption are quantified using energy reporting data, in MWh of energy per energy source. Scope 2 emissions are quantified with the market-based methodology and the location-based methodology, following GHG Protocol scope 2 guidance. Locationbased scope 2 electricity emissions on energy reporting perimeter are equal to 321,153 tCO 2 e (audited value). Total scope 1 and 2 (location-based) CO 2 emissions (energy, vehicles, and SF 6 emissions in tCO 2 e) on full perimeter are equal to 527,186 tCO 2 e (audited value). Electricity emissions calculated with market-based and location-based methodologies should not be added. Market-based electricity emissions are calculated using residual electricity emissions factors (source AIB, 2017) for European countries, and average country emission factors for other countries (IEA, 2017);\n\n- (3)  CO 2 emissions for sites not included in the energy reporting perimeter are estimated based on site surface in real estate databases and average CO 2 intensity of sites per region from our energy reporting. Overall coverage of emissions due to energy consumption is 100%, based on site surface occupied by Schneider Electric worldwide. Using location-based methodology, total scope 2 emissions are equal to 385,037 tCO 2 e;\n\n- (5)  Emissions of products sold by Schneider Electric during the year of reporting, and cumulated over their lifetime. These emissions are due to electricity consumption of products, either due to internal consumption or due to heat dissipation (Joule effect);\n- (6)  CO 2 savings are calculated for sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers' lifetime. Emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with Schneider Electric's offer and emissions in the reference situation. The methodology distinguishes 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions: saved CO 2 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO 2 emissions compared to previous years, and avoided CO 2 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emission. CO 2 savings figures here include calculations for new offers compared to SSI2018-2020 KPI (microgrids, ADMS, cooling, power quality and 3 phase UPS), which explains the difference (155 million tons CO 2 saved vs 134 million tons).\n\nIn addition, biogenic CO 2 emissions are due to the consumption of renewable electricity from biomass, and are not reported in scope 2 emissions following GHG protocol guidance. These emissions are of 17,048 tCO 2 b in 2020.",

The transaction with the Russian Direct Investment Fund ('RDIF') was closed on January 20, 2020. The new Joint Venture is accounted for as an equity method investment in 2020, and therefore excluded from extra-financial consolidation. This caused a global reduction in workforce figures of 3,439 employees (about 3%) compared to 2019, and explains the 51% workforce decrease in Russia, where the business is located.",

        "page_content": "## Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director's introduction\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\n2020 was a signature year for Schneider Electric which demonstrated the resilience of its business model in difficult circumstances. The strong results achieved in such an unprecedented situation proved the success and the robustness of the strategy implemented under the leadership of Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO.\n\nAll employees, the management team as well as the Board of directors had to adapt. The Board held 12 meetings, i.e. 5 more than in 2019, to monitor and control the situation during the COVID-19 crisis. Overall, directors had a very high attendance rate of 97%.\n\nIn terms of governance, 2020 was also a year of change with the departure of the deputy CEO, some important changes in the Executive Committee in spring, and my appointment as Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, taking over from Leo Apotheker. In this year, the Board continued to improve and reinforce its composition and invites you to support at the Shareholders' Meeting the appointment of Anna Ohlsson-Leijon as a new director. On February 10, 2021, Anna Ohlsson-Leijon was appointed by the Board as an Observer upon recommendation from the Governance & Remuneration Committee which conducted the search process for new candidates.\n\nThe Board also recommends supporting the renewal of JeanPascal Tricoire's office as Director for a further four-year term and intends to renew his combined function as Chairman and CEO. Indeed, the performance of Jean-Pascal Tricoire in his double mandate was positively assessed by the Board of Directors taking into account his profile, excellent track record within the Company and his openness to the Board Members' recommendations as well as the governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the management. Nevertheless, the Board understands and acknowledges the preference of its investors to have a clear distinction between the roles of Chairman and CEO, and intends to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer before the end of Jean-Pascal Tricoire's upcoming term.\n\nThroughout 2020, I had the opportunity to discuss our compensation policy and approach with many of Schneider Electric's shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies, and will continue this dialogue in 2021.\n\nFor 2020, the Board decided to use the discretion clause provided in the existing compensation policy on annual variable compensation. This was predicated on the fact that the COVID-19 crisis brought about exceptional circumstances external to the Group. It was and continues to be in the Group's interest to incentivize, within reasonable levels, the Corporate Officer and all employees to drive performance and keep all teams motivated. In doing so, the Board reviewed the compensation outcome to ensure its alignment with the resilient results achieved by the Group and with shareholders' experience in 2020 (Schneider Electric TSR ranked 2 nd of the CAC40 and 1 st of its Peer group). In addition, the outcome for the Corporate Officer had to be consistent with the approach applied to the ~58,000 employees of the Group who participate in a similar annual variable compensation plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is important to note that the Board decided not to apply the discretion clause to the Long-Term Incentive Plans which remained unchanged. For the LTIP that vested in 2020, the Board concluded that its payout level accurately reflects the outstanding performance and shareholder return realized over the past three years as well as the Company's strong resilience throughout the/uni00A0crisis.\n\nAs for the 2021 compensation policy, the Board of Directors took into account the wide approval for the revisions made in the last few years (for example, on the post-mandate benefits and the new LTIP criteria). Consequently, the Board of Directors decided not to materially change the compensation policy again. The current policy appears balanced, provides a competitive pay structure, ensures a strong link between pay and performance, enforces strong alignment with employees and shareholders, and, last but not least, provides both a short and long-term focus.\n\nI hope that these balanced and well thought-through proposals will receive your support.\n\nI invite you to read this governance and compensation report as well as the notice of meeting. They provide more detail on the governance structure of the Company and on all draft resolutions you are asked to approve at the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting. I welcome shareholders' participation at the Annual General Meeting. They can express their views ahead of or during the meeting with the digital tools that we will provide. Unfortunately, the ongoing pandemic will not allow us to conduct a physical meeting for the second time. We are truly sorry about this but look forward to a successful AGM.\n\nThank you for your support and your trust,\n\n## Fred Kindle\n\nVice-Chairman\n\n& Lead Independent Director\n\nThis corporate governance report has been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 10, 2021.\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company applies all the AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance guidelines that are available online at www.medef.com.",

Governance Report\n\n## Independent Directors\n\nEach year, as provided under the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors, on the report of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, dedicates one of the points on its agenda to the qualification of its members as independent with regard to the criteria for independence set out in article 9.5 of the Code and presented in the table below.\n\n## Criterion 1: employee or Corporate Officer within the previous five years\n\nNot to be and not to have been within the previous five years:\n\n- \u00b7 an employee or executive Corporate Officer of the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive Corporate Officer, or Director of a company consolidated with the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive Corporate Officer, or Director of the Company's parent company or a company consolidated with this parent company.\n\n## Criterion 2: cross-directorships\n\nNot to be an executive Corporate Officer of a company in which the Company holds a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive Corporate Officer of the Company (currently in office or having held such office within the last five years) holds a directorship.\n\n## Criterion 3: significant business relationships\n\nNot to be a customer, supplier, commercial banker, investment banker, or consultant:\n\n- \u00b7 that is significant to the Company or its group;\n- \u00b7 or for which the Company or its group represents a significant portion of its activity.\n\nThe assessment of the significance or otherwise of the relationship with the Company or its group must be debated by the board and the quantitative and qualitative criteria that led to this evaluation (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity, etc.) must be explicitly stated in the annual report.\n\n## Criterion 4: family ties\n\nNot to be related by close family ties to a Corporate Officer.\n\n## Criterion 5: auditor\n\nNot to have been an auditor of the Company within the previous five years.\n\n## Criterion 6: period of office exceeding 12 years\n\nNot to have been a Director of the Company for more than 12 years. Loss of the status of independent Director occurs on the date of the 12th anniversary.\n\n## Criterion 7: status of non-executive Corporate Officer\n\nA non-executive Corporate Officer cannot be considered independent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or in the form of securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\n## Criterion 8: status of the major shareholder\n\nDirectors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered independent, provided these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company. Nevertheless, beyond a 10% threshold in capital or voting rights, the board, upon a report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, should systematically review the qualification as independent in light of the Company's shareholding structure and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nUpon recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors, during its meeting of February 10, 2021, reviewed the independence of each Board member in regard of the criteria reminded above.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard specifically to independence in terms of business relations, the Board of Directors noted that, due to:\n- (i)  The absence of business relations between the Directors and Schneider Electric;\n- (ii) The nature of Schneider Electric activities and those of the companies in which members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as Directors;\n- (iii) The amounts, either unitary or global, of operations performed or that may be performed between Schneider Electric and these companies that are agreed at arm's length and that are by no means likely to be referred to the Board of Directors;\n\nthe existing business relations between Schneider Electric and these companies in which the members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as officers are not likely to prejudice their independence, indeed, when such operations exist, they are agreed at arm's length and their amounts, representing less than 0.1% of the consolidated turnover of each group, are without a doubt insignificant for each party, in particular with regard to respective size of the groups concerned.\n\n- \u00b7 Among 14 Directors, 8 are independent according to the definition prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code: Mrs. C\u00e9cile Cabanis, Mr. Fred Kindle, Mrs. Linda Knoll, Mrs. Jill Lee, Mrs. Fleur Pellerin, Mr. Anders Runevad, Mr. Gregory Spierkel, and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan.",

The proportion of independent Directors of the Company, excluding Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, Rita Felix and Mr. Patrick Montier, is therefore 73%.

Governance Report\n\n## Declarations concerning the situation of the members of the administrative, supervisory or management bodies\n\n## Service contracts\n\nNone of the Directors has a service contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries providing for benefits under such contract.\n\n## Absence of conviction or incrimination\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, in the last five years, none of the Directors or the Chairman and CEO have been:\n\n- \u00b7 the subject of any convictions in relation to fraudulent offenses or of any official public incrimination and/or sanctions by statutory regulatory authorities;\n- \u00b7 disqualified by a court from acting as a member of the administrative, management, or supervisory bodies of an issuer or from acting in the management or conduct of the affairs of an issuer;\n- \u00b7 involved, as a member of an administrative, management, or supervisory body or a partner, in a bankruptcy, receivership, or liquidation.\n\n## Family ties\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, none of the Directors and/or the Chairman and CEO of the Company are related through family ties.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no arrangements or understandings with major shareholders, customers, suppliers, or others pursuant to which a Director or the Chairman and Chief executive officer has been selected as a member of an administrative, management, or supervisory body or a member of senior management of the Company.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of any Directors and the Chairman and Chief executive officer with respect to the Company in their capacity as members of those bodies or their private interests and/ or other duties.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, the Directors and the Chairman and Chief executive officer have no restrictions on the disposal of their Company shares aside from those stipulated in Performance Share plans (see pages 294 et seq. ) for the Chairman and Chief executive officer and a minimum 1,000 shareholding requirement for Directors.\n\n## Diversity policy within the Board of Directors and within the management of the Company\n\nThe Board of Directors pays due attention to its composition and that of its committees. It relies on the works of the Governance & Remunerations Committee which reviews regularly and proposes as often as required, the relevant changes to the composition of Board of Directors and its committees depending on the Group's strategy.\n\nIn that respect, in conformity with its internal regulations, the Board of Directors ensures through its proposals and its decisions that:\n\n- \u00b7 its composition reflects the international nature of the Group's activities and of its shareholders by having a significant number of members of non-French nationality;\n- \u00b7 it protects the independence of the board through the competence, availability, and courage of its members;\n- \u00b7 it encourages open and unrestricted speech;\n- \u00b7 it pursues its objective of diversifying the Board of Directors in compliance with the legal principle of attaining balanced representation between men and women on the Board;\n\n- \u00b7 it appoints persons with the expertise required for developing and implementing the Group strategy while considering the objectives of diversity based on criteria such as age, professional skills, nationalities and background;\n- \u00b7 employee shareholders and employees shall continue to be represented on the board in compliance with the provisions set forth in Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Articles of Association; and\n- \u00b7 it preserves the continuity of the Board by changing some of its members at regular intervals, if necessary, by anticipating the expiry of members' terms of office.\n\nThe gender diversity ratio of the Board of Directors, should the appointment of Mr. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon be confirmed in the 2021 Annual Shareholder's Meeting, will reach 42% (excluding the employees Directors and the representative employee shareholders Director).\n\nSchneider Electric is deeply committed towards diversity in general and gender diversity in particular. Schneider Electric focuses on taking proactive measures to encourage a balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level: the portion of women at the Executive Committee had been increased from 27% in 2019 to 38% in 2020. For the leadership pool comprising of the top 1,000 leaders, the female representation is 23.2%, while among NDVC ( i.e. white collars) representing more than 60,000 employees, the female representation reaches 32.8%.\n\nAt its meeting of December 14, 2020, the Board of Directors reviewed senior management's ambitions regarding the balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level and noted that the objective is set to at least 30% of women at the Executive Committee and 35% among NDVC. To achieve these objectives and further improve gender diversity, the Group aims at attracting female talents by offering a training leadership program and dedicated mentoring, implementing an equal treatment policy and a tailored family leave policy.\n\n## Directors' holdings in the Company's share capital\n\nArticle 11 of the Company's Article of Association provides that Directors are each required to hold at least 250 Schneider Electric shares during their term of office. Moreover, in accordance with Article 6 of the Board Internal Regulations, each Board Member shall hold 1,000 Schneider Electric shares.\n\nThe Board of Directors has set a retention target of shares representing three years of base salary for Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire. Calculation of the number of shares held is based on Schneider Electric SE shares and the equivalent in shares of the corporate mutual fund units invested in Schneider Electric shares held by the beneficiaries.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L.225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code and the AFEP/MEDEF code, the Board of Directors has approved the following:\n\n- \u00b7 mandatory retention beyond the lock-up period of 25% of the shares acquired under the Long-term incentive plan; and\n- \u00b7 mandatory investment in Schneider Electric SE shares of 10% of the selling price (net of taxes and contributions) of Performance Share acquired.\n\nThese obligations are suspended once the shareholding target described above are met which is the case of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire who owns 728,469 Schneider Electric's shares.",

However, in case of death or resignation of a member, the Board may co-opt a new member. This appointment is then subject to ratification at the next Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDirectors are appointed for four-year terms (renewable). However, from the age of 70, Directors are re-elected or appointed for a period of two years. No more than one-third of the Directors may be 70 years old or over.\n\nMrs. Xiaoyun Ma represents the employee shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Articles L.225-23 and L.22-10-5 of the French Commercial Code. She was elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting upon the recommendation of the supervisory boards of the FCPEs.\n\nMrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Patrick Montier represent the employees in accordance with the provisions of Article L.225-27-1 of the French Commercial Code. They were appointed respectively by the European works council and by the most representative trade union organization in France in pursuance of Article 11.4 of the Articles of Association.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * (Directors representing employees excluded as per AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code). In addition, out of five committees, two are chaired by a woman: the Audit & Risks Committee (Mrs. C\u00e9cile Cabanis) and the Human Resources & CSR Committee (Mrs. Linda Knoll).\n\n## Proposals to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the composition of the Board of Directors\n\n- \u00b7 As part of the Board's continuous review of its composition, the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remunerations Committee to work on the search for candidates. In doing so, the Committee identified the skills that would be required to diversify and strengthen the Board composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these candidates, the Governance & Remunerations Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed the short-listed candidates. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended a candidate to the Board of Directors, Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon who, on February 10, 2021, was appointed as an Observer with the aim to propose her appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting. She will bring to the Board her\n\nprofessional experience and skills based on her wide-ranging finance and business background, and will further add to the gender diversity of the Board of Directors. She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 9.5 of the AFEP/MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Audit & Risks Committee.\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's term of office expires at the close of the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. On February 10, 2021, the Board, following the recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting to renew Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's office as Director for a four-year term with the intention to renew his office as Chairman & Chief executive officer. The performance by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire of the duties of Chairman and CEO seems particularly appropriate to the Board of Directors taking into account:",

On the occasion of its annual review of the governance mode of the Company, the Board has, however, expressed the wish to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief executive officer in the future. The Board is planning a separation of the two roles during Mr. Tricoire's upcoming term.\n\n- \u00b7 Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma was appointed Director to represent employee shareholders pursuant to Article 11-3 of the Articles of Association and her term of office expires at the close of the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. As a consequence, her successor must be appointed according to the procedure provided in this Article which stipulates that when employee shareholders hold more than 3% of the capital at the close of a given financial year, their representative must be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting from the candidates appointed by the supervisory boards of the FCPEs invested in company shares or by the employee shareholders when their shares are held directly and not via FCPEs. The candidates designated by this procedure are:\n- - Mr. Thierry Jacquet on the proposal of the French FCPE;\n- - Mrs. Zennia Csikos and Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma on the proposal of the international FCPE;\n- - Mrs. Malene Kvist Kristensen for the employee shareholders holding their shares directly.\n\nTheir biographies are provided in section 1.1 of Chapter 7.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon the report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, decided to support the resolution n\u00b013 providing for the appointment of Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma as member of the Board of Directors representing employee shareholders. Xiaoyun Ma's profile fits in with the Group's objectives in terms of experience within the Group and internationalization, as set by the Board of Directors in relation to its composition.\n\n- \u00b7 At its meeting of February 10, 2021, the Board of Directors took note of Mr. Patrick Montier's decision not to represent himself as a candidate for the renewal of his term of office. As Mr. Patrick Montier was appointed to represent employees pursuant to Article 11-4 of the Articles of Association, his successor must be appointed according to the procedure provided in this Article which stipulates that the French employee representative must be designated by the trade union which obtained the highest number of votes at the most recent elections which is as of today, Force Ouvri\u00e8re (FO).\n\nThe renewed Board would comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 15 members;\n- \u00b7 75% of independent Directors (excluding consideration of the Director representing employee shareholders and the Directors representing the employees, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code);\n- \u00b7 a percentage of women which will rise to 42% (Director representing employee shareholders and Directors representing employees excluded as per the provisions of the French Commercial Code) should Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon be appointed; and\n- \u00b7 a strong proportion of Directors of non-French origin (73%) reflecting the international nature of the Group.\n\nShareholder\n\nInfor\n\nm\n\nation",

These were later modified on December 11, 2019 to reflect the regulatory changes which took place in 2019. These internal regulations include the rules of procedure of the board committees and the Directors' charter as recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code. The regulations are reproduced hereafter and available on the Company's website, www.se.com.\n\n## Article 1 - Method of exercising general management - chairmanship and vice-chairmanship of the Board of Directors\n\n## A.  Method of exercising general management\n\n- 1. General management of the company is under the responsibility of either the chairperson of the Board of Directors, who will then go by the title of Chairman and Chief executive officer, or of another natural person appointed by the Board of Directors going by the title of Chief executive officer.\n- 2. The Board of Directors decides between these two methods of exercising general management at the time when the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief executive officer is appointed or when renewing their terms of office.

Governance Report\n\n## 1.2.4 Charter of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nThe Board of Directors adopted the Charter of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director which is reproduced hereafter and available on the Company's website, www.se.com.\n\n- 1. The Board of Directors may appoint a Vice-Chairman. The Vice-Chairman shall be appointed for a period that may not be any longer than his term of office as a Director. The Vice-Chairman is eligible for re-election. The Vice-Chairman may be removed from office by the Board of Directors at any time.\n- 2. The Vice-Chairman shall preside over Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman shall be called upon to replace the Chairman of the Board of Directors in the event of any temporary inability of the latter to fulfill his functions or his death. In the event of the Chairman's inability to fulfill his functions, he will be replaced by the Vice-Chairman as long as his inability may last and, in the case of his death, until the election of a new Chairman.\n\n- 3. In exception to 1 above, and in compliance with Article 12.2 of the Articles of Association, the appointment of a Vice-Chairman is compulsory if the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined. In this case, the Vice-Chairman also takes on the role of Lead Independent Director. In this respect:\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is kept informed of major events in Group life through regular contacts and monthly meetings with the Chairman serving as CEO;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is consulted by the Chairman serving as CEO on the agenda and the sequence of events for every Board meeting as well as on the schedule for Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman may convene executive sessions with non-executive members of the Board of Directors, over which he will preside. An executive session shall be included on the agenda of every Board meeting. It is the Vice-Chairman's responsibility to decide whether it should be held or not. It is therefore held as decided by the Vice-Chairman, either directly before or after each Board meeting. In addition, the Vice-Chairman may convene an executive session between 2 Board meetings. Any Director may ask the Vice-Chairman to convene an executive session;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall promptly report to the Chairman serving as CEO on the conclusions of executive sessions;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall draw the attention of the Chairman and of the Board of Directors to any possible conflicts of interest that he may have identified;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is Chairman of the Governance Committee;\n- \u00b7 like any other member of the Board, the Vice-Chairman may attend any meetings of committees of which he is not a member;\n- \u00b7 in order to complement his knowledge, the Vice-Chairman may meet the Group's leading managers and visit company sites;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman carries out annual and biennial assessments of the Board of Directors and, in this context, assesses the actual contribution of every member of the Board to the Board's works;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall report on his actions at Annual General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall meet any shareholder who wishes so and inform the Board of their concerns on governance matters.\n- 4.

        "page_content": "## 1.2.5 Information and training of the Board of Directors and its members\n\nTo ensure that the Board of Directors is well informed at all times, Schneider Electric SE applies the following rules: members of the Board have access, via a secure dedicated platform, in principle, ten days before every board meeting, to the agenda for the meeting and to the draft minutes of the last meeting and, four to five days before, to the Board's file. The documentation includes a quarterly activities report, presentations on items scheduled on the agenda or notes, and, as appropriate, draft statutory and consolidated financial information. A supplementary file may also be provided at the meeting.\n\nExecutive Committee members are invited, depending on the subject, to present the major issues within their areas of responsibility. Statutory auditors attend the portion of the Board's meetings at which the statutory and interim financial statements are reviewed.\n\nBetween each meeting of the Board of Directors, aside from meetings that they may have with the Chairman and CEO, Directors receive continuous information through periodic information letters, drafted exclusively for their attention, which keep them informed of developments in the Group, the competitive environment and developments in investor consensus and feedback. They also receive a weekly press review, all of the Company's press releases, relevant financial analysts' reports, and other documents.\n\nBoard members also have the opportunity to meet informally with key members of senior management between Board meetings.\n\nBoard of Director dinners are also organized in order to offer more opportunities to interact with investors, customers, experts, etc. These dinners are meant to provide the Board members with external views on the Group, to increase their understanding of the changes in its business environment, and to gain more insight on the needs and motivations of all stakeholders. In 2020, due to COVID-19 sanitary crisis, only one dinner was organized in February 2020 before the first lockdown in France.\n\n## On-boarding program of new Directors\n\nA complete on-boarding program is provided to any new Director in order to help them to get a deep understanding of the business, the challenges and priorities of Schneider Electric as well as its governance and values. As such, new Directors are offered a training and information program on the Group's strategy and businesses designed around a common core which comprises of:\n\n- \u00b7 a set of documents including, in particular, the last registration document and integrated report, the Company's Articles of Association, the internal regulations of the Board of Directors, the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the compliance Code governing stockmarket transactions (see below), the minutes of the Board's and committees' meetings for the period starting from the appointment back to the full year before, Directors' and officers' liability master policy and the last three periodic information letters;\n- \u00b7 a summary relating to the Group organization;\n- \u00b7 working meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-presidents of Strategy, Energy Management, Industrial Automation, and other EVPs as the case may be;\n- \u00b7 a work session with the secretary of the committee(s) he/she will join;\n- \u00b7 concerning governance and values: work session with the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director; the chief governance officer and secretary general, the secretary of the Board of Directors, as well as with the persons in charge of compliance and ethics and sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 to know more about Schneider Electric's shareholding structure and shareholders' expectations, an interview with the senior Vicepresident Investors Relations;\n- \u00b7 training on the use of the secure dedicated platform on which all the board's files are filed and kept;\n- \u00b7 the designation of a mentor for any new Director to facilitate his/her integration;\n- \u00b7 as the case may be, visits to sites which are particularly illustrative of Schneider Electric's activities.\n\nIn addition, the Directors representing employees, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Patrick Montier, benefit from a training program compliant with legal requirements and approved by the Board of Directors. In pursuance of new French regulations coming from law n\u00b02019-486 of May 22, 2019 relating to companies' growth and transformation, known as PACTE law, the Director representing the employee shareholders, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, was offered a tailored training session to address her needs.\n\n## Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions\n\nSchneider Electric has adopted a compliance Code governing stock-market transactions for members of the Board of Directors and Group employees designed to prevent insider trading. Under these provisions, both Directors and relevant employees are barred from trading in the Company shares and shares in companies for which they have inside information that has not yet been made public. In addition, they may not trade in Schneider Electric SE shares during the 31 days preceding the day following publication of the annual and interim financial statements, nor during the 16 days preceding the day following publication of a quarterly update, nor may they engage in any type of speculative trading involving Schneider Electric SE shares (including margin trading, purchasing, and selling shares in a period of less than four months). In addition, in accordance with the AFEP/ MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, Corporate Officers also undertake not to enter into hedges of shares resulting from exercise of options and of Performance Shares they are required to hold (see page 230). These restrictions supplement the prohibition against hedging unvested stock options and Performance Shares during their vesting period.\n\nThe compliance Code governing stock-market transactions was revised when the European 'Market Abuse Regulation' No. 2014/596 of April 16, 2014 entered into force, and subsequently updated in December 2018. The regulation obliges companies to draw up insider lists, and market operators to put in place mechanisms aimed at preventing and detecting suspicious transactions, enabling them to report to the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers those that seem to them to constitute insider dealing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Governance Report\n\n## 1.2.6 Self-assessment of the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant to its internal regulations, Schneider Electric SE's Board of Directors annually reviews its composition, organization, and operations, as well as those of its committees. This yearly assessment is carried out through a written questionnaire sent to Board members or an interview with the Board member. The evaluation is conducted under the leadership of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director by the secretary of the Board of Directors. In addition, as per the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors shall undertake at least once every three years, a formal self-assessment, which may be conducted with the assistance of an external consultant.\n\n## Formal self-assessment conducted in September and October 2020 (with the assistance of an independent and external expert)\n\nIn accordance with the three - year frequency recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, a formal assessment of the activities of the Board of Directors and its specialized committees was performed at the end of 2020 with the assistance of an external service provider and under the responsibility of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, who guaranteed the confidentiality of opinions expressed, the objectivity of analyses and the consultant's ability to freely express his recommendations.\n\nTo ensure independence and avoid any conflict of interest, it was decided to appoint a firm that was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of Directors on behalf of the Group. The assessment was therefore conducted by Russels Reynolds. For the purposes of the assessment, each Director was asked to complete a detailed questionnaire validated beforehand by the Lead Independent Director. The answers provided were used to prepare 'interview guidelines' for meetings held with each Director to obtain, with complete anonymity, their comments and suggestions. The questions focused on the composition and activities of the Board of Directors and its Committees and enabled a self - assessment of the effective contribution of each Director. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director provided individual feedback on these assessments of the effective contribution of each Director.\n\nA summary report was presented to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and to the Board of Directors on December 14, 2020 by the external consultant, analyzing the information gathered both through the questionnaires and the individual meetings. This report was discussed in detail.\n\n## Key findings\n\nThe 2020 external assessment of the Board of Directors concluded that Schneider Electric Board has:\n\n- \u00b7 a leading edge in most governance and Board effectiveness aspects (future-oriented, well-functioning, effective best practices in corporate governance);\n- \u00b7 a strong Board culture that is trust-based and open yet challenging with appropriate behaviors from all Board members;\n- \u00b7 a good strategic, risk, and Environmental, Social and Governance alignment;\n- \u00b7 a transparent relationship with the senior management team;\n- \u00b7 a composition that was found to be particularly diverse and appropriate with the right set of skills, experiences, and geographies;\n- \u00b7 a high consideration for actions and disclosures related to Environmental, Social and Governance issues that are considered to be at world class level.\n\nThe management of the Board meetings and processes were also praised.\n\n## Areas for improvement\n\nNo major short-term concerns were raised based on this external assessment. Nevertheless, the Company is undergoing significant transformation and it was recommended that continued emphasis was placed on the following few areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term Board composition and succession planning;\n- \u00b7 Further improving Board materials, especially timelines and structure.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5 Report of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director of the Board of Directors\n\nMr. Fred Kindle hereby reports on the work he carried out in 2020 as part of his responsibilities as Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director. He was appointed as Vice-Chairman on April 23, 2020 in replacement of Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker who lost his status of independent Director due the length of his tenure to the Board. In order to ensure a smooth transition between him and Mr. Fred Kindle, most of the engagement meetings held with shareholders in March ahead of the Annual General Meeting were done jointly by the former and the new Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is appointed by the Board of Directors in pursuance of Article 12 of the Articles of Association, which provide for the appointment of a Vice-Chairman with the function of a Lead Independent Director if the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined. In compliance with Article 12 of the Articles of Association, the duties of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director are defined by the internal regulations of the Board of Directors. Those internal regulations and the charter for the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director can be found on section 1.2.3 of Chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Information of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nTo be able to carry out his duties, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director must have excellent knowledge of the Group and be particularly well informed about its business performance.\n\nAs such, the Vice-Chairman is apprised of current events and the performance of the Group through weekly exchanges with the Chairman and CEO. He meets regularly all members of the Group Executive Committee and pursues regular interactions with managers and other employees of the Group in various sites of Schneider Electric.\n\nHe is continuously kept informed of the evolution of the competitive environment, technological breakthroughs and business opportunities. Besides he is also the Chairman of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and a member of the Investment Committee.\n\n## Participation in the preparation of the meetings of the Board\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director participated in the preparation for meetings of the Board of Directors. As a result, he has participated in all the 'pre-Board' meetings. As a matter of fact, each meeting of the Board of Directors is preceded by one or two preBoard meetings, in which the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary General and the Board Secretary review the topics and issues addressed by the committees, and establish the agenda prepared by the Chairman and the content of the meeting file.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director chairs the executive sessions ( i.e. the meetings where Board members meet without the presence of the Corporate Officer), convened at the end of each Board meeting. The employee Directors are invited to attend all executive sessions following meetings of the Board at which they are present.\n\nThe Board of Directors held three executive sessions in 2020 during which its members expressed their views and observations on, among others, the Group's strategic options and the succession planning of the Corporate Officer. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director reported the conclusions thereof to the Chairman.\n\n## Interaction with shareholders\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is the designated contact for the shareholders on matters pertaining to corporate governance. He carried out two shareholder engagement campaigns in 2020: one before the Shareholders' Meeting to present to those who so wished, the resolutions submitted to the shareholders' approval; the other one, in the fall semester, to freely exchange views on topical themes of corporate governance that do not materialize in resolutions submitted to the shareholders' approval and thus, are excluded from the usual dialog. On this occasion, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director explained to the investors' representatives the growing importance of social and environmental topics at the Board of Directors and their reflection in the Corporate Officers' compensation. Overall, these two campaigns comprised 28 face-to-face or phone meetings with analysts from a wide range of corporate governance cultures and covered around 40% of the share capital. The conclusions of these discussions have been reported in detail to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and contributed to its on-going thought process on governance matters. Report thereon was subsequently made to the Board.\n\n## Other duties\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director conducted the annual deliberation of the Board on its composition, organization and operations as well as those of its committees. In 2020, this self-assessment was carried out by an external independent firm. The conclusions of this assessment, which highlighted the quest for continuous improvement, are presented on section 1.2.6 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director has also had frequent contacts with each of the Directors. He ensured that there was no conflict of interest within the Board of Directors, which he would have been responsible for bringing to the attention of the Chairman.",

It also felt it necessary to strengthen Mr. Babeau's post-mandate commitments in terms of non-compete and other restrictive covenants, which Mr. Babeau accepted.\n\nThe agreement provided for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Base salary for 2020 due on monthly instalments as per the 2019 policy providing for an annual amount of \u20ac680,000, representing an aggregate amount at the date of departure of \u20ac226,667;\n- \u00b7 Annual incentive for 2020 awarded at the target level, ie. 100% of the base salary, and calculated prorata temporis over the time of presence, representing therefore an accrued amount at the date of departure of \u20ac226,667;\n- \u00b7 Corresponding complementary payments for pension building to be paid or awarded as per the 2019 policy in the same manner as the base salary and the annual incentive, representing therefore \u20ac51,100 for the fixed portion (based on an annual amount of \u20ac153,300) and \u20ac51,100 for the variable portion;\n- \u00b7 Non-compete commitment replaced with a fresh one, with a scope extended, notably, to companies from the technology and engineering sectors and a term prolonged to two years (vs. 12 months previously);\n- \u00b7 Restrictive covenants of non-solicitation, non-disparagement, confidentiality and cooperation in the context of legal or administrative proceedings involving the company, for a term of 2 years after the date of departure;\n- \u00b7 Payment of non-compete indemnity at 60% of the total effective target cash compensation waived by Mr. Babeau;\n- \u00b7 By way of derogation, waiver of the presence condition applicable to the unvested Performance Shares granted to Mr. Babeau in 2018 and 2019, which gives him the right to retain such unvested Performance Shares in proportion to his time of presence within the Group over the total vesting period of the plans. This corresponds to 18,056 Performance Shares granted in 2018 and 9,389 Performance Shares granted in 2019, which remain subject to the original performance conditions and other terms of the plans;\n\n- \u00b7 Legal and tax support until the completion of the study relating to the consequences of him being based in the United-Kingdom from July 2014 to July 2018, the cost of which is capped at 15,000 euros.\n\nThis agreement was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of 23 April 2020 under the 5th resolution.\n\n## 1.7.2 Procedure for assessing agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting of December 11, 2019, established a procedure for regularly assessing whether agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions meet these conditions. Any persons directly or indirectly concerned by any of these agreements shall not participate in its assessment.\n\nThe procedure is comprised of two phases:\n\n- \u00b7 the assessment of the application of Schneider Electric SE's internal charter for regulated agreements approved by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2020, which results in an annual business report drawn up jointly by the legal department and the secretary of the board. This report is made available to the Audit & Risks Committee for preparing the evaluation report it draws up for the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the assessment by the Board of Directors of criteria for qualifying agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions which deliberates on the basis of the above-mentioned assessment report drawn up by the Audit & Risks Committee.\n\nAccording to this procedure, the Governance & Remunerations Committee reviewed at its meeting of December 10, 2020, the relevance of criteria for qualifying agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions as defined by the procedure and decided not to amend it.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compensation Report\n\n## 2.1 Overview\n\nThroughout 2020, the Board continued to discuss compensation policy and approach with many of Schneider Electric's largest shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director met with 28 investors, representing ~40% of the share capital during two shareholders engagement campaigns dedicated to Governance, one in March ahead of the AGM and one in fall, and reported back to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and to the Board thereon. This dialogue will be pursued in 2021 to ensure that the Board took the feedback into account to determine the compensation of the Corporate Officers.\n\nThe 2020 policy received a very large support from the shareholders at the 2020 Annual Shareholders' meeting and the subsequent engagement with the shareholders thereon did not raise any concerns. After a previous year where the Compensation policy was largely reviewed to take into account the expectations expressed by the shareholders, for example, on the post-mandate benefits and the new LTIP criteria, the Board of Directors decided not to materially change the compensation policy for 2021 which appears balanced and provides market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, and long-term focus.\n\n89%\n\nof the shareholder votes cast supported 2019 compensation decisions for the Chairman and CEO\n\n## Group's strategic priorities\n\nOrganic growth\n\nValue for customers\n\nSustainability\n\nContinuous efficiency\n\nValue & returns to shareholders\n\n90%\n\napproved the principles and criteria governing 2020 compensation for the Chairman and CEO\n\n93%\n\nof the shareholders supported the 2020 compensation report\n\nHow the strategy links to the Corporate Officers' variable compensation\n\n## Annual incentive plan\n\nDelivering strong execution and creating value for customers and shareholders every year to contribute to Schneider Electric's long-term success, in line with the financial objectives communicated to the market\n\nGroup organic sales growth\n\n40%\n\nGroup adjusted EBITA margin improvement\n\n30%\n\nGroup cash conversion rate\n\n10%\n\nSchneider Sustainability Impact\n\n20%\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nBuilding an integrated and leading company with strong sustainability focus and attractive returns to shareholders\n\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\n\n40%\n\nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n\n35%\n\nRelative Sustainability Index\n\n25%",

They are deemed to constitute the last policy approved by the shareholders in the meaning of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code and govern the entirety of the compensation granted by the Group to the Corporate Officers until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.\n\n## Pillar\n\n## How It is reflected in the Group 2020 Compensation Policy\n\nPay-for-performance\n\nPrinciple 1: Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n\n## Alignment with shareholders' interests\n\nA prevalent part of the Corporate Officer target package shall be variable; the 2020 target package thus consist of approximately 80% variable pay component (excluding pension payments).\n\nChairman and Chief executive officer:\n\nOn target pay mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle 2: Performance evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n\nPerformance is evaluated via criteria that are mainly economic (80% of variable cash compensation and 75% of multi-year Performance Shares) and measurable, which are selected based on KPIs used in the market communication and drivers of the Group's strategy. All criteria have measurable targets approved by the Board at the beginning of the performance period, ensuring targets are achievable but demanding.\n\n## Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual incentive) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\n2020 Annual Incentive (80% financial):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Group organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 30% Adjusted EBITA margin (organic) improvement\n- \u00b7 20% Schneider Sustainability Impact\n- \u00b7 10% Group cash conversion rate\n\n## Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n\nThe Corporate Officer's target package consists of approximately 60% long-term share-based benefits, meaning their compensation is subject to the same share price volatility that shareholders experience.\n\nPrinciple 5: Performance conditions aligned to shareholders' expectations and Schneider Electric's strategic priorities.\n\nPerformance criteria were selected from financial indicators that are most representative of Group performance and that are closely linked to shareholder value creation. Performance levels required to reach targets were set at the beginning of the year in line with the objectives disclosed to the market at the same time as the results of the previous fiscal year and were supplemented by factors that enable the Group to offer a long-term and satisfactory development outlook for all stakeholders in the Company's success.\n\n2020 Long-term incentive (75% financial and TSR):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Adjusted EPS\n- \u00b7 35% Relative Total Shareholder Return\n- \u00b7 25% Schneider Sustainability Index",

Most of the Group's key competitors are headquartered outside France. To reflect this, the International Peer group consists of 24 French, European, and US companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in size or industry sector, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition. Compensation levels for Corporate Officers are reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the median of this peer group to ensure they remain reasonable and appropriately competitive. This benchmarking is primarily used to establish a frame of reference for what competitors are paying to comparable roles, rather than as the main factor for making compensation decisions.\n\nThe 2020 peer group which did not change compared to 2019 included European and US-based companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Business competitors (in particular, those identified in the Long-term incentive plan as performance peers for TSR comparison purposes);\n- \u00b7 Talent competitors for operational and functional roles; and\n- \u00b7 'Acceptance' peers ( i.e. groups of a similar size, business, or structure)\n\n| Group 1:  European  (Capital Goods)   | Group 2:  European  (Construction)   | Group 3:  European  (Technology  Hardware  & Software)   | Group 4:  European  (Industrial B2B)   | Group 5:  US  (Capital Goods)   | Group 6:  US  (Technology  Hardware  & Software)   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| ABB                                   | ACS                                  | Dassault                                                 | Airbus Group                           | Eaton                           | Autodesk                                           |\n| Atlas Copco                           | Lafarge Holcim                       | Syst\u00e8mes                                                 | Air Liquide                            | Emerson                         | PTC                                                |\n| Legrand                               | Saint-Gobain                         | Hexagon  SAP                                             | Bayer                                  | Honeywell                       |                                                    |\n| Siemens                               | Vinci                                |                                                          | Thyssenkrup                            | Johnson Controls                |                                                    |\n| CNH Industrial                        |                                      | TE Connectivity                                          |                                        | Rockwell                        |                                                    |\n\n## Principle 7: To reference the CAC 40 third quartile and the Stoxx Europe 50 median.\n\nThe Board reviews Corporate Officer's compensation with reference to the upper quartile of the CAC 40 companies and the median of the Stoxx Europe 50 companies, in line with the Group's position within these panels.\n\nPositioning of 2020 at target compensation of Schneider Electric's Corporate Officer relative to the market benchmarks\n\n## Chairman and CEO compensation relative to the market benchmarks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal compensation includes base salary, annual incentive at target, and IFRS value of Performance Shares granted during the year.",

Hence, his fixed compensation paid during and for the fiscal year 2020 amounted to \u20ac875,000 instead of \u20ac1,000,000.\n\n## Reminder of the 2020 compensation policy\n\nThe annual variable compensation rewards achievement of the short-term financial, and sustainability (corporate and social responsibility) objectives of the Group.\n\nThe pay-out opportunity is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at threshold performance: 0% of the fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 at target: 130% of the fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 at maximum over-performance: 260% of the fixed compensation.\n\nThe payment of the variable annual cash compensation is conditional upon approval by shareholders of the compensation granted to the concerned Corporate Officer.\n\nThe structure of the 2020 Annual variable compensation focuses on what matters to Schneider Electric in delivering value to shareholders. 100% of the variable compensation depends on measurable objectives. As a reminder, in 2019, the annual variable compensation structure was simplified from eight performance criteria to four, with 80% financial and 20% sustainability based criteria, while removing the portion based on individual assessment by the Board.\n\nThe financial criteria (organic sales growth (40%), adjusted EBITA margin (30%), and cash conversion (10%)) closely align pay outcomes for the Corporate Officer to Schneider Electric's financial performance. The significant part is subject to the Schneider Sustainability Impact (20%) highlighting the importance of sustainability on Schneider Electric's business agenda.\n\nThe Board also ensured that more stringent targets were set for the annual variable compensation with maximum award only payable if a strong performance is delivered on each performance metric.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\n## \u20ac1,048,775\n\n(amount due for 2020 to be paid in 2021)\n\nReminder: \u20ac1,717,300 (amount due for 2019 paid in 2020)\n\n<!-- image -->",

In consultation with him, the Board of Directors considered that the reduction to his fixed compensation in 2020 (due to the donation of 25% of his fixed remuneration over 6 months to the Tomorrow Rising Fund) should also be reflected in the basis of calculation of his annual variable compensation due for 2020. Therefore, the outcome of the variable compensation is applied on his actual fixed annual compensation of \u20ac875,000, instead of a normative annual compensation of \u20ac1,000,000.\n\nThe annual incentive due for 2020 was determined by the Board at the meeting of February 10, 2021, based on the attainment rate of the objectives set for fiscal year 2020 as reviewed by the Board of Directors at its July 28, 2020 meeting.\n\nIndeed, the guidance announced at the beginning of 2020 was withdrawn in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. In July 2020, after assessing the first half of 2020 results, the Board issued a new 2020 guidance demonstrating the good resilience of the Group in a challenging year. At that time, for the 2020 annual variable compensation of the Chairman and CEO, the Board resolved to use the discretion clause provided in the existing compensation policy on the basis that:\n\n- \u00b7 The COVID-19 crisis constitutes an exceptional circumstance external to the Group;\n- \u00b7 The teams and the CEO had to work in a very challenging environment requiring them to be fully committed and to constantly adapt themselves to a situation changing daily;\n- \u00b7 The Group's interest was to continue to incentivize, within a reasonable level, the Corporate Officer and all employees to drive the performance of the Company and keep all teams motivated to achieve the new guidance issued.\n\nThe Board therefore decided in July 2020 that:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of the discretion clause shall ensure the payout outcome of the Corporate Officer is aligned with shareholders' experience and consistent with the approach applied to ~58,000 employees of the Group who participate in a similar annual variable plan with the same criteria as the one used for the Chairman & CEO;\n- \u00b7 The use of the discretion clause will impact the Chairman & CEO's annual variable compensation for the two objectives linked to organic sales growth (40%) and adjusted EBITA margin improvement (30%) set at the beginning of the year and align them with the new targets published in July 2020 (Revenue between -7% to -10% organic, Adjusted EBITA margin between -0.5 pts to -0.8 pts organic);\n- \u00b7 The use of the discretion clause would be fully disclosed in the 2020 Universal Registration Document and submitted to the shareholders' vote at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 The outcome of the variable compensation will be reviewed to ensure that there is an alignment between pay and performance, taking into account the overall economic circumstances and the achievements of the Company compared to the market and its peers.\n\nIt is important to note that the discretion clause has not been applied to the Long Term Incentive Plans, hence there were no amendments to any LTIP targets and plans which remained unchanged.\n\nAt its meeting on February 10. 2021, the Board of Directors first assessed the two criteria not affected by the application of the discretion clause. These two criteria, i.e. the cash conversion rate and the Schneider Sustainability Impact, amounted to a 46.4% achievement rate.\n\n|                                          | Weight (%)   | Performance range   | Performance range   | Performance range   | Achievement   | Achievement                   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2020 performance criteria                |              | Threshold 0%        | Target 100%         | Maximum 200%        | 2020  results | Achievement  rate  (weighted) |\n| Cash conversion rate                     | 10%          | 85%                 | 100%                | 115%                | 159%          | 20.0%                         |\n| Schneider Sustainability Impact  (score) | 20%          | 8                   | 9                   | 10                  | 9.32          | 26.4%                         |\n| Total                                    | 30%          |                     |                     |                     |               | 46.4%                         |\n\n- \u00b7 Efforts on cash management delivered excellent results, the free cash-flow was \u20ac3.67bn. Cash conversion was 159% (excluding IFRS 16) in 2020 on a normalized basis which represented a maximum achievement rate of 20% on this criterion.\n- \u00b7 The Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), the Group's three-year (2018-2020) transformation plan which measures the progress towards its ambitious sustainability commitments reached a good result of 9.32/10, exceeding the target set for this criterion, representing an achievement rate of 26.4%.",

        "page_content": "## Annual variable compensation\n\n(continued)\n\nFor the two other criteria (organic sales growth and Adjusted EBITA margin), considering the excellent resilience that the Company demonstrated in 2020 through the COVID-19 crisis and the exceptional total shareholders return achieved (Schneider Electric ranked 2 nd of the CAC40 and 1 st of its Peer group in 2020), the Board of Directors confirmed its decision to use the discretion clause.\n\nThe Board assessed the results achieved by the Group for these two criteria as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Despite the challenging circumstances the Group delivered organic sales growth of -4.7%, a level which clearly exceeded the guidance of -10% to -7% given in July, and also the revised guidance of -7% to -5% given in October;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin increased organically by +0.2 pts thanks to a combination of tactical savings and productivity actions, a very strong performance that exceeded the guidance of July of -0.8 pts to -0.5 pts and also the one of October 2020 of -0.2 pts to +0.1 pts.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration of the annual incentive potential outcomes for the Chairman and CEO, the Board decided not to use these revised targets as a reference for the annual variable compensation assessment as this would have resulted in an achievement rate close to 140% for these two performance criteria alone (organic sales growth and adjusted EBITA margin).\n\nIn view of this and the unprecedented circumstances in 2020, the Board carefully reviewed the options. Much emphasis was given to a strong alignment between pay and performance taking into account the particular challenges in this year, and the achievements of the Group compared to its market and peers. The Board acknowledged the excellent leadership in this exceptional period by the Chairman and CEO and the resilient results achieved by the Group.\n\nThe Board decided to award 45.8% achievement on the mentioned two criteria. This represents a reduced level as compared to 'on target\" (70%) and 'maximum' (140%) but reflecting the various considerations. This resulted in a total annual achievement rate of 92.2%, slightly below target (taking into account the effect of the voluntary compensation reduction mentioned above, the actual achievement rate is 80.7% which can be compared to 132.1% in 2019).\n\nThe Board noted that the achievement rate of 92.2% of the Group objectives is consistent with the result for the Group part of the annual variable plan applicable to ~58,000 Schneider Electric's employees globally and that the average outcome for the participants of this programme was above 100% due to the individual part of the plan which does not apply to the Chairman and CEO (for more details, see section 4.6 of Chapter 2 of the Universal Registration Document).\n\nWhen making this decision, the Board also took in consideration the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group did not benefit from significant grants established by the countries impacted by the pandemic, and chose not to resort to the exceptional liquidity support schemes proposed by the French state to overcome the crisis, nor the French special COVID-19 crisis scheme of partial unemployment;\n- \u00b7 The response from the management of the Group to recognize the efforts demonstrated by all employees globally during the challenging year and complexities caused by COVID-19, including;\n- - the special positive adjustment applied to the outcome of the annual incentive plan;\n- - the reversal of COVID-19 pay reduction impact on calculation of the annual incentive pay-out - contrary to the approach taken for the Chairman and CEO;\n- - a one-time payment to recognize the exceptional effort of Schneider Electric field employees.\n\nAs a result, the 2020 Annual variable compensation pay-out for the Corporate Officer was calculated on the base of his actual fixed compensation (including the pay-cut linked to the COVID-19 crisis) as follows:\n\n| At Target pay-out   | At Target pay-out   | Achievement rate   | 2020 Actual pay-out   | 2020 Actual pay-out   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| as a % of salary    | Amount (\u20ac)          | as a % of target   | as a % of salary      | Amount (\u20ac)            |\n| 130%                | \u20ac 1,137,500 (1)     | 92.2%              | 104.9% (2)            | \u20ac 1,048,775           |",

After applying the reduction for performance not achieved, the resulting outcomes were as follows:\n\n| Corporate Officer    | Number of Shares   (Plan n\u00b0 30) (1)   | Number of Shares   (Plan n\u00b0 31)   | Number of shares  deemed vested   | No of shares lapsed   | Value of deemed  vested shares (2)   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire | 18,000                                | 42,000                            | 58,909                            | 1,091                 | 6,968,935                            |\n| Vesting date         | March 26, 2021                        | March 26, 2021                    |                                   |                       |                                      |\n\n- (2)  Vested shares are valued at the closing share price of December 31, 2020, i.e. \u20ac118.3.\n\n## Reminder of the 2020 compensation policy\n\nThe Compensation policy provides that the Chairman and CEO may benefit from:\n\n- \u00b7 the employer matching contributions;\n- \u00b7 the profit-sharing;\n- \u00b7 a company car;\n- \u00b7 supplementary Life & Disability scheme.\n\n## Application of the 2020 compensation policy\n\nFor the fiscal year 2020, the Chairman and CEO was eligible for profit-sharing and the employer matching contributions paid to Employee Saving Plan subscribers. In addition, he was eligible for the employer matching contributions paid to subscribers to the collective pension fund (PERCO) for the retirement of workers in France. The use of a company car in 2020 represented an equivalent cost of \u20ac26,345.\n\n| Employer matching  contributions to Employee  Saving Plan   | Employer matching  contributions to  collective pension  saving plan (PERCO)   | Profit-sharing   | Company car   | Total 2020 benefits   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac1,404                                                      | \u20ac800                                                                           | \u20ac7,575           | \u20ac26,345       | \u20ac36,124               |\n\nThe Chairman and CEO is eligible for (i) the collective welfare plan applicable to employees of Schneider Electric SE and Schneider Electric Industries SAS covering the risks of illness, incapacity, disability, and death and (ii) additional coverages conditional on the fulfilment of some conditions as described in the compensation policy (cf. chapter 3, section 2.3.1 of the Universal Registration Document).",

Schneider Electric ranked 1 st on relative TSR, delivering c. 75% return to shareholders over the same three-year period, demonstrating a strong value creation for the shareholders. Schneider Electric delivered robust organic adjusted EBITA margin improvement year-on-year, largely beating initial targets, exceeding the cash conversion rate three-year target, and demonstrating consistent progress on the Group's sustainability targets which are at the heart of the Group's strategy. These strong results across the range of performance criteria led to a vesting outcome of 98.18% out of 100%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LTIP 2018 Performance criteria achievement\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin (organic) improvement (40%)\n\nCash Conversion Rate (25%)\n\nRelative TSR (15%)\n\nSchneider Sustainability Impact (20%)\n\nTotal weighted achievement rate\n\n- \u00b7 Organic adjusted EBITA margin improvement (40%) - During the 3 years plan, the adjusted EBITA organic margin improved by more than +0.45 pts on average, reflecting the successful execution of the strategy combining top line growth, positive net pricing, better mix, industrial productivity, and better efficiency to reduce SFCs. Despite of the COVID-19 crisis, the adjusted EBITA margin increased organically by +0.2 pts in 2020 thanks to a combination of tactical savings and productivity actions. Overall, the achievement rate for this criterion was 32% (out of 40%).\n- \u00b7 Cash conversion (25%) - Our efforts on cash management delivered outstanding results consistently over the three-year period with an average cash conversion rate c. 123%, outperforming the target of 100% average cash conversion. 2020 was particularly remarkable with a 159% cash conversion rate. The achievement rate for this criterion was set at 37.5%, including the over-performance of 12.5%, which contributed to the offsetting of the non-achievement of the adjusted EBITA margin criterion.\n- \u00b7 Relative TSR (15%) - The Group's performance was acknowledged by the market and reflected in the stock price increase, which, combined with a robust dividend distribution policy and consistent share buy-back program to balance the dilution coming from allocation of Performance Shares and employee shareholding schemes, generated strong returns to shareholders over the period. Schneider Electric's TSR was ranked 1 st versus the selected peers (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa). The achievement rate for this criterion was set at 22.5%, including the over-performance of 7.5%, which contributed to the offsetting of the non-achievement of the adjusted EBITA margin criterion.\n- \u00b7 Planet & Society Barometer/Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) (20%) - The barometer provides, on a scoring scale of 10, an overall measure of the Group's progress on sustainability issues. Over the last three years, Schneider Electric demonstrated strong delivery and continuous improvement on its suitability programs. The barometer reached a score of 9.32 out of 10 versus the ambitious target of 10.0 set by the Board for this criterion, which resulted in an achievement rate of 79.6% for 2020 with overall 18.18% shares vesting out of 20% allocated to this criterion.\n\nHistorical vesting of the Corporate Officers' Performance Share plans:\n\nLTIP 2018 98.18%\n\nLTIP 2017 99.54%\n\nLTIP 2016 91.46%\n\nLTIP 2015 71%\n\nLTIP 2014 78%\n\nLTIP 2013 100%",

three years (cf. page 273 of the 2019 Universal Registration Document).\n\n## Non-compete compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors reviewed the contractual conditions currently applicable to the Corporate Officers as part of their status, which was amended for the last time on February 14, 2018 and approved under the procedure of the regulated agreements and commitments at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 24, 2018.\n\nThe Board of Directors, during its meeting of February 28, 2020, after hearing the report of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and deliberating thereon, decided to modify the term of the previous non-compete agreement in order to further protect the Company and Group's interests after the departure of the former Deputy CEO, which was subsequently approved by the Shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 23, 2020.\n\nThe terms of this new agreement were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 scope extended to positions as employee, executive, and non-executive officer (and in particular, any participation in a governance body) and to any activity providing services or consultancy within or to the companies already covered by the initial non-compete agreement as well as companies in the engineering and industrial software sector;\n- \u00b7 term of the non-compete commitment extended to two years (instead of 12 months under the previous commitment);\n- \u00b7 additional restrictive covenants of: (i) non-solicitation, (ii) non-disparagement, (iii)/uni00A0confidentiality, and (iv) cooperation in the context of legal or administrative proceedings involving the Company, all binding Mr. Emmanuel Babeau for a period of two years.\n\nSubject to compliance with the terms of all these commitments and covenants, Mr. Emmanuel Babeau was entitled to retain the unvested Performance Shares granted to him in 2018 and 2019, in proportion to the time of his presence over the vesting period of the Performance Share plans concerned and subject to the original performance conditions applicable to those shares and the plan rules.\n\nFor 2020, Mr. Emmanuel Babeau was not awarded nor did he benefit from multi-annual variable compensation, exceptional compensation, stock options, welcome bonus, or Directors' fees.\n\nEmployer social contributions paid by the Group's companies in respect of Mr. Emmanuel Babeau's compensation amounted to \u20ac612,335 in 2020.",

Besides the fixed base amount, Directors' compensation mostly depends upon the said Directors' attendance at Board and committee meetings.\n\nUpon the recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors is responsible for setting the allocation of the Directors' fees among Board members accordingly with the maximum annual amount of Directors' fees that can be paid to the Board members is set at \u20ac2,500,000 by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 25, 2019; and the 2020 compensation policy approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 23, 2020 which provides that the allocation rules of the fees to the nonexecutive Directors are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-executive Directors are paid:\n- - a fixed basic amount of \u20ac25,000 for membership of the Board;\n- - an amount of \u20ac7,000 per Board meeting attended;\n- - an amount of \u20ac4,000 per Committee meeting attended;\n- - an amount of \u20ac5,000 (for intercontinental travel) or \u20ac3,000 (for intra-continental travels) per Board session physically attended.\n- \u00b7 Additional annual payments are made to non-executive Directors who chair a Committee to reflect the additional responsibilities and workload:\n- - Audit & Risks Committee: \u20ac20,000;\n- - Human Resources & CSR Committee, Digital Committee, and Investment Committee: \u20ac15,000; and\n- - Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director, who is also the Chairman of the Governance & Remunerations Committee: \u20ac250,000.\n- \u00b7 For an observer, an annual fixed payment of \u20ac20,000 is paid, unless they become a non-executive Director at the next General Meeting. In this case, they will receive the same fees for attending the Board and committee meetings as non-executive Directors.\n- \u00b7 All payments are pro-rated for time served during the year and are paid in cash.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.5 Pay Equity ratio\n\n## Employees experience at Schneider Electric\n\nDelivery of the strategy, both short term and long term, depends upon Schneider Electric's success in attracting and engaging a highly talented workforce, and on equipping people with the skills for the future. The Group is committed to fair pay, which is at the forefront of the Group's and executives' agenda, ensuring that all Schneider Electric employees are appropriately and fairly rewarded for their contribution. The progress is monitored via the Schneider Sustainability Impact Indicators. More information can be found in the Sustainability section of this report, page 144.\n\n## Pay Equity\n\n## Living wage\n\n## Recognition\n\n## Well-being\n\n## Engagement\n\nSince 2015, as part of its HeForShe commitments, the Group has developed and implemented a pay equity framework; proactive actions have been taken to not only close existing gender pay gaps but also to prevent gaps from being created in the first place. Furthermore, the pay equity adjustment is fully integrated into the annual global salary review and its principles leveraged during the promotion and hiring processes.\n\nSchneider Electric believes earning a decent wage is a basic human right and is committed to paying employees in the lower salary ranges at or above the living wage to meet their family's basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers food, housing, sanitation, education, and healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to creating a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues, celebrating people who constantly demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond - using global recognition portal 'Step Up' and encouraging the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'Thank you'.\n\nHealth and wellbeing are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its core sustainability mission. The Company has a commitment to strive, at a minimum, that 90% of Schneider Electric's employees have access to a comprehensive well-being at work program translated into dual standard of access to healthcare and well-being training programs further detailed in the 'Wellbeing in our DNA', subsection 4.2.4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Group listens to employees through a number of different channels, both formally and informally. Two of the Board directors are employees of the Company, appointed through a formal designation process; the Group runs OneVoice internal survey designed to measure employee satisfaction and engagement; the Group also recognizes the importance of dialog and engages with the local work councils on compensation matters on a regular basis.\n\n## Pay Equity Ratio\n\nEquity pay ratio measures the ratio between the level of compensation of the Chairman and CEO, and former Deputy CEO and CFO, and the average and median compensation of the employees, as required by Article L.22-10-9-3 6\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nThe compensation comparisons and pay ratios set out below were calculated based on the fixed and variable compensation paid and relevant benefits during the fiscal years indicated, including IFRS value of the Performance Shares granted during the same periods.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe legal scope, the issuer, comprises of only one employee, therefore, an alternate 'relevant scope' was defined to reflect a larger representative employee population as prescribed by article 26.2 of AFEP-MEDEF code. It is based on the French holding entity Schneider Electric Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (SESE) (the issuer) as well as all employees in France of the operational company Schneider Electric Industries (SAS). This group of employees is employed on comparable terms to the Corporate Officers and represents more than 4,000 employees in France on a full time equivalent basis (FTE).\n\nThe ratios between the compensation paid to the Corporate Officers, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and Chief executive officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, former Deputy CEO and CFO, and the average and median compensation received by Schneider Electric employees are presented in the table below.\n\nThe former Deputy CEO and CFO's compensation was calculated on a like-for-like basis to the Chairman and Chief executive officer as if Mr. Babeau would have continued to be a Deputy CEO and CFO of the company for the full fiscal year, i.e. it was annualized for the full fiscal year, including the same 25% reduction in fixed compensation as for the Chairman and CEO, excluding Performance Shares as Mr. Babeau was not granted any Performance Shares in 2020.",

Set out below is the Corporate Officers and non-executive Directors' compensation policy for 2021. It will be submitted to the shareholders at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting (7 th and 8 th resolutions) and, subject to shareholders approval, will remain in force until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.\n\n## 2.3.1 Executive Compensation policy\n\nSchneider Electric follows a rigorous process for determining executive compensation, under the leadership of committed and independent Directors.\n\n## Role of the Governance & Remunerations Committee\n\nThe general principles and criteria forming part of the compensation policy for Corporate Officers, and their individual compensation packages are prepared and reviewed by the Governance & Remunerations Committee which makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision. The Board also hears the report and recommendations from the Human Resources & CSR Committee on the incentive structure and performance criteria (annual variable compensation and Long-term incentive plan) applied to the members of the Executive Committee (see below chapter 3, paragraph 2.4 of the Universal Registration Document), as well as the Group's other employees. To help the Board in the decision process, the Governance & Remunerations Committee and the Human Resources & CSR Committee are authorized to call upon external experts for specific topics, benchmarking data and analyses. The Committees hold at least one joint meeting every year to discuss the compensation structure applicable to Corporate Officers and other employees of the Group. These joint committee meetings are attended by one of the two employee Directors and the Director representing the employee shareholders who are members of the Human Resources & CSR Committee. In 2020, there was one joint meeting between Governance & Remuneration Committee and the Human Resources & CSR Committee to review the annual variable compensation plan applicable to the Corporate Officers, members of the Executive Committee, as well as the Group's other employees.",

        "page_content": "As part of its preparatory work for its proposals to the Board, the Committee:\n\n## Defines performance criteria\n\nDefines performance criteria based on Schneider Electric's executive compensation pillars and business strategy. Targets are determined at the beginning of the year in accordance with the goals of the Strategic Plan.\n\nBased on circumstances and priorities, the targets also encompass risks raised by the Audit & Risks Committee as well as the recommendations of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\n## Benchmarks Corporate Officers' pay\n\nBenchmarks Corporate Officers' pay against the median of a peer group consisting of 24 French and international companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in terms of market capitalization, revenue, and industry, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition.\n\nThis benchmarking is used as an indicator, not as a target, and is done ex-post only for reference.\n\n## Engages with shareholders\n\nRelies on the Lead Independent Director to directly engage with shareholders to ensure their perspectives and feedback on Schneider Electric's compensation policy are heard and considered in decision-making.\n\nThe topic of Corporate Officers' compensation is usually discussed at four Board meetings every year. Corporate Officers do not take part in the debates of the Board concerning their own compensation.\n\nThis process ensures consistency and alignment between the compensation policy applied to the other executives and employees and the compensation policy applied to Corporate Officers. They share the same objectives and priorities and their rewards are aligned with the Group's performance and shareholder value creation.\n\n## Use of discretion\n\nIn determining executive compensation, the use of discretion is limited, and an appropriate disclosure on the use of discretion will be provided, if any, so that shareholders understand the basis for the Board's decisions. This discretion is available to the Board to ensure successful execution of the policy and to reflect the fact that there are no qualitative objectives in Corporate Officers' compensation:\n\n- \u00b7 Flexibility to take account of unexpected changes in the industry environment and in compensation practice generally, this allows to respond to changes in circumstances, for example in modifying the benchmarking peer groups.\n- \u00b7 Exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, to adjust the formulaic outcome for annual or long-term incentive awards resulting from the strict application of the approved policy, where a qualitative assessment of performance is required to ensure that the awarded compensation is fair in light of the Corporate Officers' actual contribution to the Company's overall performance, its positioning vs. competition, and the outcomes for shareholders and employees.\n\n## No major changes in the 2021 Compensation policy\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the existing policy and concluded that the pillars and principles formulated in 2018 continue to provide market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, and longterm focus. Therefore, based on the Committee's analyses and recommendations, the Board decided at its meeting of February 10, 2021 to maintain the executive compensation pillars, namely, Pay-for-Performance, Alignment with Shareholders' Interests, and Competitiveness, and the seven principles that they translate into.\n\nThe Committee has also reassessed the compensation elements and criteria considering these principles and the shareholders' feedback received during the shareholder engagement process described above. Relying on the recommendations of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board, at its meeting of February 10, 2021, decided that the overall compensation structure of the Corporate Officers should remain the same as in 2020 as it satisfies the objectives of pay-for-performance and alignment with shareholders' interests.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the start of each year, the Board reviews the measures, targets, and weightings to ensure they remain consistent with the annual priorities and Group strategy. For the annual variable compensation and the Performance Shares, the approach to performance measurement is intended to provide a balance of measures to assess performance focusing on execution of the Group's strategic priorities.\n\n## Considerations of wider workforce compensation and shareholders' views\n\nThe Board monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the compensation policy for Corporate Officers and senior management and has regard to its impact and consistency with compensation policies in the wider workforce. During the year, the Board is provided with information and context on pay in the wider workforce and various HR initiatives to enable its decision-making. This includes the approach to gender pay gap and living wage programs rolled out globally, the annual variable compensation results, and the total cost of LTIP awards.\n\nThe Board is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with Schneider Electric's shareholders through the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director. Where appropriate, Schneider Electric actively engages with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, taking their views into account when making any decisions about the Corporate Officers' compensation. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is also available to answer questions at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 2021 Compensation Pillars and Principles\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 1: Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n- \u00b7 Principle 2: Performance is evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n- \u00b7 Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual variable compensation) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\n## Alignment with shareholders' interest\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n- \u00b7 Principle 5: Performance conditions support Schneider Electric's strategic priorities and are aligned with shareholders' expectations.\n\n## Competitiveness\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 6: To benchmark the Corporate Officer's compensation package 'at target' in the median range of the Company's updated peer group.\n- \u00b7 Principle 7: To reference the CAC 40 third quartile and the Stoxx Europe 50 median.",

The Board ensures that the Chairman and CEO's salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles in the market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsidering the positioning of the Corporate Officer's salary on the relevant markets, the Company performance, and also pay conditions for other employees, the Board decided that there were no special circumstances that would call for a salary increase in 2021.\n\n| Corporate Officer                      | FY 2021   (January 1, 2021)   | FY 2020   (January 1, 2020)   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO | \u20ac1,000,000                    | \u20ac1,000,000                    | 0%         |\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nAnnual variable compensation provides variable cash compensation which rewards achievement of the short-term financial and sustainability targets of the Group.\n\nAt the start of the fiscal year, financial and sustainability performance criteria, weightings, and annual targets are reviewed in detail by the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval. Outcomes will be determined based on performance against each of those targets. The Board has the flexibility to review targets during the year to ensure continuous alignment with shareholders' interests.\n\nThe payment of the annual variable compensation is conditional upon approval by shareholders of the compensation granted to the Chairman and CEO. The Company does not operate a clawback policy.\n\nThe pay-out opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with 50% of maximum annual variable compensation payable for achieving target. The maximum annual variable compensation will only be earned where a strong performance is delivered on each performance metric. Pay-outs between threshold and target, and between target and maximum, are determined on a straight-line basis.\n\nSchneider Electric does not operate a deferral program.\n\n2021 Annual variable compensation opportunity at target and maximum:\n\n| Minimum                  | At target                  | Maximum                    |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 0% of fixed compensation | 130% of fixed compensation | 260% of fixed compensation |\n| Nil                      | \u20ac1,300,000                 | \u20ac2,600,000                 |\n\nFor 2021, the Board proposes that the measurable financial performance criteria determine 80% and sustainability criteria, 20% of the variable cash compensation of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as follows:\n\n| Performance criteria                          | Description and link to strategy                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 40% Group organic sales growth                | Fostering organic growth through deployment of strategic priorities in key  markets |\n| 30% Adjusted EBITA organic margin improvement | Enabling shareholder value creation through continuous efficiency                   |\n| 20% Schneider Sustainability Impact           | Promoting continuous progress towards more sustainability and value for  customers  |\n| 10% Group cash conversion                     | Enabling returns to shareholders                                                    |\n\nFor business confidentiality reasons, the targets cannot be disclosed; however, the targets have been set precisely by the Board at the meeting of February 10, 2021 and will be communicated retrospectively.",

Vesting will normally operate on a straight-line basis between these points.\n\n## LTIP time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2018, the Board has undertaken a robust review of the performance criteria and target setting approach to ensure LTIP performance criteria reflect a holistic assessment of the Group's performance, continue to reinforce Schneider Electric's strategy, encourage management to deliver steady and sustainable growth, and have a strong alignment with shareholders.\n\nThe 2021 LTIP criteria will remain the same as in 2020, in line with the proposals approved by shareholders under the LTIP resolution at the 2019 Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 25, 2019 (21 st resolution).\n\nIn order to align the interests of the Group's executives to those of the shareholders, in 2021, the Board will allocate Performance Shares to more than 2,000 Group executives and Senior Management, leaders, and key talents (Plans n\u00b0 38 and 39). For Group Senior Management, 100% of shares allocated will be subject to performance conditions measured over three years.\n\nThe maximum annual award to the Chairman and CEO for 2021 remains the same as in 2020 - 60,000 shares. However, the Board may decide to award a different number of shares, provided it does not exceed the existing policy maximum. Under no circumstances, including in case of overachievement of all targets, may the number of shares acquired exceed the number of shares defined as policy maximum.\n\nThe volume of the maximum annual award was set in consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 The market practice and competitive positioning of the Chairman and CEO's compensation package;\n- \u00b7 The Group's performance in 2020, acknowledged by the market;\n- \u00b7 The performance criteria applicable to the final acquisition of LTIP awards;\n- \u00b7 The culture of ownership deeply rooted in Schneider Electric's DNA.\n\nIn the context described above, the Board decided that the number of shares granted to the Chairman and CEO continues to be reasonable in terms of quantum and market practice for comparable roles; it rewards the Company's resilient performance in a challenging year and supports the culture of ownership strongly promoted by Schneider Electric.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\n100% measurable and quantifiable criteria\n\n75% Financial & TSR and 25% Sustainability\n\n## Performance conditions and weightings applicable to the 2021 LTIP:\n\n- \u00b7 40%, improvement of Adjusted Earning per share ;\n- \u00b7 35%, relative TSR performance of Schneider Electric:\n- - 17.5% measured vs. a bespoke panel of 11 companies: ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa,\n- - 17.5% measured vs. CAC 40 companies;\n- \u00b7 25%, based on Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI).",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Adjusted EPS (40%)\n\nAdjusted EPS (earning per share) is a key long-term performance metric which promotes the execution of Schneider Electric's strategy to deliver profitable growth, thus reinforcing alignment with shareholders. The criterion is defined as the average of the annual rates of achievement of Adjusted EPS improvement targets for the 2021 to 2023 fiscal years. Adjusted EPS performance is published in the external financial communications and its annual variance will be calculated using adjusted EBITA at constant FX from year N-1 to year N. Foreign exchange impacts below adjusted EBITA will be taken in full. Significant unforeseen scope impact could be restated from this calculation upon decision of the Board.\n\n## \u00b7 Relative TSR (35%)\n\nThis criterion strengthen the alignment between the shareholders' interests and compensation of the Chairman and CEO.\n\n- \u00b7 For 17.5% of the shares, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Yokogawa) with a vesting scale as follows: 0% at rank 8 and below, 100% at rank 4, 150% for ranks 1 to 3, and linear between these points, as was already introduced in 2019 LTIP\n- \u00b7 For the remaining 17.5%, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared with the TSR of the companies in CAC 40 index to reflect the macro-economic and stock-market specific trends which influence the performance of the share and in turn, the return to shareholders with a vesting scale as follows: 0% below median, 50% at median (rank 20), 100% at rank 10, 120% in ranks 1 to 4, and linear between these points.\n\nIn case of over-performance, if Schneider Electric's TSR is ranked within the top quartile of the bespoke industry panel or within top 10% of the CAC 40 companies, this criterion may compensate the under-performance under the Adjusted EPS criterion up to the same number of shares. If the Schneider Electric TSR is closely clustered with that of other companies in the panel, then the Board of Directors will apply its judgment to decide whether Schneider Electric's TSR shall be deemed to be ranked in the same position as those companies.\n\n## \u00b7 Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index (SSERI) (25%)\n\nThe Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index measures the long-term sustainability performance of the Group in terms of relative performance, through a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and different from the Schneider Sustainability Impact. Using external indices will also ensure that the sustainability priorities governing the assessment of the long-term sustainability performance of the Group are at all times those which matter the most to the stakeholders.\n\nFor the 2021-2023 plans, the Board has selected some of the most challenging external indices (DJSI World, Euronext Vigeo, Ecovadis and CDP Climate Change) which are objective, recognized, and independent, covering main geographies in line with the Group's global footprint and which complement each other as they cover different sustainability dimensions. From 2021 the FTSE4GOOD index has been replaced by Ecovadis index, due to the decommissioning of one of the two FTSE4GOOD indices. Ecovadis is a robust evidencebased index which will supplement the SSERI. Using external and relative indices for performance assessment encourages permanent progress as their content is dynamic and includes new and more relevant topics as they emerge, forcing participants to constantly anticipate the most demanding trends in global sustainability. In line with Schneider Electric's sustainability strategy, external indices stand at the forefront of new academic research of sustainability practices ( e.g . IPCC 1.5\u00baC report, TCFD recommendations, UN Global Compact SDGs) and continuously raise the bar to deliver stronger impacts.\n\n| DJSI                                                            | Euronext Vigeo                                                                                                             | Ecovadis                                                                                            | CDP Climate Change                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Covers three dimensions:  economic, environmental, and  social. | Covers environment, community  involvement, business behavior,  human rights, corporate  governance, and human  resources. | Covers four dimensions:  environment, labor and human  rights, sustainable procurement  and ethics. | Covers climate change, water,  and forests and represents  a major reference for climate  change leadership globally. |",

The cash payments are a combination of fixed and variable payments that are considered 'other benefits' to ensure consistency and comparability with other French or international companies. The maximum annual Complementary Pension Cash Benefit for 2021 remains unchanged and is detailed in the table below. Variable portion is subject to the same performance criteria and targets as the annual variable compensation. The Chairman and CEO has committed to depositing these additional payments, after taxes, into investment vehicles dedicated to the supplementary financing of their pensions.\n\n|                                        |               | Variable portion                  | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Corporate Officer                      | Fixed portion | Target (% of fixed  compensation) | Minimum            | At target          | Maximum            | Total at target    |\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO | \u20ac191,600      | 130%                              | \u20ac0                 | \u20ac249,080           | \u20ac498,160           | \u20ac440,680           |\n\n## Other benefits\n\nSchneider Electric aims to provide an appropriate level of benefits considering market practice and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Group.

However, it is recognized that all circumstances in which Corporate Officer may be appointed cannot be anticipated. The Board will aim to set compensation that is appropriate to attract, motivate, retain, and reward an individual of the quality required to run the Group successfully, while avoiding paying more than is necessary. If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to secure the services of a particular individual not promoted within the Group, it may require considering the terms of that individual's existing employment and/ or their personal circumstances.\n\nThe table below summarizes the policy on appointment of a new Corporate Officer.\n\n| Fixed compensation           | Salaries are set by the Board, taking into consideration a number of factors including the  current pay for other Corporate Officers, the experience, skill and current pay level of the  individual, and external market forces.

These plans also aim at mobilizing Schneider Electric's management for the achievement of the Group's long-term objectives and align their interest with those of our shareholders.\n\nThe Long-term incentive plans are based on an allocation of Performance Shares. No stock options or SARs have been granted since 2009 and the last plan of stock options implemented expired on December 31, 2019.\n\nThese plans are granted by the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation from the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\nBeneficiaries include members of Group Senior Management, top managers, high-potential managers and employees in all countries whose performance was judged remarkable. There were 2,728 beneficiaries in the 2019 Long-term incentive plan and 3,100 in the 2020 Long-term incentive plan. Allocations to Group Senior Management, including Corporate Officers, represent 14.5% of the total attributions in the framework of the 2020 Long-term incentive plan, similar to the proportion prevalent (13.9%) in the framework of the 2019 Long-term incentive plan.\n\nCorporate Officers formally undertake, for each grant of shares, not to engage in hedging transactions until the end of their duties as executive Officers.\n\n## Past share plans (as of December 31, 2020)\n\n|                                                          | LTIP 2016      | LTIP 2017                                                                                            | LTIP 2018                                                                                            | LTIP 2019                                                                                                          | LTIP 2020                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Plan number                                              | Plan 24, 26    | Plan 28, 29, 29 bis                                                                                  | Plan 30, 31, 31 bis                                                                                  | Plan 32, 33, 34, 35                                                                                                | Plan 36, 37, 37 bis                                                                    |\n| Date of Annual Shareholders'  Meeting                    | Apr. 25, 2013  | Apr. 25, 2016                                                                                        | Apr. 25, 2016                                                                                        | Apr. 25, 2016                                                                                                      | Apr. 25, 2019                                                                          |\n| Date of the grant by the Board                           | Mar. 23, 2016  | Mar. 24, 2017  Oct. 25, 2017                                                                         | Mar. 26, 2018  Oct. 24, 2018                                                                         | Mar. 26, 2019  Jul. 24, 2019  Oct. 23, 2019                                                                        | Mar. 24, 2020  Oct. 21, 2020                                                           |\n| Number of shares at grant of  which:                     | 2,318,242      | 2,463,420                                                                                            | 2,371,940                                                                                            | 2,444,010                                                                                                          | 2,216,791                                                                              |\n| -

The supply chain organization instituted a global management team that has been tracking evolution of the situation in real time. The Group focused on enhancing the digital customer experience, while establishing communities and partnerships, and provided multiple digital interactions and trainings to customers across the world. The Group also accelerated its medium-term cost efficiency plan, and implemented specific tactical savings across the organization, leveraging its multi-local model.\n\n## Government grants\n\nThe Group did not benefit from significant grants established by the countries impacted by the pandemic and chose not to resort to the exceptional liquidity support schemes proposed by the French state to overcome the crisis. The Group however benefited from deferral of payment of various tax and social charges across the world, generating temporary positive cash impact that will be compensated in 2021.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Group demonstrated the agility and resilience of its global supply chain while coordinating and regionally managing supply chain organization to enable quick decision making and flexibility. The crisis did not reveal new risks factors for the Group.\n\n## Liquidity and balance sheet position\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Group has a total liquidity of around EUR 10.7 billion, including cash & cash equivalents and undrawn available committed credit lines. The Group has sufficient liquidity for debt repayments, funding acquisitions that have been already announced, and its operations for at least the year to come. The Group working capital was assessed with the same accounting policies, principles and methodologies used for the full year 2019 consolidated financial statements. There was no material impairment booked in the income statement as at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group expects to emerge strong from the crisis and recover its sales & margin level in the near perspective and has therefore restated its adjusted EBITA margin ambition for 2022.\n\nThe Group performed the annual impairment test of all the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) using the same methodology as the one used on previous periods and described in note 1.11. Following the performance of these tests, the Group concluded that there was no risk of impairment at December 31, 2020. The respective headrooms have not been significantly impacted by the crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 Accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2020. The same accounting methods were used as for the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe following standards and interpretations that were applicable during the period did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 16 Leases COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material;\n- \u00b7 annual improvements to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards.\n\nThe Group did not apply the following standards and interpretations for which mandatory application is subsequent to December 31, 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 standards adopted by the European Union:\n- - amendments to IFRS 4 Contracts - Deferral of IFRS 9;\n- - amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2.\n- \u00b7 standards not yet adopted by the European Union:\n- - IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n- - amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current -Deferral of effective date;\n- - amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations;\n- - amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment;\n- - amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets;\n- - Annual Improvements 2018-2020.\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the potential effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements of the standards not yet applicable as of December 31, 2020. At this stage of analysis, the Group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Effects of IFRS 16\n\n## Leases COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\nOn 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases . The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient authorized by the amendment, Schneider Electric elected, for the concessions that meet the amendment's criteria, not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. This amendment had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the total incentives provided by lessors for the Group amount to around 2 million euros.\n\n## IFRIC decision - Lease term and useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements\n\nThe November 2019 IFRIC decision has been applied by the Group as of December 2020 with retroactive effect. For this purpose, remaining useful life of leasehold improvements have been compared to the duration defined for IFRS 16 on a case by case basis. Furthermore, all contracts classified as short-term leases because considered as not enforceable beyond 12 months were reviewed, to ensure that the most probable duration was considered as the IFRS 16 duration. Any deviation identified has been adjusted and the total impact of those corrections is not significant for the Group.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of presentation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative instruments and certain financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities are measured using the amortized cost model. The book value of hedged assets and liabilities, under fair-value hedge, corresponds to their fair value, for the part corresponding to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires Group and subsidiary management to make estimates and assumptions that are reflected in the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in the statement of income and the commitments created during the reporting period. Actual results may differ.\n\nThese assumptions mainly concern:\n\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (Note 1.8 and Note 1.9) and the measurement of impairment losses (Note 1.11);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of non-current financial assets (Note 1.12 and Note 13);\n- \u00b7 the realizable value of inventories and work in progress (Note 1.13);\n- \u00b7 the recoverable amount of trade and other operating receivables (Note 1.14);\n- \u00b7 the valuation of share-based payments (Note 1.20);\n- \u00b7 the calculation of provisions or risk contingencies (Note 1.21);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations (Note 1.19 and Note 20);\n- \u00b7 the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforward (Note 14).\n\n## 1.4 Consolidation principles\n\nSubsidiaries, over which the Group exercises exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\nGroup investments in entities controlled jointly with a limited number of partners, such as joint ventures and companies over which the Group has significant influence ('associates') are accounted for by the equity method. Significant influence is presumed to exist when more than 20% of voting rights are held by the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired or sold during the year are included in or removed from the consolidated financial statements as of the date when effective control is acquired or relinquished.\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe list of consolidated main subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates can be found in Note 29.\n\nThe reporting date for all companies included in the scope of consolidation is December 31, with the exception of certain immaterial associates accounted for by the equity method. For the latter however, financial statements up to September 30 of the financial year have been used (maximum difference of three months in line with the standards).\n\n## 1.5 Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations . Acquisition costs are presented under 'Other operating income and expenses' in the statement of income.\n\nAll acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, the fair value can be adjusted during a measurement period that can last for up to 12 months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share in the fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognized in goodwill. Where the cost of acquisition is lower than the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired, the badwill is immediately recognized in the statement of income.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired (see Note 1.11 below). Any impairment losses are recognized under 'Amortization expenses and impairment losses of purchase accounting intangible assets'.\n\n## 1.6 Translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries that use another functional currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities are translated at the official closing rates;\n- \u00b7 income statement, backlog and cash flow items are translated at average annual exchange rates.\n\nGains or losses on translation are recorded in consolidated equity under 'Cumulative translation reserve'.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to the Group's subsidiaries in hyperinflation countries (Venezuela and Argentina). The impacts are not significant for the Group in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5. Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1.7 Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rate in effect at the transaction date or at the hedging rate. At the balance sheet date, monetary items in foreign currency (e.g. payables, receivables, etc.) are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the closing rate or at the hedging rate. Gains or losses on translation of foreign currency transactions are recorded under 'Net financial income/ (loss)'. Foreign currency hedging is described below, in Note 1.23.\n\nHowever, certain long-term receivables and loans to subsidiaries are considered to be part of a net investment in a foreign operation, as defined by IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates . As such, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in equity and recognized in the statement of income when the investment is sold or when the long-term receivable or loan is reimbursed.\n\n## 1.8 Intangible assets\n\n## Intangible assets acquired separately or as part of a business combination\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized in the balance sheet at historical cost. They are subsequently measured using the cost model, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets .\n\nIntangible assets (mainly trademarks, technologies and customer lists) acquired as part of business combinations are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the combination date, appraised externally for the most significant assets and internally for the rest, and that represents its historical cost in consolidation. The valuations are performed using generally accepted methods, based on future inflows.\n\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or, alternatively, over the period of legal protection. Amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment when there is any indication that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying amount.\n\nAmortization expenses and impairment losses on intangible assets acquired in a business combination are presented on a separate statement of income line item, 'Amortization expenses and impairment losses of purchase accounting intangible assets'.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe trademarks fair value is determined using the royalty method at the date of acquisition.\n\nTrademarks acquired as part of a business combination are not amortized when they are considered to have an indefinite life.\n\nThe criteria used to determine whether or not such trademarks have indefinite lives and, as the case may be, their lifespan, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 brand awareness;\n- \u00b7 outlook for the brand in light of the Group's strategy for integrating the trademark into its existing portfolio.\n\nNon-amortized trademarks are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication, they may be impaired. When necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\n## Internally generated intangible assets\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the statement of income when incurred. Development costs for new projects are capitalized if, and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are separately identified and reliably monitored;\n- \u00b7 the project's technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the Group has the intention and financial resources to complete the project and to use or sell the resulting products;\n- \u00b7 the Group has allocated the necessary technical, financial and other resources to complete the development;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the project will flow to the Group.\n\nDevelopment costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed in the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\nBefore the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are tested for impairment at least annually. From the date of the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are amortized over the lifespan of the underlying technology, which generally ranges from three to ten years. The amortization expenses of such capitalized projects are included in the cost of the related products and classified into 'Cost of sales' when the products are sold.\n\nAs for development-related assets which are in the amortization period, they are tested for impairment in case an impairment risk has been identified.",

        "page_content": "## Software implementation\n\nExternal and internal costs relating to the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are capitalized when they relate to the programming, coding and testing phase. They are amortized over the applications' useful lives. In accordance with paragraph 98 of IAS 38, the SAP bridge application currently being rolled out within the Group is amortized using the production unit method to reflect the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Said units of production correspond to the number of users of the rolled-out solution divided by the number of target users at the end of the roll-out.\n\n## 1.9 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is primarily comprised of land, buildings and production equipment and is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment .\n\nEach component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that differs from that of the whole item is depreciated separately on a straight-line basis. The main useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 buildings: 20 to 40 years;\n- \u00b7 machinery and equipment: 3 to 10 years;\n- \u00b7 other: 3 to 12 years.\n\nThe useful life of property, plant and equipment used in operating activities, such as production lines, reflects the related products' estimated life cycles.\n\nUseful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted prospectively if appropriate. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value, when the residual value is material.\n\nDepreciation is expensed in the period and included in the production cost of inventory or the cost of internally generated intangible assets. It is recognized in the statement of income under 'Cost of sales', 'Research and development costs' or 'Selling, general and administrative expenses', as the case may be.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. Impairment losses are charged to the statement of income under 'Other operating income and expenses'.\n\nSince 2019, property, plant and equipment also include right-of-use assets, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IFRS 16 Leases, and as described in the following note.\n\n## 1.10 Leases\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, according to the modified retrospective approach.\n\n## Scope of the Group's contracts\n\nThe lease contracts identified within all the Group entities fall under the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 real estate: office buildings, factories, and warehouses;\n- \u00b7 vehicles: cars and trucks;\n- \u00b7 forklifts used mainly in factories or storage warehouses.\n\nThe Group has retained the exemption for low-value assets (i.e. assets with a cost lower than USD 5,000). Thus, the defined scope does not include small office or IT equipment, mobile phones or other small equipment, which all correspond to low-value equipment. Short-term contracts (i.e. less than 12 months without purchase option) are also exempted under the standard. In this case, for example, for occasional vehicle or accommodation rentals.\n\n## Rental obligation:\n\nAt the inception date of the lease, the Group recognizes the lease liabilities, measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease. The present value of payments is calculated mainly using the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting entity's country, at the contract starting date.\n\nRental payments include fixed payments (net of rental incentives receivable), variable payments based on an index or rate and amounts that should be paid under residual value guarantees. Besides, the simplification allowing not to split services components has not been elected by the Group. Therefore, only the rents are taken into account in the lease payments.\n\nLease payments also include, when applicable, the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and the payment of penalties for the termination of a lease, if the term of the lease takes into account the fact that the Group has exercised the termination option.\n\nVariable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nAfter the start date of the contract, the amount of rental obligations is increased to reflect the increase in interest and reduced for lease payments made.\n\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the lease liabilities is revalued in the event of a reassessment or modification in the lease (e.g. change in the term of the lease, change in lease payments, application of annual indexation, etc.).\n\nThe obligation is recorded under other current debt and other non-current liabilities.\n\n## Right-of-use assets:\n\nThe Group accounts for the assets related to the right-of-use on the lease starting date (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is available). Assets are measured at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, and adjusted for the revaluation of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made on or before the effective date, minus lease inducements received. They are recognized as tangible assets, in the Balance Sheet. Unless the Group is reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recorded right-of-use assets are depreciated using the linear method over the shortest period of time between estimated life of the underlying asset and the duration of the lease. The assets related to the right-of-use are subject to depreciation.\n\n## Determining the duration of contracts:\n\nThe duration of the Group's contracts varies according to geographies.\n\nThe real estate contracts have variable durations depending on the countries and local regulations. Vehicles and forklifts are generally contracted between 3 and 6 years.\n\nIn certain geographies, the Group's real estate contracts offer unilateral options for termination of contracts (particularly in France with contracts 3-6-9).\n\nAccording to the recommendation of IFRIC, on a case by case analysis and based on Real Estate teams' expertise, experience strategy and projects, the Group is determining the most probable duration to perform our calculations.

If such an indication exists, the Group tests the asset for impairment by comparing its carrying amount to the higher of fair value minus costs to sell and value in use;\n- \u00b7 non-amortizable intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nValue in use is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by the tested assets. These future cash flows are based on Group management's economic assumptions and operating forecasts presented in business plans over a period generally not exceeding five years, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate. The discount rate corresponds to the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) at the measurement date. The WACC stood at 6.8% at December 31, 2020 (6.9% at December 31, 2019). This rate is based on (i) a long-term interest rate of 0.53%, corresponding to the average interest rate for 10-year OAT treasury bonds over the past few years, (ii) the average premium applied to financing obtained by the Group in 2020, and is completed by, for CGUs WACC only, (iii) the weighted country risk premium for the Group's businesses in the countries in question.",

        "page_content": "The perpetuity growth rate is 2%, unchanged from the previous financial year.\n\nImpairment tests are performed at the level of the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. The cash-generating units are Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, Industrial Automation and Secure Power . CGUs net assets were allocated to allocated to each CGU ( Low Voltage, Medium Voltage and Industrial Automation mainly).\n\nthe CGUs at the lowest possible level on the basis of the CGU activities to which they belong; the assets belonging to several activities were The WACC used to determine the value in use of each CGU was 7.4% for Low Voltage , 7.7% for Medium Voltage , 7.6% for Secure Power , and 7.5% for Industrial Automation .\n\nGoodwill is allocated when initially recognized. The CGU allocation is done on the same basis as used by Group management to monitor operations and assess synergies deriving from acquisitions.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is lower than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the book value over the recoverable value. The recoverable value is defined as the highest value between the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Where the tested CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment losses are firstly deducted from goodwill.\n\n## 1.12 Non-current financial assets\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies are initially recorded at their cost of acquisition and subsequently measured at fair value. The fair value of investments listed in an active market may be determined reliably and corresponds to the listed price at balance sheet date (Level 1 from the fair value hierarchy as per IFRS 7).\n\nIFRS 9 standard allows two accounting treatments for equity instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 change in fair value is recognized through 'Other Comprehensive Income' in the comprehensive income statement, and in equity under 'Other reserves' in the balance sheet, with no subsequent recycling in the income statement even upon sale.\n- \u00b7 change in fair value, as well as gain or loss in case of sale, are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe election between those two methods is to be made from inception for each equity investment and is irrevocable.\n\nVenture capital (FCPR) / Mutual funds (SICAV) are recognized at fair value through income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nLoans recorded under 'Non-current financial assets' are carried at amortized cost. In accordance with IFRS 9, a depreciation is booked from inception to reflect the expected credit risk losses within 12 months. In case of significant degradation of the credit quality, the initial level of depreciation is modified to cover the entire expected losses over the remaining maturity of the loan.\n\n## 1.13 Inventories and work in progress\n\nInventories and work in progress are measured at the lower of their initial recognition cost (acquisition cost or production cost generally determined by the weighted average price method) or of their estimated net realizable value.\n\nNet realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining expenses to complete and/or sell the products. Inventory impairment losses are recognized in 'Cost of sales'. The cost of work in progress, semi-finished and finished products, includes the cost of materials and direct labor, subcontracting costs, all production overheads based on normal manufacturing capacity and the portion of research and development costs that are directly related to the manufacturing process (corresponding to the amortization of capitalized projects in production and product and range of products maintenance costs).\n\n## 1.14 Trade and other operating receivables\n\nTrade and other operating receivables are depreciated according to the simplified IFRS 9 model. From inception, trade receivables are depreciated to the extent of the expected losses over their remaining maturity.\n\nThe credit risk of trade receivables is assessed on a collective basis country by country, as the geographical origin of receivables is considered representative of their risk profile. Countries are classified by risk profile using the assessment provided by an external agency. The provision for expected credit losses is evaluated using (i) the probabilities of default communicated by a credit agency, (ii) historical default rates, (iii) aging balance, (iv) as well as the Group's assessment of the credit risk considering actual guarantees and credit insurance.\n\nOnce it is known with certainty that a doubtful receivable will not be collected, the doubtful account and its related depreciation are written off through the income statement.\n\nAccounts receivable are discounted in cases where they are due in over one year and the discounting impact is significant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1.15 Assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations\n\nAssets held for sale are no longer amortized or depreciated and are recorded separately in the balance sheet under 'Assets held for sale' at the lower of its amortized cost and net realizable value.\n\n## 1.16 Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes, related to temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of consolidated assets and liabilities, are recorded using the balance sheet liability method, based on tax rates and tax rules enacted before the balance sheet date. The effect of any change in the tax rate is recognized in the income statement, apart from changes relating to items initially recognized directly in equity.\n\nFuture tax benefits arising from the utilization of tax loss carry forwards (including amounts available for carry forward without time limit) are recognized only when they can reasonably be expected to be realized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be fully or partially offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are recorded in the balance sheet under non-current assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the same unit and which are expected to reverse in the same period are offset.\n\n## 1.17 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents presented in the balance sheet consist of cash, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and marketable securities traded on organized markets. Marketable securities are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at maturity. They notably consist of bank deposits, commercial paper, mutual funds and equivalents. Considering their nature and maturities, these instruments represent insignificant risk of changes in value and are treated as cash equivalents.\n\n## 1.18 Schneider Electric SE shares\n\nSchneider Electric SE shares held by the parent company or by fully consolidated companies are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity.\n\nGains/(losses) on the sale of own shares are canceled from consolidated reserves, net of tax.\n\n## 1.19 Pensions and other employee benefit obligations\n\nDepending on local practices and laws, the Group's subsidiaries participate in pension, termination benefit and other long-term benefit plans. Benefits paid under these plans depend on factors such as seniority, compensation levels and payments into mandatory retirement programs.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPayments made under defined contribution plans are recorded in the income statement, in the year of payment, and are in full settlement of the Group's liability. As the Group is not committed beyond these contributions, no provision related to these plans has been booked.\n\nIn most countries, the Group participates in mandatory general plans, which are accounted for as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined Benefit plans\n\nDefined Benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nExpenses recognized in the statement of income are split between operating income (for service costs rendered during the period) and net financial income/(loss) (for financial costs and expected return on plan assets).\n\nThe amount recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present value of the obligation, and net of plan assets.\n\nWhen this is an asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefit due in the form of plan refunds or reductions in future plan contributions.\n\nChanges resulting from periodic adjustments to actuarial assumptions regarding general financial and business conditions or demographics (i.e., changes in the discount rate, annual salary increases, return on plan assets, years of service, etc.) as well as experience adjustments are immediately recognized in the balance sheet as a separate component of equity in 'Other reserves' and in comprehensive income as 'Other comprehensive income/loss'.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nProvisions are funded and expenses recognized to cover the cost of providing health-care benefits for certain Group retirees in Europe and the United States. The accounting policies applied to these plans are similar to those used to account for Defined Benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Group also funds provisions for all its subsidiaries to cover seniority-related benefits (primarily long service awards for its French subsidiaries). Actuarial gains and losses on these benefit obligations are fully recognized in profit or loss.",

In the case of stock appreciation rights, a liability is recorded corresponding to the amount of the benefit granted, re-measured at each balance sheet date.\n\nAs part of its commitment to employee share ownership, Schneider Electric gave its employees the opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted price (Note 19).\n\n## 1.21 Provisions and risk contingencies\n\nA provision is recognized when it is probable that the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the loss or liability is not likely and cannot be reliably estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a contingent liability. Provisions are calculated on a case-by-case or statistical basis, and discounted when the impact from discounting is significant.\n\nProvisions are primarily set aside to cover:\n\n- \u00b7 economic risks: these provisions relate to probable tax risks arising on positions taken by the Group or its subsidiaries. Each position is assessed individually and not offset and reflects the best estimate of the risk at the end of the reporting period. Where applicable, it includes any late-payment interest and fines. In accordance with IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments , provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment are presented under 'Accrued taxes and payroll costs' as of 1st of January 2019;\n- \u00b7 customer risks: provisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. Provisions for expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified;\n- \u00b7 product risks: these provisions comprise\n- - statistical provisions for warranties: the Group funds provisions on a statistical basis for the residual cost of Schneider Electric product warranties not covered by insurance. The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the warranty period;\n- - provisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.\n- \u00b7 environmental risks: these provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs. The estimation of the expected future outflows is based on reports from independent experts;\n- \u00b7 restructuring costs: when the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the restructuring and has either announced or started to implement the plan before the end of the year. The estimation of the liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the restructuring.\n\n## 1.22 Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily comprise bonds, commercial paper and short and long-term bank borrowings. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, from which any direct transaction costs are deducted. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost based on their effective interest rate.\n\n## 1.23 Financial instruments and derivatives\n\nRisk hedging management is centralized. The Group's policy is to use derivative financial instruments exclusively to manage and hedge changes in exchange rates, interest rates or prices of certain raw materials. The Group uses instruments such as FX forwards, FX options, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodities future, swaps or options, depending on the nature of the exposure to be hedged.\n\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income, except when they are qualified in a hedging relationship.\n\n## Foreign currency hedges\n\nThe Group periodically enters into FX derivatives to hedge the currency risk associated with foreign currency transactions. Whenever possible, monetary items (except specific financing items) denominated in foreign currency carried in the balance sheet of Group companies are hedged by rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency through FX spots realized with Corporate Treasury (natural hedge). The FX risk is thus aggregated at Group level and hedged with FX derivatives. When FX risk management cannot be centralized, the Group contracts FX forwards to hedge operating receivables and payables carried in the balance sheet of Group companies. In both cases, the Group does not apply hedge accounting because gains and losses generated on these FX derivatives naturally offset within 'Net financial income/(loss)' with gains or losses resulting from the translation at end-of-year rates of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5. Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Group also hedges future cash flows, including recurring future transactions and planned acquisitions or disposals of investments. In accordance with IFRS 9, these are treated as cash flow hedges. These hedging instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is accumulated in equity, under 'Other reserves', and then recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\nThe Group also hedges FX risk financing receivables or payables (including current accounts and loans with subsidiaries) using FX derivatives than can be documented either in Cash Flow Hedge or Fair Value Hedge depending on the nature of the derivative.\n\nThe Group may also designate FX derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments of its investments in foreign operations (net investment hedge). Changes of value of those hedging instruments are accumulated in equity and recognized in the statement of income symmetrically to the hedged items.\n\nThe Group documents FX derivative based on the spot rate. The Group adopted the cost of hedging option offered by IFRS 9 to limit volatility in the statement of income related to forward points:\n\n- \u00b7 For FX derivatives hedging an item on the balance sheet: Forward points are amortized in statement of income on a straight-line basis. Forward points related to FX derivatives hedging financing transactions are included in 'Finance costs, net';\n- \u00b7 For FX derivatives hedging future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet: Forward points are recorded in the statement of income when the hedged transaction impacts the statement of income.\n\n## Interest rate hedges\n\nInterest rate swaps allow the Group to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The derivative instruments used are financially adjusted to the schedules, rates and currencies of the borrowings they cover. They involve the exchange of fixed and floating-rate interest payments. The differential to be paid (or received) is accrued as an adjustment to interest income or expense over the life of the agreement. The Group applies hedge accounting as described in IFRS 9 for interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet are recognized in equity (for Cash Flow Hedges) or in profit or loss (for Fair Value Hedges).\n\nBorrowings hedged by an interest rate derivative in a fair value hedge are reevaluated at fair value for the portion of risk being hedged, with offsetting entry in the statement of income.\n\nCross-currency swaps may be presented both as foreign exchange hedges and interest rate hedges depending on the characteristics of the derivative.\n\n## Commodity hedges\n\nThe Group also purchases commodity derivatives including forward purchase contracts, swaps and options to hedge price risks on all or part of its forecast future purchases. Under IFRS 9, these qualify as cash flow hedges. These instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the period-end (mark to market). The effective portion of the hedge is recognized separately in equity (under 'Other reserves') and then recognized in income (gross margin) when the underlying hedge affects consolidated income. The effect of this hedging is then incorporated in the cost price of the products sold.\n\n## Shares hedges\n\nSchneider Electric shares are hedged in relation to last Stock Appreciation Rights granted to US employees before 2012 using derivatives documented in cash flow hedge.\n\nTime value of options documented in a hedging relationship is recorded using the same approach used for forward points. Any ineffectiveness arising from a derivative documented in a hedging relationship is recorded in 'Net financial income/(loss)'.\n\nCash flows from financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions.\n\n## 1.24 Revenue recognition\n\nThe Group's revenues primarily include transactional sales and revenues from services, and system contracts (projects).\n\nSome contracts may include the supply to the customer of distinct goods and services (for instance contracts combining build followed by operation and maintenance). In such situations, the contract is analyzed and segmented into several components ('performance obligations'), each component being accounted for separately, with its own revenue recognition method and margin rate. The selling price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the specific selling price of the underlying goods and services. This allocation should reflect the share of the price to which Schneider Electric expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of these goods or services.",

This method is applicable for all transactional sales and for specific services such as spare parts deliveries, or on-demand services.\n\n## Recognition of revenue over time\n\nTo demonstrate that the transfer of goods is progressive and recognize revenue over time, the following cumulative criteria are required:\n\n- \u00b7 the goods sold have no alternative use, and\n- \u00b7 enforceable right to payment (corresponding to costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit margin) for the work performed to date exists, in the event of early termination for convenience by the customer.\n\nWhen these criteria are fulfilled, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs of the performance obligation. The cost incurred includes direct and indirect costs relating to the contracts.\n\nExpected losses on contracts are fully recognized as soon as they are identified.\n\nPenalties for late delivery or for the improper execution of a contract are recognized as a deduction from revenue.\n\nThis method is applicable for systems contracts (projects) as the constructed assets are highly customized, and thus the Group would incur significant economic losses to redirect the built solutions to other customers.\n\nRevenue from the majority of services contracts is recognized over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided. When costs incurred are stable over the contract's period, revenue is linearized over the contract's length.\n\nProvisions for the discounts offered to distributors are accrued when the products are sold to the distributor and recognized as a deduction from revenue. Certain Group subsidiaries also offer cash discounts to distributors. These discounts and rebates are deducted from sales.\n\nConsolidated revenue is presented net of these discounts and rebates.\n\n## Backlog and balance sheet presentation\n\nBacklog (as disclosed in Note 3) corresponds to the amounts of the selling price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at closing date.\n\nThe cumulated amount of revenue accounted for, less progress payments and accounts receivable (presented on a dedicated line of the balance sheet) is determined on a contract-by-contract basis. If this amount is positive, the balance is recognized under 'contract assets' in the balance sheet. If it is negative, the balance is recognized under 'contract liabilities' (see Note 16). Reserves for onerous contracts (so called reserves for loss at completion) are excluded from contract assets and liabilities and presented among the 'provisions for customer risks' item.\n\n## 1.25 Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share .\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of the exercise of stock options outstanding at the balance sheet date. The dilutive effect of stock options is determined by applying the 'treasury stock' method, which consists of taking into account the number of shares that could be purchased, based on the average share price for the year, using the proceeds from the exercise of the rights attached to the options.\n\n## 1.26 Statement of cash flows\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method, which consists of reconciling net profit to net cash provided by operations. The opening and closing cash positions include cash and cash equivalents, comprised of marketable securities, net of bank overdrafts and facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On March 25, 2020, the Group acquired approximately 9.99% of the capital of the company, outside the takeover offer. On July 10, 2020, the Group announced the successful completion of the voluntary public takeover offer. As of December 31, 2020, the Group owns 87.64% of the capital of RIB Software, fully consolidated within Energy Management reporting segment. The consideration paid amounts to EUR 1,075 million (net of cash acquired).\n\nThe purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition is not completed at the closing date. As of December 31, 2020, the net purchase accounting adjustments amount to EUR 228 million and result mainly from the identification of intangible assets (technologies, trademark and customer relationship). The preliminary Goodwill recognized amounts to EUR 1,114 million as of December 31,2020.\n\nThe Group holds a put option agreement on 9.1% of minority interests, valued at EUR 137 million (EUR 29 per share), with a maturity in 2024. This debt has been recognized within 'Other non-current liabilities'.\n\n## ProLeiT\n\nOn August 4, 2020, the Group acquired ProLeiT AG and fully consolidated it in Industrial Automation reporting segment since August 1, 2020. The consideration paid in cash amounts to EUR 84 million (net of cash acquired). As of December 31, 2020, the Group recognized intangible assets for a preliminary amount of EUR 31 million (technologies, trademark and customer relationship), and an amount of Goodwill of EUR 91 million.\n\n## Larsen & Toubro\n\nOn May 1st, 2018, Schneider Electric, partnering with Temasek, a global investment company headquartered in Singapore, reached an agreement to buy Larsen & Toubro's Electrical & Automation business.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the Group completed the transaction to combine Schneider Electric India's Low Voltage and Industrial Automation Products business and Larsen and Toubro ('L&T') Electrical and Automation business, for a consideration paid of EUR 1,571 million.\n\nTemasek took a 35% stake in the combined business for EUR 530 million. The partnership with Temasek resulted in the dilution of the Group's interests within Schneider Electric India's Low Voltage and Industrial Automation Products business, and in the recognition of a gain of EUR 191 million in the Group share of equity.\n\nL&T is fully consolidated since September 1, 2020, and reports within the Energy Management reporting segment.\n\nThe purchase accounting as per IFRS 3R is not completed as of December 31, 2020. The net adjustment of the opening balance sheet is EUR 316 million, resulting mainly from the booking of a preliminary amount of identifiable intangible assets (mainly customer relationship, technology and trademark), and the assessment of some contingent liabilities (mainly related to risks identified in contracts). This adjustment is subject to change in 2021, notably with the ongoing valuation of the environmental risks. The preliminary Goodwill recognized amounts to EUR 1,020 million as of December 31,2020.\n\n## Planon\n\nOn December 17, 2020, the Group has successfully completed the strategic minority investment in Planon Beheer B.V.

LLC. for a consideration of USD 5.0 billion. OSIsoft is a global leader in real-time industrial operational data software and services. For the year ended December 31,2019, OSIsoft recognized a revenue of USD 470 million and adjusted EBIT of USD 125 million.\n\nAVEVA has received all antitrust and regulatory clearances required ahead of completion of the acquisition, except for the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal is expected to close in the course of March 2021. The deal will be funded by USD 4.4 billion of cash consideration, of which USD 3.5 billion have already been raised via rights issued to existing shareholders (including Schneider Electric), and USD 0.9 billion from existing cash. The remainder will be funded by a USD 0.6 billion share consideration to be issued to Estudillo Holdings Corp. As of December 31, 2020, the cash received from AVEVA's minority interests amounts to EUR 1.1 billion.",

The Group's go-to-market is oriented to address customer needs across its four end-markets of Buildings, Data Centers, Industry and Infrastructure, supported by a worldwide partner network.\n\nIndustrial Automation includes Industrial Automation and Industrial Control activities, across discrete, process & hybrid industries.\n\nExpenses concerning General Management that cannot be allocated to a particular segment are presented under 'Central functions & digital costs'.\n\nOperating and reporting segment data is identical to that presented to the board of directors, which has been identified as the main decision-making body for allocating resources and evaluating segment performance. Performance and decisions on the allocation of resources are assessed by the board of directors and are mainly based on Adjusted EBITA.\n\nShare-based payment is presented under 'Central functions & digital costs'.\n\nThe board of directors does not review assets and liabilities by business.\n\nThe same accounting principles governing the consolidated financial statements apply to segment data.\n\nDetails are provided in the Management Report.",

Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Worldwide Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nEvery year, Schneider Electric gives its employees the opportunity to become group shareholders thanks to employee share issues. Employees in countries that meet legal and fiscal requirements have been proposed the classic plan.\n\nUnder the classic plan, employees may purchase Schneider Electric shares at a 15% discount to the price quoted for the shares on the stock market. Employees must then hold their shares for five years, except in certain cases provided for by law. The share-based payment expense recorded in accordance with IFRS 2 is measured by reference to the fair value of the discount on the locked-up shares. The lockup cost is determined on the basis of a two-step strategy that involves first selling the locked-up shares on the forward market and then purchasing the same number of shares on the spot market (i.e., shares that may be sold at any time) using a bullet loan.\n\nThis strategy is designed to reflect the cost the employee would incur during the lock-up period to avoid the risk of carrying the shares subscribed under the classic plan. The borrowing cost corresponds to the cost of borrowing for the employees concerned, as they are the sole potential buyers in this market. It is based on the average interest rate charged by banks for an ordinary, non-revolving personal loan with a maximum maturity of five years granted to a natural person with an average credit rating.\n\n## Year 2020\n\nOn April 20, 2020, the Management Board took the exceptional decision to cancel this year employee share issues as part of its strategy to deal with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Year 2019\n\nThe table below summarizes the main characteristics of the 2019 plan, the amounts subscribed, the valuation assumptions and the plan's cost:\n\n|                                                                | Full Year 2019   | Full Year 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in millions of euros)                                         | %                | Value            |\n| Plan characteristics:                                          |                  |                  |\n| Maturity  (years)                                              |                  | 5                |\n| Reference price  (euros)                                       |                  | 70.9             |\n| Subscription price  (euros)                                    |                  | 60.26            |\n| Discount                                                       | 15.0%            |                  |\n| Amount subscribed by employees                                 |                  | 161.3            |\n| Total amount subscribed                                        |                  | 161.3            |\n| Total number of shares subscribed  (million of shares)         |                  | 2.7              |\n| Valuation assumptions:                                         |                  |                  |\n| Interest rate available to market participant  (bullet loan) * | 3.1%             | -                |\n| Five-year risk-free interest rate  (euro zone)                 | 0.3%             | -                |\n| Annual interest rate  (repo)                                   | 1.0%             | -                |\n| Value of discount (a)                                          | 15.0%            | 28.5             |\n| Value of the lock-up period for market participant (b)         | 26.4%            | 50               |\n| TOTAL EXPENSE FOR THE GROUP (a) - (b)                          |                  | -                |\n| Sensitivity:                                                   |                  |                  |\n| decrease in interest rate for market participant**             | (0.5)%           | 5.2              |\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric gave its employees the opportunity to purchase shares at a price of EUR 60.26 per share, as part of its commitment to employee share ownership, on April 16th, 2019. This represented a 15% discount to the reference price of EUR 70.90 calculated as the average opening price quoted for the share during the 20 days preceding the Management Board's decision to launch the employee share issue.\n\nAltogether, 2.7 million shares were subscribed, increasing the Company's capital by EUR 161 million as of July 10, 2019. Due to significant changes in valuation assumptions, specifically the interest rate available to market participant, the value of the lock-up cost is higher than the discount cost since 2012. Therefore, the Group did not recognize any cost related to the transaction.\n\n## 19.5 Schneider Electric SE shares\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Group held 12,741,481 Schneider Electric shares in treasury stock, which have been recorded as a deduction from retained earnings.\n\nThe Group has repurchased 650,307 shares for a total amount of EUR 50 million in 2020.",

AVEVA, which remains a listed company, is publishing its financial statements on a regular basis.\n\n## Note 20: Pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations\n\nThe Group has set up various post-employment benefit plans for employees covering pensions, termination benefits, healthcare, life insurance and other benefits, as well as long-term benefit plans for active employees.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe Group's main Defined Benefit pension plans are located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). They respectively represent 64% (2019: 63%) and 21% (2019: 22%) of the Group's total Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) on pensions. The majority of benefit obligations under these plans, which represent 93% of the Group's total commitment at December 31, 2020, are partially or fully funded through payments to external funds. These funds are never invested in Group assets.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe Group companies operate several Defined Benefit pension plans in the UK. The main one is related to the Invensys Pension Scheme. Pensions payable to employees depend on average final salary and length of service within the Group. These plans are registered schemes under UK tax law and managed by independent Boards of Trustees. They are closed to new entrants, and for most of them, the vested rights were frozen as they have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans.\n\nThese plans are funded by employer contributions, which are negotiated every three years based on plan valuations carried out by independent actuaries, so that the long-term financing services are ensured.\n\nIn relation to risk management and asset allocation, the Board of Trustees' aims of each plan are to ensure that it can meet its obligations to the plan's beneficiaries both in the short and long term. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the plan's long-term investment strategy and defines and manages long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.\n\nFollowing the agreement reached with the Trustee of the Invensys Pension Scheme on February 2014, Schneider Electric SE guaranteed all obligations of the Invensys subsidiaries which participate in the scheme, up to a maximum amount of GBP 1.75 billion. As of December 31, 2020, plan assets exceed the value of obligations subject to this guarantee and thus this guarantee cannot be called.\n\nSchneider UK pension plans contain provisions of pension called Guaranteed Minimum Pension ('GMP'). GMPs were accrued for individuals who subscribed to the State Second Pension prior to April 6, 1997. Historically, there was an inequality in the benefits between male and female members concerning GMP.\n\nA High Court case concluded on October 26, 2018, confirmed that all UK pension plans must equalize 'GMPs' between men and women. In the light of these events and new information, the Group updated the related assumptions, leading to a net experience adjustment in 'Other Comprehensive Income' of EUR 56 million. Following a further High Court ruling in November 2020, an additional net experience adjustment of EUR 7 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in 2020.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States' subsidiaries operate several Defined Benefit pension plans. These plans are closed to new entrants, frozen to future accruals and have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans. Pensions payable to employees depend on the average final salary and the length of service within the Group.\n\nEach year, the Group companies contribute a certain amount to the Defined Benefit pension plans. This amount is determined actuarially and is comprised of service costs, administrative expenses and payments toward any existing deficits. Since the plans are closed and frozen, there is generally no service cost component.",

These committees define and manage long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change, resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nActuarial valuations are generally performed each year. The assumptions used vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the country concerned, as follows:\n\n|                                | Group weighted average rate   | Group weighted average rate   | Of which United Kingdom   | Of which United Kingdom   | Of which United States   | Of which United States   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                | Dec. 31, 2020                 | Dec. 31, 2019                 | Dec. 31, 2020             | Dec. 31, 2019             | Dec. 31, 2020            | Dec. 31, 2019            |\n| Discount rate                  | 1.57%                         | 2.18%                         | 1.40%                     | 2.06%                     | 2.42%                    | 3.26%                    |\n| Rate of compensation increases | 2.52%                         | 3.16%                         | 3.46%                     | 3.34%                     | n.a                      | n.a                      |\n\nThe discount rate is determined on the basis of the interest rate for investment-grade (AA) corporate bonds or, if a liquid market does not exist, government bonds with a maturity that matches the duration of the benefit obligation. In the United States, the average discount rate is determined on the basis of a yield curve for AA and AAA investment-grade corporate bonds.\n\nIn the Euro zone, the discount rate currently stands at 0.5%.\n\n## 20.1 Changes in provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations\n\nAnnual changes in obligations, the market value of plan assets and the corresponding assets and provisions recognized in the financial statements can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                        | DBO benefit  obligations   | Plan assets   | Asset ceiling   | Net Liability   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Dec 31, 2018                                  | (8,911)                    | 7,901         | (187)           | (1,197)         |\n| Service cost                                  | (50)                       | -

If the Group is not able to hedge these risks, fluctuations in exchange rates between the functional currency and other currencies can have a significant impact on its results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. As a result, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to exchange rates mainly through FX forwards and natural hedges. Furthermore, some long-term loans and borrowings granted to the affiliates are considered as net investment in foreign operations according to IAS 21.\n\nSchneider Electric's currency hedging policy is to protect its subsidiaries against risks on transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. Hedging approaches are detailed in Note 1.23.\n\nThe breakdown of the nominal of FX derivatives related to operating and financing activities is as follows:\n\n|                        | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Sales           | Purchases       | Net             |\n| USD                    | 1,913           | (1,013)         | 900             |\n| CNY                    | 5               | (651)           | (646)           |\n| EUR                    | 201             | (658)           | (457)           |\n| DKK                    | 13              | (143)           | (130)           |\n| SGD                    | 351             | (248)           | 103             |\n| SEK                    | 1               | (151)           | (150)           |\n| JPY                    | 9               | (44)            | (35)            |\n| CHF                    | 52              | (201)           | (149)           |\n| AED                    | 8               | (69)            | (61)            |\n| BRL                    | -               | (97)            | (97)            |\n| CAD                    | 9               | (98)            | (89)            |\n| AUD                    | 13              | (74)            | (61)            |\n| SAR                    | 40              | (6)             | 34              |\n| RUB                    | 68              | -               | 68              |\n| NOK                    | 13              | (6)             | 7               |\n| GBP                    | 77              | (125)           | (48)            |\n| ZAR                    | 40              | (8)             | 32              |\n| HKD                    | 13              | (41)            | (28)            |\n| Others                 | 77              | (220)           | (143)           |\n| TOTAL                  | 2,903           | (3,854)         | (951)           |",

If the Group is not able to hedge, compensate for or pass on to customers any such increased costs, this could have an adverse impact on its results. The Group has, however, implemented certain procedures to limit exposure to rising non-ferrous and precious raw material prices.

Banking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency.\n\nGroup policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules. In addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\n## 23.9 Financial risk management\n\nForeign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations. These exposures arise from sales in currencies other than the Group's presentational currency of Euro.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risk is related to the US dollar, Chinese Yuan and currencies linked to the US dollar. In 2020, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to EUR 20.1 billion (EUR 21.6 billion in 2019), including around EUR 6.6 billion in US dollar and EUR 3.7 billion in Chinese yuan (respectively EUR 7.2 billion and EUR 3.6 billion in 2019).\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. The financial instruments used to hedge the Group's exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described above.\n\nThe table below shows the impact of a 10% change in the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan against the Euro on Revenue and Adjusted EBITA.

Statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Schneider Electric SE,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Schneider Electric S.E. for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the audit and risks committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirement rules required by the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1st, 2020 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of goodwill and trademarks with an indefinite useful life\n\nNotes 1.3, 1.8, 1.11, 5, 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n| Risk identified   | As at December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with an indefinite useful  life is M\u20ac 19.956 and M\u20ac 2.071 respectively, totaling 45 % of the group consolidated assets.

The Group is also subject to the inherent risks of its operations, especially with  regard to commercial and industrial aspects. In this context, the Group may face uncertain, litigious or contentious situations, particularly when                                                  |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | As described in note 1.21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognizes a provision  when it has an obligation towards a third party prior to the balance sheet date, and when the loss or  liability is likely and can be reliably measured. If the loss or liability is not likely and cannot be reliably  estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a contingent liability. |\n|                   | Each subsidiary and relevant departments of the group assess the identified risks on a regular basis,  with the assistance of external counsels when necessary.  We considered the recognition and measurement of provisions, uncertain tax positions and  contingent liabilities to be a key audit matter given the various risks the Group is exposed to and to                                                |",

Statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the audit and risks committee\n\nWe submit a report to the audit and risks committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the audit and risks committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the audit and risks committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the audit and risks committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nCourbevoie and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 10, 2021\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\n## MAZARS\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert\n\nJean-Yves J\u00e9gourel Alexandre Resten\n\nMathieu Mougard",

Notes to the financial statements\n\n(All amounts are in thousands of euros unless otherwise indicated)\n\n## 3.1 Significant events of the financial year\n\nDuring the financial year, Schneider Electric SE carried out a capital reduction by canceling EUR15 million treasury shares of EUR4 each of nominal value resulting in a capital reduction of EUR60 million.\n\nThe company issued three bonds for EUR800, EUR500 and EUR500 million respectively.\n\nThe company issued a convertible bond (OCEANE) for EUR650 million.\n\nOn May 2020, the company paid out the 2019 dividend of EUR1,413 million.\n\nThe company also proceeded to buy back 650,307 of its own shares for EUR50 million.\n\nFinally, during 2020, action plans 24,26,28,29 and 29bis expired, the company decided to serve 4 million shares for an amount of 182 million re-invoiced to the group companies concerned.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company decided to fund some of its current share plans by using existing shares and to re-invoice the related expense to the various entities of the Group. As a consequence, the provision for expenses on shares distribution has been adjusted to 390 million.\n\n## 3.2 Accounting principles\n\nAs in the prior financial year, the financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with French generally accepted accounting principles and with the ANC no. 2014-03 code updated by ANC no. 2016-07 code on Nov. 04, 2016.\n\n## Non-current assets\n\nNon-current assets of all types are stated at historical cost.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible rights are amortized over a maximum of 5 years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmortizable Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Lands are not depreciated.\n\n## Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nShares in subsidiaries and affiliates are stated at acquisition cost.\n\nProvisions for impairment may be funded where the carrying amount is higher than the estimated value in use at the end of the financial year. This estimate is primarily determined on the basis of the underlying net assets, earnings outlook and economic forecasts. For listed securities, the average stock price over the month before the closing is used. Unrealized gains resulting from such estimates are not recognized.\n\n## Own shares\n\nTreasury stocks are assessed by category (shares in subsidiaries and affiliates, marketable securities), according to the FIFO. method 'firstin, first-out'.\n\nThe accounting classification of treasury stocks depends on the purpose for which they are held:\n\n- \u00b7 own shares are classified in marketable securities if they are the object of an explicit allocation to cover performance share distribution plans or if they are bought to regulate the share price of the Group;\n- \u00b7 own shares are classified in long-term investments if they are not the object of an explicit allocation to cover an option plan or if they are bought with the aim of their use within the context of a liquidity contract by an investment services provider, or of their later cancellation within the framework of a capital reduction.\n\nThe accounting of an impairment of own shares depends on the purpose for which they are held:\n\n- \u00b7 when own shares are allocated to cover of performance share distribution plans, there is no reason to record a provision for impairment;\n- \u00b7 in other cases, it is necessary to book an impairment if the average stock market price of the month before the closing is lower than the weighted average cost.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3. Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe present value of termination benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. Provisions are funded for the supplementary pension benefits provided by the company on the basis of the contractual terms of top-hat agreements, granting a level of benefits exceeding the general regimes. The company applies the corridor method to actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in estimates. Under this method, the portion of net cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceeding 10% of the projected benefit obligation is amortized over 10 years.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nWhen necessary, a contingency provision is put in place for unrealized exchange losses. However, when there are unrealized exchange gains and losses on back-to-back transactions in the same currency and with the same maturity, the amount of the provision is then limited to the net loss.\n\n## Bonds\n\nIssue costs are amortized over the life of the bonds and are booked under 'deferred expenses'.Issuance premiums are booked under 'Call premiums' & amortized over the duration of the bonds.\n\nIn the case of convertible bond (OCEANE), at conversion, the bond will be reclassified as equity for its nominal conversion amount.\n\n## 3.3 Notes\n\n## Note 1: Non-current assets\n\n## 1.1 Intangible assets\n\nThis item primarily consists of share issue and merger expenses, which are fully amortized.\n\n## 1.2 Property, plant and equipment\n\n(in thousands of euros)\n\n| Property, plant and equipment   | Dec. 31, 2019   | Additions   | Disposals   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                            | 4,301           | -           | -           | 4,301           |\n| Depreciation                    | (290)           | -           | -           | (290)           |\n| NET                             | 4,011           | -           | -           | 4,011           |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are mainly comprised of land not built.\n\n## Note 2: Investments\n\n## 2.1 Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates\n\n(in thousands of euros)\n\n| Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates   | Dec. 31, 2019   | Additions   | Disposals   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                    | 5,596,996       | -           | (219,897)   | 5,377,099       |\n| Provisions                              | (111,288)       | -           | 80,820      | (30,468)        |\n| NET                                     | 5,485,708       | -           | (139,077)   | 5,346,631       |\n\nDuring the financial year, Cofimines has been liquidated for 139 million, its shares were released for 220 million and the provision has been reversed for 81 million.\n\nThe main investments at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n\n| Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates   | Carrying value   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Schneider Electric Industries SAS       | 5,343,544        |\n| Schneider Electric Japan Holding        | 2,049            |\n| Other (less than EUR5 million)          | 1,038            |\n| TOTAL                                   | 5,346,631        |",

Statutory auditors' report on the annual financial statements\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Schneider Electric SE,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Schneider Electric S.E. for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the audit and risks committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of rules required by the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the French Code of ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1st, 2020 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and advances to subsidiaries and affiliates\n\n'Accounting principles' and note 2 'Investments' of the notes to the parent company financial statements\n\n| Risk identified   | As at December 31, 2020, investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and the related advances  amount to M\u20ac 5,347 and M\u20ac 3,983 respectively in the balance sheet of Schneider Electric S.E., net of  any impairment loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | As described in the accounting principles of the notes to the financial statements, investments  are recognized at their acquisition cost and impaired, should their carrying amount exceed their  estimated value in use at closing date.

Statutory auditors' report on the annual financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe audit and risks committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the audit and risks committee\n\nWe submit a report to the audit and risks committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the audit and risks committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the audit and risks committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the audit and risks committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nCourbevoie and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 10, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\n## MAZARS\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert\n\nJean-Yves J\u00e9gourel\n\nMathieu Mougard\n\nAlexandre Resten",

In particular, shareholders may send proxy and mail ballot forms before Annual Shareholders' Meetings either in paper form or, if approved by the Board of Directors and stated in the meeting announcement and/ or notice, electronically.\n\nWhen the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors may authorize shareholders to fill out and sign these forms electronically through a secure site set up by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting organizer using a process that complies with applicable laws and regulations (Paragraph 2 of Article 1367 of the French Civil Code) and consisting of a username and password.\n\nProxies or votes so submitted electronically before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, as well as the related acknowledgments of receipt, will be considered irrevocable and binding documents. However, in the event that shares are sold before the applicable record date (midnight Paris time two business days before the meeting date), the Company will cancel or amend, as appropriate, any related proxy or electronic votes submitted before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nMeetings shall be chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or in his absence by the Vice-Chairman, or in his absence by a member of the Board of Directors specially appointed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. In the event that no chairman has been selected, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects its chairman.\n\nThe two shareholders present who hold the largest number of votes and who accept shall act as scrutineers. The Board appoints a secretary, who is not required to be a shareholder.\n\nAs required by law, a register of attendance is kept.\n\nCopies or extracts of the meeting's minutes are certified either by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the Annual Shareholders' Meeting's secretary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholders' rights and obligations\n\n## 2.2 Voting rights\n\nThis section is part of the Board of Directors' governance report.\n\n## 1 - Double voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nVoting rights attached to shares are proportionate to the equity in the capital they represent, assuming that they all have the same nominal value. Each capital share or dividend share confers the right to one vote except where compulsory legal provisions limit the number of votes a shareholder may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, double voting rights are attributed to fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same holder for at least two years prior to the end of the calendar year preceding that in which the Annual Shareholders' Meeting takes place, subject to compliance with the provisions of the law. In the case of a bonus share issue paid up by capitalizing reserves, earnings, or additional issue premiums, each bonus share allotted in respect of shares carrying double voting rights will also have double voting rights.\n\nThe shares are stripped of their double voting rights if they are converted into bearer shares or transferred, except in the case of the transfer from one registered holder to another as part of an inheritance or family gift.\n\nDouble voting rights may also be stripped by a decision of the Extraordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting after ratification by a Special Shareholders' Meeting of beneficiaries benefiting from double voting rights.\n\nThe minimum holding period to qualify for double voting rights was reduced from four to two years by decision of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 27, 1995.\n\n## 2 - Ceiling on voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, no shareholder may exercise, either in person or through a proxy, by virtue of single voting rights conferred by the shares they hold directly and indirectly and by virtue of the proxy votes entrusted to them, more than 10% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by shares in the Company. However, if a shareholder also holds double voting rights directly or indirectly and/or as proxy, the limit set may be exceeded taking into consideration only the resulting additional voting rights, without the total voting rights thereby held exceeding 15% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by the shares in the Company.\n\nTo apply these provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 the total number of voting rights allowed are calculated as of the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and announced to the shareholders at the beginning of such Annual Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 the number of voting rights held directly and indirectly are understood to include those conferred by shares held personally by a shareholder, those conferred by shares held by a legal entity controlled by a shareholder as defined by Article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code, and those shares that are assimilated to the shares owned, as defined by the provisions of Articles L.233-7 et seq. of the Code;\n- \u00b7 shareholders' proxies returned to the Company that do not appoint a representative are subject to the above ceilings. However, these ceilings do not apply to the meeting chairman voting on behalf of such proxies.\n\nThe above ceilings will no longer apply, without it being necessary to put the matter to the vote again by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, if any individual or legal entity, acting alone or jointly with one or other individuals or legal entities, acquires or increases its stake to at least two- thirds of the Company's capital through a public tender offer for all the Company's shares. The Board of Directors takes note of this nullity and undertakes the formalities necessary to amend the Articles of Association. The ceiling on voting rights was approved by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995.\n\nIn accordance with Article L.225-96, Paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code, any amendment to the Articles of Association must be approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, by a majority of at least two-thirds of the voting rights represented by shareholders in attendance or participating by proxy.\n\n## 2.3 Allocation of income (Article 22 of the Articles of Association)\n\nNet income for the year less any losses brought forward from prior years is appropriated in the following order:\n\n- \u00b7 5% to the legal reserve (this appropriation is no longer required once the legal reserve represents one-tenth of the capital, provided that further appropriations are made in the case of a capital increase);\n- \u00b7 to discretionary reserves, if appropriate, and to retained earnings;\n- \u00b7 to the payment of the balance in the form of a dividend.\n\nThe General Meeting may decide to offer shareholders the opportunity to receive the dividend in cash or in the form of new shares. Dividends not claimed within five years from the date of payment are forfeited and paid to the government, in accordance with the law.",

        "page_content": "## 2.4 Holding of shares (Article 7 Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association)\n\nShareholders may elect to hold their shares in registered or bearer form. To establish proof of ownership, the shares must be recorded in the shareholder's account in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined by current legislation and regulations.\n\n## 2.5 Disclosure thresholds (Article 7 Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that any individual or legal entity that owns or controls (as these terms are defined in Article L.233-9 of the French Commercial Code) directly or indirectly, shares or voting rights representing at least 1% of the total number of shares or voting rights outstanding, or a multiple thereof, is required to disclose the total number of shares, voting rights and share equivalents held directly, indirectly or in concert to the Company by registered letter with return receipt requested, within five trading days of the disclosure threshold being crossed. In addition, effective November 1, 2009 the shareholder must notify the Company, in the disclosure letter, the number of existing shares it is entitled to acquire by virtue of agreements or financial instruments referred to in point b) of the third paragraph of Article L.233-7 of the French Commercial Code and of the number of existing shares covered by any agreement or financial instrument referred to in point c) of said paragraph. Shareholders are also required to notify the Company if the number of shares or voting rights held falls below one of the thresholds defined above. In the case of failure to comply with these disclosure obligations, the shares in excess of the disclosure threshold will be stripped of voting rights at the request of one or several shareholders owning at least 2.5% of the share capital, subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the law. These provisions are from the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995, May 5, 2000, and April 23, 2009.\n\n## 2.6 Identifiable holders of bearer shares (Article 7 Paragraph 3 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe Company may at any time request Euroclear to identify holders of bearer securities conferring immediate or future voting rights. This provision was adopted by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 30, 1988 and May 5, 2000.\n\n## 2.7 Disposal of shares (Article 8 of the Articles of Association)\n\nShares in the Company are freely negotiable and transferable.\n\n## 2.8 Publication of information of Article L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code\n\nThis section is part of the Board of Directors' governance report.\n\nItems that could have an impact in the event of a public tender offer include:\n\n- \u00b7 agreements calling for payments to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (see see pages 289 et seq. ) or to employees if they resign or are terminated without real cause or if their employment ends due to a public tender offer;\n- \u00b7 certain loans with conditional provisions of anticipated reimbursement in the event of change of control. Under these provisions, the debt holders may request for repayment if a shareholder or shareholders acting together hold more than 50% of the Company's shares, and for the majority of contracts, this event triggers a downgrading of the Company's rating. As of December 31, 2020, EUR8.8 billion of the Group's financing and lines of credit had these type of provisions; and\n- \u00b7 statutory restrictions in the Articles of Association on the exercise of voting rights (see page 386) relating to the non-application of the ceiling on voting rights when a public tender offer is successfully completed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Annual Shareholders' Meeting decided that the delegation shall be valid for a twenty-six (26) month-period and granted within a maximum nominal amount of capital increase of \u20ac115 million being deducted from the capital increase ceiling of \u20ac230 million provided for in the 17 th resolution and to the capital increase ceiling of \u20ac800 million provided for in the 15 th resolution, of said Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nAt its meeting of October 21, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to use the powers granted to it by the General Meeting of April 25, 2019 in its 20 th resolution and to approve the principle of an issuance, by the Company, of securities giving access to the share capital, represented by OCEANEs, in the context of a public offering referred to in Article L.411-2, 1\u00b0 of the French Monetary and Financial Code to qualified investors in France and outside France (as the case may be, except in the United States of America, Australia, Japan, Canada and/or South Africa), without the shareholders' preferential subscription right within the limits of a total nominal amount of such issuance of OCEANEs of \u20ac750 million and a maximum total nominal amount of the corresponding capital increase(s) resulting from the potential conversion of the OCEANEs into new ordinary shares of \u20ac21 million (excluding any adjustments to preserve the rights of holders of OCEANEs). The Board of Directors subdelegated until January 30, 2021 to the Chairman and Chief executive officer all powers to decide the issuance of OCEANEs and to set its conditions. The Chairman and Chief executive officer using this subdelegation decided on November 17, 2020 to issue 3,683,972 OCEANEs with a nominal value of \u20ac176.44 and a per-unit price of \u20ac190.11.\n\n## Main features of the issuance of the OCEANEs\n\nIn pursuance of the above mentioned Board's decision, OCEANEs has been issued under the main terms and conditions as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 date of announcement and launching of the issuance : November 17, 2020\n- \u00b7 settlement-delivery of the OCEANEs : November 24, 2020\n- \u00b7 terms of issue of the OCEANEs : by way of a placement to qualified investors only (within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the 'Prospectus Regulation')), in accordance with Article L. 411-2-1\u00b0 of the French Monetary and Financial Code in France and outside of France (excluding, in particular, the United States of America, Australia, Japan, Canada and/or South Africa),\n- \u00b7 number and nominal value of the OCEANEs to be issued : 3,683,972 OCEANEs with a nominal value of \u20ac176.44\n- \u00b7 corresponding nominal amount of the issuance : \u20ac650,000,019.68\n- \u00b7 issue price of the OCEANEs : \u20ac190.11 representing 107.75% of the nominal value\n- \u00b7 interest rate : zero-coupon\n- \u00b7 yield to maturity : - 1.33% per annum\n- \u00b7 maturity of the OCEANEs : June 15, 2026\n- \u00b7 conditions for redemption : redemption at nominal value\n- \u00b7 premium payment amount : in line with Schneider Electric's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, if the average sustainability performance score (calculated as the arithmetic average of the three key performance indicators), which should be published by the Company together with the 2025 annual audited financial statements and no later than 28 February 2026, does not reach a minimum level by 31 December 2025 payment by the Company of an amount equal to \u20ac0.88, representing 0.50% of their nominal unit value in respect of each bond which would neither be repaid or converted/exchange before\n- \u00b7 conditions for early redemption : at the option of the Company at par plus any applicable premium payment amount at the Company's option at any time from 15 January 2024 (inclusive), subject to a prior notice of at least 30 (but not more than 60) calendar days, if the arithmetic mean, calculated over a period of 10 consecutive trading days, chosen by the Company from among the 20 consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day immediately preceding the day of the publication of the early redemption notice, of the daily products on each of such 10 consecutive trading days of the volume weighted average price of the Company's shares on Euronext Paris and the applicable conversion/exchange ratio on each such trading day, exceeds 130% of the nominal value of each bond\n- \u00b7 dates, deadlines and conditions of conversion/exchange : right to convert or exchange the bonds into new and/or existing shares of the Company exercisable at any time from 4 January 2021 up to the 7 th business day (inclusive) preceding June 15, 2026 (or on the following business day if this date is not a business day) or, as the case may be, the relevant early redemption date\n- \u00b7 conversion/exchange ratio : 1 share per bond (adjustments: French standard protection against dilution and dividend protection if the yearly dividend is above 2.55\u20ac per year)",

This authorization was renewed by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 23, 2020.\n\nPursuant to these authorizations, the Company bought back 650,307 of its own shares during the year. The Company suspended the buyback of its shares aligned with the withdrawal of its 2020 guidance pursuant to its March 23, 2020 communication. EUR316 million of buyback had been completed prior to the suspension of the program.\n\nAt its meeting of February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to proceed with the cancellation of 15,000,000 treasury shares, representing 2.58% of the share capital as of January 31, 2020, in pursuance with the authorization granted to it at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 25, 2019 in its 24 th resolution. Further to this cancellation, the Company held 16,043,977 of treasury shares, representing 2.76% of the share capital as of January 31, 2020, after capital reduction.\n\nWe remind you that on February 14, 2019 Schneider Electric initiated a new EUR1.5 billion to EUR2.0 billion share buyback program over the period 2019 - 2021. The program has been launched under the 15 th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and pursued under the 14 th and 17 th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019 and 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meetings. These buybacks were part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Performance Shares plans and the exercise of options. All the shares acquired by the Company as part of the share buyback program are held to cover Performance Shares plans.",

In countries where regulations permit, Schneider Electric offers its employees the opportunity to invest during share capital increases reserved for its employees.\n\nThe Group's last employee share issue took place in July 2019. In March 2020, the program was cancelled, and focus turned towards shortterm priorities, starting with employee health and safety.\n\nOn December 31, 2020, Group employees were holding a total of 20.6 million Schneider Electric SE shares either directly, through the corporate mutual funds (FCPE), or through Performance Share plans, representing 3.6% of the share capital and 6.1% of the voting rights, taking into account double voting rights.\n\nVoting rights attached to shares held by corporate mutual funds are exercised by the supervisory boards of the corporate mutual funds.\n\nThe Group's employee shareholders are spread across over 50 countries, as follows: 30% in France, representing 43% of employee shareholding, 13% in China, 11% in India, 9% in the United States, and 37% elsewhere. Approximately half of all employees are shareholders of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Among these candidates, the Governance & Remuneration Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed the short-listed candidates. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended a candidate to the Board of Directors, Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon who, on February 10, 2021, was appointed as an Observer with the aim to propose her appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting. Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon, a Swedish citizen, will bring to the Board her professional experience and skills based on her wide-ranging finance and business background, and will further add to the gender diversity of the Board of Directors. She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 9.5 of the AFEP/MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Audit & Risks Committee.\n\nBesides, we remind you that the terms of office of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire expires at the close of this Shareholders' Meeting. On February 10, 2021, the Board, following the recommendation from the Governance & Remuneration Committee, decided to propose to the General Meeting to renew Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's office as Director for a four-year term with the intention to renew his office as Chairman & Chief executive officer. The performance by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire of the duties of Chairman and CEO seems particularly appropriate to the Board of Directors taking into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The results of the external Board assessment conducted in October 2020 that confirmed that (i) all Board members individually support the current leadership structure and (ii) the level of transparency between management team and the Board of Directors is considered as excellent;\n- \u00b7 Jean-Pascal Tricoire's profile, his excellent track record within the Company, his leadership, and his openness to the Board members' recommendations;\n- \u00b7 The current unprecedent COVID-19 crisis which reinforces the leadership needs of the Group, especially with the renewal of the Executive Committee made in February 2020;\n- \u00b7 The governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the management (appointment of a Lead Independent Director with specific powers, high rate of independent Directors within the Board (73%), independence of the committees mainly chaired by independent Directors, executive session proposed systematically at the end of each Board meeting);\n- \u00b7 The requirement for the Board to deliberate each year on the unification of the functions of Chairman and Chief executive officer in pursuance of its internal regulations.\n\nOn the occasion of its annual review of the governance mode of the Company, the Board has, however, expressed the wish to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief executive officer in the future. The Board is planning a separation of the two roles during Mr. Tricoire's upcoming term.\n\nActing upon recommendation of the Governance & Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors propose to shareholders:\n\n- \u00b7 in the 9 th resolution to renew the terms of office of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for a four-year (4) term; and\n- \u00b7 in the 10 th resolution , to appoint Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon as Director for a four-year (4) term.\n\nShould these resolutions be approved, the Board of Directors would consist in 15 members (including one Director representing the employee shareholders and two Directors representing the employees), with an independence rate of 75% and 42 % of women Director and 73 % of non-French origin or nationalities.\n\nMr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's and Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon's biographies are provided on section 1.1 of the Chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Text of the ninth resolution\n\n## (Renewal of the term of office of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report, takes note that the term of office of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as a Director expires at the close of this Shareholders' Meeting and decides to renew it for a four-year (4) term expiring at the close of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025 to approve the financial statements for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n## Text of the tenth resolution\n\n## (Appointment of Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon as a Director)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report, decides to appoint Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon as Director for a four-year (4) term expiring at the close of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025 to approve the financial statements for the 2024 fiscal year.",

Explanatory comments & draft resolutions submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## 15 th resolution: Share buybacks\n\n## Explanatory statement\n\nAs the pre-existing authorization comes to its term in October 2021, it is hereby proposed in the 15 th resolution submitted to the General Meeting to reconduct, for a new eighteen-month period starting after the present General Meeting, the authorization given to the Board of Directors to purchase the Company's shares as part of a share buyback program subject pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-62 of the French Commercial Code and European Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse.\n\nWe remind you that on February 14, 2019 Schneider Electric initiated a new \u20ac1.5bn to \u20ac2.0bn share buyback program over the period 2019-2021. The program has been launched under the 15 th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and pursued under the 14 th and 17 th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019 and 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meetings. These buybacks were part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long-term incentive plans. Pursuant to the authorization granted at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 23, 2020, Schneider Electric didn't proceed from April 24, 2020 to February 10, 2021 to any buyback due to the COVID-19 crisis. Since the beginning of the program, February 14, 2019, the Company bought back 4.1 million shares for \u20ac315.8 million.\n\nDue to the ongoing economic uncertainty, and as the OSIsoft transaction has not yet completed, the current share buyback program of \u20ac1.5 - \u20ac2.0 billion remains on-hold in the near term, with likely extension for its full completion beyond 2021.\n\nAll the 12,740,423 treasury shares held on December 31, 2020 (representing 2.25% of the share capital) are allocated to employees and Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool.\n\nThe authorization that you would give to the Board would allow to proceed to purchase of shares for the purposes, amongst others, of:\n\n- \u00b7 their allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool;\n- \u00b7 their delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company's capital;\n- \u00b7 their cancellation;\n- \u00b7 their delivery in connection with external growth operations;\n- \u00b7 their disposal in the course of a share management agreement.\n\nShares bought back may be cancelled under the authorization adopted by this Annual Shareholders' Meeting (24 th resolution).\n\nThe number of shares thus purchased and the number of shares held may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time (for reference purposes, based on the issued capital on December 31, 2020: 56,706,855 shares). The maximum purchase price of the shares would be set at \u20ac150 and the total amount allocated to the share repurchase program will not exceed \u20ac8,506,028,250. As for previous years, the resolution prevents that the authorization be used during a public offering on the Company's shares.\n\nFurther information on the Company's share buyback programs can be found section 3.5 of the Chapter 6 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Text of the fifteenth resolution\n\n## (Authorization granted to the Board of Directors to buy back Company shares)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report, hereby authorizes the Board of Directors, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse and its delegated regulations and the French Financial Market Authority's General rules, to buyback or arrange for the buyback of the Company's shares for the purpose of:\n\n- \u00b7 the allotment or transfer of shares to employees or Corporate Officers of the Company and/or of current or future related companies, for the purposes of implementing any stock option or Performance Share plan, or any other grant, allocation or disposal to employees and Corporate Officers of the Company;\n- \u00b7 the delivery of shares as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company's capital by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or by any other mean;\n- \u00b7 the cancellation by way of share capital decrease of all or part of these repurchased shares;\n- \u00b7 the delivery of shares (for exchange, payment or otherwise) in connection with external growth operations (up to a limit of 5% of the share capital);\n- \u00b7 their provision for the purposes of a share management agreement entered into with an investment services provider in order notably to maintain a liquid market; or\n- \u00b7 the implementation of any market practice which would be allowed by the AMF.",

The maximum nominal amount of the capital increases that may be carried under this resolution shall not exceed \u20ac800 million in aggregate, i.e. 200 million shares representing 35.27% of the capital as of December 31, 2020. The capital increases that may be realized in accordance with the 17 th , 18 th , 19 th , 20 th and 21 st resolutions shall be counted against this aggregate ceiling.\n\nFor the 17 th and 18 th resolutions , you are requested to cancel the preferential subscription rights to shares. Indeed, depending on market conditions, the types of investors involved and the type of securities issued, it may be preferable, or even necessary, to cancel the preferential subscription rights in order to carry out a securities placement under optimal conditions, particularly when the speed of transactions is a prerequisite to success, or when the issuances are carried out on overseas financial markets. The cancellation of the preferential subscription rights can facilitate the Company's access to capital due to more favorable issuance conditions. Capital increases without preferential subscription rights may take the form of a public offering except those in which case a priority period for shareholders can be established (17 th resolution) or of an offering in accordance with Article L. 411-2-1\u00b0 of the French Monetary and Financial al Code (18 th resolution). In compliance with the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), the issue price of shares issued without preferential subscription rights will be at least equal to the lowest price provided for according to the regulatory provisions applicable on the date of issue (currently, the average market price of the shares in the three (3) trading days on the regulated market Euronext Paris preceding the setting of the price, reduced by a discount of 10%). Regarding the issuance of securities giving access, immediately or in the future, to the Company's share capital, the issuance price of these securities will be so that the amount received by the Company, immediately or in the future, for each share to which such securities give the right, is at least equal to the minimum issuance price of the shares as defined above. The maximum nominal amount of the capital increases that may be carried under these resolutions shall not exceed \u20ac224 million, i.e. 56 million shares representing 9.88% of the capital as of December 31, 2020.\n\nIn the 19 th resolution , we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the number of securities to be issued under the 16 th , 17 th and 18 th resolutions in the event of an over-subscription (greenshoe). An additional capital increase could thus be carried out within the timeframe and limits provided for by the legislation applicable as of the date of issue (currently, within 30 days of the closing of the subscription period and up to 15% of the initial issuance).\n\nThe 20 th resolution concerns the issuance of share and/or securities giving immediate or deferred access to the Company's capital with a view to remunerate contributions in kind granted to the Company. This resolution allows the Board of Directors to realize external growth operations with a consideration in shares within a limit of \u20ac224 million, i.e. 56 million shares representing 9.88% of the capital as of December 31, 2020.\n\nIf granted, these delegations would be valid for 26 months. The Board of Directors may not use this delegation from the date of filing of a takeover bid for the shares of the Company by a third party and for the duration of the bid period.\n\nUnder the 21 st resolution , we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the share capital by incorporating premiums, reserves or profits. The rights of shareholders are not affected by this transaction, which results in free shares allotment, an increase in the nominal value of the existing shares, or a combination of both. This transaction does not change the Company's shareholders' equity.",

by issuing ordinary shares or securities giving access to share capital of the Company with shareholders' preferential subscription right)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for extraordinary shareholders' meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' special report, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles L./uni00A0225-129, L./uni00A0225-129-2 to L./uni00A0225-129-6, L./uni00A0225-130, L./uni00A0225-132, L./uni00A0225-134, L./uni00A0228-91 to L./uni00A0228-93, L./uni00A022-10-49 and L./uni00A022-10-50 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- 1. delegates to the Board of Directors the authority, with the power to subdelegate in accordance with applicable law and regulations, to decide one or several capital increases through the issue, in the proportions and at the times it deems appropriate, in France and/ or abroad, of ordinary Company shares and/or securities providing access through any means, immediately and/or in the future, to ordinary shares of the Company, or of a company in which it directly or indirectly owns more than half the capital, in Euros or any other currency or unit of account determined by reference to several currencies, it being specified that (i) the subscription of shares and other securities may be performed, either in cash, or by offsetting receivables, and (ii) the shares to be issued shall grant the same rights as the old shares; it being specified that the issuance of any shares or securities giving access to preferred shares is excluded;\n- 2. decides that the nominal amount of the capital increases which may be undertaken immediately and/or in the future on the basis of this resolution may not exceed \u20ac800 million representing on an indicative basis 35.27% of the capital as of December 31, 2020, it being specified that:\n- a. this amount would be increased by the nominal amount of the capital increase resulting from the issuance of shares to be carried out as the case may be, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions, and, where applicable, relevant contractual provisions providing for other adjustments, in order to preserve the rights of holders of securities giving access to the share capital, and\n- b. the maximum aggregate nominal amount of capital increases that may be undertaken immediately and/or in the future on the basis of this resolution and the 17 th , 18 th , 19 th , 20 th and 21 st resolutions of this Annual Shareholders' Meeting, is set at \u20ac800 million;\n- 3. decides that the maximum nominal amount of issuances of debt equity-linked securities which could be carried out pursuant to this delegation, shall not exceed a nominal amount of \u20ac7 billion (or the equivalent in any other currency or monetary unit), it being specified that the maximum aggregate nominal amount of debt equity-linked securities that may be issued on the basis of this resolution and the 17 th , 18 th , 19 th and 20 th resolutions of this Annual Shareholders' Meeting, is set at \u20ac7 billion;\n- 4. should the Board of Directors make use of this delegation:\n- a. decides that the issuance(s) of shares shall be reserved in priority to shareholders who may subscribe as of right (\u00e0 titre irr\u00e9ductible) under the conditions provided by law,\n- b. grants to the Board of Directors the power to provide shareholders with a prorata subscription right (\u00e0 titre r\u00e9ductible) for the number of shares in excess of those to which they could subscribe as a matter of right, in proportion to the number of shares to which they have the right to subscribe and, in any case, up to the number of shares requested,\n- c. decides that, if the subscriptions as of right (\u00e0 titre irr\u00e9ductible) and, as the case may be, on a prorata basis (\u00e0 titre r\u00e9ductible), do not absorb the entirety of the share issuance, the Board of Directors may use, under the conditions set by law and in such order as it shall determine, either one of the options provided under Article L./uni00A0225-134 of the French Commercial Code, listed below: (i) limit the capital increase to the amount of the subscriptions, provided that they reach at least three-quarters of the initially approved increase, (ii) freely distribute all or part of the issued and unsubscribed securities among persons it may choose, (iii) offer to the public, on the French market or the international market, all or part of the issued and unsubscribed shares,\n- d. decides that any issuance of share subscription warrants of the Company may be carried out either pursuant to a subscription offer under the conditions described above, or by granting free shares to owners of existing shares,\n- e. takes note and decides, as necessary, that this delegation of authority automatically entails by operation of law, in favour of holders of equity-linked securities issued pursuant to this delegation giving access or which may give access to shares of capital of the Company, the express waiver by the Company's shareholders' of their preferential subscription rights to the shares to be issued to which such issued securities shall give right;\n- 5. decides that the Board of Directors shall have all powers, with the power to subdelegate under the conditions provided by law, to implement this delegation, in order, in particular, to:\n- a. set the terms and conditions of the capital increase(s) and/or the issuance(s) of shares or securities,\n- b. determine the number of shares and/or securities to be issued, the issue price and the premium payment, of which, as the case may be, may be requested upon issuance,\n- c. determine the dates and conditions of the issuance, the nature and form of the securities to be issued, which may be subordinated or unsubordinated securities, with or without a specific maturity date, and, in particular, with respect to issuances of debt equity linked securities, their interest rate, maturity, their fixed or variable redemption price, with or without premium and the conditions for redemption,\n- d. decide how shares and/or securities are to be paid for,\n- e. set, if necessary, the terms of the exercise of the rights attached to the shares or securities issued or to be issued and, in particular, set the date, even if retroactive, from which the new shares to be issued would bear dividend rights, as well as all other terms and conditions for completing the issuance(s),\n- f. set the terms and conditions under which the Company would have the right, as the case may be, to purchase or exchange, at any time or during fixed periods, securities issued or to be issued,\n- g. provide the ability to suspend the exercise of rights attached to such securities,",
