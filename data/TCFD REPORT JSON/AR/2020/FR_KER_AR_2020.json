The acquisition of a controlling stake in Gucci Group in 1999 marked a new stage in  the  Group's  development,  and  the  establishment  of  a coherent ensemble of complementary luxury brands. Since 2018 and the distribution  in  kind  of  70%  of  PUMA  shares, Kering is a pure player in Luxury.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1963\n\nFran\u00e7ois  Pinault  establishes the  Pinault  group, specializing in timber trading.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nListing of Pinault SA on the Paris Stock Exchange.\n\n## 1990\n\nAcquisition of  Cfao,  a  group  specializing  in  trading with  Africa  and  in  electrical  equipment  distribution (activity renamed Rexel in 1993).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEntry into  the  retail  market  with  the  acquisition  of  a controlling stake in Conforama.\n\nTakeover of  Au  Printemps  SA,  a  department  store chain which also held a majority interest in mail order clothing brand La Redoute.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMerger of La Redoute with Pinault-Printemps, renamed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute.\n\nTakeover of Fnac, a retailer of books, music, films and consumer electronics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAcquisition of a 42% stake in Gucci Group NV, marking the Group's entry into the luxury sector.\n\nFirst  steps toward  the  creation  of  a  multi-brand Luxury  group,  with  the  acquisition  by  Gucci  Group  of Yves Saint Laurent, YSL Beaut\u00e9 and Sergio Rossi.",

Against  a  backdrop  of ever-faster  change,  new  economies  are  taking  shape as cultures evolve, disruptive technologies emerge and young 'always-on' consumers seek meaningful connections. Today's change generation is shaking up the rules.\n\nKering  is  setting  the  trend,  purposefully  shaping  the Luxury  of  tomorrow,  which  will  be  more  responsible and more in tune with our times while remaining true to  the  exceptional history and heritage of its Houses. Our  ambition  is  to  be  the  world's  most  influential Luxury group in terms of creativity, sustainability and long-term economic performance.\n\nA  new  generation  of  consumers  means  new  client expectations.  Tradition  and  expertise,  which  many luxury brands have relied on for decades, are no longer enough.  Consumers  today  want  to  express  their unique  individuality  -  and  our  vision  of  Luxury supports this radical shift. We dare to take risks, think differently, and constantly propose fresh and innovative ideas that inspire emotion and enthusiasm for  our  exceptional  products  capable  of  expressing each consumer's distinctive personality.\n\nWhat  Kering  and  its  Houses  propose  is  an  experience. Our  values  are  closely  tied  to  a  powerful,  creative content imbued with modernity and are complemented by the entrepreneurial spirit that permeates each of our brands and by the vision of our creative teams. Kering is made up of women and men who strive each day to create authentic, ever-changing Luxury.\n\nWe want to play our part in the emergence of a more environmentally  friendly  world.  We  are  constantly raising  our  creative  and  production  standards  to ensure respect for the planet while at the same time having positive social impacts. We aim to create value that is equitably distributed among all our stakeholders.\n\nKering  is  pronounced  'caring',  which  is  much  more than a simple allusion - it gives meaning to everything we do.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our model fosters rapid growth for our brands and creates the space for them to thrive.\n\n## 'Our multi-brand approach is built on a long-term vision and combines agility, balance and responsibility'\n\n## AGILITY\n\n## Kering provides its Houses with an organizational structure that unlocks their potential for excellence\n\n## \u00b7 Constancy\n\nKering began as a family company more than 50 years ago  and  is  now  controlled  by  Art\u00e9mis,  a  holding company owned by the Pinault family. With this strong and  stable  shareholder,  Kering  boasts  an  attractive and  sustainable  profile  conducive  to  developing  its vision in the luxury goods market over the long term.\n\n## \u00b7 Transformation\n\nFrom  a  conglomerate  of  diversified  retail  activities until  the  early  2000s,  Kering  has  transformed  itself into  a  Luxury  group  focusing  on  personal  goods.  We are  now  an  integrated  group  bringing  together  and developing  some  of  the  world's  most  prestigious Houses.  Through  the  years,  we  have  been  able  to leverage the most effective growth drivers.\n\n## \u00b7 Clarity\n\nKering  helps  its  Houses  realize  their  full  growth potential.  At  each  stage  of  their  development,  they benefit  from  innovative  logistics  platforms,  digital services and technological infrastructure and common support  functions.  By  encouraging  imagination  in  all its forms, our organization fosters strict management while enabling our Houses to unleash the best of their talent  and  creativity.  The  Group  ensures  that  the brands' success is aligned with their long-term visions and  objectives.  Thanks  to  our  curiosity,  capacity  for self-reflection and big-picture thinking, we can achieve the clarity necessary to set a successful course for the Group and its Houses.\n\n## BALANCE\n\n## Kering's multi-brand model is reaching optimal efficiency\n\n## \u00b7 An ensemble of exceptional Houses\n\nEach of our Houses fosters a unique blend of emotions and creations.

The  Group  supports  the  brands  by  providing expertise,  exercising  its  power  as  a  group  to  exert influence,  improving  supply  chain  reliability  and opening up access to distribution networks, as well as enhancing  client  experience,  especially  in  digital channels.

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Growth prospects\n\nSpurred  by  positive  demographic,  economic  and sociological  factors, the  worldwide  luxury  goods market  enjoys  significant  structural  growth  potential. Kering  adds  its  own  momentum  on  top  of  these intrinsic  factors,  further  amplified  by  placing  creative boldness at the heart of its model. So while our most firmly  established  Houses  are  reinventing  themselves and  re-engaging  with  their  audiences,  our  emerging brands are focused on realizing their full potential and gaining new clients.\n\n## \u00b7 Ready to weather adverse market conditions\n\nWith both well-established and still-emerging brands in  various  specialties,  segments  and  markets,  Kering has  an  extensive  footprint  in  diverse  regions.  Due  to the  variety  of  its  clients,  products,  brands  and locations, the Group is well placed to weather changes in  market  conditions  and  seize  growth  opportunities. Kering's  global  reach  proved  crucial  during  the  2020 pandemic, alleviating the impacts of store closures in certain  regions  while  enabling  the  brands  to  benefit from the rapid market recovery in Mainland China.\n\n## 'Our economic model is built on exceptional Houses, complementary positionings and varied maturity profiles'\n\n## RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## All our operations are founded on a responsible economic model. Our comprehensive, sustainable approach is a structural competitive advantage\n\n## \u00b7 Towards sustainable Luxury\n\nCan a responsible economic approach change the very nature  of  Luxury?  For  Kering,  the  answer  is  a resounding  'yes'.  For  our  Houses,  sustainability  is  in line with our vision of modern Luxury. Businesses have an ethical obligation to be more  responsible, reflecting  society's  new  expectations.  This  situation can also be viewed as an opportunity to grow, and a source of inspiration and innovation. Methods, materials, resources and products are being reinvented  and  client  usages  and  expectations  are changing. Kering is changing the way it designs luxury products by incorporating the criterion of sustainable value, for our clients as well as for society. The targets identified to improve the Group's social and environmental  performance  are  set  out  in  our 2025 sustainability strategy.\n\n## \u00b7 An inclusive approach\n\nThe aim of the responsible model is to rethink Kering's relationships  with  its  stakeholders  so  as  to  ensure fairness and responsibility. Affecting all dimensions of Kering's eco-system, from the Group's strategy and the Houses'  creative  decisions  to  operational  production, processing and distribution choices, the model aims to reduce  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the Group's operations. Placing people at the heart of the model  brings  fresh  entrepreneurial  spirit,  engaging employees and stakeholders.\n\n## \u00b7 Creative potential\n\nResponsibility  is  deeply  embedded  in  the  Group's organizational structure and promotes business growth  through  ever  more  innovative  and  attractive products.  It  rewards  best  business  practices  such  as good cost control and process upgrading. In a context of limited natural resources, new high-quality materials  are  being  fashioned  and  more  sustainable processes devised. We are constantly on the look-out for  innovative  and  disruptive  technologies.  For  our brands,  this  represents  a  vast  swathe  of  creative territory yet to be explored.\n\n## \u00b7 Governance and ethics\n\nBuilt  on  the  Group's  core  values,  Kering's  responsible model  leverages  an  ambitious  governance  structure, supported by the Board of Directors and its Sustainability  Committee.  Together  they  drive  the sustainability  strategy,  which  the  Houses  put  into action  every  day  under  the  guidance  of  dedicated experts.  The  Group's  Ethics  Committees,  Compliance structure and whistleblowing procedure for employees and  third  parties  ensure  that  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics and  principles  for  responsible  business  conduct  are properly applied.\n\n'Being a responsible Luxury group means crafting the Luxury of tomorrow - we perceive change as an opportunity and a growth lever'\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the coming years, the Group will continue to strengthen and sustain its growth momentum.\n\n## Promoting organic growth\n\n## \u00b7 Above-market performance in an industry set to deliver growth in the medium and long term\n\nThe  future  of  the  luxury  goods  market  is  structurally bright. The  growth  of  emerging  economies,  the cultural exposure of new populations to global brands and the increasing use of new technologies are major sources of value creation for Kering. The challenge for each  of  our  Houses  is  to  outperform  its  respective market in all segments and categories.\n\n## \u00b7 Product innovation\n\nEnergized by new creative teams, our Houses are setting trends. Backed by the Group, they are moving into new product categories and coming up with ever more fresh ideas.  Their  offerings  both  stimulate  and  meet  their clients' expectations and aspirations by arousing desire, inspiring dreams and tapping into emotions.\n\n## \u00b7 Sales efficiency\n\nIn their networks of directly operated stores, our brands deploy initiatives to boost sales performance, capitalizing on  increasingly  effective  merchandising  and  in-store operational  excellence,  supported  by  the  Group  and  its dedicated  teams.  Optimizing  comparable-store  sales performance is a key organic growth lever for Kering.\n\n## \u00b7 Client experience\n\nImproving  the  quality  of  in-store  client  experience  is central  to  driving  sales  performance.  Personalized  client experience  and  customization  help  make  each  client relationship unique. Support for clients before, during and after  the  sale  -  in  stores  or  online  -  is  what  enables  our Houses to create and sustain lasting connections. With this in  mind,  in  2019  Kering  completed  the  roll-out  of  a dedicated  application  designed  with  Apple.  The  Group's sales associates are invited to use the app to consult stock levels  in  real  time,  order  an  out-of-stock  product  for delivery  to  the  client's  home,  and  generate  personalized style advice for a truly revitalized shopping experience. The decision to bring client relations and  e-commerce platforms  back  in-house  and  the  acceleration  of  the development of distance selling tools were guided by the same aim.\n\n## \u00b7 Omni-channel approach\n\nOur  clients  are  connected  and  mobile,  constantly flicking  between  distribution  channels,  from  digital platforms  to  brick-and-mortar  stores.  Our  client relations  strategy  is  epitomized  by  continuity  on  all communication and distribution channels. This holistic omni-channel  approach  is  supported  by targeted directly operated  store  extensions  and strategies  for  distribution  agreements,  travel  retail, e-commerce, social media and digital communication. In  2020,  we  began  to  migrate  some  of  our  Houses onto the e-commerce  platform  developed  and managed internally.  This  migration  is  a  key  phase  of our strategy, especially in view of the rapid penetration of online sales. It gives us control over the whole value chain so as to provide clients with a truly exceptional experience  across  all  channels  and  touchpoints, aligning  the  e-commerce  side  with  the  standards  of excellence seen in its boutiques thanks to a range of omni-channel services.\n\n## \u00b7 Digital expertise, CRM and innovation\n\nA  number  of  projects  have  been  set  up  under  the leadership  of  the  Chief  Client  and  Digital  Officer  to support Kering in  its  digital  transformation  and  drive forward  its  e-commerce,  CRM,  data  science  and innovation  activities. These  include  several  pilot projects  using  data  science  techniques  to  deliver personalized  messages  and  experiences  to  individual clients, which are now being rolled out, as well as the creation of a dedicated data science team to improve the service provided to the clients of Kering's Houses by  making  the  best  use  of  the  available  data.  Lastly, the  Group's  Innovation  team  has  been  tasked  with fulfilling  two  objectives:  firstly,  to  instill  an  internal culture of innovation  (applying  a  test-and-learn approach, sharing discoveries quickly, scouting business  trends,  etc.)  and  secondly,  to  work  on disruptive technologies to enrich our business models and support our sustainability efforts.\n\n'Digital is simultaneously accelerating and deepening our relationships with our clients, allowing us to offer them an exceptional shopping experience'",

Our  brands  benefit  from  Group-wide  synergies  while preserving their unique characters and exclusivity.\n\n## \u00b7 Resource pooling\n\nOur  Houses  share  certain  support  functions,  allowing them to concentrate on what really counts: creativity, production  quality,  product  range  development  and renewal, client relations, as well as brand and product communication.  The  Group  pools  resources  and streamlines certain strategic functions such as logistics,  indirect  purchasing,  legal  affairs,  property, accounting,  media  relations,  IT  and  the  development of  new  tools  (in  particular  with  respect  to  the omni -channel approach). Relieved of this burden, our Houses can focus their energy on creativity.\n\n## \u00b7 Cross-business expertise\n\nIn  order  to  enrich  its  brands'  offerings,  the  Group draws on cross-business expertise. A notable success story in this domain is Kering Eyewear, which has been developed  internally.  Our  Houses  benefit  from  a dedicated specialist that ensures full control over the value chain of their frame and sunglasses businesses, from creation and development to supply chain; brand strategy and marketing to distribution. This innovative management model enables Kering to harness the full growth  potential  of  its  brands  in  this  category  and generate significant value creation opportunities.\n\n## \u00b7 Growth platforms and operating efficiency\n\nKering  is  constantly  improving  and  adapting  its operating  model  to  ensure  its  structures  are  always more up-to-date and flexible. The Group has launched an  ambitious  transformation  project  focusing  on  its information  systems,  supply  chain  and  logistics.  The aim  is  to  adapt  these  functions  to  the  Group's  new\n\nscope, as well as changing consumer trends and client expectations.  With  shared,  state-of-the-art  IT,  as  well as  redefined  logistics  operations  that  include  the construction of new warehouses in the United States (2019),  Italy  (2020-2021)  and  ultimately  Asia,  the Group's brands will be in a better position to anticipate demand,  respond  more  quickly  and  adapt  inventory management to optimize costs.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent excellence\n\nWe  pay  particular  attention  to  the  professional development and satisfaction of the women and men working  for  our  Houses  and  in  our  headquarters. Based on ever-greater mobility, our ambitious worldwide  human  resources  strategy  facilitates  the growth  of  the  Houses  through  a  shared  pool  of talented  individuals,  expertise  and  excellence.  The Group  helps  employees  reach  their  potential  and express  their  creativity  by  developing  skills  and performance,  as  well  as  by  offering  aspirational development opportunities.\n\nA source of collective intelligence and enrichment but also  fundamental  to  our  culture  of  equality,  allowing each individual to realize their full potential, our policy of promoting diversity, gender parity and inclusiveness is at the heart of Group and House talent management actions and initiatives.\n\nKering  also  pays  careful  attention  to  the  role  of women,  who  make  up  the  majority  of  its  employees and clients. Internal systems are in place to guarantee gender equality, as evidenced by our ambitious global parental  policy.  The  Kering  Corporate  Foundation  is committed to combating violence against women. The aim of the Women in Motion initiative is to showcase the  contribution  of  women  to  the  film  industry, whether in front of the camera or behind.\n\n'The Group strives to create value for its Houses and is geared to unlocking their creative potential'\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market overview: size, trends and main growth drivers\n\nThe worldwide personal luxury goods market enjoyed strong  growth  from  2010  to  2012.  The  market gradually  decelerated  from  late  2013  up  to  and including 2016, with weaker or even subdued growth at  comparable  exchange  rates,  when  signs  of  a recovery were nonetheless visible in the second half of the  year.  2017  marked  the  return  of  solid  growth  in the  market,  a  trend  confirmed  in  2018  thanks  in\n\nparticular to a promising macro-economic environment. Growth  slowed  slightly  in  2019  at  comparable exchange  rates,  whereas  in  2020  the  industry  was strongly  impacted  by  the  health  crisis  related  to  the COVID-19  pandemic,  contracting  23%  on  a  reported basis (22% at comparable exchange rates) to \u20ac217 billion.\n\n## Worldwide personal luxury goods market trends (in \u20ac billions)\n\n281\n\n| reported   | +11%   | +2%   | +3%   | +12%   | 0%   | +4%   | +3%   | +7%   | -23%   |\n|------------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| comparable | +6%    | +6%   | +3%   | +1%    | 0%   | +5%   | +7%   | +4%   | -22%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

According  to  IATA,  global  air  traffic (based  on  the  number  of  passengers)  fell  by  over 60% in 2020 compared to the previous year;\n- \u00b7 acceleration  of  an  existing  trend  to  relocate spending:  in  2020,  80%  to  85%  of  luxury  goods purchases  were  made  by  clients  in  their  local market;\n- \u00b7 sharp  increase  in  online  sales,  whose  contribution to  total  personal  luxury  goods  sales  doubled  in 2020;\n- \u00b7 a  drop  in  consumer  confidence,  earnings  and spending in the first half of the year, followed by a rebound in the second half in certain regions, such as Mainland China. According to a McKinsey survey published  in  September  2020,  consumer  intent  to shop for apparel, footwear, accessories and jewelry was  down  by  27%  to  35%  in  the  United  States compared to 2019;\n- \u00b7 a contraction in global GDP of 3.9% in 2020 versus a 2.5%  increase  in  2019 (1) : the  key  luxury  market regions  were  affected  differently,  with  Mainland China  rebounding  from  the  second  quarter  and growing 2% over the year as a whole and the United States,  the  eurozone  and  Japan  experiencing  a recession. The implementation of large-scale fiscal stimulus policies in the United States and Western Europe and the relaxation of already expansionary monetary  policies  in  the  world's  main  business regions  limited  the  pandemic's  adverse  impact  on global growth.\n\nIn this context, trends in the personal luxury goods market varied considerably from one quarter to the next:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nst\n\n1\n\nquarter\n\n3\n\nrd\n\nquarter\n\n2\n\nnd\n\nquarter\n\n- 2020/2019 change by quarter\n- Forecast high for the 4 th quarter\n- Forecast low for the 4 th quarter\n\nThese trends had a significant impact on the profitability of  sector  participants,  with  a  decrease  in  operating income  estimated  at  approximately  60%  in  2020  and operating  margins  for  the  sector  narrowing  from  an average of around 21% in 2019 to 12% in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Operating margin (EBIT as a %)\n- Operating income (2019 = index)\n\nth\n\n4\n\nquarter",

        "page_content": "## B. Other trends\n\n## 2020 was also characterized by:\n\n- \u00b7 renewed  geopolitical  and  social  tensions  and uncertainty about major political changes combined with the unprecedented deterioration in the  economic  situation  (protests  about  racial  and social issues, as well as the presidential and senate elections  in  the  United  States,  sharp  volatility  on equity  markets,  Brexit  negotiations,  etc.)  have weighed  on  consumer  confidence  and  spending trends;\n- \u00b7 persistently high FX volatility in certain key currencies  for  the  luxury  industry  (appreciation  of the euro in the second half of the year, depreciation of the US dollar against a basket of key currencies, appreciation of the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen).  These  currency  fluctuations  had  a  lesser impact on consumer trends than in the past, in view of  the  sharp  reduction  in  tourist  spending  due  to the health crisis.\n\n## C. Main structural and cyclical factors underpinning trends in the luxury goods market\n\n## a. 2020 luxury goods market by nationality\n\nBy  nationality,  the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods market is characterized by the weight of Chinese and American consumers, who together account for more than  half  of  the  market  in  value.  For  most  of  2020, international tourist flows came to a standstill, leading to a sharp drop in tourist spending and an increase in local  purchases.  The  proportion  of  consumers  of nationalities that are traditionally active on their local markets increased, while the proportion of those who generally  spend  abroad  dropped  accordingly.  For example, the proportion of consumers from China fell by  5  percentage  points  compared  to  2019,  while  the proportion  of  American  and  European  consumers increased by 3 points and 1 point, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/pt: Market share change (2020e vs 2019).\n\n## b. The market is facing a number of structural changes and more cyclical events\n\nAlthough  the  COVID-19  pandemic  had  significant short-term  impacts  on  the  personal  luxury  goods market,  the  underlying  trends  that  shape  the  market were not affected:\n\n- \u00b7 traditional  luxury  consumers  are  continuing  to extend  their  spending  to  new  categories  involving experiences (hotels, cruises, restaurants, etc.), while new  luxury  consumers  are  entering  the  market, either  via the  'accessible'  luxury  segment  or  more directly,  by  purchasing  products  from  brands  that are positioned in a more premium segment;\n- \u00b7 luxury consumers  are becoming  more  value sensitive  and  digital-oriented  and  are  leaning increasingly toward innovation and novelty, especially as younger populations enter the market and  more  particularly  generations  Y  and  Z  (born after 1980 and around 2000, respectively);\n- \u00b7 the  key  players  and  biggest  brands  have  already achieved significant penetration of the main markets  thanks  to  the  expansion  of  their  store networks, which means that growth is now mainly driven by increases in same-store sales.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, luxury groups and brands need to  adapt  their  strategy  to  the  market  trends  that  are likely to shape the industry in the coming years:\n\n- \u00b7 Chinese  consumers  will  continue  to  be  the  main growth driver;\n- \u00b7 meeting  the  expectations  of  a  new  generation  of consumers, whose buying decisions are increasingly influenced by:\n- - digital technology (online editorial and marketing content, social media, etc.), together with buying habits that require greater use of digital features and tools (including online shopping, Internet of Things,  virtual  reality,  artificial  intelligence  and mobile payments),\n- - environmental awareness (environmental footprint of  raw  materials,  production  and  distribution activities,  product  composition,  animal  welfare, etc.) and the integration of these expectations into brands'  operations  and  communications  (carbon offsetting, management of unsold inventory, etc.);\n- \u00b7 luxury consumers seeking a creative and differentiated product offering, together with a customer experience that  is  both  personalized  and  integrated  across physical and digital distribution channels;\n- \u00b7 rebalancing of local/tourist spending through appropriate management of price differentials across regions, which gained momentum in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Competitive environment\n\nAlthough  fragmented,  the  worldwide  personal  luxury goods  market  is  nonetheless  characterized  by  the presence  of  a  few  large  global  players,  often  part  of multi-brand  groups,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of smaller independent players. These players compete in different segments in terms of both product category and geographic location. Kering operates alongside the most prominent global groups in the personal luxury goods  market:  LVMH,  Herm\u00e8s,  Richemont,  Chanel, Prada  and  Burberry.  A  number  of  brands  with  more accessible prices could also compete with established luxury brands.\n\nNevertheless, the luxury goods market, which relies on discretionary  consumption  by  individuals,  is  exposed to  a  certain  number  of  risks,  which,  if  they  were  to materialize, could lead to short-term disruptions:\n\n- \u00b7 macro-economic  uncertainties,  currency  volatility and higher customs tariffs and taxes on luxury goods;\n- \u00b7 geopolitical tensions, security threats and outbreaks  of  epidemics/diseases,  as  we  have  seen with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 any  other  factor  weighing  on  tourism  (including  visa policies and travel regulations) or luxury consumption (restrictions, tax and import duties, etc.);\n- \u00b7 exogenous  events  such  as  political  turmoil  and unfavorable weather conditions.\n\nA  phenomenon  known  as  performance  polarization has  been  observed  over  the  past  three  to  four  years, with:\n\n- \u00b7 above-market  performances  by  certain  players, usually  of  significant  size  or  belonging  to  a multi-brand group; and\n- \u00b7 in  contrast,  below-market  performances  by  single brand and/or medium-sized players.\n\n## III.

Given its high exposure to tourists, who usually account for up to two thirds of the  region's  consumers  in  an  ordinary  year,  Europe was  strongly  impacted  by  the  sharp  decrease  in international and inter-regional tourism. Local consumption fared better, but also trended downwards.\n\nWithin  the  eurozone,  Italy  and  France  remained  the leading  countries  despite  a  44%  contraction  at comparable  exchange  rates.  As  luxury  spending  in these  two  countries  is  concentrated  mainly  in  major cities  that  attract  tourists  (Paris,  Milan),  they  were particularly hard-hit. The United Kingdom and Germany  were  less  affected  as  they  have  a  greater percentage of local clients.\n\nThe Americas region was the largest market, ahead of Europe, with the United States accounting for the vast majority of revenue (c. 89%). In 2020, business in the region contracted 26% at comparable exchange rates. In the United States, the impact on the local market of lockdowns  and  political  uncertainty  related  to  the elections  was  not  fully  offset  by  greater  spending  at home. The large cities and regions that are traditionally key for luxury goods consumption in the United  States, such  as  New  York  and  Boston, underperformed, with secondary cities such as Atlanta, Detroit,  Houston  and  Dallas  faring  better  than  usual. The  performance  of  department  stores  remained subdued, due to very low in-store traffic  and  despite growth in their online sales. Canada was also affected by  the  decline  in  incoming  Chinese  tourists,  while Brazil held up well thanks to purchases typically made in the United States and Europe being shifted back to the local market.\n\nMainland  China  was  the  greatest  beneficiary  of  the trend  to  repatriate  luxury  spending  in  2020  with  a spectacular  48%  rise  at  comparable  exchange  rates. The  country  now  represents  20%  of  the  worldwide personal luxury goods market, an increase of 5 percentage points. The first country to be impacted\n\nby  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Mainland  China,  saw  a rebound  in  the  consumption  of  luxury  goods  in  the second  quarter,  with  sales  continuing  to  progress rapidly during the second half. This performance was driven  by  the  repatriation  of  local  spending  and  the market's underlying dynamics,  which  attract  an increasing  number  of  younger  clients  each  year. Spending  by  locals  in  their  local  market  represented between  70%  and  75%  of  total  spending  by  Chinese nationals, up by some 40 percentage points compared to the  previous  year.  Hong  Kong  continued  its downward  trend  as  its  position  as  a  leading  tourist destination  for  luxury  goods  purchases  suffered. Chinese  tourists,  who  represented  the  majority  of Hong  Kong's  luxury  goods  clients,  shifted  their spending  back  to  Mainland  China,  particularly  to Hainan  province  where  various  measures  were  taken to attract them.\n\nJapan  represented  8%  of  the  worldwide  personal luxury goods market in 2020. The third largest country in  terms  of  personal  luxury  goods  consumption  after the  United  States  and  China,  the  Japanese  market contracted 25% on a comparable basis. Consumers in Japan spent less during the crisis and the absence of tourists,  mainly  from  China,  also  dampened  the performance  of  the  Japanese  personal  luxury  goods market.\n\nAmong the other countries in Asia, South Korea held up  well,  thanks  to  the  appetite  of  local  clients  for luxury goods and despite a drop in duty-free shopping by tourists.\n\nThe  rest  of  the  world  -  including  the  Middle  East, Africa and Australia - represented 4% of the worldwide personal  luxury  goods  market  with  \u20ac9  billion  in revenue in  2020,  down  20%  at  comparable  exchange rates.  Countries  in  the  Middle  East  delivered  mixed performances, although relatively speaking, the health crisis had a lesser impact as spending was repatriated. However,  Australia  was  impacted  first  by  a  large number of major bush fires and then a contraction in tourism.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  category includes  ready-to-wear  for  both  women  and  men, which  declined  in  the  same  proportions.  Two  key trends  are  emerging  in  apparel:  (i)  the  popularity  of streetwear  among  younger  generations  and  (ii)  the difficulties met by the most formal clothing segment.\n\nAll  Kering  soft  luxury  Houses  operate  in  this  product category,  especially  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and, to a lesser extent, Bottega Veneta,  as  well  as  Brioni  for  the  menswear  segment only.\n\n## Leather goods\n\nThis category includes handbags, small leather goods (wallets, purses, etc.), and other leather products. The revenue  generated  by  leather  goods  in  2020  is estimated  at  \u20ac47  billion,  or  22%  of  total  personal luxury goods revenue. This category held up relatively well  in  2020,  contracting  18%  on  a  reported  basis, thanks  to  the  appeal  of  the  entry-price  offering  and iconic products, such as high-end handbags.\n\nKering operates in this category primarily through the Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands and, to a lesser extent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga.\n\n## Shoes\n\nThis category includes both men's and women's shoes. It represented 9% of the luxury goods market in 2020, or  \u20ac19  billion  in  revenue.  It  saw  a  limited  decline  of 12% in 2020, on a reported basis, the trend toward less formal shoes, such as sneakers, resulting in a rebound in the second half.\n\nKering  mainly  operates  in  this  product  category through Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga.\n\n## Watches\n\nThis category generated revenue of \u20ac27 billion in 2020, representing  12%  of  the  total  personal  luxury  goods market, and was down 30% versus 2019 as reported. Already  affected  by  consumer  trends  towards  other categories,  the  watch  industry  was  strongly  impacted by  the  health  crisis.  Kering  operates  in  this  category across  different  price  points  with  Gucci  Timepieces, Boucheron, Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin.\n\n## Jewelry\n\nRevenue from jewelry decreased by 15% as reported in 2020  to  reach  \u20ac18  billion,  representing  8%  of  the personal  luxury  goods  market.  The  segment  resisted relatively  well,  supported  by  its  entry-price  offering and by the performance of high jewelry, especially in Asia and Mainland China.\n\nKering  operates  in  this  category  primarily  through Boucheron,  Pomellato,  DoDo  and  Qeelin,  but  also Gucci,  which  proposes  an  offering  ranging  from fashion jewelry to a high jewelry collection.",

Kering operates in this product category  through  licensing  agreements  between  its main  brands  and  leading  industry  players  such  as L'Or\u00e9al,  Coty  and  Interparfums  to  develop  and  sell perfumes and cosmetics.\n\n## V. Distribution channels\n\nWorldwide personal luxury goods market: breakdown by distribution channel (2018-2020e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Retail\n- Wholesale\n\n## Retail channel\n\nA strong directly operated store network is important for  the  success  of  a  luxury  brand  as  it  allows  greater control  over  the  consumer  shopping  experience  and over  the  product  mix,  merchandising  and  customer service. In 2020, the retail channel accounted for 48% of  in-person  sales  in  the  worldwide  personal  luxury goods market.\n\nIn the case of Kering's Houses, the share of retail sales is  far  higher (78%), reflecting the maturity of some of the brands, Kering's strategic commitment to grow its directly operated network and growth in the portion of online sales made via the brands' own websites.\n\nIt  also  reflects  the  importance  of  leather  goods  and accessories,  which  represent  a  higher  share  of  the product  mix  for  retail  sales,  in  the  Group's  luxury ranges.\n\n## Other (eyewear, textile accessories, etc.)\n\nPersonal  luxury  goods  that  do  not  fit  into  the categories  mentioned  above  represented  6%  of  the market in 2020, or \u20ac13 billion in revenue. This category includes eyewear, a segment in which Kering operates through Kering Eyewear.\n\n## Wholesale channel\n\nThe  wholesale  channel  typically  includes  department stores,  independent high-end multi-brand stores and franchise stores, and accounted for approximately 52% of  the  total  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods  market in  2020.  This  channel  can  thus  be  multi-brand  or mono-brand. The share of wholesale sales is typically higher  in  ready-to-wear,  watches  and  jewelry,  and  is also more significant than retail in the channel mix for brands that stand at an earlier stage of maturity.\n\n## Sales formats\n\nDistribution  channels  can  also  be  split  into  six  sales formats, which are either operated directly or by partners.\n\n/pt: Market share change (2020e vs 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue increased by \u20ac16 billion year on year to nearly \u20ac50  billion  and  accounted  for  c.  23%  of  total  luxury goods sales.  This  includes  sales  made  through  brand websites  (retail  channel)  and  department  stores  and e-tailers (wholesale). E-commerce became the market's leading sales format in 2020, driven by Asia and  by  a  younger  cohort  of  generation  Y  and generation  Z  consumers.  Within  e-commerce,  brands and  e-tailers  are  the  top  performers.  Brands  are accelerating  their  development  of  online  activities,\n\n## VI. Market outlook\n\nKey trends for 2021 include:\n\n- \u00b7 a gradual recovery and a significant improvement in the  global  economy  after  the  shock  in  2020: forecasted global GDP growth of 5.0% in 2021 (1) to reach 2019 levels at the end of the year;\n- \u00b7 a  gradual  upturn  in  global  air  traffic  based  on  the number of passengers, depending on how well the vaccination campaigns progress. According to IATA, air traffic could increase by more than 50% in 2021, but  would  still  be  down  by  around  40%  compared to 2019;\n- \u00b7 a  continuation  of  the  repatriation  of  consumption back to local markets, particularly in China, and the ensuing  impact  on  spending  by  Chinese  tourists, depending  on  the  pace  at  which  international tourism recovers. In addition, Hong Kong's ability to recover  its  appeal  as  a  destination  for  luxury consumers will depend on the development of the alternative offering in Mainland China and in Hainan province  in  particular,  and  on  the  more  structural measures  taken  by  the  Chinese  government  to encourage local consumption;\n- \u00b7 faster  penetration  of  e-commerce  in  the  personal luxury  goods  market  and  greater  demand  from consumers  for  increasingly  sophisticated  digital exchanges;\n- \u00b7 mixed  performances  across  regions,  with  Europe depending  partly on the recovery in tourist numbers, the United States potentially experiencing a downturn after the strong 2020 performance, and Asia  (particularly  Mainland  China)  continuing  to drive the industry's recovery.\n\nexpanding  both  the  geographical  reach  and  the product  offering  on  their  e-stores,  while  e-tailers  are seeing strong momentum due to an integrated offer of appealing content, sometimes supported by exclusive partnerships with brands.\n\nKering's  Houses  are  present  online  via e-commerce sites,  operated  completely  internally  in  the  case  of Gucci,  and  also  for  Alexander  McQueen  and  Saint Laurent since 2020. The internalization of e-commerce on the Group's platforms will  be  finalized  in  the  first half of 2021 for Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta.\n\nKering  brands  are  also  distributed  online  by  selected partners, in line with the Group's strategy to also operate under a closely controlled virtual licensing model.\n\nAccordingly, global demand for personal luxury goods is  expected to rebound in 2021, leading to growth of between 10% to 19% compared to 2020, depending on the  different  scenarios  considered  and,  in  particular, the extent to which local consumption and international travel recover.\n\nNone  of  the  current  scenarios  for  2021  foresees  the market  recovering  to  2019  levels.  Depending  on  the underlying  assumptions,  the  personal  luxury  goods market could contract  by  around  8%  to  15%  in  2021 compared to 2019, representing an absolute value of \u20ac240  billion  to  \u20ac260  billion.  Similarly,  the  industry's profitability is expected to bounce back in 2021 to an average  of  16%  to  18%,  once  again  remaining  below 2019 levels.\n\nIn the longer term, according to Bain and Altagamma and  despite  the  atypical  circumstances  in  2020,  the personal  luxury  goods  market  is  expected  to  resume an  annual  growth  rate  of  nearly  10%  between  2020 and 2025 and could reach \u20ac330 to \u20ac370 billion by the end  of  that  period.  This  represents  annual  average growth of 10% to 15% between 2020 and 2022, and of 8% to 14% between 2020 and 2023.\n\nThe  market's  structural  growth  drivers  have  been clearly identified:\n\n- \u00b7 emerging  consumers:  a  booming  upper-middle class (urbanization, higher standards of living and a tendency  to  devote  a  larger  budget  share  to discretionary  spending),  which  should  benefit  the 'accessible'  luxury  segment,  particularly  in  China. According  to  forecasts, Chinese  clients could represent  46%  to  48%  of  the  worldwide  personal luxury goods market in 2025;",

According to Bain's estimates, ultra-high-net-worth individuals  (UNHWIs)  already  represented  30%  of the  luxury  market  in  2019  and  their  share  will continue to grow;\n- \u00b7 the  development  of  distribution  channels  such  as discount  outlets,  travel  retail  (depending  on  the recovery of international tourism) and e-commerce.\n\n- The  latter  is  expected  to  account  for  more  than 30% of total personal luxury goods sales by 2025;\n- \u00b7 the  development  of  new  high-end  products  and services;\n- \u00b7 increasing  interest  in  second-hand  luxury  goods. The  second-hand  market  generated  an  estimated \u20ac26 billion in 2019, with growth driven by increased environmental awareness among consumers. Certain  clients,  particularly  among  the  younger generations, also see the second-hand segment as a  more  accessible  way  to  enter  the  luxury  goods market.\n\nThese  trends  are  expected  to  drive  an  increase  in the number of luxury market clients from c. 380-390 million in 2019 to c. 450 million in 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over at least the last five years, thanks to its contemporary approach  to  luxury  fashion,  Gucci  has  regained  its leadership  position  within  the  industry,  resulting  in powerful business momentum.\n\nOne  of  the  foundations  for  the  brand's  success  has been its ability to combine the introduction of a wholly new  aesthetic  led  by  Alessandro  Michele  with  an equally  innovative  strategic  vision  and  execution  led by  Marco  Bizzarri.  This  approach  has  prioritized creativity  and  a  distinctive  company  culture  as  the\n\n## Competitive environment\n\nGucci  is  one  of  the  few  luxury  brands  with  truly worldwide operations, alongside Chanel, Christian Dior, Herm\u00e8s  and  Louis  Vuitton.  In  2020,  Gucci  further\n\nenhanced its positioning as one of the world's leading luxury  fashion  brands  both  in  terms  of  revenue  and profitability.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOver at least the past five years, always in a disruptive way, Gucci has succeeded in establishing itself at the vanguard  of  the  fashion  industry  by  challenging  the status  quo,  both  as  a  business  and  as  a  brand. Creativity,  freedom  of  self-expression,  innovation  and a distinctive corporate culture have always been at the center of its value system and important drivers of the strategy.\n\nWhat  has  defined  and  underpinned  the  brand's success has been its constant capacity for reinvention and  regeneration,  while  remaining  true  to  its  unique DNA. This blend between modernity and heritage finds its  harmonious  expression  in  Alessandro  Michele's collections.  The  unique  styles  are  rooted  in  the House's  rich  archive  of  icons,  symbols  and  patterns. These are always reinterpreted in a contemporary way, which deeply resonates with the zeitgeist and with a growing community around the world, bonded to the brand by a joyful sense of belonging.\n\nThe  focus  on  creating  an  increasingly  authentic, emotional  connection  between  Gucci  and  its  clients has been one of the key drivers of its success over at least  the  past  five  years.  Deepening  the  conversation with  clients  across  all  the  brand's  touchpoints  is critical  for  its  long-term  success,  especially  in  a digitally  connected  society  where  immersive  and innovative digital experiences are paramount and lead the way in engaging with consumers across the globe. This  is  achieved  through  the  careful  implementation of  a  qualitative  content  and  platform  strategy  that  is the  source  of  an  ongoing,  authentic  emotional  and engaging  narrative,  which  goes  beyond  products  and collections.\n\nGucci's  long-term  business  strategy  is  based  on  the key growth drivers reaffirmed during the Kering Capital Markets Day held in June 2018. These include, among others,  the  constant  improvement  of  retail  KPIs (traffic, conversion, retention and average ticket price), the  rollout  of  the  new  store  concept  and  the  further expansion  of  gucci.com.  In  terms  of  products,  the ultimate  objective  is  to  achieve  full  potential  in  all categories, consolidating leadership in the core areas and strengthening the positioning in segments where growth potential is still untapped.\n\ncatalysts  for  a  dynamic  business.  The  framework  is defined  by  empowerment  at  every  level  of  the Company, an atmosphere that encourages thoughtful risk-taking,  and  a  progressive  approach  to  diversity and social responsibility.\n\nGucci  products  continue  to  represent  the  pinnacle  of Italian craftsmanship and savoir-faire , with unsurpassed quality and attention to detail. They are sold  exclusively  through  a  network  of  483  directly operated  boutiques,  a  directly  operated  online  store (active in 35 markets), a limited number of franchises, and  select  department  and  specialty  stores,  both offline and online.\n\nAt the  end  of  2020,  Gucci's  direct  retail  sales represented  approximately  87%  of  the  brand's  total revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On  the  eve  of  its  100 th anniversary,  Gucci  is once  again  taking  ambitious  decisions,  carefully balancing past legacy with innovation and risk-taking.\n\nGucci embarked on a new phase in the transformation of  its  distribution  to  make  it  even  more  exclusive  and controlled,  further  enhancing  its  brand  equity.  The already selective approach  to  wholesale  will  be reinforced  across  the  board,  significantly  reducing  the channel's  exposure.  The  same  strategy  is  now  being applied to online e-tailers through the implementation of  a  concession  framework  that  once  again  protects brand equity.\n\nAiming  at  fostering  more  creativity,  freedom  and flexibility,  Gucci decided to review the timing and the pace  of  its  main  collections,  which  will  now  be presented  twice  a  year,  without  necessarily  being associated  with  a  global  fashion  week.  This  new milestone  started  with  the  collection Ouverture  of something  that  never  ended , which  was  presented\n\nthrough a unique seven-episode mini-series co-directed by filmmaker Gus Van Sant and Alessandro Michele, unveiled daily during GucciFest, an innovative  digital  fashion  and  film  festival  over  the course of a week in November 2020. These moments will  be  complemented by regular new product drops, capsules and collaborations to continuously feed and nurture clients' curiosity and appetite for novelty.\n\nGucci's  commitment  to  environmental  and  social sustainability  has  been  reinforced  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic.  Gucci  pushed  forward  with  its  ten-year sustainability strategy, building on various industry-leading initiatives to minimize its impact on the  planet  and  to  protect  the  rights  and  status  of people around the world. Since 2018, Gucci has been carbon  neutral  in  its  operations  and  across  its  full supply chain.\n\nGucci further committed to a plan of action to increase diversity and inclusion among its employees, consistent  with  Kering's  strategy.  Diversity  in  all  its forms,  and  equity  and  inclusivity,  continue  to  be essential  pillars  of  Gucci's  company  culture  and  fully integrated into its People strategy.\n\n## 2020 highlights and ambitions for 2021\n\nIn 2020, the health and economic crisis brought on by the  outbreak  of  COVID-19  slowed  the  strong  revenue momentum  that  Gucci  had  been  experiencing  for  at least the last five years. The pandemic, as well as the associated lockdowns and restrictions, impacted Gucci in  terms  of  ways  to  engage  with  its  clients  and  its business operations.\n\nNevertheless, the brand showed remarkable resilience during the peak of the crisis. Gucci responded quickly to the outbreak,  reorganizing  its  priorities and operations, adopting strict but flexible cost management  as  well  as  continuously  reallocating resources  where  needed  throughout  the  year.  The brand ensured business continuity by promoting new ways of working within the organization and innovative  ways  of  engaging  with  clients,  while implementing best-in-class health and safety measures to ensure employees and clients' safety.\n\nWith  its  production  facilities  based  in  Italy,  Gucci's operations were particularly affected by the pandemic. Italy  was  one  of  the  most  impacted  countries  in Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and imposed strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus. As a result, the production plants were shut down  completely  for  two  months  (from  March  until the end of April).\n\nLike other players in the sector, Gucci's retail network was heavily affected by store closures and by the lack of tourism due to lockdowns and travel bans involving all geographical  areas.  However,  once  restrictions started  to  ease,  business  trends  started  to  improve materially,  at  a  different  speed  and  magnitude  for each market. This was achieved through action plans that were executed promptly and tailored individually to each market, intensifying the focus on local clients in all geographical areas. A strong set of initiatives was put in place to create excitement in the retail network and  to  attract  clients  to  come  back  to  the  stores. Dedicated clienteling and retail activities were organized  in  store,  from  private  appointments  to engage with clients on a deeper level, to institutional experiences involving a broader audience, to showcase collections and emphasize strategic product launches. All this complemented by the deployment of a tactical product  assortment,  further  differentiated  to  meet local demand in each market and enhanced by a visual merchandising strategy to maximize the visibility and selling potential of the offer.",

        "page_content": "The retail network remained stable in its footprint, while being continuously enhanced by the new store concept, with  new  openings  and  refurbishments  in  important cities across the world, including San Francisco, Sydney and  Moscow.  This  concept  is  pivotal  to  reflecting  the brand's  aesthetic  and  values,  giving  substance  and expression to the value of client inclusivity. With COVID19 accelerating the evolution of the physical stores into experience hubs, the new concept plays an even more important  role  in  powering  interactions  with  clients, reducing  barriers  between  the  product  and  the  client and across product categories - thus enhancing crossselling opportunities.\n\nThe brand also continued to implement innovative forms of  its  experiential  strategy.  The  Gucci  Osteria  restaurant, inaugurated  in  Florence  at  the  Gucci  Garden,  opened  a branch  in  Beverly  Hills  above  the  Gucci  Rodeo  Drive flagship  store  in  January  2020,  and  there  are  also  plans for other openings by the end of 2021.\n\nIn the wholesale  channel,  Gucci  progressed  in continuing  to  streamline  its  footprint,  while  also moving  forward  with  the  conversion  of  strategically relevant accounts to a concession or retail model, both on-  and  offline,  with  the  primary  goal  being  to increase  control  over  distribution.  As  for  travel  retail, the brand focused on reviewing its locations in order to  account  for  the  new  direction  of  traffic  flows  that has been accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nThe  online  channel  delivered  another  outstanding  year. Sales  have  been  growing  strongly  as  a  result  of  the ongoing  emphasis  placed  on  a  best-in-class  client experience,  blending  seamless  shopping  functionalities, including  new  payment  methods,  with  the  brand's unique  narrative  content,  and  leveraging  immersive innovations, from 3D product renderings to virtual try-on. New  omni-channel  services  were  introduced  to  ensure ease  in  remote  shopping,  enhanced  by  personalized customer experiences, including customized content and a live video service. This innovative tool was powered by the  Gucci  9  global  client  service  center,  which  plays  an increasingly  strategic  role  in  reaching  and  engaging clients  through  online  channels,  while  preserving  the human touch.\n\nGucci  further  reinforced  its  global  digital  footprint, establishing key partnerships with innovative companies and  emerging  platforms.  In  December  2020,  Gucci  and Alibaba  Group  announced  the  opening  of  the  Gucci flagship  store  on  Alibaba's  Tmall  Luxury  Pavilion,  an exclusive platform dedicated to the world's leading luxury and  fashion  brands.  Based  on  a  concession  model,  the new Tmall Luxury Pavilion Gucci flagship store builds on an existing strategic digital ecosystem in China established  by  Gucci  over  the  past  few  years,  with  its Chinese website, gucci.cn, launched in 2017, and a strong presence  on  all  the  market-relevant  social  media platforms.\n\nFrom a product perspective, Gucci continued consolidating its key pillar products, which are highly desirable,  while  sustaining  curiosity  and  building excitement through the calibrated introduction of new pieces, perfectly complementing the offer. During the year,  new  introductions  across  all  product  categories represented  approximately  30%  of  total  business. Leather goods were driven by a stronger focus on the most iconic lines, with seasonal refreshes and tactical extensions. This included the Jackie 1961 ,  a  refreshed version of a historical Gucci bag, which was launched this  year  and  has  been  extremely  well  received  in  all markets.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  also  consolidated  its  fine  fragrances business,  while  expanding  the  beauty  category.  The make-up  line  was  enriched  with  key  products  to complete  the  offer  of  the  different  segments  (eyes, lips, face and nails), with an innovative and disruptive advertising campaign supported by coordinated digital activations.\n\nThe  high-end  watches  and  jewelry  segment  was marked this year by the launch of the Lion Head fine jewelry collection. In 2021, the brand will continue to expand this category further with new launches. Gucci is also  developing  a  new  Lifestyle  category  that includes  a  wide  range  of  products,  from  games  and playing  cards,  to  stationery,  travel  sets  and  gifting items.\n\nDuring the year, Gucci's brand heat remained strong, as was underlined by several achievements and industry recognitions.  This  included  Interbrand's Best  Global Brands Report for  2020  confirming Gucci as the most valuable  Italian  brand  across  all  sectors,  for  the  21 st consecutive year.\n\nGucci continued its contribution to environmental and social sustainability. Alongside its reaffirmed commitment to be carbon neutral in all its operations, including its supply chain, in 2020, Gucci continued its efforts toward fulfilling its pledge to further reduce its environmental impact and drive progressive change. It increased  the  use  of  recycled  raw  materials  and organic  fibers  in  its  collections,  and  in  June  2020 successfully  launched  its  first  circular  line, Gucci  Off The Grid .  In  October  2020,  Gucci  teamed  up  with  The RealReal  to  promote  circularity  in  luxury  fashion through a temporary online shop, while in November 2020 the brand debuted its new sustainable  packaging.  Aiming  to  help  small  and medium-sized  enterprises  in  the  'Made  in  Italy' production supply chain to recover from the impact of COVID-19, Gucci partnered with Intesa Sanpaolo bank to  launch Programma  Sviluppo  Filiere . Under  the initiative,  Gucci  suppliers  in  Italy  were  able  to  obtain fast  access  to  loans  from  Intesa  Sanpaolo,  cutting down the time it  might  take  to  obtain  much-needed liquidity,  with  very  favorable  borrowing  conditions generally reserved for large corporate clients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Global  Equity  Board  also  works with the Changemakers committee to implement new initiatives  and  strengthen  the  company's  internal global volunteering program.\n\nGucci  is  confident  in  its  strategy  and  aims  to  further consolidate  its  leadership  position  within  the  luxury industry in 2021. The brand will focus on enhancing its control  of  distribution,  deepening  relationships  with local  clients,  unleashing  its  full  potential  across  all product categories and developing new ways to service its  clients,  in  a  customer journey that will not be just about products, but also about content and engagement.\n\nIn order to create additional moments to engage with clients,  Gucci  will  continue  to  exploit  the  opportunity to develop more frequent and well-coordinated drops within the main  collections.  To  strengthen  the effectiveness of each of its drops, new must-haves and sparkling  capsule  collections,  possibly  dedicated  to specific events, will pair with a renewed carryover offer promoted at all times. Gucci Pins (Gucci pop-up stores) will be deployed from the beginning of 2021 to bring forward  new  seasonal  messages  and  explore  further opportunities,  with  an  ambitious  plan  starting  with  a co-branded capsule collection with The North Face.\n\nFor  its  100 th anniversary  in  2021,  Gucci  is  planning  a full  calendar of diverse activities, starting in Florence, its birthplace, then moving on to a series of events and launches  that  reinforce  the  brand's  DNA.  While certainly recognizing the past, the brand will distinguish its activations with the unexpected, never-nostalgic  Gucci  creative  twist,  which  keeps  on differentiating the brand from its competitors.",

Originally a House of haute couture, Yves Saint Laurent revolutionized the way fashion and society interact in 1966 with the introduction of high-end ready-to-wear clothes  produced  on  a  larger  scale  than  its  exclusive collections.\n\nSaint  Laurent  designs  and  markets  a  broad  range  of men's  and  women's  ready-to-wear,  handbags,  shoes, small leather goods, jewelry, scarves, ties and eyewear. The  House's  products  are  made  in  Italy  and  France, where an historic atelier manufactures ready-to-wear garments.  Under  a  worldwide  licensing  agreement with L'Or\u00e9al, the House is active in the fragrances and cosmetics segment, and also collaborates with Kering Eyewear  to  develop  a  full  range  of  frames  and sunglasses.\n\n## Competitive environment\n\nSince  its  inception,  Saint  Laurent  has  held  enormous influence both inside and outside the fashion industry. Over  the  years,  its  founder,  the  couturier  Yves  Saint Laurent, secured a reputation as one of the 20 th century's foremost designers and personalities.\n\nSaint  Laurent  was  the  first  revolutionary  fashion House, and this spirit is a fundamental part of its DNA.\n\n## Strategy\n\nSaint  Laurent's  primary  objective  remains  to  create and market highly desirable products that embody the core  values  of  the  brand  through  innovation  and unparalleled quality and design.\n\nUnder  the  helm  of  its  Creative  Director,  Anthony Vaccarello, the House's collections are a sophisticated tribute to Paris, the atelier and  the  expertise, conceived with a modern perspective.\n\nIn April 2016, Saint Laurent announced the appointment of Anthony Vaccarello as Creative Director. With a natural creative connection to the brand's spirit, he has since his arrival strongly empowered a highly desirable vision.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Saint  Laurent  retail network consisted of 239 directly operated boutiques, including flagship stores in Paris, London, Dubai, New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Melbourne, Miami  and  Los  Angeles.  These  boutiques  generated 69% of the House's total revenue for the year.\n\nThe House is also present in selected multi-brand and department stores worldwide.\n\nIts status  as  a  leader  is  fully  established  and recognized, with a very distinctive identity and strong codes, identified and made relevant to our time. Saint Laurent  competes  globally  with  the  most  high-end exclusive  luxury  brands  and  occupies  a  leading position  in  the  ready-to-wear,  fashion  and  leather goods sectors.\n\nA  key  focus  of  Saint  Laurent's  strategy  is  to  build  an innovative  and  sustainable  future  by  retaining  and hiring the best talent, promoting gender equality, and developing a sustainable way of doing business, while preserving  heritage  craft  and  exploring  new  business models.  With  this  strategy  firmly  in  place,  Saint Laurent  will  continue  growing  and  affirming  itself  in the  21 st century  as  a  brand  with  a  strong  and  clear DNA.\n\n## 2020 highlights and ambitions for 2021\n\nUnder the leadership of Francesca Bellettini, President and CEO, Saint Laurent took decisive action in 2020 to maintain the House's position at the forefront of the luxury goods industry.\n\nCreative  Director  Anthony  Vaccarello  continues  to express  his  vision  through  collections  that  embrace both modernity and the brand's legendary codes. The House's creative independence was asserted by setting a new precedent in Luxury, with the decision to adapt the  timing  for  presenting  collections  according  to Anthony  Vaccarello's  own  creative  sensibility  rather than an arbitrary fashion calendar.\n\nThe  House's  creativity  and  agility  were  displayed  in equal measures through the innovative presentations of  its  collections  in  2020.  These  stunning  digital films  demonstrated  the  House's  ability  to  adopt  new forms  of  creative  expression  -  and  met  with  great success. More than 44 million people viewed the video premiere of the Men's collection and around 120 million viewed the Women's collection.\n\nThe  interconnection  of  the  House's  legacy  with  its present is featured in a special exhibition devoted to Betty Catroux at the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent in Paris. Anthony  Vaccarello  curated  the  exhibition,  selecting pieces  that  reveal  Catroux's  signature  style  and  her lasting influence on the label.",

The  film  was  part  of  the  official selection  at  the  Venice  Film  Festival.  Over  the  years, the  SELF  project  has  involved  artists  including  Daido Moriyama, Vanessa Beecroft, Bret Easton Ellis, Gaspard No\u00e9 and Wong Kar Wai and has demonstrated the importance of art and artistry to Saint Laurent.\n\nIn 2020, Saint Laurent accelerated the execution of its long-term strategy to enhance local client relationships,  expand  digital  presence  and  elevate distribution around the world.\n\nIn  a  year  marked  by  significant  uncertainty,  Saint Laurent responded to the rapidly changing environment swiftly and efficiently, adjusting operations to i) ensure safety,  ii)  maintain  stability  and  iii)  prepare  for  global economic recovery. The brand resumed retail operations across  its  entire  network  in  China  in  March  and  then launched  ysl.cn.  Stores  were  reopened  throughout  the world as soon as it was safe to do so.\n\nThe House's commitment to local clients has positioned Saint  Laurent  effectively  for  the  years  to  come.  With international  travel  unlikely  to  return  to  pre-pandemic levels in the short term, a focus on local clients, tailored and  relevant  communication  and  unique  customer experience  -  in-store  and  online  -  will  continue  to differentiate Saint Laurent.\n\nSaint Laurent recognizes that emotional engagement with clients  will  be  essential  as  people  return  to  stores. Individual attention, personal connection and anticipation  of  desires  will  be  central  to  the  client\n\nexperience.  Collection  items  will  appear  in  stores according to schedules that reflect real client desires, and increased control over wholesale distribution will help ensure consistent standards of presentation and service.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Saint  Laurent  is  transforming  its digital  sales  experience  with  the  adoption  of  a  new, directly  controlled  platform  with  enhanced  capability and seamless integration across the House. The end of the  joint  venture  with  Yoox  Net-a-Porter  has  created an  opportunity  for  Saint  Laurent  to  provide  a distinctive,  bespoke  omni-channel  experience.  Online sales have grown consistently among a technologically savvy clientele. The brand has invested in IT  infrastructure  to  provide  clients  with  a  seamless shopping  experience  -  no  matter  where  or  how they experience Saint Laurent.\n\nDigital  outreach  is  a  central  element  of  the  brand's communication strategy. Saint Laurent has a dedicated  social  media  following  that  continues  to grow  as  the  brand  engages  on  more  platforms  and with enhanced content. The House's digital engagement and social media activity is also focused on  connecting  with  local  clients,  providing  locally relevant  content  and  promoting  local  activities  and events.\n\nThe  unprecedented  events  of  2020  have  not  altered Saint  Laurent's  strategic  commitments.  Instead,  they have  focused  the  House  even  more  intensely  on  the creative independence and commercial priorities that have driven its success for several years. By continuing to  act  with  innovation  and  agility,  Saint  Laurent  will continue to set new standards for excellence in Luxury.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Business concept\n\nFounded in 1966 in the Veneto region of Italy, Bottega Veneta  began  its  journey  as  a  leather  goods  House. The  brand  quickly  rose  to  fame  with  its  signature Intrecciato code, inspiring individuality with innovative new modes of craftsmanship. Bottega Veneta has set a new standard for Luxury since its creation.\n\nBottega Veneta's products are sold through a distribution network  of  directly  operated  stores, complemented  by  exclusive  franchise  stores  and select  department  and  specialty  stores  worldwide.  In addition, Bottega Veneta's products are now available through the brand's online store in 56 countries.\n\n## Competitive environment\n\nBottega  Veneta  draws  on  its  Italian  heritage  to  offer truly  handcrafted  products  made  with  the  expert know-how  of  its  master  artisans.  An  inclusive  brand\n\n## Strategy\n\nSince  the  appointment  of  Daniel  Lee  as  Creative Director  in  2018  and  Bartolomeo  Rongone  as  CEO  in September  2019,  Bottega  Veneta  has  opened  a  new chapter in its history, establishing the brand's positioning as a luxury fashion brand by leveraging on a  bold  approach  to  creativity.  The  business  and creative sides are continuing to work hand in hand to increase  brand  awareness  and  ultimately  achieve long-term  sustainable  growth.  This  strategy  has propelled  Bottega  Veneta  into  new  territories:  while continuing  to  embrace  discretion,  the  brand  is engaging with a broader audience and tapping into its potential.  A  wider  range  of  products  appealing  to  an international clientele of men  and  women  has\n\nwith  exclusive  products,  Bottega  Veneta  offers  a unique and elevated experience.\n\ngradually been  integrated, all featuring Bottega Veneta's sophisticated substance, craftsmanship, Italian  glamor  and  discretion. Intrecciato remains essential  to  the  brand's  visual  identity,  reinvented from a modern perspective.\n\nThe  House  has  been  strengthening  its  design  and product development capabilities encompassing ready-to-wear and shoes in addition to its established core  business  of  leather  goods.  The  product  mix  has been  evolving  with  significant  efforts  to  expand ready-to-wear and shoes, which continue to increase their  share  of  the  brand's  revenue  versus  leather goods, the latter accounting for 74% of sales in 2020 (vs. 83% in 2019).\n\n## 2020 highlights and ambitions for 2021\n\nIn 2020, Bottega Veneta's strong momentum continued,  fueled  by  the  positive  reception  of  its renewed  creativity  under  Daniel  Lee,  resulting  in  a solid  revenue  performance  despite  the  COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOn the back of its successful creative renewal, Bottega Veneta posted remarkable first-quarter revenue, thanks  to  the  acclaim  received  by  the  collections among  local  clientele  in  Western  Europe  and  North America  in  particular.  Between  February  and  March, celebrating the launch of the Spring/Summer collection,  exclusive  events  were  held  at  London Harrods and Saks that both entailed window takeovers and in-store pop-up spaces.\n\nOn February 22, the Fall 2020 fashion show at Palazzo del  Ghiaccio  in  Milan  staged  immersive  projections capturing  elements  of  Italian  Palladian  architecture, paying  tribute  to  the  spirit  of  the  Veneto  region.  The collection was  disruptive in its modernity  and emphasized  the  tension  between  tradition  and innovation with Intrecciato continuing to emerge.\n\nIn  March,  during  the  months  of  isolation  due  to  the pandemic,  Bottega  Veneta  offered  a  moment  of\n\ndistraction  and  inspiration  to  its  audience  through Bottega Residency: a platform celebrating creation in all  forms,  from  art,  literature  and  music,  to  film  and cuisine.  Captivating  its  audience  on  social  media channels, through the voices of its creative community,  the  brand  was  able  to  build  powerful cultural momentum.\n\nFrom  April,  despite  the  exceptionally  unfavorable market conditions, the House succeeded in containing the drop in revenue thanks to positive impetus in the stores that remained open and a rebound in Mainland China and Korea, as well as a surge in online sales.\n\nIn  June,  Bottega  Veneta  introduced  its  Pre-Fall  2020 collection alongside a dedicated advertising campaign shot  by  Tyrone  Lebon,  receiving  an  extraordinary response from both new and existing clients.\n\nIn July, the collection took over the foyer of the Plaza 66 Mall in Shanghai with The Invisible Store, a new and unique  pop-up  concept  that  subverted  the  idea  of physical limitations with a mirrored facade. Embodying  the  brand's  core  values  -  subtlety  and discretion,  self-confidence,  joy  and  sensuality  -  the tension  between  what  is  hidden  and  what  is  visible\n\n<!-- image -->",

To further engage with the Chinese public,  Bottega  Veneta's  gold  chain  was  blown  up beyond  its  traditional proportions, allowing the product  to  become  a  giant  installation  inhabiting urban spaces around the world. Debuting at the Grand Gateway in Shanghai, the gourmette chain travelled to Tokyo,  Chengdu,  Nanjing,  Sydney,  Seoul  and  Kuwait later  in  the  year,  continuing  to  increase  the  brand's visibility.\n\nWith growth opportunities in the Men's business, the House affirmed its ambition to establish this category in July with the release of Bottega Veneta: Men ,  a  film by  Tyrone  Lebon  and  Daniel  Lee  reflecting  on  the meaning  of  masculinity  today  through  different creative voices including actor Barry Keoghan, director Dick Jewell, musicians Neneh Cherry and Tricky, as well as ballet dancer Roberto Bolle.\n\nFrom  mid-August,  the  Fall  2020 Puddle boots  in biodegradable  material  pre-launched  exclusively  on bottegaveneta.com,  building  desirability  before  the global  launch  of  the  Fall  2020  collection  in  early September.\n\nDuring  the  summer,  Bottega  Veneta  experienced  a significant sales rebound, proving that it has entered a new  phase  of  dynamic  consolidation  of  its  new creative and business strategies.\n\nBottega  Veneta  decided  not  to  present  its  new collection  during  the  Spring  2021  fashion  weeks, exploring a more intimate concept with an immersive preview of the Spring 2021 collection named Salon 01 London at  Sadler's  Wells  later  in  October.  With  a  view to  redefining  the  way  the  House  engages  with  its audience,  Daniel  Lee  explored  the  idea  of  a  more personal approach, presenting his new collection at an intimate  event  in  the  city.

Since 2010, the House has been fully owned by Kering.\n\nAlexander  McQueen  is  renowned  for  innovation grounded in  craftsmanship  and  the  House  today  has become synonymous with modern British couture. In December  2016,  Alexander  McQueen  was  awarded British Brand of the Year by the British Fashion Council (BFC).\n\nSince  her  appointment  as  Creative  Director  in  2010, Sarah Burton  has  produced  critically acclaimed collections with a focus on storytelling, experimentation  and  traditional  artisanal  techniques. Her ability  to  develop  the  design  codes  of  the  House with  lightness  and  a  distinctive,  authentic  touch  has ushered  in  a  new  aesthetic  that  is  being  translated throughout  the  Company's  culture,  establishing  a blueprint for the future.\n\nThe House's strength lies in the cohesive presence of a distinctive  silhouette  that  informs  designs  across  all product  categories.  Alexander  McQueen  has  recently enjoyed strong growth in shoes and leather goods with collections built  around iconic products that embody the  brand's  codes,  while  consolidating  its  worldwide authority in ready-to-wear.\n\nAfter  the  successful  launch,  in  partnership  with  Coty Prestige,  of  the  inaugural  fragrance  from  Alexander McQueen in 2016, a fragrance for women, Eau Blanche , was  launched  in  2017,  followed  by  an  exclusive McQueen fragrance collection in 2018.\n\nAs of 2020, the Alexander McQueen brand was sold in over 50 countries worldwide, through a network of 80 directly  operated  boutiques,  a  limited  number  of franchises and select department and specialty stores. The  network  was  recently  reinforced  with  several openings, culminating in the relocation of the London flagship store. With nearly 11,000 square feet, the Old Bond  Street  store  unveils  a  new  retail  concept developed  by  Sarah  Burton  in  collaboration  with  the architect  Smiljan  Radic,  which  translates  the  brand's powerful  storytelling  into  a  unique  customer  journey through a physical space.\n\nAt the same time, the House continues to enhance its visibility and reach with strategic openings in key cities (Tokyo  Omotesando,  New  York  SoHo,  Miami  Design District,  Singapore  ION),  shop-in-shops  in  high  traffic locations,  direct  entry  in  new,  high  potential  markets (such as Australia, Malaysia, Thailand and Kuwait) and by further developing  its online presence. The Alexander  McQueen  e-commerce  store  has  been  the brand's  number  one  store  in  terms  of  revenue\n\ncontribution since 2018. Online operations were fully internalized in 2020, offering a personalized, seamless client  experience.  Directly  operated  concessions  with Tmall Luxury Pavilion and Farfetch have extended the Company's footprint in the digital eco-system.\n\nThe  Alexander  McQueen  brand  has  a  strong  social media  presence,  with  over  10  million  followers  on Instagram  and  approximately  2  million  followers  on Twitter  and  Facebook  as  of  the  end  of  2020.  To increase direct connections with its clients and build a true sense of community, Alexander McQueen continues to invest in digital communication, including  through  heightened  engagement  across Chinese social media such as Weibo and WeChat.\n\nAlexander  McQueen's  social  media  channels  are integrated  into  the  larger  brand  communications strategy and fully aligned on key themes and stories.\n\nThe  company  has  also  successfully  developed  McQ, which was re-launched as an in-house brand in 2011 and is today well established in the popular contemporary  market.  The  McQ  brand  is  currently distributed in many  countries,  primarily as an international  wholesale  business  across  a  total  of more  than  500  doors.  Franchises  also  represent  an important  part  of  McQ's  business.  In  2020,  following the radical evolution of the contemporary market, McQ transitioned towards a new aesthetic, with a reshuffling  of  its  distribution  model  and  a  more direct-to-consumer  approach.  The  new  McQ  is  an innovative  and  collaborative  platform,  integrating fashion and technology. McQ is now a global creative collective,  working  with  credited  collaborators  and using  a  unique  blockchain  that  registers  each  item, allowing  consumers  to  interact  and  engage  with  the platform  via an  NFC  chip,  located  in  each  garment. McQ  has  also  launched  MYMCQ,  a  peer-to-peer platform  that  combines  social  media  and  resale capabilities, bringing the brand  into a circular economy model.\n\nIn  2020,  Alexander  McQueen  pursued  its  growth strategy through increased investment in communications,  further  penetration  in  accessories with  the  launch  of  elevated  new  leather  goods  lines and  strong  developments  in  footwear,  and  an acceleration  in  the  expansion  of  the  retail  network. The  roll-out of the new  store  concept  gained momentum during  the  year  with  the  opening  of  key flagships stores in Miami, Tokyo, New York, Singapore and Milan.\n\nSarah Burton has also continued to develop her vision of open access installations and collaborative education at Alexander McQueen.

Balenciaga's  exquisite technique,  masterful  cut  and  constant  innovation  in its use of fabrics has helped it carve out a special place in the hearts and minds of its clients.\n\nFrom  the  1990s  to  the  early  2000s,  the  brand experienced a re-birth,  renewing  its  relationship  with the  world  of  fashion  and  extending  its  product universe  beyond  its  core  ready-to-wear  segment  to include handbags and the development of new lines of shoes  and  accessories.  Balenciaga  also  significantly expanded its  retail  network,  helping  to  bolster  brand awareness around the globe.\n\nDemna  Gvasalia  was  appointed  Artistic  Director  of Balenciaga in October 2015. His mastery of techniques and  use  of  volumes,  combined  with  his  innovative approach,  make  him  a  powerful  force  in  today's creative world. As Artistic Director, Demna Gvasalia has begun  writing  a  new  chapter  in  Balenciaga's  history and  consolidated  the  House's  status  as  a  fashion authority. Demna Gvasalia has embraced Balenciaga's values  and  is  developing  them  in  harmony  with contemporary trends.\n\nBalenciaga  has  been  developing  men  and  women's eyewear collections with Kering Eyewear, sold worldwide  through  its  network  of  directly  operated stores and specialty third-party retailers, since 2018.\n\nIn recent years, Balenciaga has been consolidating its directly  operated  store  network  worldwide.  As  of end-2020, the House has a network of 182 stores in both  mature  markets  (Western  Europe,  the  United States and Japan) and Asia (China and South Korea). It is  also  distributed  through  franchises,  such  as  those opened  in  Brazil  and  Turkey  this  year,  and  leading multi-brand stores.\n\nIn  2020,  Balenciaga  pursued  its  retail  expansion strategy,  opening  several  new  stores  in  the  United States  and  Asia  and  doubling  the  retail  area  of  its Aoyama  flagship  store  in  Tokyo.  During  the  year, several stores were also renovated in line with the new\n\nconcept developed by Demna Gvasalia. The brand also extended  its  retail  presence  in  upscale  department stores,  with  the  opening  of  new  shop-in-shops  in Europe, Canada, Japan and Asia.\n\nThe online store Balenciaga.com confirmed its position in 2020 as one of the brand's top-performing directly  operated  stores,  and  traffic  continued  to increase strongly. All regions are enjoying outstanding results and the web experience is perfectly in line with the brand's audience and their shopping preferences. Mobile continues to be the preferred method for both browsing  and  shopping.  Today  there  are  nine  local versions  of  Balenciaga.com,  in  different  languages, including  Chinese,  Korean  and  Russian,  and  the Balenciaga  website  is  e-commerce  enabled  in  nearly 100 markets.\n\nOn social media, as of December 2020, Balenciaga had more than 1.9 million fans on Facebook. It saw strong take-up  on  TikTok  and  is  increasingly  popular  on Instagram  with  over  11.5  million  followers.  This reflects  growing  interest  for  the  collections  and  a remarkable gain in brand awareness and visibility. This year, the brand also expanded its presence on Chinese platforms  and  was  able  to  present  its  collections online, impressing clients and boosting their engagement.\n\nIn  2021,  the  brand  will  continue  to  benefit  from  the momentum  generated  by  Demna  Gvasalia's  creative vision and new product launches, particularly the new lines  of  leather  goods.  While  wholesale  distribution will  remain  an  important  contributor  to  the  brand's activity, retail and  e-commerce  development  will continue  to  be  the  priority.  To  this  end,  new  store openings  are  planned  during  the  year  in  strategic locations  both  in  mature  markets  and  in  Asia.  In  its roadmap  for  2021,  Balenciaga  also  plans  to  further develop its men's collection, with dedicated spaces in the  new stores,  and  to  continue  to  enlarge  its  online product  and  services  offering,  forming  part  of  the overall omni-channel strategy. All e-commerce operations will therefore be migrated during the year to  the  platform  directly  managed  by  the  brand,  with the Group's support.",

Revolutionary since the beginning, in 1952 Brioni was the  first  men's  luxury  House  to  stage  a  fashion  show and to  introduce  bright  colors  and  new  fabrics  to  its tailoring  collections,  pushing  the  boundaries  and interpretations of traditional menswear.\n\nOver the years, Brioni strengthened its global reputation,  obtaining  notable  recognition  in  the  US, where it was named the most prestigious men's luxury fashion  brand  by  the  Luxury  Institute  of  New  York  in 2007 and 2011.\n\nPart  of  Kering  since  2012,  Brioni  develops  and manufactures men's apparel, leather goods and shoes. The  company's  identity  is  founded  on  its  bespoke service, which provides entirely custom-made garments with an unparalleled level of craftsmanship.\n\nAll  the  brand's  products  are  handmade  by  expert artisans and the majority of the production is carried out in-house at Brioni's ateliers in Penne, a small town in  the  Abruzzo  region  with  a  rich,  long-standing tailoring tradition.\n\nWholesale represents an important distribution channel  and,  in  recent  years,  Brioni  has  aimed  to optimize and consolidate its distribution and franchise network.\n\nIn  retail,  Brioni  had  29  directly  operated  stores  as  of the  end  of  2020,  mainly  located  in  Western  Europe, North America, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Asia.\n\n2020  marked  the  75 th anniversary  of  the  House  and the launch of the two advertising campaigns featuring newly  appointed  brand  ambassador  Brad  Pitt.  The campaigns  were  deployed  on  social  media  and  in business  newspapers  and  magazines,  as  well  as outdoor  and  airport  billboards  in  major  cities  across the world.\n\nDespite  the  pandemic,  the  campaign  was  very  well received,  leading  to  increasing  brand  awareness  and strengthened brand equity. Key wholesale clients also returned  to  the  brand  for  the  Fall/Winter  2020 collection,  validating  the  style  direction  of  Norbert Stumpfl.\n\nThe  brand  further  enhanced  its  retail  network  in  the second half of the year with the refurbishment of the Bal Harbour store (US) and several relocation projects are planned for 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the retail network will be expanded with the opening  of  a  directly  operated  store  in  Chengdu (China)  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  retail  format, Brioni  Atelier ,  in  Frankfurt  (Germany).  This  experiment aims  to  reinforce  the  exclusive  experience  sought  by Brioni clients. The launch of a new fragrance in 2021, the fully revamped e-commerce offering, as well as the second year of Brad Pitt's ambassadorship, will further anchor Brioni among the most desirable and leading brands in luxury menswear.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thanks to its founder's  intuition,  Boucheron  was  the  first  major contemporary  jeweler  to  open  a  boutique  on  Paris' prestigious Place Vend\u00f4me, in 1893. Since its creation, the House has been closely associated with the idea of freedom,  not  only  in  terms  of  its  aesthetic,  creative and technical approach but also the freedom to wear jewelry,  independently  from  traditional  codes  and conventions.  For  162  years,  Boucheron  has  been synonymous  with  creativity  and  style  in  jewelry  and high jewelry.\n\nThe  brand  is  focusing  its  expansion  through  its 44  directly  operated  stores  (at  the  end  of  2020)  and 11 franchises in key locations worldwide.\n\nDespite the international health crisis, the House had quite an eventful year.\n\nIn January, a new high jewelry collection was presented to clients and the media at the Boucheron apartment, number  26,  place  Vend\u00f4me,  Paris.  The  collection focuses  on  the  iconic Point  d'Interrogation necklace, created by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boucheron in 1879 and re-imagined in 2020 through the creative lens of Claire Choisne, with the aim of establishing the piece as one of the House's Signatures .\n\nSeveral of the House's stores had to temporarily close their doors in March, as a result of the pandemic and associated restrictions. However, Boucheron's employees  reacted  with  determination  and  strong spirits,  launching  new  projects,  including  a  podcast using  the  voice  of  French  actor  Guillaume  Gallienne. Boucheron  also  supported  French  jewelry  workshops that are members of the UFBJOP ( Union fran\u00e7aise de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie, Orf\u00e8vrerie, des Pierres et des Perles ) professional association by paying for accountants to help them with the documentation needed to receive government assistance.\n\nThe  House  held  an  original  event  in  Pangyo,  South Korea  between  May  13  and  31.  The  ' La  Maison ' immersive experience gave visitors the opportunity to discover Boucheron's four pillars, with spaces dedicated to heritage, innovation, style and the French art of living. Illustrating the latter, a real French jardin d'hiver ,  or  winter  garden,  was  created  for  visitors  to enjoy a cup of tea and p\u00e2tisseries created by a French pastry chef.\n\nIn  July,  Boucheron  presented  its  new  high  jewelry collection Contemplation during  Paris  Haute  Couture Week. The collection is made up of 67 pieces created using an extremely sensory and innovative approach. It was  later  unveiled  in  Cannes  and  Monaco  during  the summer, and presented in Taiwan in September 2020.\n\nIn  August,  the  focus  shifted  to  the Quatre collection, with two new additions. Firstly, in jewelry, denim blue joined the signature colors of the Quatre ring.  In  high jewelry,  Boucheron  reinforced  its  image  of  a  jewelry style  leader  with  an  innovative  capsule  collection. Creative Director Claire Choisne chose to pair denim, a universal  material,  with  precious  diamonds,  resulting in  two  unique  pieces:  a  high  jewelry  ring  and  cuff bracelet made of white gold, diamonds and denim.\n\nIn September  2020,  the  House  reached  a  new milestone in its development plan for China, opening its  fourth  store  in  the  country  in  one  of  the  most luxurious  department  stores  in  the  world:  Beijing's SKP. Boucheron chose a strategic location with access to an outdoor terrace, allowing the House to open its own tea salon. Inspired by the Jardin d'Hiver at 26 Place Vend\u00f4me,  the  new  boutique  echoes  the  Parisian space,  embarking  clients  on  a  journey  through  the French art of living. More than just a boutique, visitors to the SKP space can also taste or take away p\u00e2tisseries created by a French pastry chef.\n\nTo  celebrate  this  cross-cultural  bridge  between  Paris and  Beijing,  the  House  unveiled  its From  Paris  to Beijing campaign  in  October  2020,  in  collaboration with Chinese illustrator Leo K. The campaign features Wladimir,  Boucheron's  iconic  cat,  and  the  talented Chinese actress Zhou Dongyu, an ambassador for the House since 2018.\n\nThe  high  jewelry  collection Contemplation traveled  to Beijing  for  the  opening  of  the  new  Boucheron boutique  at  SKP.  The  creations  then  continued  their world tour, presented at events organized in Shanghai, Tokyo  and  Hong  Kong  in  October,  before  returning home at 26 Place Vend\u00f4me in Paris.\n\nOn  November  6,  2020,  Boucheron  revealed  the six  faces  of  its  year-end  campaign Sharing  Holiday Emotions ,  ending  the  year  on  a  woman-empowered, emotional note.  In  line  with  the  House's  ambition  to develop  its  brand  awareness  on  the  international markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, actresses Dongyu Zhou and Jung Eun-Chae, model and designer Alexa  Chung,  model  and  social  influencer  Rola  and entrepreneurs Nour Arida and Hannah Quinlivan came together  to  portray  the  six  faces  of  Boucheron's femininity. These six women are all unique - yet have plenty  in  common:  with  their  elegance  and  attitude, their  careers  and  their  life  choices,  they  are  the epitome of Boucheron style.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  House  presented  a  new  high jewelry collection, Histoire  de  style,  Art  D\u00e9co ,  in  honor of  the  period  that  had  such  a  great  influence  on artistic  movements.  In  creating  this  new  collection, Claire  Choisne  was  inspired  by  Boucheron's  vast archives, while adding a pure and contemporary spin.",

During the year, Pomellato kept boosting brand recognition with targeted digital, public  relations  and  product  activities.

In March, alarmed by the upsurge  of  domestic  violence  during  lockdown, Pomellato leveraged the Pomellato for Women platform  to  launch  an  awareness  and  crowdfunding campaign  to  help  anti-domestic  violence  centers  in Italy.\n\nPomellato  also  introduced Fantina , a brand-new collection leveraging the brand's goldsmithing expertise  and  consolidating  the  architecture  of  its products by upscaling its pillar collections, investing in the gold segment and increasing stackability.\n\nWith an eye towards the future, Pomellato has further invested  in  sustainability  and  social  responsibility. Since 2018, the brand has achieved 100% responsible gold sourcing. Pomellato also continued its partnership  with  the  Galdus  Goldsmith  Academy, established  in  2018.  Known  as Pomellato  Virtuosi ,  it provides  programs,  seminars  and  apprenticeships  to promising young local artisans in Milan with the aim of safeguarding craftsmanship.\n\nIn  2021,  Pomellato  plans  to  boost  its  presence  and visibility in China and other Asian markets. In addition, the House will further invest in brand communications,  especially  by  reaching  out  globally toward a wider audience of younger clients with digital media. As for products, the brand will continue to roll out its pillar strategy, celebrate the 20 th anniversary of Nudo ,  its  most  iconic  collection,  and  build  on  the success of La Gioia.\n\nFollowing  its  international  expansion,  at  the  end  of 2020, Pomellato had a distribution network spanning 52  directly  operated  stores,  11  franchise  boutiques and approximately 500 wholesale doors.",

The House  takes  its  name  from  the  legendary  bird  of Mauritius. A symbol of precious moments, DoDo loves Mother  Nature,  promotes  inclusivity  and  celebrates self-expression.\n\nDoDo  is  the  jeweler  for  the  modern  girl,  offering charming collections of delicate and small handmade creations that match  her cool chic style. Its composable  jewelry  is  designed  to  be  mixed  and matched, multiplied and played with.\n\nIn  2020,  DoDo  started  its  evolution  from  its  very successful niche position in the charms business to a broader positioning as the leader of charming jewelry.\n\nThe  launch  of  the  new Bollicine collection  in  January marked this important milestone.\n\nIn  terms  of  communication and product launches, in 2020, DoDo focused on its core values, with a strong commitment to  sustainability  in  particular.  In  March, the brand introduced its new Bee charm to celebrate World  Bee  Day  in  May.  In  June,  in  line  with  its commitment  to  the  environment,  DoDo  launched  a partnership with Tenaka to restore 1,000 sq.m of coral reef  in  Malaysia  along  with  a  limited-edition  bracelet made in recycled plastic, which became the symbol of this project and quickly sold out.\n\nThe  brand  also  invested  in  a  special  project, Italian Pride , to show heart and pride towards Italy during the difficult months of the COVID-19 crisis. As part of this\n\nproject,  DoDo  launched  four  iconic  charms  with  the colors  of  the  Italian  flag  and  a  communication campaign using the voices of a nurse, a teacher, a chef and  personalities  from  the  art  and  music  industry united in a message of solidarity.\n\nIn  2020,  DoDo  also  enriched  its  iconic  collection Granelli with  a  new  delicate  design,  confirming  the line's  success,  and  launched  a  new  collection, Pepita , in  November, taking  inspiration  from  an  iconic  DoDo component and turning it into a complete jewelry line.\n\nIn 2021, DoDo will continue to build on its new brand positioning  by  rolling  out  a  fully  refreshed  customer journey.  It  will  include  a  new  store  environment,  in retail  and  wholesale,  a  new  advertising  campaign,  a new  website  and  a  360\u00b0  communication  platform aimed at encouraging people to share common values in DoDo  communities, from the DoDo  Planet community, to LGBTQ+ and Italian Pride . The brand will establish  four  product  pillars, Granelli,  Nodo,  Stellina and Bollicine , and  will  leverage  them  to  reach  new audiences  with  new,  modern,  ready-to-wear  and personalizable jewelry. The  charms'  novelty  will sustain the brand's storytelling, focusing on key DoDo themes, and limited edition pieces. This omni-channel approach will enhance brand awareness and presence in  Europe  while  maintaining  a  leading  position  in Italy.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  DoDo  distribution  network included  24  directly  operated  stores,  26  franchise boutiques and 526 authorized dealers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since the brand's creation in 2004, every piece of jewelry has carried rich cultural connotations,  reinterpreting  traditional  symbols  with stylish designs that infuse new life and contemporary meaning into Chinese heritage.\n\nNamed after the Qilin ,  an auspicious Chinese mythical animal  and  icon  of  love,  Qeelin  fuses  unbridled creativity with excellence in craftsmanship, bringing a touch of playfulness and surprise into the world of fine jewelry.\n\nThe brand's iconic Wulu collection revisits the legendary  Chinese  gourd,  an  auspicious  symbol  of good  fortune  and  positive  energy  in  the  country's traditional  culture.  Its  contemporary  lines  echo  the curves of the cherished number 8.\n\nQeelin's  other  two  pillar  collections  are Yu  Yi and Bo Bo . Yu Yi is inspired by the ruyi lock, or lock of good wishes, a traditional Chinese symbol of protection and spiritual  potency  representing  a  modern  fulfiller  of dreams.  Inspired  by  the  panda,  China's  national treasure, Qeelin's Bo Bo has many  endearing expressions.  Named  after  the  Chinese  word bao meaning 'precious', Bo Bo conveys the priceless value of childhood innocence and curiosity.\n\nPerpetuating Chinese culture is Qeelin's most distinctive ambition, through exquisite jewelry intended for daily wear, embracing the fashion trends of  new  generations  and  shining  a  light  on  Chinese culture in the world of luxury.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Qeelin had a distribution network of  31  boutiques  and  store-in-store  points  of  sale globally, of which 28 located in Greater China and 20 in Mainland  China.  The  brand  expanded  its  presence  in Mainland  China  during  the  year,  with  the  opening  of three new directly operated stores, in Shanghai Sogo, Wuxi  Centre  66  and  Nanjing  Deji,  as  well  as  new wholesale  points  of  sale  in  Shanghai  New  World, Fuzhou Taihe and Zhengzhou David Mall.\n\nIn terms of communications, 2020 was marked by the appointment of two new ambassadors for the brand: the top-tier award-winning Chinese actress Liu Shishi as  the  new  brand  ambassador  and  young  Chinese actor  Chen  Feiyu  as  the  millennial  ambassador.  Liu Shishi  is  widely  recognized  among  mainland  Chinese and  regional  consumers  and  has  helped  to  increase both the awareness and prestige of Qeelin. Chen Feiyu has helped to strengthen Qeelin's visibility among the important  millennial  and  gen-Z  consumer  bases  and convey a message of youthful vitality and playful spirit.\n\nIn August,  Qeelin  launched  a  very  well-received Powerful  Love communications  campaign  as  part  of the Qixi festival. This campaign included digital assets and  setting  up  pop-up  installations  in  three  key locations  in  China:  Sanya  Haitang  Bay  International Shopping  Complex,  Guangzhou  Taikoo  Hui  Mall  and Chengdu IFS Mall.\n\nIn 2020, the brand also launched new products across its three key collections Wulu , Yu Yi and Bo Bo .\n\nQeelin  expanded  its Wulu collection,  with  new Wulu rings  in  a  variety  of  striking  colors  and  a  new Double Wulu collection,  as  well  as  launching  the  brand-new Yu Yi collection featuring a modern outline design with elegant diamond edging. Two new products were also added  to  the Bo  Bo family  this  year,  emphasizing Qeelin's unique micro-craftsmanship. The Bo Bo Mouse holding a spinning Chinese coin brought a message of prosperity for the Chinese New Year and the Christmas Guimi  Bo  Bo is  a  tribute  to  the  positive  energy  of friendship.\n\nIn 2021,  Qeelin  will  continue  to  accelerate  the expansion of its footprint in Greater China, as well as develop new collaborations to increase brand awareness and promote its commitments to corporate social responsibility.",

        "page_content": "Girard-Perregaux  traces  its  origins  back  to  1791, spanning 230 years of watchmaking history. The brand is  one of the oldest Swiss watch Manufactures still in operation  today,  distinguished  by  legendary  watches that bridge technical mastery and iconic design, such as  the  renowned Tourbillon  with  Three  Gold  Bridges . The  latter  won  a  gold  medal  at  the  Paris  Universal Exhibition  and  has  featured  in  the  brand's  catalogue ever since.\n\n## Girard-Perregaux has been part of Kering since 2011.\n\nTrue  to  its  roots,  the  Girard-Perregaux  Manufacture remains in La Chaux-de-Fonds, in Western Switzerland, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The brand has  proudly  retained  its  Manufacture  status  by mastering all the required horological skills in-house. From design and development to production, finishing and assembling, the brand's comprehensive expertise reflects  generations of relentless effort in the pursuit of technical mastery and iconic artistry.\n\nToday, Girard-Perregaux is a brand with unique appeal to  true  watch  connoisseurs.  Innovation  remains  a hallmark of the Swiss Manufacture, as Girard-Perregaux continuously  reinvents  its  icons,  as  shown  by  its launches throughout 2020. At the start of the year, the brand  presented  a  new  interpretation  of  its Tourbillon with Three Gold Bridges , the Quasar Light . This masterpiece  features  gleaming  aerial  views  of  the\n\nManufacture's  most  iconic  movement,  encased  in Swiss-made  sapphire,  exclusively  available  in  just 18 pieces.\n\nLater  in  2020,  Girard-Perregaux  took  over  the  city  on the occasion of the Geneva Watch Days. Several luxury brands also took part in this initiative, which aimed to showcase the City of Geneva and also highlight the art of  watchmaking  on  which  its  reputation  is  founded. This  was  the  only  multi-brand  industry  gathering  to take  place  in  2020,  as  Baselworld  and  Watches  & Wonders Geneva were both cancelled. Over the course of  the  four-day  event,  Girard-Perregaux  unveiled  its latest  collection  in  a  pop-up  boutique,  created  with the theme of 'Infinity' in mind. This space featured a deep black background marked by rose gold touches with  angular  blade  shaped  elements  throughout, abstractly  refencing  the  brand's  contemporary  visual universe, which is echoed across the Infinity collection timepieces.\n\nGirard-Perregaux  timepieces  are  distributed  through an exclusive but global distribution network. In 2020, Girard-Perregaux  reinforced  its  relationship  with  key commercial  partners  by  deploying  a  new  retail concept, brand ambassador program and an enhanced phygital customer experience. To that end, the brand also introduced a new website and product campaign to  support  two  of  its  key  pillars,  the Bridges and Laureato collections.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The House has written some of the finest chapters in the history of Haute Horlogerie , from its  first  marine  chronometer  designed  for  sailors around the world in 1876, to the launch of the Freak in 2001.  Ulysse  Nardin  has  been  part  of  Kering  since 2014.\n\nA  pioneer  of  cutting-edge  technologies  and  the innovative use of materials like silicon, Ulysse Nardin is one of the few Swiss watchmakers with the in-house expertise to produce its own high-precision components and movements. This exceptional level of watchmaking  excellence  has  earned  the  House membership  of  the  most  exclusive  circle  of  Swiss watchmakers,  the Fondation  de  la  Haute  Horlogerie . Today, from its manufacturing sites in Le Locle and La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland, the brand's continuing quest  for  horological  perfection  centers  around  two pillars:  the  collections  dedicated  to  the  marine  world ( Marine and Diver ) and  the  singular,  disruptive X collections ( Executive and Freak ).\n\nIn  January  2019,  Ulysse  Nardin  launched  the Freak  X and Skeleton X watches, once again breaking traditional  watchmaking  codes.  The X collections reveal the inner design and mechanics of the watches, with a price positioning accessible to a younger client base,  especially  in  China.  The  X  factor  stands  for disruption  and  addresses  those  who  dare  to  be\n\ndifferent.  In  2020,  the  X  saga  continued  with  the launch  of  the Blast ,  an  automatic  tourbillon  skeleton model  with  the  X  code  integrated  in  its  design.  The Blast is set to be as iconic as the Freak . The House will celebrate  its  175 th anniversary  in  2021  with  new releases  as  well  as  limited  editions  in  its Marine collection, honoring its marine heritage.\n\nDuring  the  year,  Ulysse  Nardin  pursued  its  retail expansion  strategy,  opening  new  stores  in  Dubai, Shanghai and Chengdu, all  with  the  same  bright  and airy  architectural  design  based  on  a  metaphorical representation  of  the  sea,  the  horizon  and  the  sky. Renovations are planned at the Moscow flagship store in early 2021.\n\nThe  evolution  of  its  physical  network  was  matched with a digital transformation. Ulysse Nardin accelerated  the  deployment  of  its  e-commerce  site during the first wave of the pandemic, with a strategy focused  on  a  strong  social  media  presence  and personalized client engagement initiatives.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Ulysse Nardin showed its support for the sailors participating in the Vend\u00e9e Globe as the race's official timekeeper. This solo, non-stop, unassisted sailing race around the world is the height of adventure, bravery and the desire to explore - just like  for  Ulysses  in  the  legend.  Closely  followed  by  the world's media, the sailors - three of whom are wearing Diver watches  -  set  off  at  the  start  of  November  and arrived in early 2021.",

Thanks  to  a  strong  group  of  talented  and skilled people, Kering Eyewear directly manages design and  product  development,  supply  chain,  commercial and  distribution  strategies,  as  well  as  sales  and marketing, thus allowing tight control over the whole value chain.\n\nKering  Eyewear's  first  collection  was  unveiled  on June  30,  2015,  for  11  of  Kering's  Houses  and,  since then,  more brands have been added to the portfolio, starting  with  Gucci,  for  which  the  first  collection  was presented in October 2016.\n\nIn  March  2017,  Kering  and  Richemont  announced  a partnership agreement for the development, manufacturing  and  worldwide  distribution  of  the Maison Cartier and Ala\u00efa eyewear categories, resulting in  Richemont  becoming  a  shareholder  of  Kering Eyewear.\n\nIn  January  2019,  the  Company  added  to  its  portfolio Montblanc and Balenciaga - the  last  Kering  brand  at the  time  with  an  eyewear  category  not  managed  by Kering Eyewear.\n\nIn summer 2020, Kering Eyewear announced two new partnership  agreements,  starting  from  January  2021, for the development of the Chlo\u00e9 and Dunhill eyewear categories, consolidating its leadership in the high-end segment and reinforcing its partnership with the Richemont Group. As a result, Kering Eyewear now designs,  develops  and  distributes  a  complete  and well-balanced portfolio of 15 brands.\n\nSince  its  creation,  Kering  Eyewear  has  been  a  telling example  of  disruption  in  a  historically  consolidated industry.  It  is  now  a  fully  established  and  recognized eyewear  company  with  a  unique  approach,  a  strong reputation  in  the  market  and  a  commitment  to creating  long-lasting  and  valuable  partnerships  with brands, suppliers and clients.\n\nAs  the  leading  luxury  company  in  eyewear,  Kering Eyewear has built an innovative business model that is able  to  anticipate  and  embrace  all  the  challenges  of this relevant and growing industry.\n\nThe Company relies on a fast and agile decision-making process as well as a close collaboration with the brands to create synergies and generate  incremental  business  growth  in  'shared channels',  such  as  brand  boutiques,  travel  retail, department  stores,  multi-brand  fashion  specialists and e-tailers.\n\nKering  Eyewear  works  together  with  the  Creative Directors  of  each  brand  in  order  to  preserve  the  DNA and  aesthetic  code  of  each  individual  House  when developing its eyewear, while maintaining a focus on innovation  in  terms  of  design  and  materials.  As  a result, the eyewear collections are always fully in line with the Houses' calendars and needs.\n\nAlong  with  design,  strong  attention  is  also  paid  to sustainability: through the research and development of  increasingly  sustainable  materials,  Kering  Eyewear is  committed  to  reducing  its  environmental  footprint and  has  published  its  Environmental  Profit  &  Loss (EP&L) since 2017.\n\nFrom  a  manufacturing  standpoint,  Kering  Eyewear's strategy is based on production flexibility working only with  the  best  manufacturers  in  the  world  and selecting production capabilities globally, guaranteeing  product  excellence  and  the  highest quality  standards  in  the  industry.  The  Company  has thus been able to establish strong relationships with a selected  number  of  suppliers  located  mainly  in  Italy, France, Japan and the Far East.\n\nUnder  the  deal  with  Maison  Cartier,  the  production plant  Manufacture  Kering  Eyewear,  previously  known as Manufacture Cartier Lunettes, located in Sucy-en-Brie (France), was included in and contributed  to  Kering  Eyewear.  This  one-of-a-kind plant is equipped with best-in-class technologies and machinery  as  well  as  undisputed  expertise  in  solid gold, horn and wood manufacturing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Above  all,  the  Group's responsibility as an employer came into play throughout the year, with the implementation of strict health and  hygiene  measures  and  protocols  to guarantee  and  protect  the  health  and  safety  of  our employees,  clients  and  suppliers,  which  was  Kering's first  priority  worldwide.  Our  other  overriding  concern was to protect jobs and maintain wages, and to provide support and assistance to Group employees as remote working took hold and modes of interaction changed. Outside the Group, Kering addressed the impact of the pandemic on its suppliers and, more broadly, on local communities  and  civil  society  by  organizing  support initiatives, making  donations  and  participating  in numerous  collective  efforts,  including  the  production of masks by the Group's Houses.\n\nIn times of crisis, Kering's responsibility to society also prevents  it  from  slowing  its  ambitions  and  measures taken  to  build  an  increasingly  diverse  and  inclusive Group  committed  to  the  culture  of  equality  that underpins  individual  and  collective  success.  This  is demonstrated  by  the  ambitious  action  plans  set  in motion during 2020 - not least of which the Diversity & Inclusion Committees set up within the Group's Houses -building on the many commitments and collaborations already in place for many years. For its part, the Kering Foundation has pursued its commitment  to  combating  violence  against  women throughout the year. It published a policy on domestic violence  in  coordination  with  the  Group's  Human Resources  Department,  following  on  from  its  support for  the  approval  of  International  Labour  Organization (ILO)  Convention  190  on  violence  and  harassment  in the workplace.\n\nThe crisis  also  provided  confirmation  that  the  Group's ambitions  in  terms  of  sustainability  in  general  and environmental  protection  in  particular are more relevant than ever. Indeed, it reinforced and intensified the transformation already underway in those areas. At a time when COVID-19 provides a stark reminder of the link  between  nature  conservation,  human  health  and economic  development,  Kering  has  rounded  out  its climate  strategy  with  the  adoption  of  a  biodiversity strategy  to  define  and  structure  the  Group's  approach to conservation, and has created the Kering Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  to  steer  its  action programs  and  achieve  a  net  positive  impact  by  2025. From  the  signing  of  the  Science  Based  Targets  for Nature commitment to the work carried out to include the  product  use  and  end-of-life  phases  in  the  EP&L (Environmental  Profit  &  Loss  account),  the  Group's flagship  environmental  management  tool,  and  the publication of the first results and commitments of the Fashion  Pact,  the  coalition  created  in  2019  at  the initiative of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  of  Kering,  it  is  clear  that  2020, exceptional  as  it  was,  in  no  way  undermined  the Group's  efforts  or  commitments  in  favor  of  a  more sustainable and responsible future. On the contrary, it made these efforts and commitments more critical and pressing than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  full report was also released via Kering's website.\n\nKering  published  its  biodiversity strategy and introduced a conservation  approach  aimed  at achieving  a  net  positive  impact by  2025,  notably  through  the Kering Regenerative  Fund  for Nature  to  support  the  transition to regenerative agriculture.\n\nKering  shared  the  results  of  its EP&L  for  2019,  which  show  that the  Group  is  on  track  to  achieve its goal  of  reducing  its  EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025 (compared  with  2015).  To  date, the  Group  has  been  able  to reduce its EP&L intensity by 29% as  expressed  in  monetary  terms (on  a pro  forma basis).  Going forward,  the  EP&L  for  2020  will cover the entire lifecycle, with the inclusion of the product use and end-of-life phases.\n\nKering has had a dedicated Diversity  &  Inclusion  (D&I)  team since 2019, and was able to draw up  a  global  strategy  and  launch an action plan to promote these major  themes  across  the  entire Group, thanks in large part to the establishment of D&I Committees in each of the Houses in 2020.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Kering  Foundation drafted  and  published  a  global policy  on  domestic  violence  in coordination  with  the  Group's Human  Resources  Department. The policy guarantees appropriate and confidential support to victims of  domestic  violence  within  the Group.\n\nFounded  in  November  2019,  the IFM  -  Kering  Sustainability  Chair celebrated its first anniversary with the announcement of the creation of  a  training  course  specializing in sustainable fashion. The course will  enable  master's  students  to acquire  all  the  knowledge  and skills required to promote sustainability  in  the  fashion  and luxury industry.\n\nFor the eighth consecutive year, Kering was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index (DJSI Europe). In Corporate Knights' 2021 Global 100 ranking, Kering featured among the world's ten most sustainable corporations, leading the ranking in the textile, apparel and accessories sector for the fourth year running.\n\nWith  the  global  COVID-19  health crisis, the Human Resources teams of Kering and its Houses worldwide took countless initiatives to support and assist employees, guaranteeing their  health  and  safety  while preserving the Group's activities.\n\nKering  signed  the  Science  Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) commitment and joined the program  of  the  same  name dedicated to businesses: alongside other groups and coalitions, the program will provide the  SBTN  with  essential  scientific data  and  be  an  open  forum  for exchanging  best  practices  and experience.",

Since 2013, this approach has allowed Kering to identify the key challenges matching its vision and its activities (based on their economic, environmental and  social  impacts),  and  also  to  grasp  the  related governance  issues  and  the  assessment  made  by  the Group's key stakeholders.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kering consulted its stakeholders around the world in 2020 in order to update  its  materiality  assessment,  first published  in  2014.  In  2018,  Kering  aligned  its  matrix with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n## 1.4.1.1 Materiality assessment methodology and stakeholder consultation procedure\n\nTo  better  grasp  the  Group's  challenges  and  the expectations  of  its  stakeholders,  Kering  conducted  a three-step  materiality  assessment,  drawing  on  the various existing guidelines for stakeholder engagement (GRI,  AA1000,  ISO  26000).  A  steering  committee  made up  of  members  from  the  Group's  main  functional departments  was  mobilized  throughout  the  project, which  was  carried  out  with  the  support  of  a  team  of independent consultants.\n\n## 1. Identification of issues\n\nThe  map  of  issues  -  CSR,  strategic,  economic  and operational - was updated on the basis of an in-depth documentary  review:  international  benchmarks  (GRI, TCFD, SASB, IIRC, UN SDGs, UN GC, etc.), rating agencies assessments,  investor  questions,  Group  news  and press  releases,  major  trends,  internal  surveys  and\n\nstudies.  An  initial  exhaustive  longlist  of  issues  was then refined for greater clarity, resulting in a shortlist of 28 issues on which stakeholders were consulted.\n\n## 2. Stakeholder consultation and assessment of issues\n\nThis stage combined a quantitative study conducted at an international level, with strategic interviews of nearly 70  internal  and  external  stakeholders  representing the  main  categories  of  stakeholders  with  which  the Group  and  its  Houses  interact  (investors,  suppliers and  business  partners,  distributors  and  clients,  civil society,  local  communities  and  NGOs,  academics, public  authorities  and  regulators,  peers,  professional organizations and actors of innovation). The strategic interviews  mainly  involved  members  of  the  executive management of Kering and its Houses.\n\nEach  issue  was  subject  to  a  dual  assessment:  first by  external  stakeholders,  and  second  by  internal stakeholders (management, functional departments). In the  spirit  of  dynamic  materiality,  it  was  also  proposed that  developments  affecting  the  various  issues  be assessed (i) with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) after a period of ten years.\n\n## 3. Ranking and consolidation of results\n\nThe last stage was devoted to consolidating, analyzing and sharing the results. It was decided to give the issues and  responses  equal  weight  between  stakeholder categories. The  data  gleaned  from  the  strategic interviews  was  used  to  enrich  the  quantitative  results, and confirmed the preponderance of certain challenges - and notably their importance for Kering. Kering's 2020 materiality  matrix  thus  includes  28  issues  with  high overall  importance,  broken  down  into  four  categories: planet,  people  (labor  relations  and  societal  issues), profit (business) and governance. Arranging these issues in  a  three-level  hierarchy  provides  useful  information allowing  the  Group  to  better  understand,  manage  and prioritize  its  actions  in  the  short  and  medium  term (the coming three years).\n\n## 1.4.1.2 Graphical representation and analysis of results\n\nThe  results  of  the  materiality  matrix  confirm  that Kering's  strategic  pillars  defined  in  the  2025  strategy and its  business  model,  as  well  as  the  commitments made  in  2020,  are  consistent  with  the  expectations of  external  stakeholders.  The  qualitative  interviews conducted  served  to  enrich  the  analysis  by  allowing weak signals  and  emerging  issues  to  be  looked  at  in greater depth, and by shedding light on the perceived impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  issues  and major trends in the short, medium and long term.\n\nAccording to the stakeholder consultation, the pandemic has been an accelerating factor, bringing to the forefront issues that have emerged as important in recent years, especially biodiversity and  climate change,  and  driving  the  need  for  faster  action. Employee well-being also stands out as a strong focus for businesses in the context of the pandemic and the development of new ways of working. In a longer term perspective,  stakeholders  identified  four  issues  that are  gaining  in  importance:  biodiversity,  sustainable procurement and responsible supplier relations, employee well-being, and cybersecurity.",

The approach as a whole and, in general,  all  aspects  relating  to  risks,  are  presented  in Chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRisks  relating  to  the  categories  included  in  the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) as defined  in  Article L. 225-102-1  of  the  French Commercial  Code  -  environment,  social/societal, human  rights,  corruption  and  tax  evasion  -  are accordingly an integral part of the Group's overall risk\n\nidentification  and  management  process,  and  as  such are described in Chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document. The Sustainability Department is involved in the process of identifying and classifying the risks that fall within its scope.\n\nThis  risk  assessment  extends  beyond  the  scope  of Kering's  operations  and  covers  the  entire  value  chain from  the  supply  of  raw  materials  to  the  use  of products made by the Group's Houses, fully consistent with  the  materiality  matrix  and  other  analytical  work conducted by Kering, including the EP&L.\n\nAs  a  result,  nine  principal  risks  out  of  the  NFIS categories  have  been  identified,  for  which  all  policies and  actions  implemented  within  the  Group,  the outcomes  obtained  and  the  related  performance indicators are detailed in this NFIS.\n\n## Policies and projects implemented, outcomes and performance indicators\n\n| Risk                                                           |                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employment standards                                           | See 'Supporting our employees'                                                                                    |\n|                                                                | See 'Working conditions in our supply chains'                                                                     |\n| Talent management                                              | See 'Supporting our employees'                                                                                    |\n|                                                                | See 'Community impact and preservation of know-how'                                                               |\n| Climate change, other natural                                  | See 'Strategy and management' and 'Carbon emissions'                                                              |\n| or man - made risks                                            | See 'EP&L'                                                                                                        |\n| Raw materials scarcity, quality  and biodiversity              | See 'Strategy and management', 'Land use and protection  of biodiversity', and 'Sustainable use of raw materials' |\n| Product quality and safety,  consumer health                   | See 'Risk management: product quality control, and consumer  health and safety'                                   |\n| Ethics and global governance                                   | See 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business'                                                                     |\n|                                                                | See 'Animal welfare'                                                                                              |\n|                                                                | See 'Stakeholder dialogue'                                                                                        |\n| Human rights and fundamental  freedoms                         | See 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business', 'Duty of care plan'  and 'Protection of human rights'              |\n|                                                                | See 'Supporting our employees'                                                                                    |\n|                                                                | See 'Working conditions in our supply chains'                                                                     |\n| Fraud and corruption                                           | See 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business'                                                                     |\n| Compliance with national tax laws  and international standards | See Chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document                                                             |",

The strategy rests on three pillars:\n\n## CARE for the planet\n\n- \u00b7 Use resources within the ' planetary boundaries ',  with a science-based approach in order to reduce carbon emissions from Kering's business activities by 50% in Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (1) of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol by 2025 (2) .\n\n## COLLABORATE with people\n\n## CREATE new business models\n\n- \u00b7 Further  address  all  supply  chain  environmental  impacts  with  the  goal  of reducing  Kering's Environmental  Profit  and  Loss  (EP&L) account  by  at  least  40%,  including  the  remaining  carbon emissions (3) , as well as water consumption, water and air pollution, waste production and land use.\n- \u00b7 Create  a  Supplier  Sustainability  Index  and  ensure  Kering's  high standards for  raw  materials  and processes are implemented by all suppliers by 2025, which also raises the bar on traceability , animal welfare, use of chemicals and working conditions.\n- \u00b7 Promote sustainable design and minimize the environmental impact of products at every stage, from sourcing and manufacturing to transportation and consumer use, and create an open source tool to assess products based on Kering's standards.\n- \u00b7 Establish a Materials Innovation Lab (MIL) focused on Watches and Jewelry (4) ,  following on from the success of Kering's MIL for fabrics and textiles in offering access to sustainable alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Expand offsetting commitments to include a new 'insetting' approach to ensure that actions across the supply chain contribute toward protecting biodiversity and developing local communities.\n- \u00b7 Support the continuation of craftsmanship traditions and the communities that support them.\n- \u00b7 Extend focus across the supply chain and improve community livelihoods  where  raw  materials  are sourced.\n- \u00b7 Develop  an  industry-leading  performance  metric  system  that  will measure achievement  of  the  UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 Leverage current partnerships with  leading universities and  continue  to  develop  collaborations  to identify sustainability solutions.\n- \u00b7 Amplify forward-thinking employment practices ,  including  the  global  parental  policy  launched on January 1, 2017, a well-being at work policy in 2018, and an employee benefits policy by 2020.\n- \u00b7 Achieve gender parity in all positions and business lines and at all hierarchical levels of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Establish  sponsorship  and  mentoring  programs,  and  develop  innovative career  paths for  all employees.\n- \u00b7 Aim to be the preferred employer in the luxury sector.\n- \u00b7 Invest in disruptive innovations that can transform conventional processes in Luxury, and influence the industry.\n- \u00b7 Develop  new  and  sustainable  solutions  for  sourcing  raw  materials,  including  exploring  biotech  and promoting a circular economy through turning recycled textiles into new clothing.\n- \u00b7 Scale up an internal purchasing platform to provide access to high quality, sustainable raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Stimulate and enable innovation to translate vision into action through strong internal governance .\n- \u00b7 Establish a Young Leaders Advisory Group for inspired ideas.\n- (1) Emissions from upstream transportation and distribution, business air travel and fuel- and energy-related emissions in Scope 3.\n- (2) Kering updated its Science Based Target (SBT) in 2020 to align it with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n- (3) All Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services all the way back to raw materials at Tier 4.\n- (4) Created in 2020 under the name Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL).\n\n<!-- image -->",

More  specifically,  while  Kering  can contribute directly or indirectly in variable proportions to each of the 17 SDGs, there are 12 SDGs for which it can have a more significant impact than elsewhere.\n\nKey:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResults above expected performance to date\n\nResults at expected performance to date\n\nResults below expected performance to date\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKering  published  its  first-ever  Sustainability  Progress Report  in  early  2020,  providing  a  detailed  update  on the progress made within each of the strategy's three pillars.  The  table  below  shows  the  progress  made  to the end of 2020.\n\nIn  October  2020,  the  first  progress  report  on  the Fashion Pact - the coalition of fashion brands set up in  2019  -  was  published  and  presented  at  the Copenhagen Fashion Summit. It sets out the members' initial  progress  on  a  number  of  fronts,  including reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  the  use  of plastic,  the  transition  to  raw  materials  with  lower climate impact and the shift to renewable energies, as well as commitments in favor of biodiversity and the prevention  of  deforestation.  The  report  also  sets  out seven strategic tangible targets focusing on the Pact's three  pillars  -  climate,  biodiversity  and  the  oceans  and a dashboard of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to  measure  their  impact.  In  2020,  the  coalition  also implemented an operations structure, with a Steering Committee bringing together the CEOs of the member brands  and  an  Operations  Committee  of  Chief Sustainability  Officers.  These  Committees  met  four times in 2020.",

More  than  20  specialists,  who  report  to  the Chief  Sustainability  Officer  and  Head  of  International Institutional  Affairs,  a  member  of  the  Executive Committee, assist the Houses with the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy by systematically looking for potential synergies and continuous improvement. In addition, each House has at least one Sustainability  Lead  and  for  the  larger  Houses,  entire Sustainability teams. As a result, Kering's Sustainability team numbers more than 60 people.\n\nThe Group has developed an internal network dedicated to  sustainability,  known  as  the  Sustainability  Network Meeting (SNM). The SNM meets online every six weeks to present  the  Group's  developments  in  the  field,  share best  practices  internally  and  spur  thinking  on  new issues, sometimes with the help of external professionals  and  experts.  In  2020,  the  SNM  focused on  biodiversity,  e-commerce,  green  fashion  shows, human rights and innovation.\n\nThe  network  also  meets  face-to-face  every  year  on  the sidelines of a two-day Sustainability Network Conference (SNC),  enabling  participants  to  broaden  their  reach beyond the teams dedicated to sustainability. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SNC was held online in 2020. It brought together more than 100 participants from all the Houses'  sectors  of  activity,  and  heard  talks  by  Kering Director  Emma  Watson,  Inna  Modja,  a  Malian  singer, model  and  actress  and  Land  Ambassador  for  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and Dr.  M.  Sanjayan,  Director  General  of  NGO  Conservation International.  Work  and  discussions  at  SNC  2020 focused  mostly  on  the  concept  of  'regeneration'  as\n\napplied  to  agriculture,  in  connection  with  the  Group's new  biodiversity  strategy  and  its  approach  to  human rights.\n\nFrom  a  governance  standpoint,  a  Sustainability Committee  was  established  at  Board  level  in  2012. Comprising six Directors (Emma Watson, Chair, Sophie L'H\u00e9lias, Daniela Riccardi, Jean-Pierre Denis, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Palus),  it provides advice on and guides the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nDesignated by the Board of Directors, Sophie L'H\u00e9lias has held the role of Lead Independent Director since February 2019. In coordination with the Chairman, she represents  the  Board  in  its  dealings  with  investors concerning  environmental,  social  and  governance (ESG) matters.\n\nThe  Sustainable  Development  Committee  met  on November 12, 2020. At this annual meeting, it reviewed the 2025 objectives and discussed the Group's policies and  outcomes  in  the  areas  of  climate,  biodiversity, animal  welfare  and  human  rights.  Members  also discussed  the  initiatives  needed  to  strengthen  the mechanisms  for  taking  sustainability  into  account throughout  the  value  chain,  particularly  with  the Group's  suppliers,  and  to  respond  to  investors'  ESG expectations. Practical examples of the implementation of  sustainability  strategies  and  policies  by  the  Houses were  also  presented,  including  Gucci's Off  The  Grid collection and the Balenciaga Summer 2021 Pre-collection. The progress of Fashion Pact members' commitments was also reviewed.\n\nLastly, for the second consecutive year and in response to  growing  interest  for  non-financial  issues  in  the financial  sector,  Kering  once  again  held  an  ESG roadshow in 2020 to present the Group's approach to key investors. Held online in view of the health crisis, it was  organized  with  the  assistance  and  presence  of Sophie L'H\u00e9lias, the Lead Independent Director.",

In  2020,  Kering  was  once  again recognized  as  a  leader  in  its  sector  by  the  principal non-financial rating agencies and rankings.\n\nMain non-financial indices: DJSI World and DJSI Europe (Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Index),  Euronext  Vigeo Eurozone 120, Ethibel Sustainability Index Excellence, MSCI  Global  Sustainability  Indexes,  Oekom  Prime Index, FTSE4Good.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering's  performance  was  also  recognized through places in the following rankings: The 100 Most Sustainably  Managed  Houses  in  the  World  Wall Street  Journal (second  most  innovative  company), Indice  d'Engagement  Soci\u00e9tal -  BrightHouse  and  BCG GAMMA (1/40).\n\nKering's performance in terms of diversity and inclusion continues  to  be  recognized  in  key  benchmarks: Equileap,  Refinitiv  Diversity  &  Inclusion  Index  and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Socially Responsible Investing.\n- (2) The Sustainalytics methodology changed in 2020.\n- (3) 2020 sector averages are only shown when available.",

        "page_content": "## 2 ETHICS, THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR BUSINESS\n\n## 2.1 How we see ethics\n\n## General framework, guiding principles and key commitments\n\nThe strong values embraced by Kering and its Houses are expressed through their products and form a solid basis for trust-based relationships with clients, employees and the Group's stakeholders in general. To ensure that these values permeate its operations and ceaselessly nurture a sustainable climate of trust and successful  performance  across  the  Group,  Kering  is firmly committed to ethical behavior in all its activities and business relationships. Kering is fully aware of its duty to adopt extensive ethical responsibilities and to act  at  Group  and  House  level,  and  with  its  suppliers and  other  business  partners,  in  such  a  way  as  to promote the highest ethical standards in all circumstances, and to resolutely identify and effectively handle any situation likely to involve risk in terms of ethics or respect for human rights.\n\nThis firm commitment starts at the top, with Executive Management  and  the  Sustainability  Committee  of  the\n\nBoard  of  Directors.  To  ensure  this  commitment  is actively taken up throughout the Group and its Houses, Kering draws upon its Code of Ethics, the key document setting  out  the  principles  behind  the  Group's  internal and external actions, and upon a compliance program with  a  dedicated  organization  tasked  with  developing and overseeing implementation, led by the Group Chief Compliance  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the  Group Audit Committee.\n\nThis is tightly integrated into Kering's internal control system,  ensuring  effective  propagation  of  a  strong culture  of  integrity  throughout  the  Group  and  its Houses,  and  providing  all  employees  with  a  solid framework  for  action  along  with  all necessary resources  and  support  to  clarify  any  ethics  issues.  It also  enables  employees  to  confidentially  report  any potential violations, and ensures the prompt and fair treatment  of  any  such  reports.  It  ensures  that  the Group complies with applicable regulatory requirements,  including  French  laws  no.  2016-1691, known as 'Sapin II', and no. 2017-399 on the Duty of Care.\n\n## Organization of ethics and compliance within the Group\n\nThe  Group's  ethics  organization  is  coordinated  and  overseen  by  the  Kering  Executive  Committee,  under  the guidance of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInitially  consisting  of  a  single  body  (the  Ethics  and Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Committee  -  ECSRC, set up in 2005), the ethics organization has since late 2013 drawn on the work of three Ethics Committees, a Group  Committee  and  two  Regional  Committees (Asia-Pacific  and  the  Americas),  thereby  dovetailing with the Group's policy of delegating responsibility to ensure the existence of bodies that can act effectively in  the  light  of  actual  operating  conditions,  within  a shared  reference  framework  applied  throughout  the Group.  Each  of  the  three  Committees  is  made  up  of representatives from Kering and the Group's Houses to ensure  greater  diversity  (nationality,  gender,  position occupied). In 2020, women accounted for 61% of the members  of  these  committees.  These  Committees focus on three main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 to ensure that the Code of Ethics is up to date and that it effectively reaches all Group employees;\n- \u00b7 to  generate  proposals  on  appropriate  updates  to the Code and on the implementation of appropriate behaviors and practices;\n- \u00b7 to process ethics issues reported by Group employees and,  since  January  1,  2018,  by  external  and temporary  staff  working  for  external  partners  or service  providers  under  contract  with  the  Group and/or its  Houses.  Issues  may  be  reported  directly or  by  means  of  an  ethics  hotline.  Kering's  ethics whistleblowing  system  is  described  below  in  the section  entitled  'Whistleblowing  procedure  for reporting unethical conduct'.\n\nEmployees  can  also  call  on  the  Ethics  Committee  of their  choice  to  request  clarification  or  ask  questions on  the  interpretation  of  the  Code,  if  they  are  unsure how to behave in a specific situation.\n\nThe  Compliance  structure,  which  was  put  in  place  in 2015,  is  coordinated  by  a  Group  Chief  Compliance Officer (CCO), responsible for implementing the Group Compliance  Program  as  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors.  Appointed  in  October  2015  by  Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee, an important  factor  given  the  independence  required  of this  function,  and  has  direct  access  to  the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Group Chief Compliance Officer does not hold any other position, and is thus fully dedicated to this function.\n\nTo ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of the Compliance Program, the Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported by (i) a team of five compliance law experts  working  out  of  in  Paris,  Hong  Kong,  Shanghai and Tokyo, (ii) a network of Brand Compliance Officers appointed  by  the  House  CEOs,  and  (iii)  a  network  of Regional  and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  In  some Houses, there are compliance managers in addition to the Brand and Local Compliance Officers.\n\nAs a general rule, the positions held by the Compliance Officers  in  parallel  with  their  compliance  duties  are sufficiently  high-ranking  to  ensure  they  have  the necessary authority and independence.\n\n## 2.2 Implementation throughout the Group and beyond\n\n## Kering's Code of Ethics\n\nSet  out  since  1996  in  the  Group's  first  Ethics  Charter, Kering's ethical principles apply to everyone within the Group and reflect the Group's strong convictions about responsible  business  practices.  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics was  first  introduced  in  2005,  and  underwent  major updates in 2009 and 2013. The latest update, in 2018, was issued to all employees in June 2019. To ensure the fullest possible employee understanding and take-up of Kering's  values  and  ethical  standards,  the  new  version of  the  Code,  reissued  in  2019,  is  now  available  in 14 languages, compared with 9 up until 2018. The latest update focused chiefly on strengthening commitments with regard to personnel and the behavior expected of\n\neveryone, and on Group measures and policies brought in  following  the  introduction  of  new  legislation  and regulations, such as France's Sapin II law. The Suppliers' Charter included in the Code of Ethics was updated at the same time, with particular regard to the question of human  rights.  In  addition,  the  Code  of  Ethics  now extends  to  the  commitments  of  members  of  the Executive Committee as well as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, for the first time, was presented to and reviewed by the Kering Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Code  clearly  sets  out  the  ethical  principles  that should be applied everywhere and by everyone, as well as  the  Group's  values,  what  it  believes  in  and  what  it does not tolerate.",

Sustainability for Kering is not possible without the Code of Ethics, which is used  as  the  sole  set  of  standards  implemented  by  all throughout  the  Group,  regardless  of  their  level  of responsibility, position or location.\n\nThe Code of Ethics is available on the Group's intranet, and on Kering's website for readers outside the Group.\n\n## System for detecting and preventing corruption\n\nKering's  Code  of  Ethics  emphasizes  the  fact  that employees  must  at  all  times  act  with  integrity,  loyalty and  a  sense  of  responsibility.  It  clearly  sets  out  the Group's  commitment  to  zero  tolerance  on  corruption, and  encourages  employees  to  report  any  instance  of corruption.  It  stipulates  the  necessity  of  avoiding conflicts of interest, any risk of which must be promptly identified and resolved.\n\nTo  apply  these  commitments  in  an  effective  way  and ensure full compliance with the stipulations of France's Sapin II law, a map of corruption risks was drawn up in 2017  under  the  supervision  of  the  Group  Chief Compliance  Officer.  The  Group  Chief  Compliance Officer  submitted  the  risk  map  analysis  and  ensuing action  plans  to  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors at the meeting held on June 7, 2017.\n\nIn  2019,  a  new  in-depth  assessment  of  corruption  risks was undertaken across the Group and each of its Houses worldwide. This assessment was run over a period of nine months  by  an  independent  law  firm  working  with  the Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  and  her  teams,  and involved  more  than  242  Group  employees  across  all regions,  functions  and  management  levels.  To  ensure that  the  risk  assessment  was  comprehensive,  each potential  corruption  scenario  relevant  to  the  Group  was identified and assessed after analyzing existing controls. The resulting corruption risks with these scenarios were rated and ranked in a preliminary risk map.\n\nThis risk map will be updated during 2021 to take into account  the  stricter  controls  introduced  in  2020  and the findings of a compliance review undertaken in the Middle East region.\n\n## Steering\n\nIn  2016,  Kering  brought  in  an  anti-corruption  policy, standing  side  by  side  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  to  offer employees  fuller  guidance  in  their  everyday  practices and  ensure  tight  control  over  risks  of  corruption.  This policy,  which  was  updated  in  October  2019  under  an action plan drawn up as a result of the risk map plotted in  2019,  identifies  prohibited  behaviors  and  sets  out guidelines  enabling  employees  to  detect  instances  of corruption and report them to management. The Group Chief  Compliance  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the Audit  Committee,  independently  of  the  Houses  and support functions, is responsible for implementing the anti-corruption policy under the Group's overall Compliance Program. The deployment of the anti-corruption policy is monitored closely by the Audit Committee and Executive Management.\n\nThe  policy  extends  to  specific  procedures  on  the following subjects:\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment\n\nThe procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment sets  out  rules  on  giving  and  receiving  gifts  and invitations to Group events.\n\nPrior written authorization from the relevant Compliance Officer is required whenever a gift or invitation involves a public official or is of significant value.\n\nThe procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment was updated in October 2019.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on third-party due diligence\n\nThis procedure, introduced in October 2015 and updated in  October  2019,  sets  out  the  principles  and  rules applicable  to  the  due  diligence  required  with  regard  to third parties with which the Group is considering entering into  a  business  relationship  (distributors,  direct  and indirect  suppliers,  etc.).  The  degree  of  due  diligence required depends on the objective risk profile of the third party  in  question  and  any  specific  risks  that  may  have been identified during the assessment. In certain cases, compliance  questionnaires  are  sent  to  the  third  parties concerned  requesting  additional  information  for  the purpose of closer diligence.\n\nTo  assist  the  Compliance  Officers  and  other  Group employees  called  upon  to  assess  third  parties  under this  procedure,  Kering  works  with  a  service  provider specializing in third-party due diligence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  is  the  case  for  the  procedure on  third-party  due  diligence,  this  procedure  specifies different degrees of diligence, matched  to the compliance risks identified.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on donations and sponsorship\n\nUnder  a  specific  Group  procedure,  all  donations  and sponsorships  granted  by  the  Group  to  third-party persons or organizations require prior written approval from  the  relevant  Compliance  Officer.  The  procedure was updated in October 2019.\n\nSince  August  22,  2017,  the  Group  has  been  listed  on the register of the French government's Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique ,  and  complies with all ethics requirements stipulated by French law on the matter.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on conflicts of interest\n\nIn  2016,  Kering  brought  in  a  specific  procedure  on conflicts of interest, which requires employees to report any  connections,  relationships  or  other  situations giving rise or that may potentially give rise to a conflict of interest  by  signing  a  specific  declaration  and discussing the situation with their managers.  A campaign is launched each year to collect declarations of  conflicts  of  interests  across  a  target  population  of employees.\n\nSeveral procedures, including that on the involvement of  suppliers  in  the  production  chain,  refer  to  this procedure and invite employees involved in decision-making processes with regard to third parties to report any potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nIn  addition  to  the  anti-corruption  policy  and  related procedures,  the  Group  Compliance  Department  also provides additional advice to Compliance Officers and Group employees through the regular issue of guidelines\n\non  specific  compliance  matters.  Specific  guidelines issued  so  far  cover:  interaction  with  public  officials, third-party  due  diligence,  discounts  granted  to  certain business partners, real estate transactions, consignment, and analysis of gifts, hospitality, donations and sponsorship, etc.\n\n## Whistleblowing procedure for reporting unethical conduct\n\nIntroduced  in  2005,  Kering's  whistleblowing  system was  strengthened  in  2018  to  ensure  full  compliance with France's Sapin II law. It is accessible to all people working  for  the  Group:  employees  and  interns  of  the Group  and  its  Houses,  and  external  and  temporary personnel  working  for  external  partners  or  service providers  under  contract  with  the  Group  and/or  its Houses.\n\nAll  employees  may  use  the  system  to  submit  reports via  their  direct  or  indirect  manager  or  employer,  the Human  Resources  Department,  the  Group  Chief Compliance Officer, the Compliance Officer network or the Ethics Committee. It may be used to report any of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a criminal offense;\n- \u00b7 a serious violation of a law or regulation;\n- \u00b7 conduct or a situation contrary to the Group's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 a threat or serious harm to the general interest.\n\nReports are transferred for processing by the ethics or compliance organization via authorized contact persons who  ensure  the  confidentiality  and  security  of  the information  transferred.  The  contact  persons  are  also responsible for verifying the facts reported.\n\nWhen  a  report  is  submitted,  one  of  the  Ethics Committees  or  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  will contact  the  person  reporting  the  matter  to  request permission  to  contact  the  House  concerned,  specifying that  the  person's  identity  will  remain  confidential  and that the issue will be investigated within three months at most. Kering is committed to protecting whistleblowers, and explicitly  prohibits  any  form  of  reprisal  in  its  ethics policies and procedures. This protection is clearly stated in the annual e-learning module on the Code of Ethics.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3 Promoting and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond\n\n## Propagation of a culture of integrity\n\nA training program on ethics and the related Code was established  for  all  Group  employees  worldwide  and has been implemented throughout Kering since 2014.\n\nAvailable  since  2019  in  14  languages  (as  opposed  to 9  previously),  it  sets  out  the  ethical  ground  rules  in place at Kering, and presents case studies and ethical dilemmas  that  help  employees  ask  themselves  the right  questions.  It  is  updated  annually,  and  covers  all the  principles  upheld  by  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics. The topics covered in 2014 included corruption, fraud, conflicts of interest and  the  confidentiality of information  on  social  media.  In  2015,  the  program covered diversity, corruption, respect for human rights and  protection  of  the  environment.  In  2016,  the themes  of  corruption,  conduct  in  the  workplace, responsible sourcing of raw materials, traceability, and compliance with business confidentiality were highlighted. In 2017, emphasis was once again put on corruption, respect for others, conduct in the workplace  and  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  the sourcing  of  raw  materials.  In  2018,  the  program included  a  specific  focus  on  the  need  to  combat  all forms of harassment.\n\nIn July 2017,  the  Group  launched  a  45-minute e-learning  module  on  anti-corruption,  addressing  all employees.  To  ensure  the  widest  possible  reach,  the module  is  available  in  nine  languages.  It  seeks  to provide employees with a full view of the subject, from (i)  typical  corruption-prone  situations,  (ii)  applicable anti-corruption regulations, and (iii) appropriate behavior  with  regard  to  gifts  and  hospitality,  to (iv) appropriate reactions to facilitation payments, and (v) working with business partners.\n\nFor  greater  clarity  and  efficiency,  the  decision  was made  in  2019  to  merge  the  Ethics  and  Compliance e-learning programs to offer comprehensive one-stop training  in  these  matters  for  all.  In  2019,  the  newly named 'Ethics & Compliance' annual training program therefore provided in-depth coverage of questions of corruption, harassment and sustainable development in the  choices  of  materials  and  products,  and highlighted for all Group personnel, the existence and operation  of  Kering's  ethics  whistleblowing  system. The  2020  edition  covered  four  key  topics:  an  anticorruption module to help employees identify potential  corruption  scenarios,  a  module  on  the environment, with examples to help them understand the meaning of responsible supply chains, a Diversity &\n\nInclusion  module  illustrating  typical  discrimination situations,  and,  for  the  first  time,  a  module  on  the impact of domestic violence in the workplace, to raise awareness  on  the  best  ways  to  react  and  support victims  of  such  violence.  As  in  previous  years, employees were reminded that the Group operates a whistleblowing system. Details were given on why and how  to  apply  it,  and  on  the  Group's  commitment  to protecting  whistleblowers  (by  ensuring  freedom  from reprisals  in  particular)  and  ensuring  confidentiality  in the processing of whistleblowing reports.\n\nThe  Ethics  &  Compliance  training  program  reached 95.09%  of  Kering  employees  worldwide  in  2020, compared with 94.4% in 2019 and 84.9% in 2018.\n\nKering's Compliance  Officers  benefit  from  regular personalized training, and the Group's internal auditors have  been  trained  on  the  key  factors  involved  in assessing  anti-corruption  procedures.  On-site  training courses  are  also  run  to  educate  Group  employees  on corruption  risks.  The  Kering  Compliance  Department trained more than 1,700 employees worldwide in 2020.\n\nAs  well  as  providing  training,  Kering  also  runs  an ongoing program of information and awareness-raising on ethics, addressing employees and managers. All new recruits  are  systematically  issued  with  a  copy  of  the Code  of  Ethics,  and  are  required  to  follow  the  ethics training program for the current year. This sets a sound basis  for  a  culture  of  ethics  and  integrity  from  each employee's earliest days with Kering.\n\nThe  Group's  intranet  includes  an  Ethics  &  Compliance section  in  French  and  English,  giving  ready  access  to policies and procedures, along with a list of compliance managers at the Houses and structures.\n\n## Relationships with business partners\n\nSince  2013,  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  has  included  the Group  Suppliers'  Charter,  which  sets  out  in  detail Kering's specific expectations of its business partners on ethics, social and environmental issues.\n\nFor  any  contractor  of  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses, notwithstanding  any  contractual  clauses,  compliance with  the  Charter  is  a  precondition  of  the  business relationship. The Group requires its suppliers to commit formally to applying high ethical standards themselves and to ensuring the preservation of human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing  the  French  Sapin  II  law,  the  Group's whistleblowing system was also opened to employees of  the  suppliers  and  service  providers  with  which Kering and its Houses have direct business relationships. All suppliers and service providers were informed accordingly. In 2020, Kering decided to take a step further, by organizing a Group-wide communication  campaign  to  reach  the  employees concerned directly.\n\nA plan for reaching the employees of Kering's and its Houses'  direct  suppliers  was  therefore  drawn  up  and rolled  out  in  2020.  Translated  into  15  languages,  the campaign took two forms: a poster to be displayed in relevant  locations  at  supplier  and  service  provider sites, in order to gain the greatest visibility (cafeteria, locker  rooms,  site  entrance,  etc.),  and  a  flyer  to  be given  directly  to  employees.  Both  the  poster  and  the flyer  listed  the  six  key  ethical  principles:  compliance with laws and regulations; prohibition of any form of corruption,  fraud,  money  laundering  or  conflict  of interest;  respect  for  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms;  protection  of  the  health  and  safety  of  all; respect  for  the  integrity  and  dignity  of  all;  and protection of the environment. The level of detail used in the communication was adapted depending on the recipients  to  give  specific  examples  of  what  was expected  in  each  case  (including  in  particular  the refusal of forced labor, the refusal of recruitment fees paid by employees, special attention paid to vulnerable  persons,  access  to  suitable  washroom facilities  and  to  decent  dormitory  conditions,  where applicable, the availability of pay  and  personal documentation, respect for privacy, access to appropriate personal protective equipment, etc.).\n\nAs  well  as  setting  out  the  key  points  requiring compliance  at  all  locations,  both  documents  also reminded  employees  of  the  whistleblowing  system and how to use it.\n\nLastly,  to  provide  all  of  the  employees,  depending on their locations and profiles, with access to documentation  in  their  own  language(s),  an  internet platform  was  developed  allowing  them  to  download documents  in  any  of  the  15  languages  available.  An email information campaign targeting the employees was  also  organized  by  the  Group  Ethics  Committee, with  full  backing  from  the  CEOs  of  all  the  Group's Houses. This information and communication campaign  will  be  renewed  each  year  from  2021,  to cover  all  new  suppliers  and  service  providers  of  the Group and its Houses. From 2021, the supplier social audits conducted each year will include checks on the effective circulation of this information to all employees (awareness of the system, display and issue of the documentation, etc.).\n\nThe Group's supplier selection criteria include ethical, social  and  environmental  aspects,  the  assessment  of which must be documented. This assessment is part of the Hercules compliance management system applicable  to  Kering's  suppliers  of  non-retail  goods. Supplier qualification is conditional on  positive findings in the audits on ethical, social and environmental  aspects  carried  out  by  Kering  supply chain  audit  and  supply  chain  security  teams.  After qualification,  suppliers'  continued  compliance  with Kering requirements is verified by follow-up audits.\n\nAudit findings are centralized in a dedicated database, to which all Houses have access.\n\nSee section 4 'Environmentally and socially responsible  supply  chains'  for  details  of  the  Group Suppliers' Charter, the conditions for the application of sustainability  principles  in  supply  chains,  and  the findings  of  audits  and  assessments  carried  out  in 2020.\n\n## 2.4 Impact of policies and initiatives\n\n## Claims addressed to the Ethics Committees\n\nIn  2020,  Kering's  three  Ethics  Committees  handled  a total  of  79  requests,  including  64  complaints  and 15 inquiries (questions, requests for clarification). Of the 64 complaints, 29 (45%) were submitted to Committees directly  (by  email)  and  35  (55%)  via  the  Group's  ethics hotline; 27 were submitted anonymously.\n\nFifty-nine  of  the  64  complaints  (92%)  gave  rise  to  an investigation under the responsibility of the Committee\n\ncontacted. The five remaining cases were not investigated,  either  because  the  reported  allegations could  not  be  audited,  or  because  the  complainants wished to remain anonymous despite the fact that the reported allegations concerned their personal situations.\n\nFifty of the cases had been closed by December  31,  2020  and  the  remaining  14  (mostly those  reported  late  in  the  year)  were  still  under investigation.",

Its first Ethics Charter  was  released  in  1996.  Kering  considers  the requirements  of  duty  of  care  legislation  as  an  integral part  of  its  ethical  commitments,  and  undertakes  to ensure compliance with these requirements throughout its own operations and its value chain.\n\nKering's  Code  of  Ethics  is  closely  aligned  with  major international conventions  on  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms (see 'Kering's Code of Ethics').\n\n## 2.5.2 Coverage\n\nKering's  duty  of  care  plan  seeks  to  identify  risks  and prevent serious impacts  on  human  rights  and fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety,  or  the environment.\n\nSince  2018,  Kering  has  refocused  its  operations  on Luxury,  around  the  Couture  &  Leather  Goods  and Watches & Jewelry Divisions, covering the operations of Kering SA and its 13 Luxury Houses: Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Boucheron,  Pomellato,  DoDo,  Qeelin,  Ulysse  Nardin, Girard-Perregaux and Kering Eyewear.\n\nKering  works  with  several  thousand  suppliers  to produce  its  Houses'  collections  and  products.  On December  31,  2020,  the  Audit  Department  and  the Security Department, in charge of supply chain security and  social audits (using the Hercules system), managed  a  total  of  3,912  Group  suppliers  in  the centralized supplier database.\n\nThe chart below shows the geographical breakdown of supplier locations:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.3 Scope and risk map\n\nThe risk mapping process covering Kering and its value chain  was  carried  out  in  2017  across  the  Luxury business, under the supervision of a Group coordination  committee  comprising  members  from departments including Compliance, Sustainability and Internal Audit, and following consultation with a panel of stakeholders. The resulting map drew a distinction between:\n\n- \u00b7 intrinsic risks (existing in the absence of checks or attenuating  factors  set  up  by  the  company), whether generic or specific;\n- \u00b7 residual risks (remaining after mitigating measures are applied).\n\nA score was attributed to each of the risks, which were then ranked.\n\nThe inherent risks involved in producing and processing raw  materials  were  determined  by  means  of  in-depth documentary, economic and statistical reviews.\n\nA review of existing tools and processes was carried out to catalogue the means of control and mitigation used by the Company, thus producing a map of residual risks to  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  human health and safety, and the environment.\n\nConcerning  the  value  chain  in  particular,  Kering collected information for all raw materials used in its luxury  product  manufacturing  processes.  These  raw materials were grouped  into  various categories according  to  type.  Kering  deliberately  took  into account  an  extended  list,  including  all  agricultural, mining  and  extraction  resources.  The  risk  map differentiates  between  the  different  types  of  risks arising  from  raw  material  supplies,  production  and processing,  and  working  conditions,  factoring  in  the countries in which these operations take place.\n\nThe  duty  of  care  plan  falls  within  the  Group's  ethics commitment, which involves a continuous improvement process  taking  into  account  feedback  and  good practices  from  implementation  of  the  plan.  In  2020, Kering ran an internal risk assessment to identify and evaluate  human  rights  risks  in  connection  with  the sourcing  of  certain  key  raw  materials,  factoring  in supplier locations.",

        "page_content": "In  line  with  the  undertakings  set  out  in  its  Code  of Ethics, Kering's duty of care plan targets risks of severe impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health and safety, and the environment, with particular regard to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 human rights and fundamental freedoms: child labor, forced  labor,  wages,  working  hours,  discrimination, freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining, prevention  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling, rights of local populations, working conditions, especially for vulnerable populations such as migrants,  working  conditions  for  fashion  models, harassment,  and  sourcing  conditions  for  certain stones and minerals;\n- \u00b7 health  and  safety:  health  and  safety  at  work, consumer health and safety;\n- \u00b7 environment:  climate  change,  air  pollution,  water consumption and pollution, animal welfare, damage to ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nIn  2021,  the  risk  map  will  be  reviewed  to  update  the identification of risks pertaining to severe impacts on (i) human rights and fundamental freedoms, (ii) human health and safety, and (iii) the environment, to improve the regular assessment procedure, and to form an up-to-date action plan. This project is led by the  Compliance  Department,  in  association  with internal and external stakeholders and with assistance from an independent external service provider.\n\n## 2.5.4 Reference framework\n\nA  reference  framework  of  several  internal  systems  is applied  to  ensure  that  the  activities  of  Kering,  its Houses and its suppliers uphold the Group's principles and values.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nKering's  approach  to  responsibility  with  regard  to stakeholders is shaped by the principles set out in its Code  of  Ethics,  and  by  a  strong  determination  to implement  these  principles  internally  and  externally. The  Code  of  Ethics,  which  includes  the  Suppliers' Charter,  setting  out  what  is  expected  of  all  Kering suppliers,  forms  the  cornerstone  of  the  commitment taken by Kering, its Houses and its suppliers, especially with  regard  to  human  rights,  fundamental  freedoms, human  health  and  safety,  and  the  environment. Suppliers  are  required  to  abide  by  these  principles themselves and to extend these requirements to their own suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nFollowing the 2018 update to the Code of Ethics, the document was reissued to all employees worldwide in 2019. This update reaffirmed Kering's commitment to apply  all  major  international  conventions  in  the pursuit  of  its  activities,  and  to  strengthen  and  clarify\n\nits  requirements,  especially  with  regard  to  human rights and fundamental freedoms, to health and safety and  to  the  environment.  For  example,  the  Suppliers' Charter  now  includes  a  requirement  to  pay  special attention  to  categories  of  workers,  such  as  migrants, who are vulnerable to exploitation. The Code of Ethics and  the  Suppliers'  Charter  have  been  translated  into the  14  most  widely  spoken  languages  within  the Group.\n\nA detailed description of the Code of Ethics is provided in the section 'Kering's Code of Ethics'.\n\n## Human rights policy\n\nThe  human rights  policy,  set  for  publication  in  2021, will aim to define the means by which the Group can ensure  its commitments  on  human  rights  and fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety,  and  the environment are fulfilled. It will set out the fundamental  principles  of  human  rights  and  outline the Group's policies that go together to form Kering's commitments on the matter.\n\n## Anti-corruption policy\n\nKering's anti-corruption policy, which was strengthened in  October  2019,  identifies  prohibited  behaviors  and sets  out  guidelines  enabling  employees  to  detect  and thereby prevent situations potentially prone to risks of corruption or influence peddling.\n\nA detailed description of the anti-corruption policy is given in section 2.2 of this chapter.\n\n## Compliance manual\n\nA compliance manual was issued Group-wide in 2018, setting out practical examples on the main ethics risks, including  corruption,  conflicts  of  interest  and  human rights  violations.  The  manual  outlines  the  basic concepts and legal challenges involved, giving practical examples  enabling  employees  to  pinpoint  areas requiring vigilance in their day-to-day work.\n\n## Sustainability Principles\n\nThe  Sustainability  Principles,  which  are  applicable across  all  Houses,  cover  three  areas:  social  aspects regarding  human  rights,  environmental  aspects,  and aspects  regarding  the  sourcing  of  raw  materials  and packaging.  Suppliers  are  required  to  abide  by  these principles,  and  supplier  compliance  is  evaluated  on this basis.\n\nThe principles are outlined in the section 'Implementation of  the  social  audit  system  within  the  Group'  and  on the Group's website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  key  factors  covered  by  the  Kering Standards  include  environmental  impact,  working conditions  and  human  rights  in  production  and extraction  processes  for  the  main  raw  materials  it uses, be they mined, otherwise extracted or of plant or animal  origin.  Under  its  2025  strategy,  Kering  is committed to seeing that all its suppliers apply these standards by 2025.\n\nA detailed description of the Kering Standards is given in section 4.2.4.\n\n## Commitment to the environment and climate strategy\n\nAs part of its strategy for 2025, Kering has embarked upon a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout  its  value  chain,  in  particular  through  its climate strategy outlined in section 3.2.1.\n\nIn addition to its efforts on reducing carbon emissions, the Group has been offsetting all residual emissions in Scopes  1  and  2  since  2012.  In  2019,  it  went  a  step further by offsetting all residual emissions in Scope 3 (including  supply  chain  emissions)  through  carbon credits  with  certified  REDD+  projects.  In  light  of  the global  pandemic situation  in  2020,  the  Group  had  to scale down its efforts, nevertheless offsetting 100% of its  Scope  1  and  2  emissions  and  a  large  part  of  its Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## Environmental policy\n\nKering's  environmental  policy  contributes  to  the fulfillment of the Care pillar of the 2025 sustainability strategy.  It  spans  the  whole  of  the  supply  chain, focusing  on  the  four  following  objectives:  (i)  reduce Kering's EP&L by 40% with respect to 2015, (ii) reduce Kering's controlled CO2 emissions by 50% with respect to 2015, (iii) achieve 100% compliance with the Kering Standards,  and  (iv)  ensure  100%  traceability  for  the Group's main raw materials.\n\nFor more information on Kering's environmental policy, see section 3.2.1.\n\n## Biodiversity strategy\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  published  its  biodiversity  strategy  to explain  its  approach  on  preserving  natural  resources. This  approach  is  structured  around  four  phases (avoidance,  reduction,  restoration/regeneration,  and transformation) and has three aims: stem the loss of biodiversity, re-build  ecosystems  and  rehabilitate species,  and  drive  systemic  change  throughout  the supply chain and beyond.\n\nMore information on Kering's biodiversity strategy can be found in section 3.2.1.\n\n## EP&L\n\nThe  pioneering  EP&L  system  developed  by  Kering means  it  is  able  to  measure  the  environmental impacts  of  its  activities  throughout  the  value  chain. These impacts are then monetized, helping Kering to focus its sustainability strategy, improve its processes and  sourcing  circuits,  and  adapt  its  technology choices.\n\nA  detailed  description  of  the  EP&L  is  provided  in section 4.4.1 of this chapter.\n\n## Policy on diversity and inclusion\n\nKering's Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Department was formed in 2019, reporting directly to the Group Human Resources  Director,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Group Executive  Committee.  The  department  works  with  the Houses to orchestrate and implement Kering's worldwide  strategy  on  diversity  and  inclusion.  This involves  defining  and  prioritizing  initiatives  to  help develop  an  environment  that  fosters  and  encourages diversity and inclusion. The new department illustrates the  Group's  conviction  that  diversity  in  employee profiles  (gender,  culture,  origin,  sexual  orientation, identity or disability) is a rewarding source of collective intelligence.\n\nThe Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Department, which was  strengthened  and  restructured  in  2020,  works closely  with  the  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Committees set  up  within  all  of  the  Group's  Houses  in  2020.  The committees all appoint leaders to represent them on the  Global  D&I  Leadership  Council.  Each  committee has a sponsor from its House's Executive Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Worldwide Baby Leave policy\n\nIn  2016,  the  Group  announced  that  all  employees worldwide  would  be  eligible  to  a  minimum  14-week maternity  or  five-day  paternity  leave  on  full  pay.  As from January 1, 2017, this policy includes appointments to prepare employees for the work/home transition before and after their leave.\n\nIn 2019, Kering decided to extend the policy to provide 14  weeks  of  paid  leave  to  all  Group  employees concerned, from January 1, 2020. All parents, regardless  of  their  personal  circumstances,  are  now entitled to 14 weeks' of paid leave, to be taken within six months of the birth or adoption of a child. This new Baby Leave entitlement ensures that employees enjoy more rights than is required under national legislation.\n\nIn giving the same leave rights to fathers and partners, the  Group  is  building  a  more  inclusive  and  positive working environment for all employees worldwide. All employees enjoy the same entitlements, and equivalent time to spend with their families. Thanks to this  policy,  the  Group  is  also  working  in  favor  of women in the workplace, insofar as both women and men are equally entitled to take Baby Leave. A detailed description of the new  measures  is  given  in section 3.1.2.1 of this chapter.\n\n## Fashion models charter\n\nThe  'Charter  on  the  Working  Relations  with  Fashion Models  and  their  Well-being'  was  introduced  in September 2017 to ensure that Kering and its Houses comply  with  various  major  principles,  including requiring models to present valid medical certificates attesting  to  their  good  health,  discontinuing  the modeling of size 32 clothes for women and size 42 for men, and improving working conditions (e.g., providing a dedicated changing area, as well as food and drink).\n\nIn 2019, Kering and its Houses decided to take a step further,  committing to only hire models aged 18 and over  to  represent  adults  at  fashion  shows  and  photo shoots as of 2020.\n\n## Health & safety policy\n\nKering's  health  &  safety  policy  addresses  its  own employees as well as service providers, and visitors to Group sites,  with  a  view  to  promoting  best  practices, asserting the Group's commitment to an environment conducive  to  employee  health  and  safety,  and undertaking ambitious measures in this respect. This policy  is  founded  on  Group-wide  best  practices  and aims to ensure that governance, processes and regular internal audits are in place with a view to achieving its target of zero accidents.\n\n## 2.5.5 Regular assessment procedure\n\n## Additional control measures and systems for assessing risks in the operations of the Group and its subsidiaries\n\nThe main risks for Group operations within the scope of  the  duty  of  care  plan  are  consistent  with  the non-financial risks corresponding to the categories of this  NFIS  as  listed  under  'Materiality  and  main priorities, non-financial risks and sustainability strategy' in this chapter. The policies addressing these risks are also set out in this section.\n\nInternal control systems are outlined in the compliance manual  issued  across  the  Group  in  2018.  The  manual clearly expresses the importance given to the protection of  human  rights  among  the  Group's  ethical  values.  It restates the definition of human rights and sets out the key  principles  that  Kering  undertakes  to  apply,  along with  case  studies  and  recommendations  for  Group employees.  The  compliance  manual  also  emphasizes Kering's  commitment  to  protecting  the  human  rights of its suppliers'  employees  and  protecting  local communities.\n\nA description of the compliance manual can be found in  section 2.2 'Implementation throughout the Group and beyond'.\n\nSince  2016,  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer conducts  regular  second-level  compliance  reviews across  Group  operations  worldwide,  to  verify  effective implementation of the Compliance Program and detect risks of breaches of the applicable anti-corruption laws.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering has also introduced a contract template that incorporates  its  Code  of  Ethics  (including  the Suppliers' Charter) and Sustainability Principles. Both documents  are  systematically  issued  to  suppliers and  form  an  integral  part  of  their  contractual relationship with Kering;\n- \u00b7 social  and  safety  audits:  the  Group  has  fine-tuned and  clarified  its  standards  on  social  audits,  which are carried out  by  a  specialist  team.  These standards  are  used  in  monitoring  the  Group's supply  chain,  and  provide  support  for  the  supply chain audit and security teams in carrying out their work. The team reports to the Group's Internal Audit Director, which ensures team member independence  and  impartiality.  All  new  suppliers must be audited as a prerequisite for qualification;\n- \u00b7 supplier  database:  all  Kering's  Houses  have  access to a common supplier database. At the end of 2020, this  database  listed  3,912  suppliers;  for  2020,  the supply chain audit and security teams carried out a total of 2,399 audits.\n\nSee  section  4.3  'Working  conditions  in  our  supply chains' for the findings of the social audits carried out by the Group in 2020.\n\n## Third-party audits - desktop due diligence\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Hercules  process  outlined  above, Kering monitors its relationships with service providers through  the  third-party due  diligence procedure provided for in the Group's anti-corruption policy. To identify and manage  the financial, regulatory,  and  reputation  risks  liable  to  arise  from current  or  future  relationships  with  third  parties, Kering  uses  databases  such  as  WorldCheck,  which collate information  from  various  sources  (legal, regulatory,  and  media),  and  calls  in  an  independent law firm specializing in the field whenever necessary.\n\n## 2.5.6 Measures to attenuate risks and prevent serious breaches\n\nAs  outlined  in  section  2.3  'Promoting  and  respecting ethics  within  the  Group  and  beyond',  all  employees have  access  to  a  training  program  on  the  Group's ethical  principles,  which  provides  exhaustive  and in-depth  coverage  of  issues  concerning  corruption, fundamental rights and protection of the environment.\n\nAn  e-learning  module  has  also  been  created  to  raise awareness  and  familiarize  employees  with  the  Kering Standards. This module has also been extended under a  pilot  scheme  to  target  a  selection  of  suppliers' employees, in addition to the annual training programs provided for all Group suppliers.\n\n## 2.5.7 Whistleblowing procedure\n\nThe  whistleblowing  procedure  outlined  above  in  the section entitled 'Whistleblowing procedure for reporting  unethical  conduct'  is  open  both  to  Kering employees and interns, and to external and temporary staff working  for  suppliers, partners or service providers  under  contract  with  the  Group.  It  also enables suppliers  to  report  potential  breaches  of  the Group's Code of Ethics and anti-corruption policy. Full details  on  how  to  use  the  whistleblowing  procedure are provided in the Group's Code of Ethics and in the Kering Standards. Both documents are available to the public on the Group's website.\n\nIn addition to the measures already taken in 2019, an extensive  communication  plan  targeting  suppliers' employees  on  this  procedure  was  drawn  up  in  2019 and implemented in 2020.\n\nA detailed description of the communication plan rolled out  in  2020  is  given  in  section  2.3  'Promoting  and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond'.\n\n## 2.5.8 Report on implementation\n\n## Monitoring and reporting systems\n\nThe Audit Committee approved Kering's risk map and action plan, as outlined above, on June 6, 2018.\n\nRegularly updated tracking and performance indicators have been set up for monitoring the action plan on the duty of care, including training on the Code of Ethics for Kering employees and the findings from supplier audits. The table below lists some of the indicators and best practices applied. Details are provided in this chapter.",

The  crisis  has  also highlighted  the  crucial  need  for  solid  processes,  not only  for  protecting  our  own  employees,  but  also  for making every effort to ensure the same principles are applied  throughout  our  supply  chains.  During  this period, we have worked with our business partners to\n\nensure  that  their  employees  are  provided  with appropriate  means  of  protection  and  to  mitigate  the negative impact of the health crisis on their economic activity to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe Group's ethical approach to business and overall behavior forms a consistent and central component of its identity and development.\n\nMore specifically, Kering is committed to observing the major international conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms. This includes the principles set out in the fundamental conventions of the International  Labour  Organization  and  the  United Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human Rights.\n\nThis commitment to respect human rights throughout the  Group  and  its  supply  chains  is  reflected  in  and expanded  upon  in  its  key  reference  documents  as shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Code of Ethics                                                              | Code of Ethics            | Code of Ethics          | Code of Ethics                                                   | Code of Ethics                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Suppliers' Charter                                                          | Sustainability Principles | Kering Standards        | Health & safety policy                                           | Anti-corruption policy                                                        |\n| Charter on the working relations  with fashion models  and their well-being | Compliance Manual         | Human Resources  policy | Individual policies  and procedures  put in place  by the Houses | Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance List; Product Restricted  Substance List |\n\nThese  systems  work  together  to  shape  the  Group's human rights strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Code  of  Ethics,  which  includes  the  Suppliers' Charter,  sets  out  the  Group's  principles  on  ethical business  conduct  and  the  behavior  expected  of  its employees and business partners on this matter. This document,  approved  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee,  clearly  states  that  respect  for  human rights  is  a  non-negotiable  condition  for  working  with or  for  the  Group.  Kering  is  committed  to  respecting human  rights  throughout  its  own  operations  and requires  its  business  partners  to  make  the  same commitment  and  to  pass  down  this  requirement  to their own business partners. Details on these two texts are  provided  in  the  section  entitled  'Kering's  Code  of Ethics';\n- \u00b7 the human rights policy, which will be published in 2021;\n\n- \u00b7 the anti-corruption policy, which identifies prohibited  behaviors  within  the  Group  and  sets  out guidelines enabling employees to detect and thereby prevent  situations  potentially  prone  to  risks  of corruption or influence peddling;\n- \u00b7 the  Compliance  Manual,  which  sets  out  practical examples  on  the  main  ethics  risks,  including corruption,  conflicts  of  interest  and  human  rights violations;\n- \u00b7 the Sustainability Principles, set out in 2015 for all Houses,  span  the  three  broad  fields  of  human rights, labor rights, and health and safety: elimination of child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking in all its forms; prevention of discrimination;  compliance  with  statutory  working hours;  respect  for  the  freedom  of  association  and the right to collective bargaining; etc. These principles are outlined in section 4.3.1, 'Implementation  of  the  social  audit  system  within the Group' and on the Group's website;",

The Standards are aimed at the Group's Houses and all their suppliers with a view to achieving Kering's responsible supply chain targets  by  2025.  Kering  has  pledged  that  100%  of the key raw materials used by the Group - and the production  processes  using  these  materials  -  will comply  with  the  Kering  Standards  by  2025.  The Standards  encourage  the  adoption  of  socially responsible  labor  relations  practices  by  specifying requirements  on  the  take-up  of  international initiatives in each sector, such as GOTS certification for cotton, RJC or Fairmined for precious stones and metals,  and  the  international  Fairtrade  framework. For reasons of transparency and open sourcing, the Standards  have  been  accessible  to  all  on  the Group's website since 2018. The underlying principles are set out in the section 4.1 'Managing our impacts beyond our own operations';\n- \u00b7 the  Charter  on  the  Working  Relations  with  Fashion Models, applicable across all Houses, which promotes  high  standards  of  integrity,  responsibility and  respect  towards  people,  and  lays  down  four major  commitments:  (i)  to  work  only  with  models holding  a  valid  medical  certificate  attesting  to  their good  health  and  their  ability  to  work  and  issued within the previous six months; (ii) to ban size 32 for women  and  size  42  for  men;  (iii)  not  to  recruit models  below  the  age  of  16  for  shows  or  photo shoots  representing  an  adult;  and  (iv)  to  adopt specific rules for models aged from 16 to 18 (working hours,  chaperone,  accommodation).  The  Charter came  into  force  as  soon  as  it  was  published,  in September 2017. In 2019, Kering decided to extend its initial commitment and discontinue the recruitment of fashion models under 18 for fashion shows  and  photo  shoots  representing  adults,  from 2020 (Fall/Winter 2020-2021 shows);\n- \u00b7 the health & safety policy, which is founded on best practices across the Group and aims to ensure that Group-wide  governance,  processes  and  internal audits  are  in  place  to  achieve  the  target  of  zero accidents;\n- \u00b7 Kering's  Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List (MRSL)  and  Product  Restricted  Substance  List (PRSL),  specifying  requirements  on  the  use  of chemical  substances  and  the  management  of manufacturing  processes  with  the  aim  of  phasing out hazardous chemicals to safeguard the health of workers and consumers. These systems are outlined in  the  sections  'Risk  management:  product  quality\n\ncontrol,  and  consumer  health  and  safety'  and 'Projects, collaborations  and  initiatives  geared towards  reducing  our  suppliers'  environmental impact';\n\n- \u00b7 human resources policies: as part of Kering's 2025 sustainability strategy, the Human  Resources Department  has  embarked  upon  a  number  of policies  on  matters  including  the  promotion  of well-being  at  work,  home/work  balance,  diversity and gender equality. These are outlined in section 3.1.2 'Furthering employee development in a stimulating and inclusive work environment'.\n\nIn addition to these policies and systems, Houses may run  their  own  individual  or  sector-specific  initiatives, as set out in section 2.6.2.6 below, entitled 'Initiatives by the Houses'.\n\nOn its  website,  Kering  publishes  its  declarations  with regard  to  the  UK  Modern  Slavery  Act  2015  and  the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, and  will  be  undertaking  the  procedure  required  by Australia's Modern Slavery Act 2018.\n\nKering's  duty  of  care  plan,  drawn  up  in  compliance with  French  Law  no.  2017-399  of  March  27,  2017  on the Duty of Care, is outlined in section 2.5 'Duty of care plan'.\n\n## 2.6.2 Implementation within the Group: objectives and actions\n\n## 2.6.2.1 A continuous improvement approach\n\nAware of the need for constant vigilance on the matter of  respect  for  human  rights  in  supply  chains,  the Ethics Charter adopted by Kering in 1996 established key  principles  to  guide  employees  both  in  their day-to-day activities and in their business relationships. These principles, now set out in Kering's Code  of  Ethics,  are  regularly  updated  to  bring clarifications  and  explanations  resulting  from  the continuous improvement process.\n\nIn  the  same vein, the due diligence procedure aimed at identifying,  assessing  and  preventing  the  impact  that Group operations have or might have on human rights is seen  as  a  continuous  process  with  a  need  for  constant adaptation.  This  procedure  is  included  in  the  Hercules system, which is described in the section entitled 'Control measures and systems for assessing risks in the Group's supply chain'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021,  the  risk  map  will  be  reviewed  to  update  the identification  of  risks  pertaining  to  severe  impacts  on (i)  human rights and fundamental freedoms, (ii) health and safety, and (iii) the environmental.\n\nFollowing on from these initiatives, additional work has been carried out to identify areas for improvement, with a particular focus on  respect  for  human  rights throughout  the  supply  chain.  A  gap  analysis  was performed in 2017 to pinpoint differences between the Group's  internal  practices  and  the  United  Nations Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights (UNGP). The findings of this analysis provided input for the  2019  update  to  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  and  for  a dedicated communication plan targeting employees of the Group's direct suppliers with specific details on how to use the whistleblowing system. The first phase of this communication campaign went ahead in 2020, and will be monitored on a regular basis to ensure it reaches all new direct suppliers.\n\nA detailed description of the communication plan for suppliers  is  given  in  section  2.3  'Promoting  and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond'.\n\nKeen to refine its understanding of human rights issues throughout  the  supply  chain,  and  to  learn  from  good practices on the matter, in 2020 Kering carried out a new study  focusing  on  the  governance  and  management  of human rights within the supply chain, at the Group and House  level.  Carried  out  with  GoodCorporation,  an independent organization specializing in business ethics, this  study  included  consultations  with  various  internal stakeholders in order to gather their feedback. To identify new  avenues  for  progress,  the  findings  from  the  study were analyzed in the light of the recommendations given in  the  UNGP  and  the  OECD  Due  Diligence  Guidance  for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector.\n\nKering also conducted a study aiming to identify and assess  human  rights  risks  linked  to  the  supply  of certain key raw materials. This analysis was carried out in  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  suppliers  are located.\n\nThe  findings  from  these  various  studies  enabled  the Group to identify a number of key points and subjects, and the resulting recommendations were shared with members of the Executive Committee.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  was  able  to  update  the  list  of  risks that the Group considers salient with regard to human rights  (forced  labor,  child  labor  in  raw  materials sourcing, discrimination, health and safety in our supply chains,  decent  wages  for  our  suppliers'  employees, harassment).\n\nThe  materiality  assessment  carried  out  by  the  Group identified  respect  for  human  rights  as  one  of  the strategic challenges central to discussions on preparation  of  its  2025  strategy,  consistent  with  the United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  This analysis,  which  was  renewed in 2020, confirmed that respect  for  human  rights  is  among  the  crucial challenges facing the Group, as set out in section 1.4.\n\nThe non-financial risk 'Human rights and fundamental freedoms'  was  identified  in  the  Group's  overall  risk analysis,  as  presented  in  Chapter  6  of  this  Universal Registration Document and in this NFIS.\n\nThe  following  sections  detail  how  Kering  monitors progress  on  these  major  challenges  and  effectively implements the  principles  set  out  above,  for  its  own operations and in its supply chains.\n\n## 2.6.2.2 Ambitions incorporated into the Group's 2025 sustainability strategy\n\nIn  January  2017,  Kering  defined  and  published  its 2025  sustainability  strategy.  Human  rights  objectives feature in two of the three pillars of this strategy.\n\nThe  Care  pillar  commits  Kering  to  achieving  100% implementation by suppliers of the strict requirements set  in  the  Kering  Standards  for  raw  materials  and manufacturing  processes  by  2025.  These  include standards  on  traceability,  animal  welfare,  use  of chemicals, environmental impact and social impact.\n\nThough  the  Collaborate  pillar  on  Kering's  strategic social  commitment  is  not  exclusively  about  human rights, it does include these six points:\n\n- \u00b7 support the continuation of craftsmanship traditions and the communities that support them;\n- \u00b7 extend focus across the supply chain and improve community  livelihoods  where  raw  materials  are sourced;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 amplify  forward-thinking  employment  practices, including the global parental policy, a well-being at work policy, and an employee benefits policy;\n- \u00b7 promote  an  inclusive  work  environment  and achieve  gender  parity  at  all  levels  throughout  the Group;\n- \u00b7 develop innovative career paths for all;\n- \u00b7 aim to be the preferred employer in the luxury sector.\n\n## 2.6.2.3 Shared governance and central systems rolled out at Group level\n\nKering takes a cross-functional approach to governance  over  human  rights  challenges,  integrated into its overall governance structure for sustainability, as set out in section 1.4.4 'Governance and organization'.  Specifically,  human  rights  governance spans various departments, starting with Compliance, Human  Resources  (and  its  Diversity,  Inclusion  and Talent  Department),  Sustainability,  Internal  Audit  and Security.  It  also  extends  to  employee  representative bodies.\n\nFor many years now, Kering's commitments on human rights  have  also  been  expressed  through  the  Kering Foundation. The Foundation, formed in 2008, combats violence  against  women.  It  commits  Kering  to  a  key issue that ties in with its Houses' activities and clients, and an area where the Group has a vital role to play alongside  governments  and  NGOs.  In  2019,  the Foundation took part in the first 'Grenelle' summit on the prevention of domestic violence, organized by the French Secretary of State for Gender Equality and the Combat against Discriminations.\n\nHuman rights considerations are also included in the annual  performance  evaluations  of  Group  executives. Thirty  percent  of  the  variable  remuneration  of  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Group Managing  Director  is  linked  to  the  fulfillment  of non-financial criteria, including the operational roll-out of the 2025 sustainability strategy. This is also partly  the  case  for  the  variable  remuneration  of  the Group's senior executives (Top 450).\n\nTo  optimize  communication  between  Kering  and  its suppliers, roll-out of a collaborative portal began in 2020. As  well  as  providing  suppliers  with  ready  access  to training and key Kering documents - including on human rights  -  the  portal  also  affords  greater  transparency  on supply  chains.  Via  the  platform,  suppliers  are  required to  complete  three  annual  questionnaires  (on  the\n\nimplementation of the Kering Standards, environmental management,  and  labor  relations  management),  the input  from  which  will  be  used  for  evaluating  their practices. The labor relations questionnaire (92  questions)  seeks  increased  transparency  on  the composition of the supplier's workforce (gender balance,  for  example),  on  specific  initiatives  taken  by the supplier on the matter, on the supplier's management  of  health  and  safety  (risk  assessment, incident rate, etc), and on measures for mitigating risks concerning forced labor and child labor.\n\n## 2.6.2.4 Employee training and education\n\nConscious  of  the  importance  of  raising  awareness within  its  workforce,  Kering  put  in  place  multiple training  activities,  some  of  which  included  various aspects of human rights.\n\n- \u00b7 All  Group  employees  take  a  compulsory  annual Ethics & Compliance course based on the principles set  out  in  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics.  The  course  is available  in  the  14  most  widely  spoken  languages within  the  Group.  The  situations  and  subjects covered  vary  from  year  to  year,  with  the  common objective  of  ensuring  that  employees  will  adopt appropriate  behavior  when  faced  with  the  ethics dilemmas they might come across in their everyday working experience. In 2020, the course covered the subject  of  responsible  supply  chains  with  a  sharp focus  on  some  of  the  Group's  salient  environment and human rights risks. For example, the subject of health  and  safety  at  work,  including    excessive working  hours,  has  been  covered,  as  well  as  the exploitation of vulnerable workers (migrants, children, etc.), and  discrimination. A detailed description  of  the  training  program  is  provided  in section 2.3 'Promoting and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond'.\n- \u00b7 Training on the Kering Standards, for employees of Kering  and  its  Houses,  and  their  suppliers,  was developed  and  published  via  the  Group's  internal website  in  2018.  This  ongoing  program  takes  an informative and educational approach to explaining Kering's  minimum  requirements  on  sourcing  and processes.  It  provides  illustrations  and  details, notably  social,  that  provide  context  for  why  the standards  are  necessary.  Detailed  descriptions  of the Kering Standards and the training program are provided in section 4.2.4 'The Kering Standards and their circulation'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These courses cover the complexity and impact of domestic violence, and provide insights into ways to develop a safe work environment. In 2020, a dedicated module was  also  included  in  the  Ethics  and  Compliance training course. A detailed description of the Foundation's work is given in section 5.4 'Initiatives carried out by the Kering Foundation and sponsorship programs'.\n\n## 2.6.2.5 Stakeholder involvement\n\nHuman  rights  initiatives  figure  among  the  many cross-cutting programs in Kering's committed stakeholder  approach  (see  section  5.1  'Stakeholder dialogue').\n\n## 2.6.2.6 Initiatives by the Houses\n\nThe  reference  framework  and  the  implementation thereof at Group level applies without exception to all of Kering's Houses, wherever they operate. The Houses are free to expand on the framework or to integrate it into their own procedures and materials.\n\nThis is, for example, the case at Gucci and Bottega Veneta, which in 2007 and 2009 respectively embarked on the process of obtaining SA8000 (Social Accountability 8000) certification. This global standard takes into account not only  the  Company  itself,  but  also  the  companies  in  its production  chain.  It  requires  the  certified  company  and its  suppliers  to  respect  nine  corporate  responsibility requirements  -  relating  to  child  labor,  forced  labor, health and safety, freedom of association and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, remuneration and management systems - and to continuously improve working conditions by setting up a specific  management  system  for  this  purpose.  Bottega Veneta  and  Gucci  have  held  SA8000  certification  for  all their  activities  since  2009  and  2013,  respectively.  The certifications  of  both  Houses  were  renewed  in  2020. Kering's  international  logistics  platform  for  its  Luxury Houses  (Luxury  Goods  International  -  LGI)  also  has SA8000 certification. In addition, Gucci is actively involved with  Social  Accountability  International  (SAI),  which developed the SA8000 standard, and is a member of SAI's Advisory Board.\n\nIn addition to meeting these certification requirements, the  Houses  also  develop  many  of  their  own  programs on  respect  for  human  rights.  Gucci,  for  example,  has developed  specific  initiatives  for  refugees  in  Italy  and women in India.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  continued  to  support  the  project  for  the social inclusion of refugees in Italy in collaboration with the Fondazione  Adecco  per  le  Pari  Opportunit\u00e0 and decided  to  go  further  by  extending  the  integration  of refugees in its stores through the #forRefugees program. Therefore, by end-2020, 17 refugees were working in the House, in its corporate, production sites and stores.\n\nFurthermore,  to  celebrate  World  Refugee  Day  2019, Gucci announced its collaboration with Tent Partnership for Refugees,  a  worldwide  network  of  companies engaged  in  the  support  of  refugees.  In  the  context  of this  collaboration, Gucci connected with the charitable organizations  Breaking  Barriers  in  UK  and  Jobs  4 Refugees  in  Germany.  All  of  these  collaborations continued in 2020.\n\nFor  the  second  consecutive  year,  the  House  won  a 'Welcome.  Working  for  Refugee  Integration'  award from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, for its efforts in favor  of  the  inclusion  and  integration  of  refugees  in Italy.\n\nIn  2018,  Gucci  also  entered  a  three-year  partnership with I  was  a  Sari,  a  social  enterprise  working  to  offer underprivileged Indian women  the  prospect  of financial independence through training in embroidery and sari recycling. This program reached 78 women in its first year, and more than 170 in 2020. I was a Sari earned the 2019 Circular Design Challenge Award and presented  its  collection  at  the  Lakm\u00e9  Fashion  Week Winter  2019  event.  To  broaden  the  reach  of  this partnership,  and  increase  the  number  of  women benefiting from the project, Gucci's Chime for Change initiative  backed  the  development  of  a  new  digital vocational training program on embroidery, accessible free  of  charge  on  the  open-source  digital  platform Udemy.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  also  continued  its  work  on  social sustainability as a member  of  the  multi-brand committee set up by the Camera Nazionale della Moda . With  support  and  expertise  from  the  Fair  Wage Network,  this  committee  assessed  the  remuneration practices of manufacturers in the luxury goods sector, with  the  goal  of  examining  their  wage  levels  and setting  methods,  while  also  evaluating  the  overall wage framework in Italy.\n\nGucci is a signatory to the UN's Standards of Conduct for  Business  Tackling  Discrimination  against  Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans & Intersex People.",

        "page_content": "Working  from  sound  historical  roots  and  its  strong stakeholder  dialogue  profile  in  Italy,  Gucci  partners with  many  organizations  and  industry  initiatives working  for  a  positive  impact  on  human  rights. Examples  include Sodalitas ,  on  questions  including community  and  life  at  work, Valore  D ,  on  women's leadership  in  the  Italian  private  sector  (as  with  its study on gender diversity in companies that are part of the Valore  D network),  and  PARKS  -  Free  and  Equals, an  NGO  working  on  value  creation  through  strategies and best practices on inclusion and diversity.\n\nAs  part  of  their  pursuit  of  gender  equality  both in-house and throughout their supply chains, in 2019 Kering and its Italian Houses worked with the Camera Nazionale della Moda and three specialist associations (BSR,  Wise  Growth  and Valore  D )  on  a  wide-reaching study into the role of women in the supply chains of the  Italian  luxury  industry.  This  study,  the  first  of  its kind, covered more than 180 suppliers, polling a total of 880 people (70% women) on the subject of gender equality  via  in-person  interviews  and  questionnaires. The purpose was to highlight the challenges faced by women  working  in  the  luxury  industry  and  issue practical recommendations on specific measures and programs  that  luxury  brands  could  apply  to  improve gender  equality.  The  study  identified  four  priority focuses: working conditions and economic opportunities,  leadership  and  career  advancement, motherhood, and workplace conduct and harassment. The findings were presented by Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Pomellato  and  Kering  Eyewear  in  December  2019  at the  Including  Diversity  event  run  by  the Camera Nazionale della Moda in Milan and are available online on  the  BSR  website,  www.bsr.org.  Following  on  from these  operations,  a  2020  webinar  was  attended  by more than 200 suppliers, and more than 100 selected women  employees  received  training  based  on  the study findings.\n\nIn  2020,  Alexander  McQueen  ran  training  courses  on sustainability challenges including respect for human rights  in  the  clothing  and  footwear  sector.  These courses reached more than 60 employees working in design, production and product development.\n\nSaint Laurent renewed  its  support  to  the  NGO charity:  water,  which  works  with  local  associations worldwide  to  bring  safe  drinking  water  to  people  in need.  In  2019,  Kering  too  entered  into  a  multi-annual\n\npartnership with charity: water to help improve access to  water  for  populations  in  emerging  and  developing countries.  Starting  from  the  observation  that  25%  of water pumps in Africa are out of order, this partnership seeks to develop and implement technological innovations  for  detecting  then  repairing  defective pumps.  Access  to  water  is  a  major  health  and socio-economic challenge, with implications especially important  in  maternal  and  infant  health,  and  also  in education and women's independence.\n\nThe  Group's  main  Jewelry  Houses  have  gone  a  step further by joining the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), an international organization promoting responsible and transparent  business  practices  in  the  precious  metals trade.  RJC  certification  attests  to  compliance  with requirements  on  ethics,  environment  and  working conditions  in  the  jewelry  and  watchmaking  sector.  It ensures supply chain transparency for diamonds, gold and platinum, from the mine to the point of sale. It is rooted in ILO and Global Compact principles, as well as the OECD's  recommendations  on  due  diligence. Girard-Perregaux, Pomellato and DoDo, Boucheron and Gucci (which is also RJC CoC-certified) are RJC-certified. Boucheron's certification was renewed in 2020, and Ulysse Nardin should obtain certification in 2021.\n\n## 2.6.3 Performance and transparency of the measures taken by the Group to protect human rights\n\n## Performance of Kering's human rights policy\n\nSection  3.1  'Supporting  our  employees'  sets  out  the findings  and  key  performance  indicators  concerning the  protection  of  human  rights  within  the  Group's operations in terms of human resources, occupational health  and  safety,  and  labor  relations.  Section  2.4 'Impact of policies and initiatives' describes performance  monitoring  for  the  Group's  ethics  and compliance  procedures.  The  findings  of  the  social audits carried out within the Group's supply chains in 2020 are presented in section 4.3.3 'Findings obtained in 2020 and key indicators'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering's principal mission is to help its employees reach their potential  and  express  their  creativity  by  developing their  skills  and  performance  in  the  most  imaginative way  possible.  To  achieve  this,  the  Group  provides  its Houses  with  the  support  necessary  for  their  growth, promoting the sharing of and access to best practices, and  encouraging  the  identification  and  development of  talent  for  the  benefit  of  all  the  Houses.  Kering encourages internal mobility, the pooling of expertise and the creation of synergies.\n\nIn today's world of fast-changing markets, competition and  customer  needs,  identifying,  developing  and retaining the best talent is a strategic priority.\n\nKering's  goal  is  to  be  the  preferred  employer  in  the luxury industry, with empowered, motivated employees who  want  to  make  a  difference  in  a  diverse  and open-minded environment.\n\nThe aim is to continue building a respected Group that brings  together  strong  Houses  united  by  a  shared culture  and  sense  of  motivation  and  in  which  every employee feels appreciated and committed.\n\nIn 2020, a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Kering  and  its  Houses  demonstrated  their  ability  to implement employee support initiatives worldwide to ensure  the  health  and  safety  of  their  teams  while pursuing  the  Group's  activities.  Despite  the  global crisis,  the  Kering  group  also  fulfilled  its  commitment to maintain jobs during 2020 and urged all its Houses to  maintain  wage  levels  in  accordance  with  local constraints.\n\nIn addition, Kering continued in 2020 to pursue the HR priorities identified in its 2025 sustainability strategy: to develop  talent,  preserve  craftsmanship,  and  promote well-being  at  work  and  employee  commitment.  As  a result, the dynamic initiated in 2019 with the launch of the  Baby  Leave  policy  and  the  implementation  of  the Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) action plan continued during 2020, notably through the creation of D&I Committees within each House.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A specific  curriculum  has  been  developed,  combining theory  and  practice.  Under  normal  circumstances,  the four-month Empowering Imagination program is open to  students  from  a  range  of  disciplines  at  the  London College  of  Fashion  and  enables  them  to  obtain  an in-depth  understanding  of  the  issues  relating  to sustainability  in  the  fashion  industry,  with  the  help  of experts from Kering, CSF and the wider fashion industry. Kering  and  the  London  College  of  Fashion  also launched the first  Massive  Open  Online  Course  (MOOC) on  luxury  fashion  and  sustainability  in  2018.  Entitled 'Fashion & Sustainability: Understanding Luxury Fashion in  a  Changing  World',  the  course  spans  a  six-week period and uses a mix of films, podcasts, activities and discussions.  The  three  sessions  held  in  2020  -  in February,  June  and  October  -  attracted  more  than 35,300  participants  from  more  than  191  countries, bringing  the  total  number  of  participants  since  the MOOC's launch in 2018 to nearly 70,000. More sessions will be held in 2021.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  renewed  the  partnership  created  in 2010  with  HEC  Paris  School  of  Management's  Luxury Chair  for  another  five  years.  The  Kering  Certificate  of Influential Luxury is a unique program that aims to help future  leaders  learn  how  best  to  handle  luxury  brand management  challenges  through  Kering's  vision  and values. It includes  basic  courses,  more  in-depth, theme-based  teaching,  and  a  series  of  practical seminars  led  by  leaders  or  members  of  the  Executive Committees  of  Kering  and  its  Houses.  Students  also have the opportunity to visit stores and workshops, and participate  in  a  team  consulting  project  on  a  topic  set by Kering, culminating in a presentation before a panel consisting  of  the  Chair's  academic  co-directors  and\n\nKering managers. Due to the exceptional circumstances created by the health crisis, the content usually taught in  classes  and  seminars  was  completely  overhauled during the year to adapt it to online learning. The whole program  was  therefore  able  to  proceed  smoothly  and successfully,  without  any  decline  in  quality.  Only  the store  visits  component  could  not  be  maintained  and was replaced by a practical case study. This partnership allows  Kering  to  play  a  role  in  the  training  of  future high-level  talent  from  diverse  backgrounds,  and  to identify any talent with the potential to join the Group and  its  Houses.  In  2020,  40  students  of  17  different nationalities  took  part  in  the  program,  which  was organized  in  partnership  with  Balenciaga  for  the  first time.\n\nIn 2020, Kering renewed its support for the IFM - Kering Sustainability  Chair  in  collaboration  with  the Institut Fran\u00e7ais  de  la  Mode .  The  Chair  focuses  its  scientific research  on  a  wide  range  of  topics  related  to sustainability, from traceability and impact assessment to eco-responsible business models. Aspects of creative ecology  are  also  studied  in  order  to  identify  ways  in which  creative  teams  can  develop  ecological  fashion and propose new, sustainable creative offerings that are highly  attractive,  while  developing  tools  for  measuring and appropriating environmental and social issues.\n\nThe Group and its Houses support numerous institutions, building on the close relationships developed by Kering's entire  HR  community  worldwide,  including  the Institut fran\u00e7ais de la mode (IFM), Istituto Marangoni , Politecnico di  Milano ,  Bocconi  University, Istituto  Polimoda , Istituto Europeo  di  Design , Accademia  Costume  &  Moda in Rome, Tsinghua University and Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  Kering's  participation  in  online  recruitment events  enabled  it  to  maintain  contact  with  students from  most  of  these  institutions  throughout  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAn  academic  partnership  strategy  is  being  developed at Kering, with the support of its Houses, so that more joint initiatives can be offered in 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  many  of  the  Group's  Houses  support  craft guilds and offer training programs (see section 5.2). They have established several professional organizations that help to ensure the survival of some very demanding and unique skills, and support long-term employment in the regions  where  these  crafts  originated.  For  instance, Brioni-backed Scuola  di  Alta  Sartoria provides  a challenging three-year course followed by a one-year apprenticeship  at  its  workshops  to  teach  the  Brioni method. More than a hundred tailors have graduated from this school and are now working for Brioni, either in its workshops or boutiques.",

In 2020, the leatherwork classes (tanning, cutting, sewing, finishing, etc.) had to be downsized to comply with COVID-19-related government restrictions. A  total  of  37  employees  were  able  to  take  part  in  the training program, half online and half in person.\n\nIn  2018,  Gucci  unveiled  its \u00c9cole  de  l'Amour education program, created as part of the brand's ArtLab opened earlier  the  same  year.  The \u00c9cole  de  l'Amour includes  a craftsmanship  school  ( scuola  dei  mestieri ),  offering  a six-month  program  to  train  students  to  professional standards; a factory school ( scuola di fabbrica ),  training technical production operators; and a technical academy, designed to provide employees with product knowledge training in a flexible way that is aligned with their needs. These initiatives are ongoing. However, the health crisis forced Gucci to suspend them temporarily in 2020.\n\n## Recruiting the best professionals\n\nIn  addition  to  partnerships  with  schools,  Kering  uses highly effective social media and other tools to recruit the  best  profiles  available.  A  new  digital  platform introduced in late 2018 facilitates interaction between the  line  manager,  the  HR  manager  and  the  applicant throughout  the  recruitment  process,  increasing  the\n\nvisibility  of  vacancies  and  enhancing  the  applicant's experience. Kering's Houses are constantly investing in order  to  offer  the  best  possible  experience  to applicants through innovative and inclusive solutions. In 2020, Gucci launched an online assessment process that uses  augmented  reality  to  give  applicants experience  while  evaluating  them  for  the  essential skills required to be a sales associate in one of Gucci's many stores worldwide.\n\nA  training  program  on  inclusive  recruitment  was introduced for the entire Kering group in 2020 to help recruiters  and  hiring  managers  identify  common biases in the recruitment process and minimize their impact. The  program  covers  all  stages  in  the recruitment  process,  including  the  issues  to  be considered when the vacancy is created, the applicant selection and interview processes, and the new hire's integration  into  the  company.  In  addition  to  this program, several Houses have implemented fully-fledged  inclusive  recruitment  strategies,  such  as Balenciaga's Hiring Pact, which takes a 360\u00b0 approach to drive real-world progress in the area of diversity and inclusion.\n\nKering  also  encourages  its  employees  to  recommend fresh  talent  to  the  Group  and  its  Houses  through  a referral program set up in 2017. The aim is to recruit new talent and enable employees to participate in the Group's  development  through  a  'refer  a  friend' function set up on the employment vacancies section of  the  Group's  intranet.  To  ensure  that  all  employees are  able  to  participate,  including  those  who  work  in production  or  in  the  Group's  stores,  the  function  is accessible via both desktop and mobile phone.\n\n## Breakdown of fixed-term and permanent contracts among new hires in 2020, 2019 and 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2020,  7,076  people  were  hired  on  permanent contracts.  Out  of  the  total  number  of  new  hires, including  fixed-term  contracts,  64.6%  were  women and 92.7% were non-managers.\n\nThe  Kering  group  also  had  a  monthly  average  of 1,682  temporary  employees  across  all  its  Houses  in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It aims to assist employees when an organizational change (such as a store transfer or closure) is liable to have an impact on jobs. An official redeployment guide has been drawn up  for  employees  of  all  the  Houses,  outlining  recent legal  developments, describing the various steps to be taken  for  internal  redeployment  and  providing  the relevant forms to be completed.\n\nIn  all  countries  and  for  all  Houses,  when  departures are  being  considered  following  reorganizations,  the efforts  made  to  find  employees  another  position  go beyond what is required by law, and priority is given to voluntary mobility measures.\n\nKering also introduced a digital HR platform in 2018, which enables vacancies in all the Group's Houses to be  posted  online.  Since  2019,  a  selection  of  job openings  is  posted  on  the  platform  each  week  and relayed  via  the  corporate  social  media  networks  to encourage internal mobility. By providing direct access to vacancies, the system enables the Group to inform all  employees  about  internal  mobility  opportunities with the utmost transparency.\n\nThe  European  Works  Council  is  also  apprised  of  the Group's plans and the associated organizational changes during its two annual plenary meetings and the meetings of its Select Committee.",

        "page_content": "## 3.1.2 Furthering employee development in a stimulating and inclusive work environment\n\n## 3.1.2.1 Promoting diversity and inclusion\n\nGoing further than its commitment to social responsibility,  the  Group  believes  that  diversity  and inclusion is a source of creativity and innovation, and as such  of  economic  performance.  This  is  why  Kering makes every effort to establish a culture of equality at all  levels  of  the  organization  and  provides  its  teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and stimulating work environment, thereby contributing to the Group's success.\n\nAs  part  of  its  2025  sustainability  strategy,  Kering  is promoting  diversity  and  gender  equality  through  a series of concrete  commitments,  which  include achieving  gender  parity  in  all  the  Group's  functions and  introducing  a  mentoring  program  for  women  at the international level.\n\nKering has long been committed to diversity, and was among  the  first  signatories  of  the  French  Corporate Diversity  Charter  in  2004.  An  equivalent  Charter  was also signed by Gucci in Italy in 2011.\n\nIn early 2015, the Executive Management of Kering and the European  Works  Council  signed  their  first European Empowering Talent agreement. It provides a forceful  and  comprehensive  reassertion  of  Kering's commitment to equal opportunities.\n\nIn  June  2019,  Kering  announced  its  support  for  the Standards  of  Conduct  published  by  the  UN  to  help businesses  tackle  discrimination  against  the  LGBTI community.  In  September  2019,  Kering  joined  the 'Open To All' coalition, which brings together 200 non-profit organizations and close to 4,000 largeand medium-sized businesses in the United States to combat all forms of discrimination against employees, visitors and customers, including discrimination based  on  ethnicity,  nationality,  sex,  gender  identity, sexual orientation, religion and disability.\n\nRanked 28 th among 7,000 companies from around the world  in  Refinitiv's  most  recent  Diversity  &  Inclusion Index (2020), Kering intends to build on these results to form an increasingly representative and high-performing team.\n\nThe  appointment  on  October  1,  2019  of  a  new  Chief Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Officer, reporting to the Chief  People  Officer,  signaled  a  new  stage  in  the Group's determined action in support of diversity. The\n\nappointment  highlights  Kering's  desire  to  accelerate and expand its action in support of diversity, equality and inclusion.\n\nIn addition, each House set up a Diversity and Inclusion Committee  in  2020,  sponsored  by  a  member  of  its management team. These committees are made up of representatives  from  the  various  departments  and regions  who  have  a  particular  interest  in  diversity  and inclusion  issues.  Their  role  is  to  transpose  the  Group's diversity  and  inclusion  strategy  within  their  respective Houses, while adapting it to their specific cultures and environments. Highlighting Kering's desire to accelerate and  expand  its  action  in  support  of  diversity  and inclusion, the initiative is sponsored  by  Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the sponsor for the Kering Corporate  Diversity and  Inclusion Committee is the Group's Chief Financial Officer. Kering pays  close  attention  to  diversity  in  employee  profiles (gender,  culture,  origin,  sexual  orientation,  identity  or disability), which it recognizes as a rewarding source of collective intelligence. It is also a means of building on the culture of equal opportunity that prevails throughout  the  Group,  giving  every  employee  the chance to realize his or her potential.\n\nIn  2019,  Gucci  deployed  a  comprehensive  plan  to promote diversity and inclusion,  which  are  central  to its values.  The  plan  comprises  an  inclusion  and diversity  development  program  for  all  employees, a global design scholarship for talented young people in all regions of the world, and  an  in-house international exchange program. Gucci has also signed the UN's LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business and organizes  events  for  its  employees  in  Italy  to  raise awareness about hurtful language and discrimination on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation  ('Words  that exclude, beyond the mirror what is there?').\n\nSince  2019,  Gucci  has  been  leveraging  its  Gucci Changemakers  volunteer  program  to  encourage  all Gucci  employees  worldwide  to  support  their  local communities. The program allows employees to spend up to four days of their working time helping non-profit organizations  in  four  key  areas:  equality,  refugees  and the homeless, education and the environment. In 2019, when the program was gradually rolled out across the regions,  1,400  applications  were  submitted,  for  the benefit  of  more  than  170  NGOs  worldwide.  The initiative  is  ongoing.  However,  the  health  situation  in 2020  forced  Gucci  to  temporarily  suspend  activities requiring  a  physical  presence.  In  2020,  more  than 570  contributions  were  submitted  and  70  new  NGOs joined  the  program.  Also  in  2020,  Gucci  launched  its Global  Equity  Board  in  order  to  define  priorities  and monitor progress in the areas of diversity, equality and inclusion, in line with Kering's policies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishing a culture of gender equality within the Group\n\nWhile  Kering  addresses  the  issue  of  diversity  in  all  its aspects, particular emphasis is placed on equal opportunities.  In  2010,  the  Group  was  one  of  the  first companies in France to sign the Women's Empowerment Principles, drafted by UN Women and the United Nations Global Compact. These principles offer guidance on how to  promote  the  presence  and  progression  of  women  in business and, more generally, in society.\n\nThe  Group's  program  for  promoting  diversity  and inclusion focuses on three key priorities:\n\n## 1. Instilling a culture of equality and inclusion across the Group via awareness initiatives undertaken throughout the year and via its HR and management processes (recruitment, talent review, remuneration, etc.)\n\nTo  coincide  with  2020  International  Women's  Day, Kering  and  its  Houses  organized  a  large  number  of initiatives aimed at raising awareness among employees.  In  Paris,  the  Chief  Diversity,  Talent  and Inclusion  Officer  organized  a  discussion  panel  with various employees and executives from Kering and its Houses,  including C\u00e9dric Charbit (CEO, Balenciaga), to talk  about  the  challenges  faced  by  women  in  the workplace and beyond. Participants shared their vision of  gender  equality  and  their  practical  suggestions  for driving  progress  in  this  area.  The  videos  recorded during the event are available to all employees via the Kering Learning online training platform.\n\n## 2. Fostering work-life balance via a Group-wide policy for all employees that promotes well-being at work and equality for all\n\nMany  other  initiatives  have  also  been  adopted  by Kering's  various  Houses,  including  remote  working, flextime  and  childcare  solutions  in  France,  Italy  and the  United  States,  as  well  as  daycare  centers  for employees  based  in  France  and  nursing  rooms  for employees in Hong Kong.\n\n## 3. Developing an inclusive and exemplary parental policy\n\nKering  has  been  committed  to  a  wide-reaching parental  policy  since  2017,  supporting  parents  and helping  to  create  a  culture  of  equality  in  the  Group. Baby  Leave  (see  section  2.5)  contributes  to  gender equality  in  a  practical  way  by  guaranteeing  the  same parental  leave  rights  to  both  men  and  women, ensuring equality for all Kering employees.\n\nBy  offering  men  and  women  the  same  parental  leave rights and introducing new, more flexible organizational methods,  Kering  is  taking  effective  action  to  combat the  prejudices  women  face  whenever  they  apply  for  a job,  seek  a  promotion  or  attempt  to  advance  their careers.\n\n## Promoting the advancement of talented women in the Group through special development programs\n\nAs  part  of  its  2025  sustainability  strategy,  Kering  has undertaken  to  promote  diversity  and  gender  equality through  a  series  of  concrete  commitments,  which include  achieving  gender  parity  at  all  levels  of  the organization and introducing a mentoring program for women on a global scale.\n\nIn 2013, Kering launched a pilot session of inter-brand and  inter-business  mentoring  in  France  for  talented women. The idea was based on a structured process lasting a year, building on a one-on-one relationship in which  an  experienced  female  manager  (mentor) would share her expertise with a more junior female manager (mentee) in order to foster her professional and personal development.\n\nMentees  and  mentors  alike  have  acclaimed  this program, which is now part of the Group's full catalogue of  talent  development  offerings  and  has  been  rolled out  internationally.  This  year,  around  sixty  talented women from the Group's various Houses in Hong Kong, China,  South  Korea,  France,  Italy  and  the  United Kingdom  enjoyed  a  year's  individual  support  from  the Group  leaders.  The  mentors  are  primarily  women  who have benefited from a talent development program and now wish to share their experience with others.\n\nFor  the  past  five  years,  Kering  has  also  partnered  the EVE program, which enables 15 employees from various Group Houses and countries to participate in seminars in  Europe  and  Asia.  Founded  in  2010  by  Danone,  this unique  management  program,  aimed  at  those  who aspire to 'enlightened' leadership, works on two levers: the  individual  and  the  organization.  It  aims  to  nurture strong  and  inspiring  individuals,  in  sufficient  numbers to  enable  them  to  bring  about  corporate  change.  In 2019, EVE program graduates from the past four years also integrated Kering's mentoring program as mentors, to  support  change  and  share  the  lessons  learned  with other talented employees within the Group. The global pandemic prevented these seminars from taking place in  2020.  However,  Kering  remains  committed  to  this partnership.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  in  2020  Kering  published  its  France  2019 Gender  Equality  Index  for  its  Corporate  entities  and Houses in France, with a score of 95 points out of 100 for Kering Corporate, marking it as one of the leaders in this area.\n\n## Recognizing and assessing the impact of gender equality initiatives\n\nIn  2020,  women  accounted  for  55.4%  of  the  Group's managers, 63.1% of the total workforce (62.9% in 2019, 62.9%  in  2018),  33%  of  its  Executive  Committee members and 58% of its Directors (excluding Directors representing  employees),  making  Kering  one  of  the CAC  40  companies  with  the  highest  proportion  of women  in  senior  management  positions.  The  Group has  set  a  target  of  achieving  a  balanced  gender  mix and equal pay at all levels of the organization by 2025.\n\nKering  came  ninth  in  the  2020  Equileap  Top  100 ranking  published  in  March  2021,  which  recognizes companies  that  lead  the  way  in  achieving  gender equality globally.\n\nEfforts  made  to  promote  female  talent  provide  an overall  reflection  of  how  committed  the  Group  is  to women, both inside and outside the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 through  the  Kering  Foundation,  which  combats violence  against  women  by  supporting  projects  led by  NGOs  and  social  entrepreneurs  and  by  raising awareness  and  promoting  involvement  among  the Group's  employees.  The  Kering  Foundation  also works  to  raise  awareness  among  employees  by involving them  in many  of  its projects. On International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Violence against Women (November 25), the Kering Foundation  launched  the  '16  Days  16  Films' campaign in the United Kingdom, France and Italy, in partnership with Modern  Films  and  with  the participation  of  non-profit  organizations En  Avant Toute(s) ,  Chayn  Italia,  the  National  Network  to  End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), Fondo Semilias and  the 'UK  SAYS  NO  MORE'  campaign.  In  line  with  UN Women's '16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based\n\nViolence',  16  films  directed  by  women  were  posted on social media  between  November  25  and December  10.  The  campaign  reached  more  than 900,000 people in five countries via social and print media (see section 5.4.1);\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group  firmly  believes  that  businesses  have  a decisive  role  to  play  in  combating  violence  against women. In line with International Labour Organization  (ILO)  Convention  190  on  violence  and harassment in the workplace, the Kering Foundation worked with the Group Human Resources Department  in  2020  to  draft  a  global  policy  on domestic  violence  presenting  the  internal  program developed  by  its  teams,  which  aims  to  provide appropriate  support  for  survivors  and  victims  of domestic  violence.  Also  in  2020,  as  part  of  the mandatory  annual  online  training  program  on ethics and compliance, a domestic violence module was  developed  jointly  with  the  Human  Resources Department  and  made  available  to  all  Group employees. Lastly, on November 25, 2020, International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Violence against  Women,  the  Kering  Foundation  presented the Group's global policy on domestic violence;\n- \u00b7 in  partnership  with  the  Kering  Foundation,  Kering sensitizes  its  employees  to  the  issue  of  domestic violence. The workplace impact of domestic violence was one of the four modules in the Ethics and Compliance mandatory annual training program in 2020;\n- \u00b7 in  the  film  industry,  as  an  Official  Partner  of  the Cannes Film Festival, Kering showcases and supports  the  contribution  of  women  to  the  film industry,  both  behind  and  in  front  of  the  camera, through its Women in Motion initiative;\n- \u00b7 in  its  supply  chains,  notably  via  the  wide-reaching study on women's role in the supply chain in Italy's luxury  segment,  which  was  initiated  by  Kering  and its Italian Houses in 2019, in collaboration with the Camera  Nazionale  della  Moda  Italiana (CNMI)  and three  non-profits  specialized  in  this  area  -  BSR, Wise Growth and Valore D (see section 4.2.5).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This agreement reiterates and reinforces  the  commitments  made  to  employee representatives in 2008 with regard to promoting the employment of people with disabilities.\n\nEach year, management presents a progress report to the European Works Council on the agreement's three pillars,  which  include  promoting  diversity  in  general, and on the initiatives undertaken by the Houses in the areas of gender equality and equal opportunity.\n\nThe Group's Houses in France and Italy also continue to outsource  to  the  sheltered  sector  to  promote  the employment of people with disabilities. Special service providers employing workers with disabilities are called on  for  such  services  as  printing,  data  entry,  archiving, replying to unsolicited applications, catering, preparing mailshots, gift packaging during the holiday season, and landscaping.\n\nKering  Corporate  and  the  Group's  Houses  also  forge partnerships  and  deploy  awareness  campaigns  to ensure that employees are onboard.\n\nGucci works with a specialized NGO to help people with Down  syndrome  integrate  its  production  site  in Florence.  Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  have initiated  a  project  with  Swiss  foundation  alfaset  and are currently discussing various options for integrating people  with  disabilities  into  their  workshops,  as interns or on contracts relating to specific projects. In 2020, Kering Corporate France invited its employees to play Le Bureau des S\u00e9ries , an online game where users explore  different  types  of  disabilities  via  around twenty  popular  TV  programs.  The  game  is  a  fun, interactive  way  to  raise  awareness  about  disability diversity and the importance of fostering a culture of inclusion.\n\n## Forging partnerships to facilitate the employment of young or disadvantaged people\n\nTo preserve and pass on their expertise, several of the Group's  Houses,  namely  Gucci,  Bottega  Veneta  and Brioni,  have  created  vocational  schools  and  training\n\nprograms, with the support of trade associations. The aim is to give young people the opportunity to learn a trade  that  will  ultimately  enable  them  to  join  one  of the Group's Houses or find employment elsewhere in the luxury or fashion industries.\n\nIn France, to support the government's urban equality efforts, Kering signed partnership agreements in 2018 to  enable  young  people  from  priority  neighborhoods to  join  the  Group's  Houses  as  interns,  apprentices  or employees.  These  agreements  were  put  into  practice in  2019. The aim of the first partnership, signed with non-profit  organizations  that  specialize  in  promoting youth employment, is to offer one-week internships to 14and 15-year-olds from schools in priority education  areas.  The  second  partnership  focuses  on the  recruitment  of  young  people  from  disadvantaged neighborhoods,  either  on  work-study  programs  or permanent  contracts. The initiative is ongoing. However, the health crisis forced the Group to suspend it temporarily in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Gucci in Italy again won a 'Welcome. Working for  Refugee  Integration'  award  from  UNHCR,  the  UN Refugee Agency, for its efforts to integrate around ten refugees  into  the  working  world,  primarily  at  its workshops  in  Florence.  Alongside  UNHCR  and  equal opportunity non-profit Fondazione Adecco, the House pursued  its  commitment  to  integrating  refugees  into its sites, plants and stores in Italy via an employment and training program baptized #forRefugees.\n\n## 3.1.2.2 Development of talent and skills\n\nDeveloping skills and talents is at the heart of Kering's HR policy.\n\nIn  2020, in light of the pandemic and its consequences, Kering adapted its practices and sped up the digitalization of its talent and  skills development initiatives. It also pooled together its talent management and  training  functions,  strengthening  collaboration  and creating a broader community within the Group's Houses.\n\nThe community focused on two key objectives during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 enhancing Kering's career development practices;\n- \u00b7 maintaining  its  training  initiatives  despite  being unable  to  conduct  them  face-to-face,  and  turning this into an opportunity to reach a wider audience by using new technologies.",

        "page_content": "## Managing and supporting talent, and fostering mobility and professional development within the Group\n\nKering has set itself the priority of better identifying and developing  talent,  and  has  for  this  purpose  established processes  and  tools  geared  towards  helping  employees constantly expand their career prospects and strengthen their skills through mobility and career opportunities.\n\n## 1. Identifying and developing talent, supporting future leaders and organizing succession plans\n\nTalent and leadership potential are identified through the performance appraisal process and talent reviews.\n\nIn January 2019, the Group adopted a new approach to performance  management  by  introducing  regular 'check-in  conversations'.  The  new  system  enables employees  to  establish  ongoing  dialogue  with  their managers  throughout  the  year,  covering  both  their performance and their development.\n\nTo support this new process, Kering intends to develop a  performance culture with clearly defined objectives and  regular  feedback,  so  that  all  employees  know exactly what is expected of them. Training is provided to  managers  to  give  them  the  skills  necessary  to handle  difficult  conversations,  but  also  to  help  their team members with their medium-term career plans. To ensure that employees receive appropriate support, the  Group  provides  training  to  Human  Resources teams via the HR Academy. The Academy trains each House's  HR  teams  so  that  they  can  then  provide  the necessary  training  to  the  managers  and  employees within their scope. In 2020, 146 HR employees (40% of local HR staff) participated in the training program and are now ready to pass on its content to others.\n\nOnce  talented  individuals  have  been  identified,  the aim is to gain a clearer picture of their profile, define the support initiatives needed in terms of organization and  talent  development,  and  prepare  succession plans  for  key  positions.  The  talent  identification process  covered  all  Group  Houses  in  2020,  enabling talent  management  to  be  considered  on  two  levels: within  each  House  and  Group-wide.  Talent  Reviews, which bring together all the Houses' Human Resources Directors  and  their  Corporate  equivalents,  provide  a forum  for  discussing  the  pool  of  talent  within  the Group, based on a shared vocabulary. They serve to lay down development plans for the talented individuals identified and to build succession plans to ensure the effectiveness of the organization.\n\n## 2. Promoting mobility and careers within the Group and its Houses\n\nProfessional  mobility  is  a  pivotal  means  to  help develop skills, offer career prospects and give everyone the opportunity to grow within the Group.\n\nToday, the employee management platform is used to communicate  about  vacancies  with  the  utmost transparency. Its aim is to allow employees to view job opportunities,  published  by  each  entity  within  the Group. All the Houses are present on the platform and post  job  offers  to  provide  greater  visibility  for  their organization and possibilities for career development. The introduction of the new platform has enabled the Group  to  strengthen  its  communications  about  the internal  mobility  program  and  improve  the  digital experience  of  internal  applicants.  In  2019,  the  Group provided  teaching  materials  to  explain  the  mobility procedure,  continued  to  post  new  vacancies  and  ran regular communication campaigns targeting all employees, including weekly job postings by region or country  under  'Jobs  on  the  Move'  on  the  corporate social network. These measures continued in 2020.\n\nTo  facilitate  dialogue  about  career  development  and mobility,  a  specific  training  program  has  been  created on the topic of career conversations. The program was offered to all members of the Group's HR community in 2020  and  was  rolled  out  to  managers  and  employees during the year.\n\n## Developing a structured training policy for all employees\n\nIn  2020,  the  Kering  group  devoted  a  budget  of \u20ac22  million  to  employee  training,  corresponding  to 1.1%  of  the  total  Group  payroll.  On  this  basis, 541,565  hours  of  training  (excluding  safety  training) were provided across Kering's Houses during the year, and  37,278  employees  took  at  least  one  training course. In 2020, 96.7% of employees received training, representing a sharp increase on the previous year.\n\nWomen accounted for 63.1% of the workforce trained in 2020 (excluding safety training). Furthermore, 83.9% of employees trained were non-managers.\n\nIn  light  of  the  Houses'  new  operations  and  Kering's new projects, the significant increase in the number of people  trained  and  the  number  of  training  hours illustrates  the  Group's  desire  to  give  employees  the means to develop and to assist new staff members.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This community develops and shares a  common  framework  for  the  co-development  by  the Houses of tools, practices and initiatives that contribute to the decentralized but consistent management of the programs  offered  to  employees.  Since  April  2020,  it meets every month via video conference.\n\nThe  regions  contribute  to  adapting  this  offer  to  the local needs of each geographical area.\n\nThe training offer is built around three main principles:\n\n- \u00b7 fostering a culture of learning;\n- \u00b7 empowering  employees  to  take  an  active  role  in their development;\n- \u00b7 remaining  agile  and  taking  advantage  of  new learning methods.\n\nWithin  this  common  framework,  three  key  priorities have been developed for the Group:\n\n- 1. Developing digital training pathways with the introduction of a new platform integrated into the HR information system: Kering Learning\n\nAfter  reviewing  its  digital  training  offer  in  2020,  Kering decided  to  deploy  a  single  platform  accessible  to everyone  that  would  enable  the  Group  to  share  key\n\ntraining content while also allowing each of the Houses to add specific content of their own. Kering Learning is the  entry  point  for  the  entire  training  offer  for  all employees of Kering and its Houses worldwide.\n\nThe  platform  is  now  linked  up  to  the  Group's  HR information  system,  ensuring  a  seamless  learning experience  for  employees  and  creating  a  consolidated reporting process that uses all HR data. Kering Learning offers  a  diverse  range  of  multi-format,  multi-device resources  that  are  open  to  all  Group  employees  and structured  around  eight  themes.  Two  complementary approaches are offered to maximize learning impact:\n\n- \u00b7 a  'push'  approach  that  promotes  learning  paths dedicated to specific topics, where the employee is guided through the learning process;\n- \u00b7 a  'pull'  approach  that  leaves  employees  free  to manage  their  own  training,  either  by  consulting isolated  content  or  by  developing  a  personalized learning path based on the resources available.\n\nCertain Houses, like Saint Laurent and Gucci, also use dedicated 'mobile-first' solutions aimed, for example, at retail employees.\n\n## Kering Learning's training offer is structured around eight themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Mastering my Kering essentials.\n- \u00b7 Embracing diversity and inclusion.\n- \u00b7 Expanding my digital knowledge.\n- \u00b7 Exploring my health & well-being.\n- \u00b7 Growing my management and leadership.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Increasing my business impact.\n- \u00b7 Increasing my personal effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 Learning a language.\n\n'Kering essentials' brings together content that forms the  foundation  of  Kering's  values,  such  as  the standards of responsible luxury and our commitments in the area of ethics and compliance.\n\nDuring  the  first  lockdown,  in  first-half  2020,  a  20% increase  in  the  number  of  users  connected  to  Kering Learning  was  recorded,  as  well  as  a  30%  increase  in time spent on digital training, highlighting the need to provide a diverse range of live and recorded resources across  all  formats:  e-learning  modules,  webinars, videos, master classes, and learning or test quizzes.\n\n## 2. Developing and maintaining a regional offer for managers and employees from all Group Houses\n\nIn 2020, to meet the needs expressed by its Houses in an agile manner, Kering developed regional programs structured  around  dedicated  themes.  By  using  an online  format  for  these  programs,  rather  than  the usual  face-to-face  format,  the  Group  was  able  to increase  participation  and  align  content  to  local situations and emerging needs.\n\n## A robust management training offer that allows managers to learn via new tools and share their experiences\n\nWith  two  digital  programs  that  focus  on  managerial skills  (People  Management  Essentials  and  Advanced Management),  Kering  was  able  to  provide  training  to many of its managers despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Face-to-face  instruction  was  replaced  by  online programs  spread  over  six  to  eight  weeks,  making  it easier  for  managers  to  integrate  training  into  their schedules.  The  format  alternated  between  virtual classes  in  groups  of  ten  and  practical  work  to  be carried out at home, enabling participants to optimize their time. Offered to all Houses, these programs also provide an opportunity to meet other managers from diverse backgrounds and to build a sense of belonging to the Group.\n\n## Programs developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn light of the changes to work practices driven by the crisis, programs  addressing  specific  topics  were developed  in  2020,  in  accordance  with  the  Houses' needs, to develop the skills and techniques required by their employees.\n\nThese included virtual team management,  the organization of digital meetings, managing your time and energy when working from home, and developing resilience. More traditional training programs on such topics as working with other cultures and creating an inclusive work environment are also proposed.\n\n- \u00b7 In  Europe,  653  employees  were  trained  in  2020 thanks to the 48 virtual programs on offer.\n- \u00b7 In  Asia,  excluding  managerial  programs,  which  are offered in face-to-face format, 252 employees were trained  in  2020  thanks  to  the  15  virtual  programs offered.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  launched  the  Gucci  Supply  Chain Academy, a customized training program that focuses on the various key skills required in the supply chain function,  such  as  demand  forecasting,  inventory management  and  inventory  control.  Developed  by  a cross-functional  project  team,  with  support  from  Tor Vergata  University  of  Rome,  the  program  aims  to standardize and share knowledge across all teams and enable them to anticipate market trends and respond to  the  commercial  challenges  ahead.  In  total,  nearly 100  supply  chain  employees  participated  in  the  first eight webinars, which each lasted 2.5 hours.\n\n## 3. Digitalization of the Group's talent programs\n\nBy digitalizing its talent programs in 2020, the Group was  able  to  increase  the  number  of  participants  and implement  innovative  training  practices.  The  efforts made in this regard illustrate Kering's commitment to employee skills development, despite the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Kering Leadership\n\nComposed  of  three  four-day  modules  held  over 12  months,  the  Kering  Leadership  program  brings together  approximately  25  leaders  in  a  multicultural context  each  year.  The  aim  is  to  nurture  talented employees  and  develop  their  leadership  capacities. The program also provides an opportunity to share a common  vision  of  the  Group  and  its  ambitions, challenges and values. The class of 2020 consisted of participants  from  ten  countries  and  ten  different Houses and Group entities.\n\n- \u00b7 The  first  module,  Exploring  Kering,  which  gets  the program  rolling,  is  an  important  moment  of understanding  and  exchange  about  the  Group's vision, challenges  and  transformation  projects through dialogue sessions with members of Kering's Executive Committee and the heads of the various Houses. This module was able to take place in Paris in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  seeks  to  foster improved  leadership  practice  through  teaching  by renowned  professors,  talks  by  entrepreneurs  from the  digital  economy  and  the  organization  of co-development workshops drawing on each participant's experience. It also features a significant individual dimension with each participant  completing  a  360\u00b0  feedback  course before  embarking  on  the  leadership  development program. This module was unable to take place in 2020.  However,  a  virtual  version  is  scheduled  for April 2021.\n- \u00b7 The third module, Transforming Kering, is usually held in Shanghai. This year, a virtual version was organized. Participants  worked  on  four  key  themes  over  a four-month period to gain a better understanding of the  ecosystem  surrounding  Chinese  customers, their  habits  and  resources,  and  the  impact  of  the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## Kering Influence Online\n\nIn 2020, the Group implemented a new, international and 100% virtual program known as Kering Influence Online.  Targeting  the  Group's  young  leaders,  the program brought together 57 people from the Group's various businesses, covering 10 different nationalities. The online program, which replaced the conventional Kering Influence program, precedes the Kering Leadership  program  and  serves  as  a  first  step  in leadership  development.  It  gave  participants  the opportunity  to  reflect  on  the  complexity  of  the situation  and  to  find  resources  to  manage  the  crisis and  the  associated  changes  in  work  practices  as effectively  as  possible.  Participants  benefited,  over  a six-month period,  from  internal  conferences,  training with external service providers, participation in working groups and individual support.\n\n## Kering Vision\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched a new type of program for talented  young  employees  called  Kering  Vision.  The program was overhauled in 2020 to enable it to take place  virtually.  For  three  half-days  per  week  over  a three-week  period,  35  participants  from  Europe  and Asia  collaborate  on  a  strategic  Group  project.  In preparation for their work on these projects, participants  meet  members  of  the  Kering  Executive Committee  and  business  leaders  from  other  luxury companies  and  adjacent  industries  and  learn  new work methods. At the end of the program, they present their  projects  to  a  jury  of  senior  executives  from Kering and its Houses.\n\n## Digital skills development resources: 360\u00b0 feedback and one-on-one coaching\n\nThe  360\u00b0  feedback  system  is  designed  above  all  for executives facing a new professional challenge, such as taking up a new strategic function. Using information on the  perception  of  participants'  skills  obtained  from several  sources  (supervisors,  colleagues,  employees, clients, etc.), the approach serves to enhance development  potential.  Each  leader  has  a  one-on-one coaching  session  to  analyze  the  results  and  define  an action plan for personal and professional development.\n\nThis  type  of  individual  development  mechanism  is often  also  backed  up  by  collective  development programs  as  described  in  the  Kering  Leadership program. The objective is both to customize as far as possible  what  each  participant  takes  away  from  the course,  but  also  to  foster  a  culture  of  development feedback between experienced participants.\n\nIt is also  possible  to  set  up  virtual  one-on-one coaching for a specific issue via access to an external coaching platform. Each House can benefit from this solution  for  its  employees  and  implement  it  on demand.\n\n## 3.1.2.3 Employee commitment: putting employees at the center of all initiatives\n\nThe  Kering  group  has  identified  the  development  of employee commitment as one of its strategic priorities. Over  the  years,  Kering  fosters  employee  commitment through shared experiences, helps to create a common culture, and strengthens the feeling of belonging to an integrated Luxury Group.\n\nKering  has  therefore  provided  all  its  employees worldwide with access to a global, shared communication  tool.  The  June  2018  launch  of Workplace, a next-generation corporate social network,  radically  changed  the  style  and  scale  of  the communication  campaigns  conducted  within  the Group and with its Houses. In July 2020, the network had achieved a record employee take-up rate of 92%, demonstrating  the  effectiveness  of  this  new  internal communication  tool  for  all  Houses  and  regions, including  China  thanks  to  the  April  2019  launch  of Lexiang,  a  platform  dedicated  to  Chinese  employees. This new  era of increased transparency gives unprecedented visibility to the Group's global communication  campaigns  about  its  values  and policies.  Over  2,500  active  communities  have  been created  via  the  platform  since  its  creation  and  more than 70% of employees use it at least once a month.",

        "page_content": "The quality of Kering information and its accessibility for employees worldwide have therefore been strengthened considerably throughout the year. Everyone  at  Kering  now  has  a  voice  and  can  access Group  information  at  any  time,  via  any  device (computer,  smartphone  or  tablet).  The  proximity between employees and Group leaders has also been greatly  enhanced,  thanks  to  live  broadcasts  of  major events  on  the  corporate  social  network,  with  Q&A sessions  that  enable  frank  discussions,  speeding  up the creation of a common culture.\n\n## An internal communication campaign to keep employees motivated, engaged and inspired during the lockdowns triggered by COVID-19\n\nFrom  the  very  first  week  of  lockdown  in  2020, management  teams  took  part  in  an  intense  internal communication campaign composed of regular posts on  the  Group's  corporate  social  networks  Workplace and  Lexiang.  The  campaign  was  designed  to  (i)  keep employees  informed  about  the  health  and  safety measures  implemented  by  the  Group  and  about  the latest business and HR developments; (ii) boost team moral  and  encourage  positive  thinking;  (iii)  maintain employee engagement despite the difficulties associated  with  the  lockdown.  Executives  also  took part in a series of online discussions to communicate their  vision  and  answer  employees'  questions.  In addition, a dedicated discussion group was created on the corporate social network to enable all employees, from  all  Houses  and  regions,  to  talk  freely  with  their co-workers  during  this  challenging  time.  Each  of  the Houses  also  created  its  own  groups  dedicated  to supporting their teams throughout the lockdown.\n\nRegular  updates  about  the  global  health  situation were published internally, with the participation of the employee  representative  organizations.  The  French Works  Council  and  the  European  Works  Council maintained their plenary meetings, which provided an opportunity to discuss the impact of COVID-19 and the health and HR measures shared by the Group with its Houses.\n\n## Global communication campaigns about the Group's values and policies\n\nThe major internal communication campaigns conducted by  Kering  strengthen  the  Group's  shared  history  and vocabulary  and  enable  the  deployment  of  new  HR resources  and  policies  centered  around  the  Group's shared values:\n\n- \u00b7 a culture of integrity: for the fifth consecutive year, a five-week communication campaign was conducted via  the  two  corporate  social  networks  to  inform  all employees about Kering's culture of integrity and the\n\nethical  principles  applicable  across  the  Group.  The campaign backed up the messages conveyed by the 'Do  the  Right  Thing!  Now  More  Than  Ever'  online training course, which is mandatory for all employees in all Houses. In 2020, the campaign focused on four topics:  anti-corruption,  responsible  supply  chains, diversity  and  inclusion  in  the  workplace,  and  the impact of domestic violence on the work environment.\n\n- \u00b7 the key HR policies deployed worldwide, such as the internal  mobility  policy  and  the  parental  policy, enjoy greater visibility  thanks  to  testimonials  from employees  who  have  benefited  from  one  of  these policies and a weekly spotlight on job vacancies on the corporate social network;\n- \u00b7 in  line  with  the  Group's  commitment  in  favor  of women,  a  major  campaign  was  carried  out  to support International Women's Day on March 8, 2020, based on two key events:\n- - a  viral  campaign  was  conducted  on  the  two corporate  social  networks  on  the  topic  of  'the woman  who  inspires  me',  with  359  employees posting  a  few  words  about  the  woman  who inspires them the most and why,\n- - a round table was organized as a physical event, with  women  from  various  backgrounds  talking about their respective experiences as a woman, in both the personal and professional spheres.\n- \u00b7 given  the  nature  of  its  businesses  and  the  client base  of  its  Houses,  combating  violence  against women is a key issue for the Group, which has been committed  to  this  cause  since  2008  through  the Kering  Foundation.  Since  2011,  1,402  employees, including  the  Group  Executive  Committee,  have received  training  to  ensure  that  Kering  provides  a supportive  work  environment  for  women  who  are victims of domestic violence;\n- \u00b7 the  internal  communication  process  is  regularly enhanced  by  live  chats  on  the  corporate  social networks  between  employees  and  one  of  the executives,  on  topics  as  diverse  as  sustainability, financial results and business strategy;\n- \u00b7 to encourage  open  dialogue  between  Group executives and employees who do not usually have the opportunity to meet them, a series of informal breakfasts were organized to enable employees to talk openly with senior management.\n\nCertain  internal  events  designed  to  bring  employees together,  foster  cohesion  and  enhance  employee engagement  had  to  be  canceled  in  2020  because  of the pandemic, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the  annual  picnic  in  the  gardens  of  Kering's headquarters, which is open to all employees based in  the  Paris  region  and  usually  attracts  more  than 800 participants from all Houses;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The aim is to foster  employee  commitment  to  the  values  of sharing  and  solidarity  and  forge  long-lasting  ties and a shared culture within the Group;\n- \u00b7 'Family Day', which is a day of fun organized for the children of employees  based  at  the  Group's headquarters in Paris;\n- \u00b7 the Kering Foundation encourages Group employees  to  use  their  professional  or  personal skills  to  support  NGOs  or  social  enterprises.  Since 2014,  employees  who  take  two  weeks'  solidarity leave to volunteer in a foreign country have received two  to  four  days'  paid  leave.  In  2019,  Kering donated 54 days' paid leave for volunteer work and pre-departure training, and 15 employees went on assignments  in  the  field,  accompanied  by  the Group's  partners  MovingWorlds  and  Nest.  In  2020, only one employee was able to leave for a volunteer assignment  in  India  before  the  global  COVID-19 pandemic forced the Solidarity Leave program to be suspended for the rest of the year.\n\n## 3.1.2.4 Quality of life at work\n\nAs early as 2010, Kering signed a 'Charter of commitments  on  the  quality  of  life  at  work  and    the prevention  of  work-related  stress'  with  the  Group's European Works Council.  This  charter  has  enabled  the Houses to develop and implement action plans based on three key principles:\n\n- 1. Identifying  and  assessing  the  causes  of  stress  in the workplace.\n- 2. Deploying preventive measures to improve quality of life at work and reduce workplace stress factors.\n- 3. Keeping employees informed and giving them the opportunity  to  provide  anonymous  feedback  so that  the  Houses'  action  plans  can  be  adapted, adjusted or enhanced.\n\nSince 2015, health, safety and the quality of working life have  been  the  key  thrusts  of  Kering's  commitments under  the  European  agreement  signed  with  the European Works Council on February 19, 2015. Within this  framework,  the  Houses  are  adopting  procedures and taking action to identify, assess, reduce and prevent the  key  risks  associated  with  their  activities.  They  are also  taking  initiatives  designed  to  achieve  continuous\n\nimprovements in the quality of work life. Kering has in turn undertaken to develop a working environment and working relationships that ensure well-being at work, in order to promote the development of all employees and contribute to the Group's performance.\n\nQuality  of  life  at  work  is  also  an  everyday  concern. Employees therefore have the opportunity to provide feedback  on  their  working  conditions,  team  spirit, well-being  at  work  and  work-life  balance  during  the Group's  biannual  opinion  surveys.  Kering's  latest #Nofilter  People  Survey  included  an  open  question about quality of life at work.\n\nIn light of the global health crisis, the Group sought to ensure  transparency  and  empowerment  in  2020  by communicating on the corporate social networks. The Group  focused  its  efforts  on  providing  a  single, constant  stream  of  information  for  all  employees worldwide,  regardless  of  how  the  pandemic  was evolving  in  each  country.  Maintaining  ties  with employees  both  during  and  after  lockdown  periods contributed to the quality of working life.\n\n## Promotion of workplace safety and management of psychosocial risks\n\nIn  2020,  a  year  dominated  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic, the  management  structures  within  each  House  or country  organization  ensured  that  health  and  safety measures  were  implemented  at  all  levels  of  the organization  worldwide.  National,  regional  and  local procedures  were  developed  by  the  entities  to  put  into practice  Kering's  global  health  and  safety  policies.  A continuous  consultation  process  was  initiated  with employees on the topics of health, safety and well-being to enable everyone at Kering to contribute to compliance with  prevention  and  protection  measures.  The  Group's measures are structured around six areas:\n\n- 1. Protective equipment at Group sites.\n- 2. Health and safety measures at Group sites.\n- 3. Social distancing.\n- 4. Recommendations for working from home.\n- Examples  include  an  initiative  to  promote  the independent use of digital training resources, such as  the  Gucci  Retail  Academy  (10,950  employees trained),  and  guides  to  best  practices  for  remote working,  such  as  Kering  Corporate's  Home  Office Tips & Tricks.\n- 5. Recommendations for returning to the workplace.\n- 6. Psychological support.",

For  example,  personal messages  from  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  were  regularly  sent  directly  to all  employees.  To  improve  collaboration  between  the HR  teams  in  the  Group's  Houses,  a  best  practices database  was  set  up  to  identify  and  centralize  the various initiatives undertaken by the Houses in each of the areas cited above.\n\nIn addition, Kering and its Houses implemented numerous protective  measures  at  Group  sites  worldwide  to  ensure the health and safety of employees and clients, in line with\n\nthe  government's  recommendations in  each  country  and any  changes  to  such  recommendations.  Examples  of  the specific measures deployed include the daily supply of face masks, the provision of hand sanitizer in bottles or touchfree pumps, regular disinfection of premises, the introduction  of  staggered  working  hours  to  significantly reduce  the  number  of  employees  present  in  the  same workspace  at  the  same  time,  the  reorganization  of common  areas  to  facilitate  social  distancing  (thanks  to floor  markings,  for  example)  and  the  installation  of protective screens. Free PCR tests have also been offered to employees at certain sites.\n\nIn 2020, 209 lost-time accidents were recorded across all of the Group's Houses, compared with 325 in 2019.\n\nThe total number of work-related accidents was lower than in 2019, reflecting the closure of certain sites for part of the year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Frequency and severity rate of accidents in 2020, 2019 and 2018\n\n|                                                 | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Frequency of work-related accidents             |        |        |        |\n| (Number of accidents per million hours worked)  | 3.50   | 5.07   | 5.05   |\n| Severity rate of work-related accidents (1)     |        |        |        |\n| (Number of days lost per thousand hours worked) | 0.09   | 0.11   | 0.11   |\n\nAcross  all  of  the  Group's  Houses,  12  employees  were recognized as suffering from a work-related illness in 2020.\n\nThe Group's comprehensive health and safety policy is based on best practices from across the organization. It  aims to ensure that a clear governance structure is in place  and  regular  internal  audits  and  other processes are implemented Group-wide, with a view to achieving  the  ultimate  goal  of  zero  accidents.  It  also requires  the  Houses  to  take  specific  measures  to improve quality of life at work for retail employees and to conduct regular health and safety audits.\n\n## Employee profiles as of December 31, 2020 by area of activity (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Sales: employees working in wholesale, stores and e-commerce.

The Houses are attached to the principle of risk prevention and the preservation of occupational health and safety involving multiple stakeholders, including the Social and Economic  Committee's  Health,  Safety & Working Conditions team, ergonomists, occupational physicians and  external  prevention  specialists.  In  terms  of  risk\n\nprevention,  84,626  hours  of  safety  training  were provided to 10,799 Group employees in 2020, representing  an  increase  from  the  previous  year.  2020 was  shaped  by  continued  efforts  towards  achieving certification  and  formalizing  employee  health  and safety guidelines and procedures.\n\n## Overall lost time and sick leave (in %) in 2020, 2019 and 2018\n\n|                                    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Overall absenteeism rate           | 5.6%   | 4.9%   | 4.7%   |\n| Rate of absenteeism due to illness | 2.9%   | 2.5%   | 2.3%   |\n\nThe total figure for absenteeism due to illness includes sick  leave,  work-related  illness,  work-related  accidents and commute-related accidents. The overall absenteeism rate  includes  absenteeism  due  to  illness  and  every other kind of absence (maternity leave, paternity leave, unjustified  absences,  etc.),  calculated  from  the  first day of absence.\n\nKering  also  works  to  prevent  psychosocial  risks  and offers its employees psychological support. In France, a  toll-free  number  is  available  to  all  employees  who feel that they require psychological support, regardless of the reason. Support  is  also  provided  when employees  are  collectively  affected  by  a  particular event or situation.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  initiatives,  the  Houses  explore various other avenues, including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying psychosocial risk factors at work (e.g.,  Kering  Corporate,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci through SA8000 and OHSAS 18001 certification);\n- \u00b7 preventing psychosocial risks and stress by bringing in  healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists, osteopaths,  sophrologists,  and  teachers  of  yoga, pilates,  and  meditation  (at  the  Kering  and  Saint Laurent headquarters), and providing social assistance  services  for  employees.  Audits  were conducted  in  2019,  for  Kering  Italia  and  Gucci,  to identify  strengths  in  this  area  and  avenues  for improvement;\n- \u00b7 promoting work-life balance (smart working, extension of the remote working program, flextime, etc.) and  introducing  the  right  and  duty  to disconnect  in  France  as  a  result  of  legislative changes. These changes notably relate to the right of  all  employees  to  disconnect  from  work  during non-working hours and their duty to regulate their use of digital devices during working hours.\n\n## Organization of work\n\nKering strives to implement  an  organized  and collective structure, as well as methods and know-how\n\nthat allow employees to work together in the interest of the Group and based on set objectives.\n\nThe  average  working  time  of  the  Group's  full-time employees is 40 hours per week. In 2020, 46,303  overtime  hours  were  logged  in  France,  a decrease versus 2019.\n\nIn  2020,  2,471  employees  had  contractual  weekly working  hours  below  the  standard  number  in  effect within their company. Staff working part time accounted  for  6.7%  of  permanent  employees,  down from the previous year, and were located mainly in the United States and Western Europe. Contractual working hours  are  spread  out  on  the  basis  of  the  specific business  and  organization  of  each  House,  either  over certain days of the week, or over reduced time slots on all working days.\n\nThe  organization  of  working  time  in  the  Group's Houses  varies  according  to  the  countries,  sites  and employees  concerned.  In  France,  work  is  most commonly organized on the basis of a fixed number of hours or days, with annualized working time and the possibility of flextime.\n\nBeyond these legal aspects, the Houses try to find and offer  more  flexible  ways  to  organize  working  time  in order to meet their own needs as well as those of their employees as part of their policy on quality of life at work: flextime for several Houses, the introduction of a smart  working  pilot  plan  at  the  Bottega  Veneta  and Gucci headquarters in Italy, continued remote working at  the  Kering  headquarters  in  Paris,  leave  to  care  for sick  children  at  Boucheron  and  part-time  work  at Pomellato.\n\nThe  topic  of  work  organization  continues  to  be addressed  by  the  Houses,  in  accordance  with  what they  do  and  whether  their  employees  work  in  stores, production facilities, workshops or support functions. Kering Corporate and the Houses make every effort to organize  the  work  of  employees  in  strict  compliance with  local  health,  safety  and  environment  guidelines, including those relating to the health crisis.",

        "page_content": "Against  the  backdrop  of  the  global  pandemic,  2020 saw  the  launch  of  a  project  on  new,  flexible  work methods, with the creation of  a  multi-brand  working group that meets in each country. Houses in the pilot countries  meet  regularly  to  share  best  practices  and talk  about  flexible  work  methods,  including  remote working. Discussions are also held with managers and employee  representatives  in  order  to  find  the  most appropriate  solutions  while  also  ensuring  employee well-being and a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## Promoting a better work-life balance and fostering workplace well-being\n\nThe Group and its Houses are implementing actions in favor  of  a  better  organization  of  professional  and personal lives, benefiting both men and women.\n\n## 1. The first avenue in this regard is a strong parental policy.\n\nThe  finest  testimony  to  Kering's  commitment  to work-life balance and its respect for working parents is its  comprehensive  parental  policy,  deployed  in  60 host  countries  on  January  1,  2017  and  further enhanced  by  the  introduction  of  Baby  Leave  on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe  policy  aims  to  promote  a  better  balance  between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to achieve  equality  between  female  and  male  employees, regardless of their personal circumstances, guaranteeing all  Group  employees  worldwide  the  same  minimum benefits on the arrival of a child.\n\nSince 2017, mothers receive 14 weeks' paid maternity leave,  in  line  with  the  ILO's  Maternity  Protection Convention  (No.  183),  and  employees  who  adopt  a child also benefit from 14 weeks' paid leave.\n\nSince  January  1,  2020,  fathers  and  partners  are  also eligible  for  14  weeks'  paid  leave  for  the  birth  or adoption of a child. Giving the same leave rights to all parents  represents  a  significant  step  forward  in improving  work-life  balance  for  employees.  The parental  policy  contributes  in  a  comprehensive  and inclusive way, for all the men and women of the Group, to promoting a well-being policy by setting a standard duration  and  payment  for  maternity,  paternity  and adoption  leave.  This  policy  helps  to  ensure  that  the Group's  employees  enjoy  more  rights  to  the  various forms  of  leave  than  is  required  under  national legislation and is applicable across all host countries, in line with ILO recommendations.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  and  Kering  Corporate  are  also implementing  initiatives  in  this  regard:  to  facilitate their  return  to  work,  Kering  Corporate  France  allows new  parents  to  opt  for  part-time  work  at  80%  of standard working hours without any loss of pay during the  month  following  their  return  from  maternity, paternity  or  adoption  leave;  Bottega  Veneta  has introduced  its  'Master  for  U'  program;  and  Gucci, Pomellato, Kering UK and Kering Italia all offer specific employee benefits.\n\n- 2. The second avenue is the introduction, where possible, of more flexible work methods that enable employees to better organize their lives, such as remote working in France and smart working in Italy (Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Kering Italia). At Balenciaga, the right to disconnect policy implemented in France has been extended to include all employees worldwide.\n\nFlexible work was suggested by Kering employees as a way of improving quality of life at work and enhancing work-life  balance,  in  response  to  the  open-ended question  included  in  the  employee  opinion  survey conducted in 2019 in all host countries. This desire for more  flexible  work  methods  is  consistent  with  the measures  deployed  by  the  Group  and  its  Houses  as part of their action plans.\n\nThe deployment of the HR platform has also contributed to improving quality of life at work by creating a shared language  for  information,  communication,  learning  and listening.  All  Group  employees  now  have  access  to  the same platform, regardless of their location, profession or position, representing a key factor in employee well-being.\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  the  global  pandemic,  2020 saw  the  launch  of  a  project  on  new,  flexible  work methods, with the creation of  a  multi-brand  working group.  The  Houses  were  also  able  to  capitalize  on measures  relating  to  well-being  at  work,  such  as  the organization  of  workplaces  in  line  with  the  highest standards,  as  well  as  flexible  work  times,  work-life balance and health and well-being.\n\nIn  addition,  in  relation  to  remote  working,  Executive Management decided to launch a project on new ways of  working.  The  project  will  assess  the  impact  of employees' experiences during the crisis in the Group's various  Houses  and  countries,  with  the  aim  of ensuring  business  continuity  and  maintaining  social ties. The  accelerated  deployment  of  these  new practices was supported by all teams, particularly the HR,  IT  and  Security  teams,  and  was  facilitated  by  the digitalization of the Group's communication platforms. The  work  underway  consists  of  examining  the  tools and  processes,  but  also  the  behavioral  changes associated with these new work methods in order to preserve  employee  performance,  engagement  and well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this way, Kering continues to create a work environment in which work-life balance is both an objective and a reality\n\nKering  receives  recognition  for  these  initiatives,  and the  Group's  participation  in  external  networks  serves to  promote its  developments in this area and help it continue to come up with innovative actions.\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  was  named  best  employer  for  women  in luxury in Italy for 2020. Bottega Veneta also earned Top Employer certification for 2019.\n- \u00b7 Kering  has  also  been  a  member,  since  2016,  of  a discussion  platform  initiated  by  the  International Labour  Organization  (ILO),  known  as  the  Global Business  Network.  It  is  also  a  member  of  the network's  French-speaking  branch,  which  brings together French-speaking companies  that  are committed to  developing  joint  international  social security programs.\n- \u00b7 Working  with  the \u00c9cole  nationale  sup\u00e9rieure  de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale fran\u00e7aise (French National School of Social Security, or EN3S), Kering helped develop an initial  guide  to  best  practice  that  outlines  the different  steps  in  the  process  of  developing  and implementing an international social security program.  Since  this  first  guide  was  published,  in November 2017, Kering has helped write a second guide, on mapping social security coverage worldwide,  which  was  published  in  2019  and presented to the ILO.\n- \u00b7 On November 28, 2019, for the ILO's 100 th anniversary,  Kering  was  invited  to  talk  about the progress made on its parental policy at the fifth annual meeting of the Global Business Network. The ILO  recognized  Kering's  contribution  to  extending social  protection,  which  benefits  thousands  of people worldwide.\n- \u00b7 In  2020,  Kering  participated  in  a  'parental  policy' working group with the EN3S to measure the impact of initiatives to support parents in French-speaking companies. The working group was set up following the  results  of  a  survey  on  this  topic,  which  were released in February 2020.\n\n## 3.1.3 Remuneration and employee benefits\n\n- \u00b7 Around  \u20ac2  billion  in  Group  personnel  expenses  in 2020  (see  note  7  to  the  consolidated  financial statements in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document).\n- \u00b7 \u20ac123  million  in  employer  contributions  from  the Houses in continental France in 2020.\n\n## 3.1.3.1 Remuneration policy\n\nRemuneration is a key component that managers can use to reward the commitment and the individual and collective performance of their teams.\n\nThe various components of the pay structure and their management  are  based  on  principles  defined  by  the Group, such as the close alignment between remuneration,  individual  contribution  and  collective performance.\n\nAccordingly,  90%  of  the  Group's  employees  receive  a fixed  salary  and  a  variable  pay  component  that  is subject  to  the  achievement  of  individual  and/or collective objectives.\n\nEfforts  are  made  to  ensure  that  the  amount  of  fixed salary received by each employee is both fair internally and  competitive  within  the  market.  Salaries  are reviewed  annually  on  the  proposal  of  line  managers. Fixed salary raises are granted in accordance with the level of the salary already achieved in comparison with peers and/or the external market, factoring in performance over time and the potential for development.  They  are  determined  independently  of any consideration whatsoever of gender or age.\n\nThe individual share of variable pay is determined and managed  as  part  of  the  performance  management process.  Each  employee's  contribution  to  the  team's results is assessed  by  their  direct  manager  in accordance  with  the  level  of  achievement  of  the targets set and their behavior throughout the year.\n\nThe existence of a shared framework for all jobs within the  Group  and  its  Houses  (known  as  the  'Job Catalogue') enables their accurate definition based on both area of expertise and level of responsibility. This is particularly helpful during the internal and external competitiveness analyses, which are regularly conducted by the Group, and for the fair allocation of variable pay and certain benefits in kind.\n\nIn  a  similar  spirit  of  recognizing  and  rewarding performance, the Group is eager to introduce incentive plans  in  countries  where  this  is  encouraged  by  the local legislation. As a result, four new agreements were signed in France in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## 3.1.3.2 Executive pay\n\nWithin  Kering's  senior  management  group  (Top  450), the  remuneration  of  300  people  in  particular  is monitored by the Group's Human Resources Department,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  internal consistency  and  competitiveness  in  light  of  industry practice.\n\nThe  remuneration  structure  for  senior  executives (portions  allocated  as  base  pay  and  as  short-  and long-term  variable  remuneration)  is  defined  by  the Group.  It  varies  in  accordance  with  the  level  of responsibility assigned to the role.\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration (annual bonus) policy  aims  to  reward  senior  executives  for  meeting objectives  -  in  part  financial  and  in  part  individual  set  in  line  with  the  strategy  of  the  Group  and  the Houses.  Financial  performance  is  assessed  on  the basis  of  two  indicators,  dedicated  to  measuring profitability (ROC) and assessing the quality of the free cash  flow  of  the  Group  and  the  Houses.  Moreover, individual objectives set for senior executives are also related to the achievement of team management and Group sustainability objectives.\n\nThe long-term profit-sharing policy meets two objectives, rewarding  executive  teams  for  their  performance  over time and for their loyalty to the Group.\n\n2020 saw the introduction of performance shares as a key  component  of  the  long-term  incentive  plan.  The number of shares granted to each executive varies in accordance  with  their  level  of  responsibility.  The number of shares that will actually be delivered at the end  of  the  vesting  period,  in  2023,  will  depend  (for +/-50% of the shares granted) on the performance of the  Kering  share  compared  to  a  reference  index  of luxury industry stocks.\n\nFor executives working within a Group House, the Kering performance  shares  are  accompanied  by  monetary units  in  the  same  proportion.  These  monetary  units were launched in 2013 and their unit value evolves over time  in  line  with  the  increase  in  the  House's  value.  At the end of a three-year vesting period starting from the year  that  the  monetary  units  were  granted,  executives have the opportunity to exchange their monetary units during two cash-in-windows per year over each of the subsequent two years.\n\n## 3.1.3.3 Employee benefits within the Group\n\nIn  addition  to  monetary  remuneration,  the  Kering group has always placed much importance on offering its  employees  healthcare,  disability/life  and  pension benefits. In addition to the coverage provided by law, virtually all employees therefore enjoy supplementary insurance through the various schemes put in place by the Group's Houses.\n\nFor  some  years,  various  Houses  have  offered  more comprehensive benefit plans in line with best practices in  each  country.  Such  plans  often  include  benefits relating  to  well-being,  sports,  education,  recreation, transportation  or  family  support.  These  popular  plans are  constantly  changing  to  better  meet  employees' expectations.\n\nFor  example,  Kering  has  developed  a  comprehensive parental policy that provides all parents in the Group, regardless of their personal circumstances or geographical location, with 14 weeks' leave on full pay for the birth or adoption of a child.\n\n## 3.1.4 Social dialogue\n\nThe  Kering  group  strives  to  ensure  ongoing  social dialogue specific to each of its bodies.\n\n2017 was marked by renewed social dialogue in Europe, which  led  to  the  signing  of  a  new  European  Works Council agreement and the renewal of its membership.\n\nThe main events in 2018 included the reorganization of  the  European  Works  Council  to  take  into  account changes  in  the  Group's  scope  of  consolidation  in Europe  (notably  following  the  deconsolidation  of PUMA),  the  presentation  on  Group  strategy  given  by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  the  Group's  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer, to members of the Council and a visit by Council members to the \u00c9cole de l'Amour at the Gucci ArtLab.\n\nHighlights in 2019 included three days of training on social  and  economic  fundamentals  for  new  Council members  and  a  tour  of  the  Kering  Eyewear  plant  in Sucy-en-Brie, France.\n\nDespite  the  health  crisis,  the  two  plenary  sessions  of the  European Works Council and the annual meeting of the French Works Council were held in 2020, either totally  or  partly  as  physical  meetings  with  all  of  the necessary protective measures. In addition to scheduled  meetings,  regular  updates  were  organized with the offices of the Group's  two  employee representative bodies in order to discuss such issues as the COVID-19 situation and the measures taken to protect the health and safety of employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Management and  representatives  from  the  EWC  met  for  four two-day  sessions  between  September  and  December 2014 to discuss and sign Kering's European agreement on behalf of the EWC.\n\nThe goal of the Empowering Talent agreement signed on February 19, 2015 is to underscore the priorities of Kering's  HR  policy  for  all  employees.  The  agreement sets out the Group's commitments in three key areas, namely to develop a working environment and working relationships  that  improve  quality  of  life  at  work,  to promote  diversity  and  foster  the  emergence  of  a culture of diversity and inclusion, and, lastly, to expand opportunities for all employees  to  boost  their professional development.\n\nThe  agreement  is  monitored  on  an  annual  basis  and the initiatives  taken  thereunder  were  reviewed  at  the EWC meeting in Paris on December 4, 2019.\n\nThe  commitments  have  also  been  adopted  by  each House.  In  2020,  316  collective  agreements  were concluded within the Group. They mainly covered pay and benefits (salary, variable remuneration, profit-sharing and incentives, etc.), working hours and the  organization  of  working  time  (remote  working, flextime,  generational  agreements,  temporary  work, donating leave, the right to disconnect, etc.), but also included  psychosocial  risk  prevention  and  video surveillance in the workplace.\n\nIn  2018,  the  Houses  in  France  negotiated  with  the unions  the  terms  governing  the  implementation  of work on Sundays with a view to allowing more stores to  open,  taking  into  consideration  the  wishes  of employees and their ability to organize their time.\n\nIn 2020, social dialogue provided a key opportunity to discuss  health  and  social  developments  in  France, Europe  and  worldwide.  Scheduled  meetings  and preparatory meetings were maintained, with the help of  an  expert,  ensuring  the  continued  success  of  the Group's employee representative bodies and its social dialogue process.\n\nSocial dialogue was also enhanced by direct messages to  employees  from  Group  and  House  executives  via Workplace, the corporate social network accessible to all employees, regardless of the local health situation. Communication with employees was constant, candid and open to comments.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of working hours of industrial action  totaled  150  in  2020,  compared  with  632  in 2019 and 6,601 in 2018.\n\n## 3.1.4.2 The Group's forums for social dialogue\n\n## The Kering European Works Council\n\nCreated pursuant to the agreement of September 27, 2000, the Kering European Works Council (EWC)  provides  a  Europe-wide  forum  for  information, consultation, the exchange of views and dialogue.\n\nThe principal purpose of the EWC is to become a key intermediary  in  the  development  of  social  dialogue between  European  countries  with  differing  realities and social practices.\n\nThe  EWC  is  a  cross-border  institution  and  operates alongside  existing  national  employee  representative bodies  in  accordance  with  specific  prerogatives.  The discussions that take place within the EWC enable the employee representatives to acquire a better knowledge and understanding of the Group's organization, strategy and main challenges.\n\nIn 2017, a new agreement was signed for an indefinite period.  Membership  of  the  Kering  EWC  was  renewed and reorganized in 2018, following the distribution of the  majority  of  the  Group's  shares  in  PUMA.  Prior  to taking  office,  all  members  received  three  days  of training on economic fundamentals. The members of the  Select  Committee  also  received  a  day  of  training on  social  dialogue  in  Europe.  This  training  offered members  an  opportunity  to  better  grasp  legal  and cultural differences existing in Europe, but also to see Kering's EWC agreement in light of legal requirements.\n\nThe EWC holds two three-day plenary sessions per year with  Group  Management,  at  which  it  is  informed  of and,  where  applicable,  consulted  on  cross-border issues  affecting  the  Group's  employees  in  a  manner defined in precise terms by the new agreement signed for an indefinite period.\n\nThe  EWC  also  has  a  Select  Committee  composed  of five  members,  elected  by  their  peers,  who  meet  at least four times a year to prepare and analyze the two annual plenary sessions and to discuss various issues with Group Management.",

        "page_content": "In  September  2019,  a  three-day  training  program  was developed for EWC members. In addition to giving them greater insight into social and economic fundamentals, the  program  was  designed  to  foster  team  cohesion, facilitate  discussion  and  enhance  members'  listening and communication skills. Thanks to a partnership with Kedge Business School, Council members learned more about  the  role  of  European  works  councils  from  an expert  in  workplace  relations  and  social  policies,  and about financial performance analysis and the indicators used  in  financial  communications  from  a  professor  of management science.\n\nThe training program for EWC members also included a  session  on  social  dialogue  and  corporate  social responsibility.  In  addition,  Council  members  were given  a  presentation  on  the  results  of  the  Kering People  Survey,  which  is  carried  out  in  all  Group countries, and on the analysis of the answers provided to  the  open-ended  question  on  quality  of  life.  This fostered  a  discussion  about  initiatives  to  enhance quality of life at work and workplace well-being.\n\nThe  two  plenary  sessions  of  the  European  Works Council  were  maintained  in  2020  and  were  held  on September 2 and 3 and on December 9 to 11, 2020. The  topics  discussed  with  Council  members  during these  plenary  sessions  and  at  the  meetings  of  its Select Committee  included:  the  appointment  by European  Works  Council  members  of  a  second Director  representing  employees  to  Kering's  Board  of Directors;  a  presentation  of  the  Group's  activities, outlook and strategy, including in the area of CSR, by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  the  Group's  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer;  an  analysis  of  the  financial results  published  by  the  Finance  Department;  a presentation  of  the  Group's  HR  and  Diversity  and Inclusion  strategy; and  a  discussion  relating  to questions  submitted  in  advance  by  members  of  the European Works Council.\n\n## The French Works Council\n\nWithin all of its Houses in France, the Group engages in social  dialogue  with  employee  representative  bodies and as part of negotiations with unions.\n\nCreated  in  1993  and  renewed  most  recently  in  2015, the Kering group Works Council represents workers in France  and  operates  under  French  law.  Its  members, who  meet  in  plenary  sessions  once  a  year,  are  kept informed  of  and  exchange  views  on  the  Group's strategies, economic and financial imperatives, and HR management policy.  The  plenary  session  is  preceded by  a  preparatory  meeting  of  members,  held  the  day before.\n\nIn  2018,  the  plenary  session  was  held  on  June  8  and included  presentations  on  the  Group's  2017  results, the findings of the Group's new employee survey and the roll-out of the new, integrated digital HR platform.\n\nThe agreement on which the French Works Council is based  and  the  terms  of  office  of  its  members  were extended via an agreement signed on February 6, 2019.\n\nOn  February  27,  2020,  an  agreement  renewing  the powers and resources attributed to the French Works Council was signed unanimously by the unions for an indefinite period. This also provided an opportunity to take into account  the  results  of  the  elections conducted  in  the  Group's  Houses  in  2019  for  the purpose  of renewing membership  of  employee representative organizations.\n\nThe  topics  addressed  during  the  virtual  meetings  of the  French  Works  Council  in  April  and  May  and  the physical meeting on September 29 and 30 included an update on the social, economic and financial situation of  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  a  presentation  on  the 2020 ethics and compliance training, and a discussion relating to questions submitted in advance by French Works Council members.\n\n## 3.2 Environmental footprint of Kering's operations\n\n## 3.2.1 Strategy and management\n\nAs the Care pillar of the Group's sustainability strategy, Kering's environmental approach is based on five key goals:\n\n- \u00b7 aim for the highest level of environmental protection through innovation;\n- \u00b7 make environmental concerns central to the activity of  the  Houses  by  involving  all  stakeholders  along the entire value chain;\n- \u00b7 go beyond mere compliance with legal environmental obligations, through a macro-environment  approach  such  as  that  of  the EP&L;\n- \u00b7 drive the Group's sustainability leadership, through a collaborative approach that favors the sharing of best practices, progress and results with competitors and stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 bring  a  culture  of  innovation  to  both  the  business model and the supply chain in order to integrate new technologies that significantly reduce environmental impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  nature  of  its  products  and  the  quality standards required of a luxury goods company mean that the Group is heavily dependent on raw materials from natural sources (such as wool, cashmere, leather, cotton and silk) and thus on the associated ecosystems,  whose  protection  is  essential  to  the production of quality raw materials.\n\nIn line with the Fashion Pact, Kering is targeting a 'net zero'  trajectory  aligned  with  the  goals  of  the  Paris Agreement. It aims to achieve this by:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing  its  emissions,  with  an  updated  Science Based Target (SBT) aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory;\n- \u00b7 offsetting emissions that cannot be reduced;\n- \u00b7 taking  into  account  material  climate-related  risks (physical  risks  and  transition  risks)  for  greater resilience.\n\nThe evaluation of climate risk is today an integral part of Group  risk  management  (see  Chapter  6  of  this  Universal Registration  Document).  The  Group's  climate  strategy  is also  described  in  Kering's  Climate  Change  2020  CDP response,  which  is  publicly  accessible  via  the  website www.cdp.net. In line with the recommendations issued by the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD), Kering's response includes information on:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's governance of climate-related risks and opportunities,  which  is  fully  integrated  into  its governance of sustainability,  described  in  detail  in the section entitled 'Governance and organization';\n- \u00b7 the  analysis  of  impacts  on  the  Group's  businesses and  the  climate-related  scenarios  used  for  the analysis, based on the RCP 2.6 scenario from the Fifth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the 2\u00b0C scenario, which states the need to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of between 41% and 72% by 2050;\n- \u00b7 the Group's management of climate-related risks;\n- \u00b7 the Group's climate-related targets and performance metrics.",

        "page_content": "To meet these targets, Kering has developed a climate strategy based on four main areas:\n\n## 1. Mitigation of climate-related risks through emissions reduction\n\nTo  set  a  relevant  carbon  footprint  reduction  target covering its main GHG emission sources, Kering opted to  take  up  the  framework  defined  by  the  Science Based Targets  Initiative.  In  2016,  Kering  was  the  first luxury  goods  group  verified  and  approved  by  the Science  Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi)  for  its  carbon footprint reduction targets. To strengthen its approach,  Kering's  SBT  for  a  1.5\u00b0C  trajectory  was revised and approved by the SBTi in early 2021. Kering has  therefore  made  the  following  commitments through 2030, based on its 2015 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 90% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from  Kering  operations  (whole  of  Greenhouse  Gas Protocol Scopes 1 and 2);\n- \u00b7 70% reduction in the intensity of supply chain-related  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (bought-in products and services under Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3), consistent with the EP&L objectives.\n\n## For Kering, this means:\n\n- \u00b7 minimizing  energy  use  by  taking  measures  to improve energy efficiency at Group facilities and in its transportation  methods  (see  section  3.2,  paragraph 'Measures  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of Kering's  operations'  and  'Optimizing  logistics  flows and switching to alternative transportation methods');\n- \u00b7 favoring 'low-carbon' energy by producing renewable energy  on  its  sites,  notably  through  the  use  of rooftop solar panels, and by purchasing power made from  renewable  sources  (or  'green  electricity') wherever possible. In 2020, Kering joined the RE100, a  global  initiative  led  by  the  Climate  Group  in partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which  aims  to  accelerate  change  towards  zero carbon  grids  worldwide.  As  part  of  this  initiative, Kering's objective is to use 100%  renewable electricity by 2022;\n- \u00b7 shifting  towards  supplies  with  a  lower  carbon impact  by  applying  the  Kering  Standards  -  which promote a circular, regenerative approach - for all key raw materials and manufacturing processes.\n\n## 2. Adaptation and resilience thanks to nature-based solutions\n\nSoil degradation and desertification pose a significant threat to the climate and to plant and animal species. They modify carbon storage capacities with medium-term consequences on the local climate, as well  as  on  a  global  scale.  On  the  other  hand,  the effective  management  of  land  and  bountiful  natural environments  such  as  forests  protects  and  creates powerful  carbon  sinks.  Scientists  say  that  these nature-based solutions could account for close to 30% of  the  world's  climate  change  mitigation  potential. This  set  of  measures  aims  to  support  resilience  and adaptation  to  climate  change  through  a  series  of actions  that  restore  and  protect  the  functionality  of ecosystems in order to reduce and sequester CO2.\n\nKering  therefore  intends  to  develop  nature-based solutions  both  within  its  supply  chains  and  beyond. Kering verifies that its supplies are not associated with any form of deforestation and gives priority to suppliers with  regenerative  agriculture  certificates.  To  achieve this,  Kering  requires  a  high  level  of  traceability  and includes specific clauses in its contracts with suppliers of  key  raw  materials.  This  is  reflected  in  the  Kering Standards, which are revised every year to ensure that they are aligned with the highest standards  in procurement. In addition, Kering has forged partnerships  with  NGOs  that  specialize  in  these  areas, such as Canopy for the fight against deforestation and the  Savory  Institute  and  Conservation  International  for the promotion of regenerative agriculture.\n\n## 3. Offsetting and achieving 'net zero'\n\nTo  achieve  its  goal  of  'net  zero'  by  2030,  Kering  has been  supporting  offsetting  programs  since  2012  via REDD+  projects.  The  aim  is  to  offset  the  emissions generated by all of the Group's activities (Scopes 1 and 2)  and  its  supply  chain  (Scope  3)  via  REDD+  projects that help  protect  critical forests and  safeguard biodiversity. The commitment made by Kering in 2019 therefore  continued  along  the  path  set  through  the program launched in 2011, which initially focused on Scopes 1 and 2 of the GHG Protocol.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability at the heart of the Group and its Houses\n\nThe Group is also working on shifting its carbon credits towards  more  innovative  projects  that  are  integrated into  its  supply  chain.  For  example,  in  2020,  Kering began  investing  in  Low  Carbon  Label  projects,  in partnership  with  IDELE  ( Institut  de  l'Elevage ),  which support  French  cattle  breeders  in  developing  more carbon-efficient practices.\n\nThe approach to offsetting 'unavoidable emissions' in the new climate strategy will be broadened to include other  natural  climate  solutions,  such  as  mangrove restoration and farming practices that enhance carbon sequestration.  The  standards  and  criteria  used  by Kering to select offsetting programs are also described in this section.\n\n## 4. Industry transformation\n\nAware that the response from the luxury industry and the  broader  fashion  industry  must  be  collective  and global,  the  Group  also  helps  address  the  issue  of climate  change  alongside  its  peers,  in  addition  to  its own  initiatives.  Through  partnerships  and  coalitions like OP2B and the Fashion Pact, Kering aims to drive a new,  holistic  approach  to  managing  climate-related risks,  attenuating  their  impact  and  contributing  to global climate-related objectives.\n\nThis  is  why  the  Group  signed  the  Fashion  Industry Charter  for  Climate  Action  in  December  2018.  An initiative coordinated by UN Climate Change, the Charter unites  the  world's  leading  fashion  houses,  retailers,\n\nsuppliers  and  professional  associations  around  the common  goal  of  drastically  reducing  the  industry's carbon footprint, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn  preparation  for  the  G7  meeting  held  in  Biarritz, France  in  August  2019,  French  president  Emmanuel Macron  tasked  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  Chairman  and Chief Executive  Officer of Kering, with bringing together fashion and textile companies to set practical objectives for reducing their industry's environmental impact.  In  an  historic  move,  given  the  scale  and importance  of  the  coalition  that  has  been  created, 63  companies  representing  more  than  250  brands have  now  signed  the  resulting  Fashion  Pact.  The participating companies have notably pledged to take action to achieve the objective of zero greenhouse gas emissions  by  2050,  in  order  to  keep  global  warming below 1.5\u00b0C between now and 2100.\n\nLastly, innovation is central to Kering's approach, and is geared above all towards integrating more sustainable  materials  from  the  creation  stage.  This relies  on  tools  derived  from  the  EP&L  that  provide insight  into  the  environmental  impact  of  a  future collection,  but  also  structures  such  as  the  Materials Innovation  Lab  (MIL)  and  the  Sustainable  Innovation Lab  (SIL),  which  offer  brand  design  teams  a  pool  of sustainable and innovative materials.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodiversity strategy\n\nIn July 2020, Kering published its corporate strategy on biodiversity,  the  first  in  the  industry.  The  Group's Houses primarily use natural materials to manufacture their products. These raw materials come from farms, rangelands,  forests  and  mines.  With  supply  chains spread  around  the  world  (wool  in  New  Zealand, cashmere  in  Mongolia,  organic  cotton  in  India,  etc.), Kering is particularly attentive to the preservation and health  of  natural  ecosystems.  For  several  years,  the Group  and  its  Houses  have  been  stepping  up  their involvement in initiatives that promote biodiversity, by providing  support  to  several  conservation  programs, for  example, and by setting standards relating to raw materials, manufacturing processes and animal welfare.\n\nTo  take  its  commitment  even  further,  in  2020  the Group developed a biodiversity strategy, which aims to stem the loss of biodiversity, re-build ecosystems and rehabilitate species, and  drive systemic change throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond.  As  part  of this  strategy,  Kering  is  committed  to  having  a  net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 to  achieve  this,  Kering  is  already  structuring  its activities  around  four  phases:  avoidance,  reduction, restoration/regeneration and transformation. Kering is applying this conservation hierarchy as recommended by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN),  which  brings  together  leading  scientists  and environmental NGOs from around the world to create a  trajectory  for  nature  and  to  develop  scientific methods  for  ensuring  that  human  activities  respect the planet's limits;\n- \u00b7 as  part  of  its  biodiversity  strategy,  Kering  has  also made quantitative commitments:\n- - by 2025, Kering will protect one million hectares of essential and irreplaceable habitats outside of its supply chain, primarily through programs that will  be  beneficial  on  multiple  levels,  in  terms  of biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local people,\n- - by  2025,  Kering  will  facilitate  the  transition  to regenerative agricultural practices on an additional one million hectares in areas where raw materials entering  Kering's  supply  chain,  such  as  leather, cotton, wool or cashmere, are extracted. To achieve this, Kering  has  partnered  with  Conservation International  to  create  the  Regenerative  Fund  for Nature, which  will support  projects for the transformation  of  farming  and  breeding  practices in  areas  that  supply  raw  materials  to  the  fashion industry.\n\nThese two million hectares represent nearly six times the  global  footprint  of  Kering's  direct  and  indirect (supply chain) operations, which has been calculated by  the  EP&L  as  350,000  hectares.  Kering  has therefore included a significant security margin in its efforts to have a net positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nThe strategy and the initiatives underway are presented in detail in section 4.4.2.\n\n## Circular economy strategy\n\nThe  circular  economy  strategy  is  currently  being developed and will be based on the four key principles of the circular economy (see section 4.4.3.1).\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Environmental management\n\n## Internal organization for environmental issues\n\nThe Kering Sustainability Department comprises around  20  specialists  tasked  with  planning  the operational  roll-out  of  the  Group's  environmental strategy  and  helping  the  Houses  implement  action plans  for  achieving  its  objectives.  For  this  purpose, Kering  develops  systems  such  as  the  environmental reporting  system,  or  EP&L,  along  with  standards  for raw  materials  and  production  processes  to  help  the brands manage their environmental impact.\n\nCoordination  between  the  Group  and  the  Houses  is ensured through a network of managers dedicated to sustainability issues, and each House has at least one Sustainability  Lead  to  spearhead  the  drive  towards sustainability.  This  means  that  around  60  employees in total are focused on sustainability within the Group and its Houses.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  dedicated  positions,  working groups  are  formed  regularly  to  bring  in  other  key business  functions  to  engage  in  the  roll-out  and application  of  sustainability  projects.  With  these cross-functional  teams,  which  usually  encompass functions  including  finance,  merchandising,  sales, design,  production  and  HR,  more  than  150  people meet regularly at Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Boucheron, Girard-Perregaux, Pomellato, Qeelin, Ulysse Nardin and Kering Eyewear.\n\nEnvironmental  reporting  is  also  backed  up  by  a substantial global network of more than 300 contributors working  in  the  Group's  Houses.  It  guarantees  optimum data  precision  and  enables  the  Group  to  monitor  its environmental impact and performance very closely.\n\n## Managing the network\n\nKering has developed an internal network dedicated to sustainability  issues,  known  as  the  Sustainability Network Meeting (SNM), which brings together Corporate and teams from the Houses (see section 1.4.4).",

        "page_content": "In  2019  and  2020,  Kering  pressed  ahead  with  its  Idea Labs:  working  groups  bringing  together  experts  and operational  staff  from  several  Houses  with  a  view  to sharing  knowledge,  developing  and  structuring  new ideas, and implementing practical solutions, particularly in  terms  of  improving  the  Group's  environmental  and societal footprints. Between 10 and 50 employees met at  each  session  of  the  Idea  Labs  to  workshop  the following issues:\n\n- \u00b7 the Kering Standards  for raw materials and manufacturing processes;\n- \u00b7 energy  management  and  purchases  of  green energy;\n- \u00b7 environmental efficiency in stores;\n- \u00b7 gender parity in our supply chains;\n- \u00b7 supplier assessment based on sustainability criteria;\n- \u00b7 traceability in operations and supply chains;\n- \u00b7 e-commerce  (packaging,  transportation,  product returns);\n- \u00b7 animal welfare;\n- \u00b7 key  raw  materials:  leather,  cotton  and  precious metals  (gold,  silver,  palladium)  for  jewelry  and  the galvanization of metal parts.\n\n## Informing and raising awareness among employees\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  regularly  share  sustainability project  updates  and  news  via  the  Group's  corporate social network, which is available to all employees and on  all  devices  (computers,  tablets,  smartphones,  etc.). As  a  supplement,  the  sustainability  communications team has created a digital platform known as the Kering Planet, which  is dedicated exclusively to Group employees and devoted entirely to sustainability topics. Quizzes, contests and other challenges are posted each quarter  to  inform  and  educate  employees  in  a light-hearted  way  about  Kering's  environmental,  social and  sustainable  innovation  strategy.  A  Kering  Planet group  has  also  been  created  on  the  corporate  social network to support a community of sustainability-sensitive employees throughout the year by  regularly  sharing  news  and  information  about sustainability-related issues.\n\nKering  also  offers  a  detailed  e-learning  module  on  the Kering  Standards,  which  is  available  to  all  Group employees worldwide. Taking a fun, hands-on approach to  training,  the  module  includes  a  role  play  component that  involves  creating  leather  goods,  ready-to-wear, jewelry  or  glasses  in  strict  compliance  with  the  Kering Standards. The online module takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours, with duration and content adapted to suit the learner's profile, depending on their function (design,\n\nproduct  development,  marketing,  etc.)  and  department (ready-to-wear, leather goods, support function, etc.). It is available  in  five  languages:  English,  French,  Italian, Chinese  and  Japanese.  Saint  Laurent  relays  the  module via  its  internal  training  platform,  e-University,  to  ensure that  its  teams  are  aware  of  the  fundamentals  of sustainable procurement and manufacturing processes.\n\nKey  dates  such  as  World  Environment  Day  on  June  5 bring ideal opportunities for reaching a broader public. At Group level, the Caring Day event has been organized for  the  past  six  years  to  celebrate  World  Environment Day  and  sensitize  employees  to  environmental  issues. In  2020,  Caring  Day  took  the  form  of  an  online challenge, encouraging employees to answer questions about  the  real-world  results  of  Kering's  sustainability strategy. Over a three-week period, all Group employees were invited to test their knowledge of Kering's progress report  published  in  January  2020  and,  by  doing  so, support  the  Group's  sponsorship  of  an  endangered animal via WWF.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  updated  its  Gucci  Equilibrium  website and  launched  a  new  Instagram  profile.  In  honor  of Earth Day, in April, Alexander McQueen's sustainability team organized a communication campaign designed to  raise  employee  awareness  of  sustainability  issues. The first message was from the House's CEO. The other messages sent out each day included videos, training resources  and  quizzes  about  Alexander  McQueen's sustainability practices.\n\nKering  is  aware  that  its  impact  on  biodiversity primarily  relates  to  its  sourcing  of  raw  materials  and therefore to the use of land associated with those raw materials. With this in mind, the Group and its Houses wish  to  sensitize  as  many  people  as  possible  about biodiversity  through  their  actions.  This  commitment has notably led to the installation of several beehives at Group headquarters and at certain Houses, such as Girard-Perregaux,  which  now  produce  honey  locally. The Novara production site has also had four beehives on  its  rooftop  since  April  2018,  to  support  urban biodiversity and combat the collapse of bee colonies.\n\nThe Houses are also developing their own training and awareness-raising  actions  on  environmental  issues, starting with the induction pathway laid out for all new employees.  An  onboarding  process  has  been  created for  new  hires  to  familiarize  them  with  the  brand universe  and  raise  their  awareness  about  its  key sustainability initiatives. This is the case, for example, at  Gucci,  Bottega Veneta, and Kering Eyewear, as well as at Saint Laurent, thanks to its e-University internal training  platform.  In  2020,  Saint  Laurent  launched  a new  version  accessible  to  all  employees  via  their phone. The sustainability module therefore reaches an even wider audience and includes games, quizzes and memos.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, 10%  of its employees had a sustainability  objective.  Brioni  continued  to  provide online  training  on  sustainability  during  the  year.  The aim  is  to  share  the  sustainability  strategy  with  all employees and provide insight into current and future initiatives. Pomellato organizes Sustainability Breakfast  Talks  at  its  offices  in  Milan  to  raise awareness of sustainability issues among the House's corporate staff.\n\nBalenciaga  continued  to  mobilize  its  employees  by organizing Sustainability Days dedicated to protecting the  environment  for  the  second  consecutive  year.  To celebrate World Cleanup Day, the House distributed a 'plastic-free  kit'  to  all  its  employees  worldwide.  Each kit contained  two  sustainably  produced,  reusable day-to-day items designed to prevent the production of  daily  waste  -  a  bag  made  from  Econyl\u00ae  and  a stainless  steel  bottle.  Gucci  also  gets  its  employees involved in initiatives such as park and beach cleanup days, tree planting and nature preservation awareness campaigns.  In  2020,  115  employees  participated  in these  initiatives  between  January  and  March,  before the  House's  volunteer  program  had  to  be  suspended because of the health crisis.\n\nOther brands focus more specifically on key business functions,  addressing,  for  example,  design,  retail  and merchandising  teams  to  deliver  key  information  on products  and  sustainability  initiatives  and  to  ensure effective  reach-down  of  good  practices,  especially  as regards efficient store management. This is the case at Saint  Laurent,  for  example,  where  'Golden  Rules'  are distributed to the House's stores. In 2020, the Golden Rules were included in a new mobile app, designed to help  sales  associates  integrate  sustainable  practices into  their  daily  work  routine.  Brioni  has  introduced  a training  program  to  raise  awareness  of  sustainability topics  among  its  sales  teams,  while  Boucheron  also educates  its  store  personnel  about  sustainability issues.  Through  the  Gucci  Retail  Academy,  Gucci sensitizes  its  employees  to  the  new  version  of Equilibrium,  the  launch  of  its  new  100%  sustainable collection  (choice  of  raw  materials,  etc.)  and  its  new, more environmentally responsible packaging. To date, 85%  of  its  store  personnel  have  completed  this training module.\n\nIn 2020, Kering Eyewear continued to hold workshops on the Kering Standards for its Finance, Legal and HR teams. The Watches Division conducted an awareness campaign for employees in its workshops and support services  (quality,  logistics,  procurement,  etc.).  The\n\ntopics covered included Kering's sustainability strategy and its Code of Ethics, as well as the RJC certification process.  Alexander  McQueen  has  introduced  training modules on the House's sustainability practices, using an online format because of the health crisis in 2020.\n\nSince 2019, Balenciaga organizes master classes each year  with  high-level  guest  speakers  to  sensitize employees  to  sustainability-related  topics,  such  as ethics,  human  rights,  inclusion,  climate  change  and biodiversity. In light of the COVID-19 health crisis, the House organized an online master class with Institut Curie  in  2020  to  present  the We  Are  Pink collection, from which 10% of the sales proceeds are donated to cancer research.\n\nAs  regards  the  management  of  chemicals,  Kering Operations  organized  three  training  sessions  on  the Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List  or  MRSL (see section 4.4.2) for 130 employees from the Houses and from various procurement, sustainability, R&D and product development teams in order to facilitate their day-to-day interactions with suppliers. MRSL requirements are included in Kering's supplier contracts.\n\n## Training on reporting tools, indicators and processes\n\nTo ensure consistent, standardized reporting practices are used across the Group, specific training is provided every  year  on  the  tools  used  for  environmental reporting  and  the  EP&L.  The  reporting  guidelines  or 'handbooks'  are  updated  annually  and  distributed throughout the Group in three languages, backed by a communication  campaign  via  the  corporate  social network.  The  handbooks  are  also  accompanied  by online training modules for all users.\n\nTo accurately measure the environmental footprint of its  activities,  Kering  has  undertaken  environmental reporting  based  on  around  100  indicators  every  year since  2004.  Representative  of  the  environmental impacts  of  the  Group's  Houses,  these  indicators  fall into  eight  categories:  energy  consumption,  water consumption, water pollution, management of environmental  risks,  goods  transportation,  business travel, waste production and use of raw materials.\n\nA methodological note provides all necessary information  regarding  the  environmental  reporting protocol, emission factors and  rules for using estimated  or  extrapolated pro  forma data  to  enable comparisons. It is available on Kering's website, under Sustainability  (Methodological  Note  Environmental Reporting, 2020).",

It  follows  that  certifications  related  to  the implementation of environmental management systems are  sought  primarily  for  the  sites  with  the  greatest environmental impact, such as large logistics centers and tanneries.\n\nBy end-2019, all of the Group's tanneries had received ISO  14001  certification.  The  Caravel,  Blutonic  and Luxury tanneries have been certified for several years.\n\nThe  P\u00e9riers  tannery  in  Normandy  (France)  recently moved to a new site, for which ISO 14001 certification was obtained in December 2019.\n\nSome  brands  are  upgrading  their  environmental certification to include ISO 14064, which is specific to the  quantification  and  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, Gucci obtained ISO 20121 certification  for  sustainable  event  management  in 2019  for  its  Guccio  Gucci  entity,  and  all  of  its  Italian and  outlet  stores  have  received  both  SA8000  and ISO 45001 certification.\n\n| Brand          | Site name                         | Activity             | Certifications                                       |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kering         | LGI headquarters (Cadempino)      | Offices Distribution | ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 28000, ISO 22301 |\n|                | Bioggio platform                  | Distribution         | ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 28000, ISO 22301 |\n|                | Stabio platform                   | Distribution         | ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 28000, ISO 22301 |\n|                | Sant'Antonino platform            | Distribution         | ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 28000, ISO 22301 |\n|                | Taverna platform                  | Distribution         | ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001                       |\n|                | KFO Novara                        | Production           | OHSAS 18001                                          |\n|                | P\u00e9riers tannery                   | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Caravel                           | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n| Gucci          | Guccio Gucci SpA                  | Legal entity         | SA8000, ISO 20121                                    |\n|                | Guccio Logistica SpA              | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | G Commerce SpA                    | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | Gucci Garden Srl                  | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | LUXURY GOODS ITALIA SPA           | Legal entity         | ISO 45001, SA8000                                    |\n|                | LUXURY GOODS OUTLET SRL           | Legal entity         | ISO 45001, SA8000                                    |\n|                | Casellina headquarters (Florence) | Offices              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | ArtLab (Florence)                 | Offices              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Gucci 9 (Florence)                | Offices              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | PhotoStudio (Florence)            | Offices              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Milano Mecenate                   | Offices              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Tigerflex                         | Production           | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Pigini                            | Production           | OHSAS 18001                                          |\n|                | GJP Milano                        | Production           | OHSAS 18001                                          |\n|                | Luxury Tannery                    | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Blutonic                          | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Marbella Pellami                  | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n|                | Falco Pellami                     | Tanning              | ISO 14001, ISO 45001                                 |\n| Bottega Veneta | Bottega Veneta Srl                | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | Bottega Veneta Logistica Srl      | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | MVP Srl                           | Legal entity         | SA8000                                               |\n|                | Montebello Vicentino              | Offices/ Production  | ISO 14064                                            |\n|                | Milan headquarters                | Offices              | ISO 14064                                            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Comprehensive analysis at the time clearly indicated a very strong  predominance  of  upstream  impacts, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 unlike many  consumer  goods,  Kering brand products  (leather  goods,  ready-to-wear,  shoes, watches and jewelry, and eyewear) generate little or no greenhouse gases in use;\n- \u00b7 because of their quality, luxury goods have a much longer lifespan than consumer goods on average;\n- \u00b7 lifecycle  analyses  available  for  the  textile  sector show a split of around 80%/20% between upstream phases (production of raw materials, transformation, assembly) and downstream phases (usage and end-of-life);\n- \u00b7 there  is  as  yet  no  reliable  database  characterizing the product usage and disposal practices of luxury goods  customers  (frequency  and  type  of  washing, maintenance, second-hand market, etc.).\n\nIn  light  of  this  last  observation  and  with  a  view  to taking into account these product usage and disposal phases, Kering surveyed more than 3,000 luxury goods customers  in  six  countries  in  2019.  Covering  four product  categories,  the  survey  provided  insight  into the purchasing habits of luxury clients, as well as the way they care for and discard products. The next step is to  map  and  measure  the  environmental  data collected during the survey. This will enable Kering to estimate  the  impacts  associated  with  the  product usage and disposal phases, and to integrate them into its EP&L, starting in 2020.\n\nEven though the majority of its EP&L impact lies in its supply chains, Kering nonetheless takes an interest in the  impact  of  the  various  sites  over  which  it  has  the most  control  (Tier  0),  which  are  its  operations  and represent 8% of its EP&L.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  2019  EP&L,  which  was  published  in 2020, showed a reduction in the environmental impact of  the  Group's  operations.  This  is  a  particularly encouraging  performance  given  the  strong  growth  in revenue and therefore business volumes recorded by Kering between 2017 and 2019.\n\nIn  addition,  at  the  level  of  the  Group's  operations (Tier  0  in  the  EP&L),  the  Group's  carbon  intensity (\u20acEP&L/k\u20ac in revenue) declined by 24% between 2015 and 2019. This progress is notably the product of the energy  efficiency  measures  undertaken  at  stores, offices  and  industrial  sites  by  Kering  and  its  Houses. Kering's ongoing efforts in this area, together with its strategy of purchasing green electricity, should enable it to maintain this positive performance in the coming years, in line with the trajectory defined by Kering on the basis of the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nThe transportation and energy emission factors taken for carbon reporting on the Group's operations (as set out  hereafter)  include  Scope  3  items  for  upstream phases  (extraction,  refining,  transportation,  electricity line losses, etc.).\n\n## Carbon footprint of Group operations\n\nEnergy consumption and the transportation of goods and people are the two main sources of CO2 emissions from the Group's operations. Total emissions for 2020 came in at 162,127 metric tons of CO2.\n\nDetails of the emission factors used are set out in the methodological  note  on  environmental  reporting  for 2020, which is available on the Group's website.\n\nBreakdown of total transportation and energy-related CO2 emissions from Group operations in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total: 162,127 metric tons of CO2\n\nThe  proportion  of  transportation-related  as  opposed to  energy-related  emissions  was  relatively  stable between 2019 and 2020. It went from 83.1% in 2019 to 81.2%  in 2020, reflecting a decrease in both transportation  and  energy  use  in  2020  due  to  the health  crisis  and  a  further  increase  in  the  use  of renewable  energies,  following  on  from  the  increase recorded in 2019.",

In 2012, this vast power  management  project  resulted  in  the establishment of a more accurate energy consumption monitoring system. The brands can now access monthly consumption data for their sites on the IT platform. In 2020,  608  Group  sites,  excluding  shop-in-shops  and stores  in  shopping  malls,  were  covered  in  Europe,  the United  States  and  Asia,  representing  75.2%  of  all  sites eligible for the system. The project also covers:\n\n- \u00b7 streamlining  the  energy  procurement  process  by pooling and consolidating energy consumption;\n- \u00b7 increasing the use of renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 centralizing energy procurement management.\n\nThe project has generated tangible energy savings and reduced costs for the Group's Houses.\n\n## Minimizing energy use and measuring energy efficiency improvements\n\nThe Group takes two main types of measures to optimize the energy efficiency of its sites:\n\nSystematically  obtaining  recognized,  high-level  certification for new sites renovated by Kering.\n\nCertification is therefore sought for all of the new sites targeted  by  Kering's  Real  Estate  teams  from  2019. US-based  LEED  (Gold  and  Platinum  level)  is  the preferred certification system selected by the Group, but other certifications, like HQE (France) and BREEAM (UK), are also sought for projects where they are particularly relevant.  Optimized  energy  performance,  the  use  of renewable  energies  and  other  energy  conservation criteria are critical to obtaining green building certifications.  To  help  the  Houses  in  their  efforts  to certify  a  significant  number  of  sites,  Kering  set  up master  agreements  in  2019  with  four  companies  that handle LEED, BREEAM and HQE certifications worldwide. This  number was doubled between 2019 and 2020. In 2020,  Kering  also  launched  its  first  projects  to  obtain WELL certification, which is based on the well-being of building users and visitors.",

Saint Laurent continues its work to reduce the environmental impact of its stores. By implementing best practices in store  planning  and  operation,  the  House  was  able  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  its  stores  by  40% between  2015  and  2020.  In  addition,  35  stores  are currently  in  the  process  of  obtaining  certification  for 2021.\n\n## Establishing a Group-wide standard for stores\n\nKering has been working with the Houses since 2017 to  develop  a  'Standard  for  Stores'  that  sets  out expected  performance  levels  in  11  key  areas.  These include energy management,  lighting,  renewable energy, water use and waste treatment. The Standards cover  all  phases  in  a  building's  lifecycle,  namely  site selection and  relations  with  the  lessor,  design, construction or renovation, and operation. In 2018, the Standard  for  Stores  was  submitted  for  an  external peer review by academic and engineering experts and NGOs,  which  helped  improve  its  ambitions  and operability. After a test phase at the Group's stores, the standard was officially published in 2020 to serve as a reference for new stores and store renovations where the  use  of  LEED  or  equivalent  certifications  is  not possible.\n\nUlysse  Nardin  has  signed  up  to  the  Swiss  Energy Agency's  energy  conservation  program,  and  met  its energy  consumption  reduction  targets  several  years ahead of schedule at the Le Locle and La  Chaux-de-Fonds  sites.  In  the  same  way,  GirardPerregaux  has  continued  to  roll  out  its  energy conservation program with the Swiss Energy Agency. In 2020,  all  sites  were  using  green  electricity  and continuing  to  replace  neon  lights  with  LEDs.  At  the House's Numa-Droz site, the heating and air conditioning system was also renovated and replaced.\n\nLastly, LED technology - a source of significant energy savings  (up  to  90%  on  lighting)  -  continued  to  be rolled  out  by  all  of  the  Group's  Houses,  with  close  to\n\n100% deployment in store sales areas, where the most light fittings are concentrated. This practice is part of the Kering Standards and also a criterion for obtaining environmental  certifications  such  as  LEED,  BREEAM and HQE.\n\n## Favoring renewable energy by producing it on site or purchasing renewable energy certificates\n\nIn 2020, the Group jointed the RE100 initiative led by the  Climate  Group  and  the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project (CDP).  As  part  of  this  initiative,  Kering  has  pledged  to use 100% renewable electricity by 2022.\n\nThe proportion of renewable electricity used within the Group increased overall between 2018 and 2020 on a pro forma basis, thanks to increased on-site production  of  renewable  energy  and  the  numerous green  energy  contracts  implemented  by  the  brands with the Group's support. It amounted to 90% in 2020, compared with 66% in 2018, based on consolidation scope.\n\nFor  many  years,  Kering  has  encouraged  the  signing  of agreements to purchase locally produced green electricity,  for  all  sites  that  pay  their  power  invoices directly and whenever the local electricity market allows. For  regions  where  this  practice  is  not  possible,  Kering purchases  Energy  Attribute  Certificates.  In  addition,  to speed  up  the  energy  transition  in  its  host  countries, Kering  only  purchases  certificates  from  solar  or  wind power  production  facilities  that  are  new  or  relatively recent (less than ten years old). Since 2019, the Group has purchased  green  certificates  for  various  countries  in order to cover 100% of its energy consumption in those areas.  The  geographical  breakdown  of  certificates  is presented  in  the  methodological  note  available  on  the Group's website.\n\nIn  2020,  the  acquisition  of  green  certificates  was extended to Japan and Taiwan for certain Houses and to Russia, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result, electricity consumption is 100% renewable in 41 countries and 90.6% renewable across the Group (up  23  points  versus  2018).  In  Europe,  100%  of  the electricity  consumed  is  generated  using  renewable resources.\n\nThe Group's Houses have also undertaken to increase their use  of  renewable  energy,  especially  green electricity. As a result, Brioni, Qeelin and Girard-Perregaux  now  use  100%  renewable  electricity. For  all  Gucci  sites,  the  share  of  renewable  electricity reached  92%  in  2020.  It  was  83%  for  Bottega  Veneta, 84%  for  Saint  Laurent,  75%  for  Balenciaga,  97%  for Alexander  McQueen,  98%  for  Kering  Eyewear  and  95% for  Pomellato.  Similarly,  Ulysse  Nardin  has  been  using close to 100% of locally generated green hydroelectricity  at  its  Le  Locle  and  La  Chaux-de-Fonds production sites since 2017.\n\nOn  top  of  external  purchases,  the  brands  have  been boosting  their  reliance  on  renewable  energy,  for example by installing solar panels. Some brands have already installed solar equipment on the roofs of their buildings, including a warehouse in the United States and  three  Bottega  Veneta  sites  in  Italy.  The  solar panels supply between 2% and 4% of each site's power needs.  Saint  Laurent  also  fitted  solar  panels  to  the roof  of  its  Beverly  Hills  store  in  2015  and  at  its  shoe workshop  in  Vigonza,  Italy,  in  2017.  In  2020,  Gucci installed solar panels at two of its Italian headquarters, in  Milan  and  Florence,  enabling  them  use  to  locally generated  green  electricity.  In  2018,  Brioni  installed new photovoltaic panels on its workshop in Montebello, which are used to heat water for the site's locker  rooms  and  restrooms.  Kering  Eyewear  has increased its portion of renewable energy produced on site,  following  the  installation  in  2017  of  a  wind turbine  that  helps  power  parking  lot  lighting  at  its Padua headquarters in Italy. The turbine can produce up to  4,300  KWh  per  year.  The  plant  in  Sucy-en-Brie, France,  also  uses  renewables,  primarily  geothermal and  solar  power,  thanks  to  solar  panels  and  heat transfer fluids. The  LEED-certified  warehouse  in Vescovana, Italy, has also been fitted with solar panels, representing 15kW of power.\n\nSince  September  2014,  the  C.  Mend\u00e8s  ready-to-wear workshop  in  Angers,  France,  which  belongs  to  Saint Laurent, has used biomass rather than gas to meet its heating  requirements,  and  since  November  2015, using green energy has significantly reduced the site's carbon footprint. In Paris, three Saint Laurent flagship stores and the new  headquarters on rue de Bellechasse  are  all  fitted  with  the  Climespace  air conditioning  system.  This  urban  cooling  system  uses water from the River Seine to cool buildings, thereby reducing  electricity  consumption  and  CO2  emissions compared to conventional air conditioning systems.\n\n## Offsetting residual greenhouse gas emissions via carbon offset projects\n\n## Carbon offset projects\n\nAs defined in 2012 as part of its sustainability targets, Kering  continues  to  offset  its  residual  Scope  1  and  2 greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, Kering decided to take its long-term commitment to sustainability a step further  by  offsetting  all  residual  annual  emissions across  the  entire  value  chain,  to  supplement  the measures already taken to avoid and reduce them. As a  result,  Kering  offset  2.4  million  metric  tons  of  CO2 emissions in 2019. Carbon credits have been obtained through  the  provision  of  support  for  several  REDD+ (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest Degradation)  programs,  with  VCS  (Verified  Carbon Standard)  verification.  Not  only  does  this  generate carbon credits, it also provides substantial support for local  populations  and  the  protection  of  biodiversity (see  section  4.4.2.3  'Land  use  and  protection  of biodiversity').  In  2020,  the  health  crisis  exceptionally forced the Group to review its offsetting. It offset 100% of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and a large part of  its  Scope  3  emissions.  In  total,  nearly  64%  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  were  offset  via  REDD+ carbon offset programs. The Group is also working on shifting  its  carbon  credits  towards  more  innovative projects  that  are  integrated  into  its  supply  chain.  In 2020,  Kering  began  investing  in  Low  Carbon  Label projects, in partnership with IDELE ( Institut de l'Elevage ),  which  support  French  cattle  breeders  in developing more carbon-efficient practices.\n\nCarbon neutral for the second year in a row in 2020, Gucci  redefined  its  approach  to  carbon  offsetting  by introducing a hierarchy of initiatives to avoid, reduce, restore  and,  as  a  last  resort,  offset  its  emissions.  In 2020,  the  House  therefore  had  a  range  of  natural climate solutions in three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Protecting  intact  land  via  'green'  REDD+  carbon offsetting projects that protect essential forests and biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 Restoring mangrove forests and other wetlands via 'blue' REDD+ carbon offsetting projects, which help protect  and  restore  these  ecosystems.  Coastal wetlands are particularly good at sequestering and storing carbon;\n- \u00b7 Managing farmland through regenerative agriculture.",

        "page_content": "To  get  as  many  businesses  as  possible  involved  in tackling  climate  change,  Gucci's  CEO  launched  a challenge  to  his  peers  in  all  industries  to  encourage them  to  implement  a  corporate  climate  strategy.  To meet  the  CEO  Carbon  Neutral  Challenge,  companies must avoid, reduce, restore and, as a last resort, offset all emissions generated by their value chain, thanks to nature-based  solutions  that  help  protect  the  world's critical ecosystems.\n\nBottega Veneta has been measuring and offsetting the CO2  emissions  generated  by  its  offices  in  Milan  since 2011, as part of its ISO 14064 certification. The House has  also  certified  its  Montebello  Vicentino  workshop since 2015.\n\n## Transportation-related emissions Methodology\n\nTransportation-related data collected under the reporting system is divided into three main categories:\n\n- \u00b7 B2B transportation: this includes all transportation of goods paid for  by  the  brands  between  suppliers  and logistics  platforms  or  industrial  sites,  and  between\n\nlogistics centers and points of sale. The transportation of goods between logistics centers also falls into this category.  B2B  transportation  includes  road,  rail,  sea and air freight. Express transportation includes goods delivered  by  express  transportation  service  providers via road and air freight;\n\n- \u00b7 B2C  transportation:  this  covers  all  deliveries  of finished  products  between  logistics  platforms  or points of sale and customers. These deliveries can be carried out either by the brands' own fleets or by subcontractors' vehicles. As with B2B, only transportation  that  is  paid  for  by  the  brands  is taken  into  account.  B2C  transportation  includes road  freight,  but  is  relatively  insignificant  for  the Group;\n- \u00b7 business  travel:  this  covers  business  air  travel  and the use of company cars.\n\nDetails of the emission factors used are set out in the methodological note, which is available on the Group's website.\n\n## Emissions related to transportation and travel\n\n## Transportation- and business travel-related CO2 emissions in 2020 (in metric tons of CO2)\n\n|                    | 2020    |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| B2B transportation | 120,150 |\n| B2C transportation | 28      |\n| Business travel    | 11,421  |\n| TOTAL              | 131,599 |\n\nB2B transportation accounted for 91% of the Group's transportation-related emissions in 2020.\n\n## B2B transportation volumes in 2020 and related CO2 emissions\n\nKering  uses  road  transportation  to  carry  its  products  from  workshops  to  distribution  warehouses  and  from warehouses to outlets.

As  a  result,  electric  and hybrid vehicles account for more than 20% of Gucci's corporate  fleet.  Bottega  Veneta  is  also  pursuing  the renewal  of  its  fleet  with  the  inclusion  of  hybrid vehicles. Of 158 company cars, 71 - or 45% of the fleet -  are  hybrids  or  electric  vehicles.  Kering  Eyewear  has also  integrated  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles  into  its fleet,  and  Boucheron's  car  fleet  for  senior  managers includes electric models. Moreover, the Novara production site in Italy has for several years offered a fleet  of  shared  vehicles.  Gucci  has  also  upheld  its commitment  to  replace  vehicles  at  its  headquarters with more efficient models. Similarly, Kering Corporate has removed all diesel models from its car catalogue and now offers hybrid vehicles. Sustainability was also one  of  the  key  criteria  used  during  Kering  Italia's tender process for its corporate vehicle fleet, to select both the supplier and the models to be included. At its new  headquarters  on  rue  de  Bellechasse  in  Paris, Saint Laurent promotes mobility solutions with a low environmental  impact.  The  House's  logistics  fleet  is made up exclusively of electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2019, a joint car-pooling initiative was launched in Italy between certain House and Group sites. The aim is to reduce  transportation-related  emissions  by encouraging employees to share their daily commute and the associated costs. 2020 also saw Gucci extend its  car-pooling  program,  launched  in  2018,  to  other sites and even other Group Houses. Similarly, Bottega Veneta  joined  an  initiative  to  facilitate  and  promote car-pooling  among  its  Milan  and  Montebello  office employees.\n\nThe Houses  also encourage the use of public transportation  to  reduce  CO2  emissions  arising  from personnel travel. Bottega Veneta, for example, provides employees  with  a  free  shuttle  service  linking  its  Milan and Montebello sites with public transportation networks. In 2020, Girard-Perregaux approved a project to subscribe to electric bicycle-sharing services near its La  Chaux-de-Fonds  and  Le  Locle  sites  in  Switzerland.\n\nPomellato has installed bicycle garages and introduced a  shuttle  bus  to  encourage  its  employees  to  use  the metro. Boucheron has also created a bicycle garage to encourage  its  employees  to  cycle  to  work.  At  its headquarters  in  Paris,  Saint  Laurent  has  a  fleet  of electric bicycles that employees can use free of charge during working hours.\n\n## Optimizing logistics flows and switching to alternative means of transportation\n\nGoods transportation represents a significant part of the Group's CO2 emissions, which is why Kering works closely with its logistics platforms, its Houses and its carriers to reduce the distances covered during supply and delivery, to optimize truck load factors and the environmental and technical  performance  of  truck  fleets,  and  to  develop alternative  means  of  transportation  aimed  at  reducing the Group's CO2 footprint.\n\nSince 2019, Kering's Logistics Division has focused on identifying potential improvement avenues in terms of measurement  and  monitoring  and  on  the  initiatives to  be  implemented  to  reduce  the  environmental impact of transportation. The results confirm the need to  establish  ongoing  dialogue  with  all  transportation companies  to  obtain  quality  data  and  determine  the most environmentally responsible solutions, in terms of  routes,  fleets  and  timing.  To  reduce  the  carbon footprint, negotiations with service providers take into account both costs and environmental performances, with  standards  (such  as  the  maximum  average emission  factor  for  aircraft)  clearly  set  out  in  service agreements.\n\nBuilding  on  the  work  begun  in  2016,  the  joint initiatives  carried  out  with  transportation  companies in  2019  focused  in  particular  on  integrating  green solutions  for  last-mile  deliveries  in  major  European cities.  To  support  the  Houses  in  their  assessment  of changes  to  transportation  methods  or  the  use  of effective  alternatives,  the  Group  continues  to  look closely at environmental impact. The carbon footprint of all freight companies has been mapped since 2019. Data  on  air  freight  emissions  was  collected  and consolidated using a standardized approach compliant with European standard EN 16258.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  House  also gives  priority  to  sea  freight,  which  has  a  lower environmental impact than air freight, for orders that do not require urgent delivery.\n\nRoad  freight  accounts  for  a  minimal  portion  of  the total  carbon  footprint  associated  with  transportation.\n\nHowever,  it  also  generates  negative  externalities.  The transportation  department  therefore  continues  to select  more  environmentally  responsible  vehicles  for its logistics needs, particularly for last-mile deliveries.\n\nIn Paris, all daily shuttles between Saint Laurent stores are  carried  out  by  electric  vehicle.  Charging  stations have been installed at the brand's headquarters in the French capital.\n\n## Emissions testing in accordance with Scopes 1, 2 and 3\n\n## CO2 emissions by Scope as per the GHG protocol in 2020 (in metric tons of CO2)\n\n|         | 2020    |\n|---------|---------|\n| Scope 1 | 14,256  |\n| Scope 2 | 11,271  |\n| Scope 3 | 136,600 |\n| TOTAL   | 162,127 |\n\nThe GHG Protocol defines three operational Scopes in respect  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  To  facilitate clarity, Kering publishes its emissions as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Scope  1  refers  to  direct  emissions  attributable  to on-site  fuel  usage  and  the  fuel  consumed  by Kering's  directly  owned  B2C  vehicle  and  company car fleets;\n- \u00b7 Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions resulting from electricity and steam production;\n- \u00b7 Scope  3  refers  to  emissions  resulting  from  goods transported  by  subcontractors  (all  B2B  deliveries and  nearly  all  B2C  deliveries)  and  from  most employee air travel, the production of energy fuels (upstream  energy  and  petrol)  and  line  losses.  The rest of Scope 3, particularly supply chain emissions, is described  in  the  presentation  of  the  EP&L (see section 4.4.3).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.5%\n\n## Breakdown of CO2 emissions in 2020\n\nIn 2020, 8.8% of the Kering group's CO2 emissions were under  its  direct  control.  Consumption  of  electricity and  steam  now  accounts  for  just  6.9%  of  CO2 emissions. The more-than-50% reduction reflects the significant  efforts  made  by  the  Group  to  purchase\n\ngreen  electricity  (with  a  certificate  guaranteeing  its source) and to increase the use of renewable energies at its industrial sites and warehouses. The decrease in the largest portion of emissions, which are those not under  the  Group's  control  (Scope  3),  reflects  the unprecedented health crisis in 2020.",

In  particular,  the  sharp  decline  in  CO2  emissions  per unit  of  store  surface  area  reflects  the  Group's  rapid transition to a renewables-oriented  energy  and electricity  mix.  Nevertheless,  when  interpreting  the figures  for  2020,  the  impact  of  temporary  store closures  in  various  countries  around  the  world  must obviously be taken into consideration.\n\n## 3.2.2.2 Water consumption and wastewater discharges\n\n## Kering's water consumption\n\nAcross the Group, 77% of water consumed is used for domestic  purposes  (store  cleaning,  restrooms,  air conditioning,  etc.)  and  23%  for  industrial  purposes. The Group's industrial water consumption is primarily attributable to its tanneries, none of which is located in water-stressed zones.\n\nMoreover,  Kering  is  applying  its  EP&L  approach  to conduct  an  innovative  review  of  responsible  water management  across  its  entire  production  chain. Indirect  water  consumption  linked  to  the  use  of agricultural  raw  materials  such  as  cotton  is  a  serious environmental concern.\n\n## Water consumption in 2020 and pro forma change vs. 2018 (in cu.m)\n\n|                      | Consumption   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | Change vs.   |\n|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n|                      | in 2020       | 2020                          | 2019                          | 2018                          | 2018         |\n| Industrial water     | 250,870       | 223,617                       | 339,760                       | 338,248                       | -33.9%       |\n| Non-industrial water | 831,323       | 413,726                       | 483,557                       | 467,626                       | -11.5%       |\n| TOTAL WATER          | 1,082,193     | 637,343                       | 823,317                       | 805,874                       | -20.9%       |\n\nThe  decline  in  industrial  water  consumption  reflects the  lower  level  of  activity  at  the  Group's  industrial sites, while  the  decline  in  non-industrial  water consumption  reflects  the  decrease  in  site  occupancy and the increase in remote working in 2020 because of\n\nthe health crisis. The difference between the 2020 and pro  forma 2020  figures  for  non-industrial  water consumption  primarily  stems  from  the  addition  of eight data centers to the scope of consolidation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the Houses still work tirelessly to come  up  with  innovative  tanning  processes  that eliminate heavy metals and use less water. As a result, water consumption intensity (cubic meters of industrial water consumed/Group revenue) declined by 22.6% between 2018 and 2020.\n\nGucci's Scrap-less initiative enables the House to only treat  the  leather  needed  for  product  fabrication.  The unused sections are cut away before tanning, thereby reducing  the  amount  of  chemicals  and  water  used during the tanning process.\n\nBalenciaga  gives  priority  to  tanneries  and  denim suppliers  that  are  making  a  genuine  effort  to  reduce energy and water use in their treatment and finishing processes.\n\nAt  Bottega  Veneta's  Montebello  site,  rainwater  is collected  for  use  on  the  gardens  and  in  the  site's fountains,  reducing  the  House's  water  consumption and helping it obtain LEED certification. Aerators have been  fitted  to  faucets  at  various  sites,  resulting  in  a water  saving  of  around  30%.  At  the  Milan  site, rainwater  collection  is  supplemented  by  the  recovery of  used  water  from  the  air  conditioning  system, resulting in higher volumes of water collected, as well as energy recovery.\n\nAt  its  new  warehouse  in  Vescovana,  Kering  Eyewear collects  and  filters  rainwater  for  use  in  the  site's lavatories and on its lawns.\n\nThough the water discharge impact from Kering's directly owned  operations  is  not  significant  by  itself,  discharge from textile and leather industry production facilities can have a more significant environmental impact, especially as  regards  chemical  pollutants.  For  this  reason,  water pollution is one of the six environmental impacts covered by  the  Kering  EP&L.  Because  of  the  large  amounts  of water  used  by  tanneries,  special  wastewater  treatment measures are required. Each tannery has its own on-site wastewater  treatment  plant.  As  a  result,  100%  of  the wastewater  from  Group  tanneries,  as  well  as  the  Kering Eyewear  plant,  is  pre-treated  on  site  before  continuing the  wastewater  treatment  process.  The  Group's  two Italian  tanneries  pre-treat  their  wastewater  at  their on-site  plants  and  send  the  output,  which  contains chrome,  to  a  special  treatment  plant  used  by  several other tanneries, which purifies the water and recovers the\n\nchrome. The Group's other two tanneries have treatment plants that use sedimentation and physicochemical and biological  treatment  techniques.  To  ensure  compliance with  local  wastewater  legislation,  analyses  are  regularly carried out at each tannery and the results continuously monitored.  If  any  anomalies  are  recorded,  dedicated procedures  and  action  plans  are  put  in  place  and, where applicable, described in the ISO 14001-certified environmental  management  system.  Each  tannery communicates  monitoring  data  via  the  Group's environmental reporting system.\n\nThe percentage of wastewater pre-treated on site for all  of  the  Group's  industrial  sites  is  99.99%  and  the percentage of water discharged by the Group is 77.7%.\n\nWater management is an integral part of the Kering Standards  published  in  early  2018,  which  set  out guidelines  for  the  Group's  main  manufacturing processes (tanning, textile processing and leather goods manufacturing).\n\n## 3.2.2.3 More sustainable packaging\n\n## Packaging challenges in the luxury industry\n\nPaper, cardboard or plastic packaging is used to protect products throughout the logistics  chain  from  the  risks of  humidity and the associated physical alterations, to prevent  the  products  from  being  damaged  and  to facilitate  their  transportation  to  stores  or  delivery destinations.  The  use  of  this  packaging  relates  directly to  the  Group's  operations.  To  limit  the  environmental impact  of  its  packaging,  Kering  and  its  Houses  make every  effort  to  opt  for  the  most  sustainable  solutions available  made  from  recycled  or  certified  biosourced materials.  They  also  carry  out  initiatives  aimed  at reducing  the  use  of  packaging  while  maintaining  an optimal level of protection for the goods manufactured. The  multi-brand  logistics  platform  aims  to  reduce packaging volumes used for product delivery worldwide. It works with the Houses to optimize capacity and track the performance of packaging used for B2B transportation.  It  also  ensures  compliance  with  the Kering  Standards  in  this  regard.  In  addition,  new machines have been installed in the Group's warehouses to provide made-to-measure packaging for orders  of  one  or  two  items,  reducing  both  packaging volumes and cardboard use. Warehouse employees are taught  not  only  how  to  package  goods  correctly, according to the Houses' requirements, but also how to choose  the  best  solution  in  terms  of  packaging volumes.",

This  renewal  also explains  the  sharp  increase  in  textile  packaging  over the  period.  In  2020,  the  proportion  of  certified  or recycled  packaging  was  close  to  89%  for  paper  and cardboard  packaging.  The  proportion  of  organic  or recycled textiles used in packaging came to nearly 50% in 2020.\n\n## Paper and cardboard packaging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Textile packaging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to promote more sustainable packaging\n\nTo supplement the Kering Standards for raw materials, a packaging  standard  was  developed  in  2020  within  the Kering  Standards  framework  (see  section  4.2.4).  The new  standard  sets  out  the  eco-design  principles  that\n\nshould be applied to packaging in order to improve its environmental  impact.  The  principles  revolve  around the  following  areas:  reduction  (of  weight  and  volume), reuse, recycling and  incorporation  of  responsible materials  (recycled,  biosourced  and  certified).  The standard  notably  aims  to  eliminate  single-use  plastics and  problem  plastics  like  PVC.  To  facilitate  employee understanding and buy-in, the Packaging standard was presented  to  employees  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses during webinars on topics like bioplastics and e-commerce packaging.\n\nMost of the Houses opt for FSC certification for their packaging,  including  Gucci,  Bottega  Veneta,  Saint Laurent,  Balenciaga,  Alexander  McQueen  (100%  for customer  packaging),  Pomellato,  DoDo,  Boucheron, Kering  Eyewear,  Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux for its wooden watch boxes. Some brands focus on the integration  of  recycled  fibers.  At  Bottega  Veneta,  for instance,  100%  of  the  cardboard  packaging  used  in 2020 was either recycled or certified. Since 2019, the House  has  used  compostable  plastic  as  its  primary packaging plastic.\n\nGucci  has  implemented  a  project  designed  to  reduce the industrial packaging used during the transportation of goods from production sites to logistics centers. The House reuses industrial packaging whenever possible to minimize the consumption of plastic packaging. Known as 'Take Back', the project aims to extend the lifespan of  the  protective  plastic  boxes  made  for  accessories while  also  avoiding  the  need  to  make  new  ones.  In November  2020,  the  House  also  launched  a  new packaging concept for the Gucci Gift collection, which is eco-designed to minimize its environmental impact.\n\nThe Houses pay special attention to the packaging used for  e-commerce.  Alexander  McQueen,  for  example,  is working  with  its  suppliers  to  optimize  packaging consumption. At Balenciaga, shipping boxes have been adapted to perfectly fit the House's packaging, thereby limiting the use of raw materials and reducing shipping volumes.  In  2019,  Saint  Laurent  developed  new packaging  for  its e-commerce  site  that  can  be transported  folded,  thereby  reducing  the  space  used and in turn CO2 emissions during transportation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  also  taking  action  to  improve  other types of packaging: its flannel bags now include recycled fibers  and  its  hangers  are  made  of  compostable  liquid wood.\n\nUlysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  only  use  Blue Angel-certified paper. Ulysse Nardin has also developed new,  more  environmentally  responsible  packaging  for its Diver X watch.\n\nKering  Eyewear's  visual  merchandising  teams  have worked closely with suppliers to improve the sustainability  of  its  point-of-sale  (POS)  materials  and packaging. Improvements include opting for FSC-certified or recycled paper and cardboard; replacing  conventional  adhesive  tape  with  ribbon  or tape  made  from  paper;  substituting  dust  bags  made from  transparent  plastic  with  tissue  paper,  whenever possible;  and  eliminating  any  unnecessary  straps.  To broaden the influence of Kering Eyewear's commitment to sustainability, the visual merchandising team is also working  on  a  project  to  include  information  on packaging components to help customers recycle them correctly. The project is being reviewed with the quality team  to  ensure  that  it  complies  with  the  applicable regulations on environmental labeling and information. Taking its commitment a step further, Kering Eyewear is also  working  on  a  pilot  communication  project  that uses QR codes to replace the instruction sheets for POS materials with paperless versions.\n\n## Single-use plastics\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the ocean environment has led  to  the  loss  of  90%  of  the  world's  large  fish,  coral reefs  may  disappear  by  2050,  the  remaining  fishing zones could also disappear and, in 2050, there may be more plastic in the ocean than fish.\n\nWith the support of its Houses, Kering has pledged to eliminate  single-use  plastics  from  its  B2C  and  B2B packaging by 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Group's  teams  have  focused  in particular  on  ready-to-wear  packaging,  identifying  the various  movements in the supply chain (from plant to distribution  center  to  store)  with  the  aim  of  reducing consumption  and  finding  alternatives  to  single-use plastics.  Discussions  are  regularly  held  with  experts from Fashion for Good, notably about the development\n\nof pilot projects to integrate circular economy principles into the use of polybags (flexible plastic packaging used to protect  products)  or  even  switch  to  reusable packaging.  A  number  of  Group  divisions  have  tested these  pilot  initiatives.  Several  prototypes  were  used  to create  polybags  made  from  70%  recycled  matter,  with the same level of performance.\n\nIn  line  with  the  objectives  of  the  Fashion  Pact,  the Group's  Houses  are  also  working  to  reduce  the  use  of plastics in their operations, thanks to projects that aim to minimize single-use plastics and integrate solutions made from recycled plastic. Gucci,  for  example,  avoids the  use  of  plastic  in  its  packaging  altogether  by  using waterproof  cardboard,  paper  ribbons  and  cotton  bags. For its e-commerce activity, the House has replaced all plastics with paper products.\n\nThe  work  initiated  in  2019  on  polybags  continued  in 2020. Balenciaga's polybags now contain 66% recycled plastic  and  its  apparel  bags  are  made  from  100% recycled PET. Alexander McQueen's store on Old Bond Street in London has joined the polybag recycling pilot project  led  by  Kering  and  Fashion  for  Good.  The project was scheduled to take place in summer 2020, but  was  postponed  to  2021  because  of  the  health crisis.  Saint  Laurent  is  also  participating  in  Kering's pilot  project  to  integrate  recycled  polybags  into  the supply  chain.  In  addition,  Kering  Eyewear  is  working with  Fashion  for  Good  to  find  alternatives  to  the polybags used to protect eyewear during storage and shipping.\n\n## 3.2.2.4 Paper consumption: printed publications and office paper\n\nPaper  consumed by the Kering group and its  Houses comes from two main sources:\n\n- \u00b7 indirect  purchases  of  paper  ordered  by  service providers outside the Group (printers and agencies) for printing communication media such as reports, posters, mailshots and point-of-sale advertising;\n- \u00b7 office paper.\n\n## Paper consumption in 2020\n\nA breakdown of Kering's paper consumption by category is presented below.",

Kering  mainly  generates  packaging  waste  and  also small quantities of hazardous waste, corresponding to specific items of waste on production sites and other waste produced mainly in stores and offices (lighting, ink cartridges, etc.).\n\nThe  main  source  of  the  Group's  hazardous  waste production  is  its  industrial  operations,  and  more particularly  its  tanneries.  One  of  the  main  challenges for  Kering's  waste  management  operations  is  the presence of heavy metals, which are used during the tanning  process.  Kering's  tanneries  are  therefore actively  involved  in  the  research  and  development  of alternative tanning methods that are more environmentally friendly. As a result, a heavy metal-free tanning method has been introduced at the Group's  exotic  and  non-exotic  leather  tanneries  and lifecycle assessments have been carried out to confirm the improvement in environmental impact associated with the new process, which does not use chrome or heavy metals.\n\nTanning processes can also give rise to odor pollution because they emit hydrogen sulfide, especially at the stripping stage. Unpleasant odors are managed by an air  evacuation  system  at  the  stripping  tubs,  which channels polluted air through a filter that traps sulfur bearing particles and outputs clean air.\n\n## Total waste produced in 2020 and pro forma change vs. 2018 (in metric tons)\n\n|                     | Production in   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | 2018-2020  pro forma  scope   | Change vs.   |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n|                     | 2020            | 2020                          | 2019                          | 2018                          | 2018         |\n| Non-hazardous waste | 16,683          | 12,910                        | 19,224                        | 18,022                        | -28.4%       |\n| Hazardous waste (1) | 572             | 456                           | 610                           | 505                           | -9.7%        |\n| TOTAL WASTE         | 17,255          | 13,366                        | 19,834                        | 18,527                        | -27.9%       |\n\nIn 2020, 97% of the waste generated by the Group was non-hazardous waste. On a pro forma basis over three years,  hazardous  waste  decreased  due  to  the  decline in activity at tanneries and industrial sites.\n\nNon -hazardous waste decreased on a pro forma basis over three years. The decline is directly related to the health crisis in 2020 and to lower business volumes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  brand  works  with  an  ESAT  (a company working in the protected sector [supporting people with disabilities] in France) specializing in the recovery  and  recycling  of  conventional  office  waste (paper,  envelopes,  flyers,  etc.),  as  well  as  cardboard, plastic,  cans  and  fabric  (such  as  offcuts  from  the brand's studio and workshops). Nearly 20 metric tons of  paper  and  cardboard,  more  than  120kg  of  plastic and close  to  7  metric  tons  of  fabric  were  recycled  in 2020 thanks to this partnership with CEDRE. The stores located on avenue Montaigne and rue Saint Honor\u00e9 in Paris  also  have  a  waste  sorting  system,  which  is operated by CEDRE on the same schedule as the Paris offices. In 2020, Saint Laurent continued to roll out a comprehensive recycling program across its industrial sites, headquarters, stores and showroom. In line with each  country's  regulations,  Gucci  also  ensures  the appropriate  management  of  waste  from  its  stores, giving  priority  to  the  separation  and  recycling  of  key components  such  as  paper,  cardboard  and  plastic. Pomellato  also  pays  particular  attention  to  waste recycling  and  Ulysse  Nardin  provides  special  wastesorting bins (for cups, paper, cardboard, etc.). All these initiatives  are  carried  out  with  the  help  of  local recycling companies.\n\nBottega Veneta has an internal procedure for managing the destruction of products and packaging. A  committee  was  created  in  2019  to  validate  the decisions  made,  based  on  financial  and  logistical recommendations. The House's sustainability lead is a member  of  this  committee.  To  promote  a  circular economy  culture,  in  2019  the  sustainability  team organized  the  donation  of  several  visual  tools  to non-profit organizations that needed them and then suggested that the regional offices do the same.\n\nPartnerships  have  been  established  in  order  to  find sustainable  solutions  for  waste  recycling.  Saint  Laurent, for  example,  continues  to  work  with  several  French organizations specialized in social reintegration, such as Emma\u00fcs offshoot Le Relais and Tissons  la  Solidarit\u00e9 for fabrics  and  uniforms  and Atelier  du  Bocage for  used computer equipment and ink cartridges. Benefiting from these  recycling  programs  that  have  been  in  place  for several years, Saint Laurent's new headquarters on rue de\n\nBellechasse  in  Paris  is  equipped  with  insulation  panels made from old fabrics. In line with this circular economy approach,  marble  recovered  from  former  stores  or previous  fashion  shows  was  also  used  in  the  building's restroom  facilities.  Balenciaga  launched  a  partnership with Le Relais in France to collect and recycle fabrics that cannot  be  reused  in  their  original  form.  After  being shredded,  these  fabrics  are  transformed  into  ecological building insulation known as M\u00e9tisse .  Balenciaga is thus pursuing  the  collaboration  it  began  with  Le  Relais  in 2018, which has already resulted in the recovery of more than ten metric tons of fabric. Le Relais is a member of the Emma\u00fcs network and works to promote reintegration  through  the  employment  of  vulnerable people.\n\nThe  Houses  pay  special  attention  to  decorative  items and point-of-sale (POS) materials during store cleaning or closure  programs,  for  example.  The  teams  at Alexander McQueen,  for  instance, choose  service providers  that  can  comply  with  the  new  Kering Standards. Furniture from relocated Alexander McQueen stores will be taken to a recycling center for conversion and reuse. A similar approach is taken at Brioni. During an inventory cleanup program, the House developed a plan  with  all  regions  to  donate  or  recycle  decorative items  and  POS  materials.  As  a  result,  all  items  were recycled in Japan and pieces of furniture were donated to a local school in Hong Kong. Boucheron has a set up a recycling project known as Vendorama in collaboration  with  non-profit  organization  ArtStock, which  recycles  stage  set  and  decorative  elements  for reuse on the arts circuit.\n\nIn  2020, Saint Laurent set up a partnership in France to  recycle  used  face  masks.  The  House  has  been providing  all  its  employees  with  two  face  masks  per day because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to the new partnership, these face masks will have a second life in the transportation or furniture industries.\n\nBoucheron  plans  to  distribute  reusable  cups  and bottles in order to limit the use of single-use plastics and  Alexander  McQueen  gives  all  its  employees  a reusable  stainless  steel  bottle,  to  reduce  the  waste related  to  plastic  bottles.  The  initiative  was  extended in 2020 to the United States and the APAC region.",

        "page_content": "Kering  Eyewear  has  made  similar  efforts  to  reduce waste by installing micro-filtered water dispensers in its Italian offices and  providing  all employees  with personalized  stainless  steel  bottles  designed  with  a\n\ncarbon-neutral partner. The Company also works with a specialized service provider to organize the collection of all  production  waste  containing  its  flagship  material acetate.\n\n## 4 ENVIRONMENTALLY AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAINS\n\n## 4.1 Managing our impacts beyond our own operations\n\n## A vision of responsible sourcing based on transparency and traceability\n\nThe  Kering  group  believes  that  sustainability  can  only exist  within  an  ethical  framework.  The  Group  is  aware that  its  social  and  environmental  responsibility  goes beyond its own operations and extends throughout its supply chains. It further believes that respect for human rights applies to everyone, be they employees, workers in supply chains or members of local communities.\n\nThis  vision,  embodied  by  Kering's  2025  sustainability strategy, also informs the Group's approach to human rights.  The  result  is  a  need  for  transparency  and traceability within its supply chains - and therefore to identify,  understand  and  map  those  chains  -  with  a view  to  developing  synergies  and  priority  programs wherever significant impacts are found within the raw materials industries essential to the Group's activities.\n\nIn operating terms, this vision is expressed in the two strategic  management  tools  implemented  by  the Group:  the  EP&L,  which  measures  its  environmental impacts across its various supply chains, even outside the regulatory framework, and the Kering Standards.\n\nThe Kering Standards, an unprecedented approach in the luxury goods sector, were first published in 2018, and  updated  in  2019  and  2020.  They  lay  down  the Group's  requirements  in  terms  of  traceability  for  the key  raw  materials  used  by  the  Houses.  They  are presented  in  section  4.2.4  of  this  document.  The overall  level  of  traceability  is  consolidated  annually through  the  EP&L  tool.  The  level  of  traceability required by type of material was set on the basis of a risk matrix for each type of raw material, as well as the level  of  transparency  achievable  by  the  market.  The origin  of  the  raw  materials  is  established  by  supplier declaration,  and  may  be  supplemented  by  specific protocols  including  certification  (such  as  ICEC  for leather) and verification by the Houses. In addition to audits,  the  Houses  use  various  technologies  to  trace the  path  from  the  extraction  of  raw  materials  to  the intermediate  production  stages  and  then  into  their own  operations and finally into stores. These technologies include RFID and NFC chips, blockchain, mechanical marking of hides, and forensic technology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4.2 Relationships with subcontractors and suppliers\n\n## 4.2.1 The Suppliers' Charter\n\nSince  2013,  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  has  included the  Suppliers'  Charter,  which  sets  out,  in  detail, Kering's specific expectations of its commercial partners in respect of social and environmental issues.\n\nFor  any  contractor  of  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses, notwithstanding  any  contractual  clauses,  compliance with  the  Charter  is  a  precondition  of  the  business relationship.  The  Group  requires  its  suppliers  to commit  formally  to  applying  high  ethical  standards themselves and to ensuring the preservation of human rights.\n\nThe  Charter  reminds  them  of  the  need  to  promote human rights within their production units and among their  subcontractors,  and  to  advise  Kering  and/or  its Houses  of  any  serious  difficulties  in  applying  the Charter. Compliance is further measured by means of social  audits  in  production  sites,  as  described  in section 4.3 'Working conditions in our supply chains'.\n\nAmong  other  aspects,  Kering  and  its  Houses  require their suppliers to commit to the following fundamental  principles,  in  line with the major international reference texts as presented in the Code of  Ethics  and  described  in  section  2  'Ethics,  the cornerstone  of  our  business':  to  ban  child  labor;  to proscribe  the  use  of  slavery  or  forced  or  compulsory labor; to prohibit any type of work  liable to compromise  health,  safety  or  morals;  to  prohibit  all behavior contrary to the principle of dignity at work, in particular  any  practice  contrary  to  labor  regulations, including  on  pay,  working  hours  and  conditions;  to respect the directly applicable right of representation and expression of employees; to prohibit discrimination,  notably  on  racial,  ethnic  or  sexual grounds; to forbid sexual or psychological harassment; to  respect  environmental  regulations  and,  beyond that,  to  work  towards  the  implementation  of  the Global  Compact's  three  principles  of  environmental protection, including the precautionary principle.\n\nThe Suppliers' Charter, as an integral part of the Code of Ethics, was revised in 2018 and circulated in 2019.\n\n## 4.2.2 Sustainability Principles\n\nThe  Sustainability  Principles  established  for  all  the Houses in 2015 are divided into three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 the  social  aspects  related  to  human  rights,  labor rights, and health and safety, including the elimination of child labor, forced labor, human trafficking in all its forms  and  discrimination,  compliance  with  statutory working  hours,  and  respect  for  the  freedom  of association and the right to collective bargaining;\n- \u00b7 environmental  aspects,  such  as  compliance  with laws as well as restrictive lists of chemicals defined by  Kering,  environmental  management,  and  waste water treatment;\n- \u00b7 aspects related to the supply of raw materials and packaging, including respect for animal welfare and the five related freedoms, sourcing and traceability requirements for a number of key materials used by Kering,  and  the  prohibition  of  certain  substances and/or certain sourcing regions (for reasons related to  the  social  conditions  of  production  -  child  or forced  labor,  for  instance  -  or  environmental issues).\n\nThese  principles  are  split  into  two  broad  categories: those  that  are  mandatory,  due  to  requirements imposed by international and national laws, and those embodying  Kering's  additional  expectations  and  best practices.  They  also  make  reference  to  conventions, agreements  and  major  international  texts,  for  which they  represent  a  practical  extension  (ILO  and  United Nations Conventions, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Ramsar Convention, etc.). These sustainability principles have been phased into supplier contracts  since  2016,  in  addition  to  the  Suppliers' Charter. Each supplier is in turn tasked with passing on these principles to its own subcontractor network, if it has  one.  The  principles  are  available  to  the  public  on the Group's website.\n\n## 4.2.3 Responsible purchasing policy for non-market purchases\n\nFor  non-retail  (indirect)  purchases,  the  Group's  Indirect Purchasing Department remains committed to responsible sourcing based on a reciprocal undertaking with suppliers to  respect  the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics.  It  also  has  specific commitments tailored to each category of purchases, with buyers identifying the most relevant sustainability criteria. To formalize this process, a responsible purchasing policy has been implemented at Group level.\n\nIt sets out the priorities to be shared and applied by all Group employees to manage purchasing ethically and responsibly.  It  has  been  distributed  to  all  Kering  employees. Today, all buyers are trained and made aware of responsible purchasing practices, and all purchases include CSR selection specifications and/or criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nKering further formalized these commitments in 2014 by  signing  the  2010  'Responsible  Supplier  Relations' Charter issued by the French Ministry of the Economy and  Finance,  and  the Compagnie  des  dirigeants  et acheteurs  de  France (French  purchasing  managers body - CDAF). The Charter's purpose is to promote the implementation of and compliance with best practices in relation to suppliers in France and to encourage the major signatory companies to implement a progress-oriented approach  with  their suppliers, especially  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  in order  to  develop  a  true  partnership  through  mutual knowledge  and  respect  for  each  party's  rights  and duties.\n\n## 4.2.4 The Kering Standards and their circulation\n\nIn 2012, Kering set out basic principles and guidelines on responsible sourcing, known  as  the  Kering Standards. These principles were revisited in depth and extended in 2017 as part of Kering's 2025 sustainability strategy,  so  as  to  give  fuller  details  of  the  Group's  raw material sourcing and manufacturing process requirements.  A  first  in  the  luxury  industry,  the Standards were published in January 2018 and can be downloaded  in  English,  Italian  and  French  from  the Group's website.\n\nThe  Standards  set  out  the  criteria  imposed  on  the Group and its suppliers  in  five  key  areas:  traceability, use of chemicals, social impact, environmental impact and animal welfare, describing the minimum requirements  for  Group  suppliers  in  each  of  these five areas, as well as the more demanding requirements that suppliers will have to meet by 2025. They  are  based  on  founding  notions  of  integrity (material  traceability,  chain  of  custody  certification, etc.), circularity  (use  of  recycled  materials  where possible, consideration of the recyclability of products, etc.)  and  the  precautionary  principle  (no  GMOs,  no nano-materials, etc.).\n\nThe  Kering  Standards  cover  the  key  materials  used  by the  Group,  representing  more  than  95%  of  purchasing volumes, namely leather and precious skins, fur,  wool, cotton,  silk,  synthetic  fibers,  paper,  wood,  plastic, feathers  and  down,  cellulosic  fibers,  gold,  diamonds, colored gemstones and silver. Standards have also been drawn  up  for  the  Group's  main  production  processes, namely tanning, the various stages of textile manufacture  and  leather  work.  Their  coverage  will subsequently be extended to include metal refining and precious  stone  cutting  processes.  The  2020  update  of the  Standards  included  new  sections  on  packaging, visual tools and innovation for sustainable production. The  sections  devoted  to  raw  materials  have  been\n\nenhanced, with added requirements on social aspects, a review  of  the  recommended  certifications,  and  the creation  of  an  'other  raw  materials'  section  covering materials  that  are  less  key  for  purchasing,  but  which have raised questions among the Houses.\n\nIn May  2019,  the  Group  added  to  its  Standards, publishing the Animal Welfare Standards with the aim of ensuring the best treatment for animals throughout the supply  chain.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  are the first ever set of full standards for luxury and fashion and  aim  to  drive  positive  change  in  industry  practices, and  beyond.  They  cover  all  the  species  in  the  Group's supply chains around the world, namely cattle and calves, sheep, goats, ostriches, crocodiles and alligators, pythons,  and  mammals  bred  for  their  fur.  For  each  of these  species,  the  open-source  Standards  highlight  the specific challenges, laying down breeding, transportation and  slaughtering  requirements,  and  provide  the  list  of existing  benchmark  certifications.  In  addition  to  this multi-species  document,  Kering  has  published  more detailed individual Standards for cattle, calves, sheep and goats, as well as guidelines for slaughterhouses.\n\nIn 2019, Kering traced 91% of its key materials back to the  country  of  origin  at  least,  and  even  further  for animal-based  materials  (fur,  leather,  precious  skins). The  Kering  Standards  aim  to  increase  this  level  of traceability by 2025, going as far back as the farm for all animal products.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  Kering  group  achieved  the following  levels  of  traceability  per  material  in  2019: 96% back to the slaughterhouse for leather; 79% back to  the  country  of  origin  for  wool;  82%  back  to  the country  of  origin  for  cashmere;  75%  back  to  the country of origin for cotton; 89% back to the country of origin  for  silk;  63%  sourced  from  approved  suppliers for cellulosic fibers; and 100% of gold used in jewelry and  watches  and  86%  of  total  gold  used  in  products (including galvanization for metal parts used in leather goods  or  accessories)  sourced  through  the  Group's responsible gold sourcing platform. For furs, traceability  must  go  back  to  the  farm;  for  precious skins,  it  extends  back  to  the  farm  for  farmed  species and  the  slaughterhouse  for  harvested  species;  lastly, for diamonds, it goes back to the country of origin.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering's  teams  continued  their  work  on  the circulation  of  the  Kering  Standards,  first  of  all  to  the staff within the Houses. Each House held one or more sessions internally, sometimes with support from the Materials Innovation Lab (MIL) or teams from headquarters. For example, at Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga,  the  2020  sessions  brought  together production, merchandising, fabric research and product development teams.",

        "page_content": "The  Standards  have  also  been  shared  with  all  of  the Group's  key  suppliers.  A  number  of  explanatory  and training  sessions  were  held  in  2020,  as  in  2018  and 2019,  particularly  for  suppliers  of  the  Leather  Goods, Fashion and Watches activities.\n\nTo round out these training courses, Kering's Sustainability  Department  put  in  place  an  internal e-learning  program  presenting  all  of  the  Kering Standards.  It  is  designed  to  adapt  to  the  learner's profile (design, merchandising,  material  research, product  development,  purchasing,  production/series production, quality, etc.). For each material or process, it explains  the  related  environmental  and  social challenges,  and  then  sets  out  the  measures  to  be taken to ensure responsible sourcing. Accessible since 2019  to  all  employees  via  the  Kering  Fundamentals section of the Group's e-learning platform, the course has  been  completed  by  more  than  6,400  Group employees to date. An external version of the module was  posted  online  on  the  Kering  supplier  portal  in 2020.\n\nThe Houses have embraced the e-learning module as an advanced tool for circulating the Group's requirements in  terms  of  sourcing,  encouraging  their  employees  to complete the course, and supplementing it with training actions  of  their  own.  Bottega  Veneta,  for  example, developed  an  additional  ready-to-use  materials  guide, which it has distributed since December 2019. It targets staff involved in the various stages of selecting suppliers and  making  purchases,  such  as  the  style,  materials research,  merchandising  and  purchasing  teams.  Two training  sessions  were  also  organized  to  explain  the purpose  of  the  guide  and  how  to  use  it.  Balenciaga published  internal  sustainability  guidelines  in  2020, accompanied  by  six  training  modules  based  on  the various  raw  material  categories.  It  held  13  virtual training  sessions  over  the  year,  bringing  together 490  participants  and  training  178  employees.  Saint Laurent  has  integrated  the  e-learning  module  into  its internal  training  platform,  e-university,  to  ensure  that its teams are aware of the fundamentals of sustainable procurement  and  manufacturing  processes.  With  the same goal, Kering Eyewear organized a further series of workshops for its Finance, Legal and HR teams in 2020, following those held in 2019.\n\n## 4.2.5 The Group's collaborative approach with its suppliers and business partners\n\n## 4.2.5.1 Initiatives aimed at supporting suppliers and encouraging them to adopt sustainable practices\n\nIn  line  with  the  roll-out  of  the  Kering  Standards, training  and  raising  the  awareness  of  suppliers  and helping  them  adopt  best  practices  is  the  preferred avenue taken by the Group and its Houses to achieve tangible improvements in practices across their supply chains.  The  environmental  aspect  grew  out  of  the lessons  drawn  from  the  EP&L  approach  and  the predominant role played by supply chains (Tiers 1 to 4) in the Group's environmental impact: without suppliers  sharing  Kering's  commitment  and  belief  in the need for action, potential improvements would be limited.\n\nThe Group therefore acts at several levels, as a Group and within  each  of  its  Houses,  individually  or  collectively, rolling  out  training  and  awareness  programs  as  well  as assessment mechanisms.\n\n## Training, awareness and capacity building\n\nThe  Materials  Innovation  Lab  interacts  daily  with ready-to-wear  and  accessories  suppliers  to  explain and promote compliance with the Kering Standards. In 2020,  restrictions  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic impacted  the  organization  of  a  large  proportion  of events planned with suppliers.\n\nIn 2019, Gucci organized a number of meetings with its suppliers to share its sustainability strategy, the Kering Standards  and  the  flagship  projects  implemented within  its  supply  chains.  Workshops  were  held  on  the following  themes:  FSC  materials,  animal  welfare  and traceability  (with  the  participation  of  Compassion  in World  Farming,  an  NGO),  metal-free  tanning  and GRS/GOTS  standards.  The  House  also  launched  the Gucci Supply Chain Academy (see section 3.1.2.2).\n\nAlexander McQueen held a Sustainability Summit with its  strategic  suppliers  in  December  2019.  The  event brought  together  more  than  a  hundred  participants from key spinning sites, factories and tanneries in the brand's supply chain. It included a presentation of the House's Sustainability strategy and the Kering Standards, with a view to supporting suppliers in the adoption of more sustainable practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Follow-up sessions planned for 2020 had to be postponed due to the health situation.\n\nIn  addition  to  meetings  devoted  to  presentations, exchanges and the joint development of solutions with its suppliers,  Kering  also  supports  them  in  the practical implementation of projects aimed at reducing its environmental footprint, such as the Clean By  Design  project,  described  in  'Measurement  and reduction  of  the  carbon  footprint  of  our  operations'; actions  implemented  by  LGI  to  reduce  the  carbon footprint  of  its  logistics  activities;  and  programs developed specifically in cooperation with stakeholders in the various key raw materials industries,  as  described  in  section  4.4.3  'Sustainable use of raw materials'.\n\nKering  continued  its  partnership  with  the  Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme and  other  luxury  brands  outside  the  Group  to  unite textile  and  leather  suppliers  around  the  notion  of proactive management of chemicals and the application of the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL).\n\nSince  the  Group  favors  a  collaborative  approach  as part of its strategy to promote the MRSL in its supply chains,  a  project  designed  to  encourage  Kering suppliers  to  become  MRSL-compliant  has  been  in place  since  2014.  This  project  has  allowed  Kering  to provide active support for its key suppliers and to offer implementation  tools  and  training  courses,  starting with suppliers in the leather (tanneries and suppliers in  charge  of  production)  and  textile  categories.  In 2020, sessions were extended to suppliers of finished ready-to-wear products and accessories.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses,  including  Balenciaga, Boucheron and Saint  Laurent,  are  also  committed  to working with organizations in the social and solidarity economy  (SSE),  particularly  through  contracts  for on-site services or pilot projects.\n\n## Kering project on gender equality in the supply chain in Italy with the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana\n\nWith  the  goal  of  working  towards  gender  equality,  both in-house  and  throughout  their  supply  chains,  in  2019 Kering and its Houses - Gucci, Kering Eyewear, Pomellato, plus  Saint  Laurent  since  2020,  under  the  leadership  of Bottega  Veneta  -  in  collaboration  with  the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI),  worked with three specialist  associations  (BSR, Valore  D and  Wise  Growth) on a wide-reaching study into the role of women in the\n\nsupply  chains  of  the  Italian  luxury  industry.  The  study covered more than 180 suppliers, polling a total of 880 people  (70%  women)  via  in-person  interviews  and questionnaires. The first of its kind, the study highlighted the  challenges  faced  by  women  working  in  the  luxury industry  and  issued  practical  recommendations  for improving  gender  equality.  It  identified  four  priority focuses: working conditions and economic opportunities, leadership  and  career  advancement,  motherhood,  and workplace  conduct  and  harassment.  For  the  project's second  phase,  launched  in  2020,  Kering  worked  to implement  the  recommendations  by  raising  awareness of  the  four  areas  identified  by  the  study  and by holding training  sessions  with  suppliers.  The  initially  planned 'Tour of Italy' of suppliers had to be canceled because of the health situation. It was replaced by a phygital event for  suppliers  organized  during  Milan  Fashion  Week  in September  2020.  Moderated  by  journalist  Maria  Latella, the event brought together 200 suppliers to discuss the theme of  gender  equality,  showing  how  the  issue  is  an asset in terms of resilience and innovation in the current crisis, and offering the chance for more in-depth training. At  the  end  of  2020,  165  women  -  107  white-  and  58 blue-collar  -  selected  by  Bottega  Veneta,  Gucci  and Pomellato suppliers were able to take part in an in-depth training session organized by Wise Growth on the issues of women's empowerment at work, work-life balance and self-awareness.  Kering  intends  to  continue  this  training in 2021.\n\n## Performance monitoring and assessment\n\nIn  line  with  the  objective  of  creating  a  'Supplier Sustainability  Index'  and  ensuring  its  Standards  are implemented  by  all  suppliers  by  2025,  Kering  also designed  and  implemented  a  new  supplier  portal  in 2020.  The  portal  is  an  online  collaborative  platform accessible to all suppliers of the Group's brands via the Kering supplier area, a single point of contact between suppliers  and  the  Group  on  various  topics  including sustainability. It serves as a Vendor Rating System and a means of sharing information and best practices in terms  of  sustainability.  In  particular,  the  supplier portal will enable the Group to continuously assess the implementation  of  the  Kering  Standards  across  its extended upstream supply chain, through a dedicated questionnaire.  This  information  will  then  be  used  to calculate CSR performance indicators for suppliers and to  define  the  scope  of  new  projects.  To  accompany the  launch,  online  training  was  provided  to  200 suppliers  in  a  range  of  product  categories;  a  support team and a dedicated email address were also put in place.

        "page_content": "Bottega  Veneta  launched  a  pilot  project  with  nine tanneries  in  2020  to  collect  information  on  raw materials,  suppliers  and  finished  products,  as  part  of the  new  portal  and  as  an  extension  of  initiatives undertaken in 2019 (presentation of the sustainability policy  to  more  than  300  suppliers  at  the  annual Supplier Meeting, presentations  at  trade  shows, measures to promote the MRSL among suppliers). The project will result in the adoption of a dashboard that will  allow  suppliers  to  be  assessed  based  on  key performance  indicators.  Similarly,  Saint  Laurent  has developed a set of specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for its supplier assessment system at its leather tanneries (see section 4.4.3.2).\n\nGucci has also made a commitment towards suppliers in  all  its  businesses  through  dedicated  questionnaires covering  the  various  aspects  of  their  CSR  approach: certifications and  management  systems  in  place, understanding  of  the  Kering  Standards,  water  and energy  consumption,  carbon  footprint,  waste  and chemical  product  management,  gender  equality  and employee  well-being.  In  2020,  the  House  assessed  six different categories of suppliers of raw materials, shoe parts,  metal  accessories  and  finished  products  for  its leather goods and shoes categories. The KPIs have been defined  in  line  with  the  Kering  Standards,  traceability requirements  and  the  MRSL,  as  well  as  with  suppliers' maturity in terms  of  sustainability. Lastly, Gucci published  a  further  update  of  the  Gucci  Sustainability Principles in 2020, setting out the House's requirements on  top  of  the  Kering  Group's  Supplier  Charter  and  its Sustainability Principles (see sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2).\n\nThe Group and its Houses also encourage - wherever relevant,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  size  of suppliers - the use of certifications in internationally recognized standards for environmental management systems (e.g., ISO 14001), labor relations (SA8000), and health and safety (e.g., OHSAS 18000).\n\n## 4.2.5.2 Sustainable innovation projects\n\nTo  significantly  reduce  its  environmental  footprint, Kering aims to stimulate disruptive innovation, transform its traditional processes and encourage the widespread adoption of more sustainable practices. An illustration of this determination is the Create pillar of its  2025 strategy, which makes innovation one of the drivers of the Group's sustainability approach.\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  are  therefore  committed  to  an ecosystem  of  organizations  spearheading  innovation. The Group is driving the sustainable innovation strategy and setting up internal workshops, while the Houses are\n\ndeveloping  innovative  initiatives  specific  to  their businesses and priorities. These projects are described in  greater  detail  in  section  5.3.2  'Crafting  tomorrow's Luxury by supporting innovation'.\n\n## 4.2.5.3 Supporting our suppliers during the health crisis\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  the  health  crisis  linked  to  the COVID-19  pandemic  that  swept  the  world  in  2020,  and fully  aware  of  their  role  as  responsible  players  and committed corporate citizens in their areas of operation, Kering  and  its  Houses  paid  particular  attention  to  their suppliers and subcontractors, remaining at their side to provide them with support and assistance. The following initiatives in particular are worth noting:\n\n- \u00b7 careful  monitoring  of  the  financial  impact  of  the crisis on the Group's suppliers;\n- \u00b7 strict  compliance  by  the  Group  with  all  contract terms  and  conditions,  particularly  payment  terms, with  prepayment  or  reverse  factoring  solutions implemented for some suppliers;\n- \u00b7 establishment  of  local  initiatives,  in  Italy  for instance, in association with public authorities and professional bodies, to provide advice and support, and  ensure  that  suppliers  were  properly  informed about what protective and emergency measures to adopt, particularly for the health and safety of their employees,  but  also  about  government  assistance measures in place.\n\nIn  May  2020,  Gucci  also  renewed  its  partnership  with bank Intesa Sanpaolo, established in 2015 to provide quick access to loans on attractive terms, extending it to  smaller  companies  in  its  supply  chain  in  Italy. Gucci's  support  allowed  these  companies,  which supply the Italian House with leather, textiles, jewelry and  accessories,  and  between  them  represent  more than 20,000 jobs, to benefit from conditions reserved for  large  groups,  at  reasonable  interest  rates.  Gucci and  Intesa  SanPaolo  see  the  program,  known  as Sviluppo  filiere ,  as  a  means  of  providing  support  to 'Made  in  Italy'  production  chains  by  enabling  these SMEs  to  survive  the  emergency  stemming  from  the COVID-19  pandemic  and  to  finance  their  growth, international  development  and  the  resumption  of work at production sites.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  social  audits  conducted  during the  year  included  new  questions  related  to  the pandemic  in  the  assessment  and  on-site  verification questionnaires,  particularly  on  health  and  safety measures implemented to protect suppliers' employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over  80%  of suppliers contacted responded to the study, conducted anonymously online, thereby providing the Group with precise  data  on  the  extent  and  repercussions  of  the COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  measures  taken  by suppliers  to  deal  with  it.  The  results  were  shared  with each House to give each of them a vision of the overall health of their suppliers and enable them to be vigilant and provide support where necessary.\n\n## 4.2.6 Risk management: product quality control, and consumer health and safety\n\nKering's  responsibility  towards  society  extends  across the  value  chain,  and  the  Group  is  keen  to  help  raise awareness of sustainability issues among consumers, while  ensuring  that  its  products  respect  their  health and the environment.\n\nTo enable clients to enjoy the products developed by the Houses safely, Kering has defined a set of quality control procedures  that  comply  with  the  strictest  international consumer  health,  safety  and  environmental  standards and  regulations,  such  as  REACH,  US  CPSIA,  China  GB Standards, Japan Industrial Standards (JIS), etc. In 2014, a dedicated  structure,  the  Product  Compliance  Advisory Department, was created at Group level. Aimed at pooling services, its purpose is to advise and support the Houses on  product  development  and  the  various  stages  of production,  including,  in  particular,  product  testing protocols to ensure that products comply with the local characteristics  of  each  market.  The  Department  relies primarily on the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) &  Product  Safety  Requirements,  an  internal  document listing  substances  to  be  removed  and  thresholds not to be exceeded, as well as requirements in terms of product safety.  To  take  into  account  the  pace  of  technological development  and  progress  in  chemical  research,  the PRSL is updated at least once a year.\n\nIn 2020, the Product Compliance Advisory Department continued the activities it initiated in 2018 and 2019 to spur progress in the following three areas:\n\n- 1. strengthen  compliance  controls:  regular  audits  of product compliance were conducted at the warehouse level together with the Houses to detect potential  non-compliance,  and  the  number  of laboratories accredited for tests and measurements has been increased to cover the growing number of material and product categories, including non-core  products  (food  contact  materials,  toys, electrical/electronic devices);\n- 2. improve knowledge sharing on product compliance processes: training programs have been strengthened and extended to all key departments (product  development,  production,  quality  and\n\npurchasing),  from  raw  materials  to  production (leather,  fabric  and  metal  accessories).  In  2020, some 25 training sessions were held (online, due to  the  health  crisis),  involving  more  than  1,500 employees.  They  addressed  the  key  issues  of production  processes,  compliance  requirements and  the  related  controls.  Due  to  the  increasing complexity of the Houses' products, a joint effort has  been  made  to  ensure  maximum  accuracy  in labeling.  To  this  end,  the  Product  Compliance Advisory  Department  has  created  guides  and specific  training  modules,  and  has  rolled  out  a dedicated IT tool;\n\n- 3. support the Houses' product development teams: in  collaboration  with  the  Chinese  authorities, company-specific  product  standards  have  been established  for  Kering's  Houses.  Following  the implementation  of  the  standards  for  handbags and purses in 2018, and shoes in 2019, a standard specific  to  belts  was  developed  in  2020.  These standards  make  it  possible  to  develop  leather goods meeting all requirements in terms of health, safety  and  compliance,  while  leaving  the  Houses' creative  teams  significant  scope  to  follow  their inspiration.\n\nIn  addition,  within  the  Group's  Operations  Department, the Quality Assurance and Logistics Compliance Department is tasked with optimizing the Houses' global distribution  flows  from  a  regulatory  and  procedural perspective, with a view to reducing risks, costs and time frames.  This  activity  mainly  involves  verifying  customs requirements,  gathering  and  certifying  documents  for export  and/or  sale  transactions,  and  implementing appropriate  compliance  procedures.  The  department  is also  responsible  for  providing  product  information  to internal  and  external  stakeholders  (regional  logistics offices, logistics partners  and  consumers),  and  for product quality assurance meeting the standards of the Houses  as  regards  value-added  services  (VAS),  product checks, on-demand audits, re-labeling management and the hallmarking process for jewelry.\n\nSome  Houses  also  have  specific  initiatives,  such  as Girard-Perregaux,  whose  Quality  Department  helped create a technical committee on watchmaking in 2014, also involving Ulysse Nardin, Gucci and Boucheron. In 2016,  the  committee  continued  to  discuss  actions related to regulatory compliance  in  respect  of hazardous substances and the implementation of the Product  Substance  Restricted  List  (PRSL)  and  the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL) drawn up  by  the  Group  in  the  Houses'  operations  and  with their  pool  of  suppliers.  The  MRSL  covers  production processes as opposed to products. It also sets out the list of chemicals to be eliminated or restricted. In the same  vein, Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin continued  to  participate  in  the Association  pour l'Assurance  Qualit\u00e9  des  Fabricants  de  Bracelets  Cuir (Swiss  association  of  quality  assurance  for  leather bracelets  manufacturers  -  AQC)  on  the  chemical compliance of leather used in watch straps, with the aim  of  creating  a  certification  label.

They include the leading laboratory for optical companies in Italy and a laboratory performing chemical compliance testing of acetates and sunglass lenses.\n\nIn  2018,  Bottega  Veneta,  in  line  with  the  Group's commitment to the MRSL, was the first House to roll out  the  list  to  a  group  of  leather  goods  and  shoe\n\nmanufacturers. In 2019 and 2020, the brand continued its work to bring an ever-greater proportion of leather goods and shoe production workshops in line with its MRSL  approach.  Twelve  new  suppliers  have  been included  since  2019.  In  addition,  more  than  95%  of leather  used  by  the  House  comes  from  tanneries participating  in  the  Chemical  Management  Voluntary Project.\n\n## 4.3 Working conditions in our supply chains\n\nKering's actions in respect of working conditions in its supply  chains  are  part  of  the  Group's  analysis  of non-financial  risks,  the  duty  of  care  and  the  Group's human  rights  approach,  as  presented  under  'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business' and elsewhere in this NFIS.\n\n## 4.3.1 Implementation of the social audit system within the Group\n\nNo  control  system,  regardless  of  how  mature  and tested it is, can guarantee the absence of risk, and it is up to  the  Group  and  its  Houses  to  develop  the  most efficient collaborative and  control  systems  with suppliers  in  order  to  keep  risk  to  a  minimum  and implement  any  corrective  action  in  cases  where non-compliance is identified.\n\nTo  meet  these  challenges,  Kering  has  established  a dedicated  organization.  2016  was  a  major  turning point  in  the  approach  to  supplier  management  and assessment,  with  the  complete  redesign  of  the organization. The challenge was that different Houses had  potentially  adopted  different  practices,  and distinct audit and risk evaluation methods, and that a single  supplier  working  for  several  of  the  Group's Houses could potentially face multiple audits. Therefore, the decision was made  in  2015  to significantly  improve  the  system's  efficiency  and  to unify practices and the monitoring of the process across\n\nKering's  entire  Luxury  Division,  which  now  represents the  entire  Group.  On  that  basis,  a  single  central  body allowing  Kering  to  control  the  compliance  of  Group suppliers  was  established  in  late  2015,  and  began operating  in  January  2016.  The  new  organization,  the Hercules system, is based on six key pillars:\n\n- 1. The Sustainability Principles established for all the Luxury  Houses  in  2015,  which  are  divided  into three areas: social aspects related to human rights, labor  rights,  and  health  and  safety;  environmental aspects;  and  aspects  related  to  raw  materials sourcing  and  packaging  (see  section  4.2.2  for details).\n- 2. Kering  provides  central  management  through  a team  of  24  people  (one  Director,  one  Manager, 12  auditors  specialized  in  conducting  supplier audits  and  monitoring  anomalies,  seven  people dedicated  to  management,  and  three  planners); depending on needs (locations, workload, etc.), this team  can  be  assisted  by  an  external  service provider.\n- 3. Clear  and  uniform  procedures  for  all  the  Houses, corresponding to the different stages of the supplier relationship,  including  the  activation  procedure, monitoring  procedure,  and  termination  of  contract procedure.\n- 4. Risk assessments and audit plans are constructed on the basis of a set of predefined criteria. Audit plans  are  regularly  updated  to  take  into  account new  suppliers  and  exclude  those  that  have become inactive.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A  single  and  comprehensive  audit  methodology, including not only the key chapters relating to social compliance,  but  also  the  essential  components relating  to  health  and  safety,  and  environmental management. Containing 97 questions, the comprehensive  audit  questionnaire  is  divided  into 13  categories  (child  labor,  forced  labor,  health  and safety,  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective bargaining, discrimination, the environment, etc.) and aligned with the best standards in the field, in  particular  the  SA8000  and  SMETA  standards.  The audits are consolidated between the Houses in order to avoid any overlap in the audits. Follow-up audits with a smaller scope focus on the area(s) in which breaches of compliance were identified or observations were made during the first comprehensive audit. In any case, the announced or unannounced  audits  consist  of  document  reviews, site  tours,  and  workers  interviews.  Workers  are selected  to  offer  a  representation  of  the  workforce, notably concerning age and union affiliation, if any. These  interviews  are  confidential.  The  frequency  of audits  depends  on  the  findings  of  previous  audits, meaning that  better  rated  suppliers  will  tend  to  be audited less frequently. Nevertheless, periodic audits will be undertaken regularly to ensure compliance.\n- 6. Anomalies  classified  into  four  categories  and standard responses to each case:\n- a) zero  tolerance  breaches  (relating  to  the  most serious  situations  liable  to  be  encountered, specifically  child  labor,  forced  labor,  irregular work, undeclared subcontractors, threats, discrimination, serious breaches of regulations, counterfeiting, etc.);\n- b) serious compliance breaches:\n\nThe supplier is given one month to resolve the serious  compliance  breach,  and  a  follow-up audit  is  scheduled  to  confirm  that  the  issue has been resolved.\n\nIdentification  of  a  zero  tolerance  breach  or serious compliance breach triggers the immediate  establishment  of  a  committee bringing  together  the  Kering  audit  team  and the relevant House(s) to decide on the future of the  relationship  with  the  supplier:  immediate shutdown  of  the  approval  process  if  the supplier is in the process of being activated but has  not  started  working;  and  discussions about  the  possibility  of  remediation  and support for the supplier or about the need to terminate  the  contractual  relationship  if  the supplier is working on one or more orders. The brand  is  the  ultimate  decision-maker  on  the most appropriate response;\n\n- c) moderate compliance breach:\n\nThe  supplier  is  given  three  months  to  resolve the moderate  compliance  breach,  and  a follow-up  audit  is  scheduled  to  confirm  that the issue has been resolved;\n\n- d) observations:\n\nThese give rise to a corrective action plan, and are the subject of a dedicated checklist at the next  audit.  The  supplier  has  six  months  to remedy the observation.\n\nFor  each  of  the  13  categories  of  the  comprehensive audit  questionnaire,  a  detailed  description  of  what constitutes zero tolerance breaches, serious or moderate compliance breaches and observations has been prepared. For example, in the health and safety category, any situation liable to endanger the lives of workers  is  a  zero  tolerance  breach;  the  absence  of mandatory  documentation  on  aspects  liable  to endanger  the  health  or  safety  of  employees  is  a serious compliance breach; the absence of mandatory documentation other than that addressing the health or safety of workers is a moderate compliance breach; and a deviation from existing procedures results in an observation. In the social category, the falsification of the  certificate  proving  payment  of  social  security contributions  is  a  zero  tolerance  breach;  any  issue relating to the minimum wage is a serious compliance breach; a failure to comply with updates to collective bargaining  agreements  is  a  moderate  compliance breach;  and  a  failure  to  implement  laws  to  promote the  professional  integration  of  vulnerable  people results in an observation.\n\nDepending  on  the  results  of  audits,  suppliers  are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 compliant (no zero tolerance breaches, no compliance breaches,  whether  serious  or  moderate,  fewer  than five observations);\n- \u00b7 partially compliant (no zero tolerance breaches, no serious compliance breaches, fewer than five moderate breaches);\n- \u00b7 progress  expected  (no  zero  tolerance  breaches, more than five moderate compliance breaches or at least one serious breach);\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance (at least one zero tolerance breach).\n\nThis  organization,  effective  since  January  1,  2016,  is being  phased  into  both  Kering's  Houses  and  their suppliers.\n\n## 4.3.2 Supply chain map\n\nAs a Group of leading global Houses, Kering operates in the luxury market, whose supply chains are structured in a very specific way, as evidenced by the location of the  suppliers  in  the  centrally  managed  database in 2020.",

Suppliers  to  the  Jewelry  and Watches  Houses  are  gradually  being  phased  into the system:\n- \u00b7 to date, it covers 3,912 suppliers, with the following breakdown:\n- - 22%  direct  suppliers  (a  supplier  is  deemed  direct when it has a direct business relationship with the Houses rather than working via a subcontractor),\n- - 17% contractors (direct suppliers working for one or  more  Houses  and  which  subcontract  part  of their production),\n- - 61% subcontractors (working for contractors and having  no  direct  business  relationship  with  the Houses).\n\nDirect suppliers with or without subcontracting are T1 suppliers (39% in 2020).\n\nSubcontractors are T2 suppliers (61% in 2020).\n\n4.7%  of  suppliers  were  deemed  strategic  in  2020. Strategic suppliers  are  those  needed  to  ensure business continuity  due  to  the  volume  of  production involved. In addition, 4.83% of suppliers are deemed at risk  because they are located in countries considered by the Group to be at risk. A country is deemed to be\n\n'at  risk'  when  the  indicators  contained  in  various external  databases  imply  that  human  rights  risks  are high or very high.\n\n9.5%  of  suppliers  were  deemed  critical  in  2020. Suppliers are deemed critical when they are strategic and/or at risk. They are given special attention in view of their importance to the business and their location.\n\nSubcontracting  without  prior  authorization  is  not permitted.\n\nAmong  its  suppliers,  Kering  also  singles  out  raw material  suppliers.  Raw  materials  suppliers  identified as key to the Group represent roughly 20% of all such suppliers,  corresponding  to  approximately  80%  of purchases.\n\nLastly, for a limited portion of its activities (fragrances and  cosmetics),  Kering  also  works  with  licensed suppliers,  i.e.,  those  that  are  under  license  to  the Houses.\n\nWithin  this  portfolio  of  suppliers,  2,399  audits  were conducted in 2020 despite the health crisis (3,241 in 2019), breaking down as 1,102 comprehensive audits and  1,297  follow-up  audits.  A  total  of  37%  of  these audits were carried out by Kering's Internal Audit team, and  63%  by  external  auditors,  with  the  Group  audit protocol  applied  in  the  same  way  for  all  audits conducted.  This  means  that  41%  of  suppliers  were audited  in  2020.  Over  the  2015-2020  period,  88%  of suppliers  were  audited,  5%  more  than  in  2015-2019. Some  of  these  audits  concern  suppliers  that  have become inactive: 297 of the audits carried out in 2020 covered suppliers that were inactive at the end of the year, and 50% of the suppliers in the system that are now inactive have been audited since 2015.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to auditing activities, the team is involved  in  support  activities  on  special  projects  in partnership with the Houses  and  other  Kering departments.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible to carry out any on-site audits in Italy during the period from mid-March to mid-June 2020.

Audits of this type, which were only conducted in Italy, ensured the  continuity  of  supply  chain  checks,  prevented  the spread of the virus and avoided complications in the organization  of  production.  Documentary  audits  are considered partial  and  non-exhaustive,  and  therefore did  not  lead  to  the  investigation  of  anomalies identified.  A  total  of  222  documentary  audits  were carried  out  between  April  and  June.  They  are  not counted among the 2,399 audits performed.\n\nThe 2,399 audits conducted  in 2020  revealed 9,391 anomalies, breaking down as follows:\n\nBreakdown by severity of anomalies recorded during social audits carried out by the Kering group among critical T1 suppliers as of December 31, 2020",

Follow-up  audits  were  then  conducted  to  verify  the resolution of the problem. The zero-tolerance breaches identified during the audits were dealt with immediately, in accordance with established rules and in  coordination with the relevant Houses. To speed up the  resolution  of  issues,  the  central  team  held  more than 253 committee meetings with the Houses.\n\nFor  example,  in  February  2020,  a  supplier  failed  to provide  risk  assessment  documentation  and  did  not provide  evidence  of  the  appointment  or  training  of safety officers, which constitutes a serious health and safety compliance breach. The breach was reviewed by the committee and corrective action was taken; as the missing documentation  was  finally provided in compliance  with  local  legislation,  the  compliance breach  was  reclassified  as  an  observation  and  the supplier will be subject to a follow-up audit to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.\n\nAnother case identified in  October  2020  concerned  a serious  compliance  breach  relating  to  employment contracts that contained clauses that did not comply with  local  law.  This  breach  was  also  the  subject  of  a corrective action plan and the non-compliant clauses were removed from new contracts.\n\n## 4.3.4 Beyond social audits\n\nNo matter how robust and efficient, a social auditing system is never sufficient to ensure that there are no risks  in  the  complex  supply  chains  of  a  global  Group, whose links - and especially the most distant ones are  shared  with  other  luxury  groups,  or  even  other industries, such as the textile industry or even the food industry for leather, a key raw material for the Kering group.\n\n## 4.4 Preserving natural capital\n\n## 4.4.1 EP&L: Environmental Profit & Loss account\n\nSince  2012,  Kering  has  measured  and  quantified  its progress  toward  becoming a more sustainable Group through  its  Environmental  Profit  and  Loss  account (EP&L). The cornerstone of its environmental approach, it  also  serves  as  a  management  tool  by  which  Kering lays out its roadmap for the coming years in terms of sourcing  strategy  and  choice  of  materials.  Kering  has undertaken  to  reduce  its  EP&L  intensity  by  40%  by 2025 compared with 2015.\n\nTo this end, Kering, as a major player in the luxury goods industry and aware of its social responsibility in respect of  a  wide  range  of  suppliers,  subcontractors  and  raw material production chains, engages in continuous and collaborative dialogue on human rights with the various players in its supply chains through:\n\n- \u00b7 sector-based initiatives such as membership of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and Textile Exchange (see section 5.1);\n- \u00b7 programs  specifically  designed  by  the  Kering  group for  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  such  as  the project on equal access to professional opportunities for women  in the luxury industry in Italy, coordinated by Bottega Veneta with Gucci, Pomellato and Kering Eyewear and Saint Laurent, and, outside the  Group,  with  the Camera  Nazionale  della  Moda Italiana (see section 4.2);\n- \u00b7 capacity building programs to support suppliers in human  resources  and  human  rights  management with  their  own  subcontractors  and  stakeholders, following the example of Gucci and Bottega Veneta as part of their SA8000 certification (see section 4.2);\n- \u00b7 House-led initiatives on specific challenges, such as the  project  developed  by  Gucci  for  the  integration of refugees in Italy with the Adecco Foundation and the UNHCR.\n\nThis  dialogue  and  its  social  impact  on  the  Group's activities  and  beyond  its  operations  are  described  in section  2.6  'Protection  of  human  rights'.  It  is  part  of Kering's  global  approach  to  stakeholder  dialogue  on sustainability issues, as presented  in  section  5.1 'Stakeholder dialogue'.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  demonstrated the effectiveness of its environmental strategy through a 29% reduction in its EP&L  intensity  (\u20acEP&L/\u20ack  in  revenue)  compared  with 2015. In line with its commitment to transparency, the Group's EP&L results and an analysis of progress made have  been  shared  via  the  open  source  platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com. Lastly, the EP&L scope can  now  be  extended  to  the  product  use  and end-of-life  phases  thanks  to  a  new  methodological approach shared in a white paper.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering uses the EP&L results, expressed in monetary terms, to:\n\n- \u00b7 translate its environmental impacts into a common business language;\n- \u00b7 compare environmental impacts between separate units;\n- \u00b7 compare, for any given environmental indicator, the magnitude  of  an  impact  for  different  locations (particularly useful for water availability, an eminently local issue);\n\nFor Kering and its Houses, the EP&L represents a new way  of  looking  at  its  activities.  It  reveals  areas  for improvement  where  the  Group  can  deploy  solutions, using innovative new technologies and materials that significantly reduce the environmental impact caused by the way in which raw materials are processed and goods manufactured.\n\nThe EP&L approach goes beyond standard environmental reporting, producing a richer and much fuller picture of the impacts of Kering's activities.\n\nThe results should not be seen as a liability or a cost for Kering.  Rather,  they  represent  a  way  of  assessing  the cost  to  society  of  environmental  changes  stemming from the activities of the Group and its suppliers.\n\n- \u00b7 facilitate  comparisons  between  its  Houses  and business units.\n\n## 4.4.1.2 Scope covered by the EP&L approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THESE IMPACTS ON LOCAL POPULATIONS /parenleft.cap\u20ac/parenright.cap\n\nEnvironmental change resulting from emissions or use of resources is translated into economic terms, taking into account local contexts and impacts on local populations.",

At the same time, impacts relating to some materials, including metals, have eased despite an increase in volumes, reflecting the Houses' ongoing efforts to integrate an increasing proportion of recycled materials or innovative alternatives with less impact into their operations.\n\nInternally  within  Kering's  operations,  efforts  carried out to save energy and use green energy at stores and production  sites  over  recent  years  have  resulted  in  a significant reduction in the environmental footprint in absolute  terms,  which  is  a  very  positive  outcome  in this context of sustained growth.\n\n## EP&L impact (in \u20ac millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA detailed analysis of the Group's environmental profile shows  that  the  supply  chain  accounts  for  92%  of impacts, with 76% attributable to the production of raw materials (Tier 4) and their initial processing (Tier 3).\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use and water pollution  remain  the  predominant  impact  indicators, accounting for more than 80% of the total impact.

        "page_content": "## 4.4.1.4 Improvement of the tool and the method\n\nThe  EP&L  serves  primarily  as  a  decision-making  tool providing  input  to  the  Group's  sustainability  projects and guiding the day-to-day choices of decision-makers, with  the  ultimate  goal  of  reducing  the  environmental impact of both Kering and its supply chains.\n\nThe  roll-out  in  2017  of  an  internal  modeling  tool including  a  dynamic  visualization  of  results  made  it possible to meet this objective. Known as Demeter, it is designed to create scenarios serving to estimate the impacts of a project or product on the Houses' EP&Ls. In  2020,  Kering  continued  its  efforts  to  increase  the reliability  of  the  data  used  in  the  EP&L,  notably  by automating the reporting of a certain number of items and by adding control and verification processes.\n\nTo strengthen this approach, one of the Group's Statutory Auditors  conducted  the  first  ever  critical  review  of  the data reporting and consolidation processes in 2020. The work also focused on the main calculation steps and the methods for expressing impacts in monetary terms.\n\nOf  particular  note  this  year  was  the  publication  of  a white  paper  presenting  a  methodological  approach  to adding the product use and end-of-life phase impacts to  the  EP&L  scope.  The  study  included  an  initial estimate, determining that the product use and end-oflife phases account for 8% of the total EP&L impact. The figure  can  vary  quite  significantly  depending  on  the business  unit.  While  the  impact  is  very  limited  for leather  goods  (3.5%),  the  product  use  and  end-of-life phases can generate significant impacts in the ready-to-wear segment (up to 26% of the total impact). The expansion of the EP&L scope planned for 2020 will pave  the  way  for  further  initiatives  targeting  the  way clients choose to care for the items they purchase, with a view to proposing more sustainable alternatives.\n\n## 4.4.1.5 Transparency, innovation and promotion of natural capital accounting\n\nTrue  to  its  commitments  to  transparency  and  the sharing of its practices, Kering launched a digital EP&L platform  in  June  2019,  allowing  users  to  browse  the Group's  EP&L  results  interactively.  All  results  are  now available online, from the Group's overall impact to the specific details, such as the materials used, processing activities  at  each  stage  of  the  chain,  and  sourcing locations.  The  platform  also  allows  access  to  the underlying  data  sets,  signifying  that  the  various environmental  key  performance  indicators  (eKPIs), which show the environmental impacts of the Group's activities, and the related valuation coefficients can be accessed and downloaded by anyone. The aim of this high level of transparency is to enable other luxury and fashion  players  to  initiate  their  own  EP&L  analysis. Simultaneously,  Gucci  has  launched  its  own  digital\n\nEP&L  portal,  accessible  from  its  Gucci  Equilibrium website, which now  offers its community  the opportunity to interact with the House's EP&L and to learn about the measures taken to reduce it.\n\nA  final  noteworthy  initiative  was  the  2017  launch  of the  My  EP&L  app,  which  gives  all  users  the  keys  to understanding  the  environmental  impact  of  Luxury products  and  aims  to  reinforce  information  and transparency around natural capital accounting.\n\n## Platforms for dialogue and exchange\n\nLastly, in addition to sharing its EP&L methodology, its findings  and  its  data  within  organizations  such  as  the Capitals  Coalition,  the  World  Business  Council  for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) and  the  EU  Business  Biodiversity Platform, Kering held numerous bilateral meetings with the  signatories  of  the  Fashion  Pact  to  share  its experience of natural capital accounting.\n\nIn particular, 2020 saw Kering join the Value Balancing Alliance  (VBA),  which  aims  to  define  an  international standard for approaches to measuring environmental, social  and  societal  impacts  and  expressing  them  in monetary terms. The VBA brings together international groups recognized for their impact valuation practice, such as BASF, SAP, Novartis, BMW Group and Deutsche Bank, but also representatives from academia (Oxford, Harvard  Business  School),  standardization  bodies (SASB, IFRS) and institutions (OECD), with the support of consulting firms (PwC, Deloitte, EY, KPMG).\n\n## 4.4.2 Projects, collaborations and initiatives geared towards reducing our suppliers' environmental impact\n\n## 4.4.2.1 Measuring and regulating the carbon footprint outside our operations\n\n## Main impacts\n\nAs  mentioned  in  section  3.2  under  'Climate  strategy', Kering firmly believes that businesses have a decisive role to  play  in  the  face  of  unanimous  recognition  of  the urgency  and  criticality  of  climate  change.  The  carbon footprint of human activity, and in particular businesses, has numerous  impacts,  which  are  analyzed  and described in the Group's EP&L methodology: the increase in  atmospheric  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  is liable  to  result  in  changes  in  weather  patterns,  higher water levels and average temperatures, and an increased likelihood of extreme weather events, thereby generating adverse  human  health  impacts  (malnutrition,  disease), risks of disruption  to  economic  activities,  reduced agricultural  yields,  desertification  and  other  serious disturbances of ecosystem services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group's  2019  EP&L  results  show  that  36%  of Kering's  environmental  impacts  relate  to  greenhouse gas  emissions,  and  that  they  are  mostly  in  Tier  4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\nIn addition to rolling out the Kering Standards across all of its activities, thus helping to reduce the Group's carbon  footprint  outside  its  operations  through  the adoption  of  raw  material  sourcing  practices  with  a reduced  carbon  footprint,  building,  for  instance,  on requirements  in  respect  of  animal  rearing  methods, the Group's climate strategy is described in the section entitled 'Climate strategy'. The actions undertaken by the  Group  to  specifically  target  its  footprint  in  its supply chains, outside its own activities, are described below.\n\n## Commitment and initiatives\n\nKering contributes to the practical implementation of projects aimed at reducing the environmental footprint  of  its  suppliers,  as  shown  by  the  Clean  By Design  project.  Spearheaded  in  2013  by  the  NRDC (Natural  Resources  Defense  Council),  the  Clean  by Design  program  aims  to  reduce  the  environmental footprint of textile manufacturers through the organization of energy-water audits reviewing ten key points of the performance of a production site.\n\nWhile  the  NRDC  initially  developed  this  program mainly with groups whose supply chains are located in China, Kering studied and demonstrated its feasibility for suppliers in Italy as early as 2014. The program was subsequently  spun  off  to  the  suppliers  of  Kering's Houses in 2015. Since then, Clean by Design has been implemented on the premises of 37 Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers located in Italy (dyeing, printing and finishing factories, spinning and weaving mills, denim laundries),  and  has  also  been  extended  to  other activities further up supply chains through three wool cleaning factories and three silk mills.\n\nThe  factories  involved  in  the  program  received  an assessment  of  their  energy  efficiency,  and  water  and chemicals  use  from  Kering,  and  subsequently  agreed to take certain initiatives to improve their performance. The average energy savings obtained are 19% per site, mainly in the range of 10% to 20%, with\n\nhighs of 40%. The program has compelling economic appeal,  since  the  return  on  investment  of  efficiency initiatives  for  suppliers  is  less  than  2.5  years  in  Italy and less than one year in China.\n\nIn 2020, Kering joined forces with other brands, namely Stella McCartney and Burberry, to develop the program under  the  supervision  of  the  Apparel  Impact  Institute (Aii),  which took over the program leadership from the NRDC in 2018 and is expanding it on a larger scale. The local  partner  managing  the  program  in  Italy  will  be Legambiente, the country's largest environmental NGO. On the strength of this new  multi-brand and multi-stakeholder organization, Kering aims to develop the  program  on  a  much  larger  scale  involving  many more  suppliers  and  other  brands  in  order  to  steer developments  in  the  textile  supply  chain  towards increasingly ambitious sustainability objectives.\n\nKering's logistics platform, LGI, also runs awareness-raising and discussion meetings  with suppliers  and  logistics  partners.  Since  2017,  these meetings  have  placed  a  sharp  focus  on  carbon footprint mapping. Most freight operators now provide the  Group  with  CO2  reports  compliant  with  the EN 16258 standard.\n\n## 4.4.2.2 Chemicals management\n\n## Main impacts\n\nAs analyzed in 2013 in the Group's EP&L methodology, the use of chemicals has numerous  impacts, particularly  in  terms  of  water  pollution  and  waste generation.  For  instance,  waste  treatment  methods (landfill, incineration, etc.) can result in the discharge of landfill leachate into the soil, while water pollution can disrupt  aquatic  ecosystems  through  eutrophication. This  can  have  adverse  human  health  impacts  (disease caused by toxic products or poor water quality), and can also result in reduced agricultural or fishing yields and other serious disruptions of eco-system services.\n\nThe Group's EP&L methodology allows it to track and quantify its annual impact on natural capital, particularly with regard to waste and water pollution. The  2019  EP&L  results  show  that  19%  of  Kering's environmental  impacts  relate  to  waste  and  water pollution, and  that  they  are  mostly  in  Tier  4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.",

        "page_content": "Hundreds  of  different  chemicals  are  used  in  the production of the items made by Kering's Houses. Risk mapping conducted in 2014 served to prioritize areas on  which  to  focus  efforts  to  eliminate  all  hazardous substances from supply chains. This mapping is based on the inherent risks of the processes, the production geography,  the  sector's  maturity  and  production volumes.  The  biggest  risks  have  been  identified  on leather  (including  tanning  and  finishing)  and  textiles (especially dyeing). The Watches and Jewelry industries have  been  rated  as  least  at  risk  among  the  Group's activities. The approach taken by the Group to address these risks is described below.\n\n## Commitment and initiatives\n\nAs  well  as  complying  with  fundamental  local  and international  regulations,  Kering  has  set  itself  the target of eliminating all hazardous chemicals from all its Houses' products and production processes. To do so,  the  Group  has  established  two  types  of  lists  of substances subject to restrictions: one for production processes,  the  Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance List (MRSL),  and  one  for  products,  the  Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL).\n\nThe  MRSL  is  focused  on  discontinuing  the  use  of dangerous  chemicals  in  the  manufacturing  process, first to  ensure  that  workers  within  the  Group's operations and in the supply chains of the Houses are not exposed to hazardous substances, and second to reduce toxic discharges into water.\n\nSince January 1, 2020, contracts signed with suppliers ensure that no substance listed in Kering's MRSL V1.0 (dated  November 2016) may be intentionally used in the  manufacturing  processes  of  the  Houses'  supply chains.\n\nThe implementation of the MRSL followed a risk-based approach and was carried out in three main stages:\n\n- \u00b7 2014-2016: start-up through a pilot phase including the four Kering tanneries;\n- \u00b7 2016-2019:  development  of  a  set  of  guidelines, tools  and  methodologies  for  rolling  out  the  MRSL, which was then introduced across the entire leather supply chain from 2016 and textiles from 2018;\n- \u00b7 2020: audit of the correct application of the MRSL using  a  methodology  developed  the  previous  year. The dual objective of this audit methodology is to verify supplier compliance with MRSL requirements and promote continuous improvement. The methodology was tested and applied to 40 leather and  textile  suppliers  in  2019,  and  an  additional 46 suppliers in 2020.\n\nAs  2020  marked  the  transition  to  an  approach  more focused  on  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the MRSL,  an  assessment  of  the  progress  made  within Kering's  supply  chain  was  carried  out.  Despite  the challenges  posed  by  the  COVID-19  crisis,  around  900 key materials suppliers (including leather and fabrics) and  finished  parts  for  leather  goods,  shoes  and ready-to-wear were involved, achieving the commitment  to  cover  approximately  90%  of  Kering's supply chain.\n\nIn  2016, Kering officially joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme as a signatory brand, having been an observer since 2015. The  ZDHC  Programme  is  supported  by  roughly 30  major  international  brands  and  upwards  of 100  industrial  partners  committed  to  encouraging sector-wide  take-up  of  best  practices  and  the  use  of sustainable  chemicals  with  a  view  to  eradicating  the most  hazardous  substances  from  textile,  leather  and footwear industry supply chains. Kering plays an active role in the work of the ZDHC Programme and, in 2020, continued  to  help  it  expand  its  activity  in  Italy  by promoting  contact  with  key  players  and  suppliers. Version 2.0 of Kering's MRSL was released in 2020: with a  view  to  aligning  standards  within  the  industry,  the MRSL 2.0 is aligned with the ZDHC MRSL V2.0, but goes further  by  also  banning  certain  perfluorochemicals (PFCs).\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  continued  to  participate  in  the  ZDHC Brands  to  Zero  Programme,  for  which  purpose  the Group's actions taken to eliminate dangerous chemicals from its production processes were evaluated by a third party.  The  primary  goal  of  this  initiative  is  to  assess signatory  brands'  alignment  with  the  ZDHC  Programme and to promote the harmonization of industry efforts by defining a personalized roadmap for each brand.\n\nTo  assist  players  in  its  supply  chains  in  their  MRSL compliance efforts, Kering held three training sessions for the leather and textile industries in 2019. They were focused on the methodology and tools available for the implementation  of  the  MRSL.  In  addition,  a  training event jointly organized with the ZDHC Programme and five other international groups brought together 250 participants from leather and textile supply chains in Italy. Here again, the sharing of experiences with the ZDHC Programme allows for a synergy of efforts and the pooling of technical expertise.\n\nThese  measures  are  complemented  by  a  number  of initiatives  within  each  of  the  Houses.  To  manage chemical  risks, Kering Eyewear  uses  centralized chemical  substance  tracking  software  in  the  form  of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) at its Manufacture Cartier  Lunettes  (MCL)  production  site,  allowing  it  to prioritize materials on the basis of their risk level.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2018, Bottega Veneta was the first House to roll out the  MRSL  to  a  group  of  leather  goods  and  shoe manufacturers.  To  this  end,  a  half-day  of  training bringing together seven key suppliers was organized at the  Montebello  workshop.  Suppliers  then  completed their first self-assessment in December 2018. In 2019, the brand continued its work to bring an ever-greater proportion  of  leather  goods  and  shoe  production workshops in  line  with  its  MRSL  approach.  A  total  of 12 new suppliers received training in the MRSL and its tools, either at the brand's headquarters in Montebello or by videoconference. To date, more than 95% of the leather used in leather goods and shoes comes from tanneries included in the brand's voluntary chemicals management project.\n\nGucci,  meanwhile,  as  Chair  of  the  Sustainability Committee of the Camera Nazionale Della Moda (CNMI), was  particularly  active  in  the  debate  on  the  negative impact of dangerous chemicals in the luxury industry, and contributed to the preparation and circulation of Industry Guidelines on eco-toxicological requirements for  apparel,  leather  goods,  footwear  and  accessories. The House has completed the implementation of the MRSL  with  major  raw  material,  shoes,  leather  goods and ready-to-wear suppliers.\n\n## 4.4.2.3 Land use and protection of biodiversity\n\nFirmly believing that businesses have a decisive role to play in the face of scientists' observation of biodiversity loss, and that there is a link between the preservation of ecosystems  and  the  sustainability  of  its  economic activity,  Kering  has  made  protecting  biodiversity  a  key aspect of its business strategy. As a player in the luxury sector, the nature of its products and the corresponding quality requirements make the Group largely dependent  on  natural  raw  materials  (wool,  cashmere, leather, cotton, silk, etc.) and their ecosystems. Climate change is already starting to disrupt these ecosystems, making  it  essential  to  boost  their  resilience.  These biodiversity-rich natural habitats provide  essential services to our societies, such as climate regulation, soil regeneration, water filtration and the availability of raw materials for our activities, but also for food, medicine and construction.\n\nThis  is  the  spirit  of  the  Group's  biodiversity  strategy, which  was  published  in  July  2020.  As  part  of  this strategy, Kering is committed to having a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025. To achieve this, Kering has  agreed  to  a)  protect  one  million  hectares  of essential  and  irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its supply  chain;  and  b)  facilitate  the  transition  to regenerative  agricultural  practices  on  an  additional one  million  hectares  in  areas  where  raw  materials entering Kering's supply chain, such as leather, cotton, wool  or  cashmere,  are  extracted.  For  this  purpose, Kering has created the Regenerative Fund for Nature.\n\nKering's biodiversity strategy is directly aligned with the guidelines of the Science Based Targets Network, which brings  together  leading  scientists  and  environmental NGOs from around the world to create a trajectory for nature,  similar  to  what  has  been  done  for  the  climate with  the  1.5\u00b0C  global  warming  target.  Under  the network's  leadership,  Kering  is  advancing  its  work  on biodiversity by:\n\n- \u00b7 continuing  to  refine  the  measurement  of  the Group's  impact  on  biodiversity  (through  the  EP&L methodology);\n- \u00b7 prioritizing key geographies;\n- \u00b7 setting targets for biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 taking measures guided by the conservation hierarchy based on the following four-step sequence: 1) avoid, 2) reduce, 3) restore/regenerate, 4) transform;\n- \u00b7 measuring progress in relation to predefined objectives.\n\n## Measurement of ecosystem services and biodiversity\n\nThe Group's EP&L methodology allows it to track and quantify its annual impact on natural capital, particularly  with  regard  to  biodiversity  and  land  use. The  Group's  2019  EP&L  results  show  that  32%  of Kering's  environmental  impacts  relate  to  biodiversity and  land  use,  and  that  they  are  mostly  in  Tier  4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\nKering is committed to improving the allowance made for  biodiversity  and  eco-system  services  in  its  EP&L and to improving the data and knowledge underlying these evaluations. Work in 2020 focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 the creation of a biodiversity indicator in collaboration  with  the  Cambridge  Institute  for Sustainability  Leadership  and  the  Natural  Capital Impact  Group  (NCIG).  This  indicator,  known  as  the Biodiversity Impact Metric (BIM), measures the impact of  a  business's  operations  on  biodiversity,  with  a particular  focus  on  the  supply  chain.  The  metric provides  a  basis  for  comparing  the  impacts  of different raw materials or supply regions on biodiversity,  and  can  therefore  be  used  to  guide actions taken to reduce those impacts. Following the publication of an initial methodology by the University of  Cambridge  in  2017,  a  second  version  including feedback from conservation experts and other stakeholders  was  presented  in  2018  at  an  event hosted by HRH The Prince of Wales in London and the Business  and  Biodiversity  Platform  in  Brussels.  In 2019,  the  BIM  was  tested  on  a  number  of  raw materials  supply  chains  for  the  Group's  brands,  in particular for textile fibers including cotton, cashmere and wool. In 2020, the CISL published the final version of the BIM, which also includes models on additional materials such as leather and viscose. The CISL team is now working alongside EP&L specialists to refine  the measurement of the Group's impact on biodiversity;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 the  continuation  of  the  partnership  with  Stanford University's  Natural  Capital  Project  and  NASA  to explore opportunities for using remote sensor data to track changes and progress in ecosystem services generated  by  the  implementation  of  sustainable pastoral practices by nomadic cashmere breeders in the  Gobi  region  of  Mongolia.  This  partnership  is part of a five-year program aimed at demonstrating that remote sensor data can be used in real time to support the development  of  low-impact  and biodiversity-friendly  farming  methods.  For  Kering, this  work is  of  particular  importance,  as  it  enables the  Group  to  contribute  directly  to  scientific progress in natural climate solutions for agriculture.\n\n## Focus on key geographies\n\nThe  results  of  the  EP&L  have  given  Kering  a  better understanding of the priority regions in which to focus its action.  The  Group  has  been  using  this  information  to launch and run programs for many years. In 2020, Kering deepened  its  understanding  of  priority  geographies through  a  partnership  with  Conservation  International, which  cross-referenced  key  data  from  Kering's  supply chain  with  a  geographic  information  system  analysis  to identify  the  Earth's  'biodiversity  hotspots'  -  specifically identifying  locations  that  are  critical  for  biodiversity,  as well as for carbon sequestration. Kering plans to continue this  work  by  investing  in  programs  in  these  areas through the new Kering Regenerative Fund for Nature.\n\nThe  Group  has  been  supporting  nature  conservation, restoration and regeneration programs in some of these 'biodiversity  hotspots'  for  several  years.  Examples include  the  program  for  the  complete  reforestation  of mining sites in the Amazonian forest run in partnership with Solicaz and ReforestFinance, the program for soil regeneration and species protection in the Gobi Desert in  partnership with Wildlife Conservation International, and support for the Karoo Lamb Consortium's efforts to preserve  the  rich  heritage  of  biodiversity  in  the  Karoo region of South Africa.\n\n## Implementation of biodiversity targets\n\nThe objectives set by the new biodiversity strategy are clear and measurable, insofar as they are related to the Group's core business. In line with this strategy, Kering joined  the  new  corporate  engagement  program  of  the Science  Based  Targets  Network  (SBTN)  in  November\n\n2020.  In  a  spirit  of  multi-stakeholder  collaboration toward  globally  shared  goals,  Kering  is  taking  the opportunity  to  actively  participate  in  the  development of methods and guidance between now and 2022. The program  will  provide  the  SBTN  with  strategic  insights into  cutting  edge  science  and  approaches,  as  well  as providing an open forum for sharing best practices and experience  with  other  groups  and  coalitions.  In  turn, this will allow Kering to continue to refine its objectives based on the best available scientific data.\n\n## Implementation of actions guided by the conservation hierarchy\n\nIn 2020, under the aegis of the Science Based Targets Network,  Kering  restructured  its  existing  and  future work on biodiversity protection in order to align it with the SBTN framework. By order of priority, the aim is to (i)  avoid  impacts  wherever  possible,  (ii)  reduce  the effects  of  negative  impacts,  (iii)  restore/regenerate ecosystems  where  possible,  and  (iv)  implement transformative actions that have a net positive impact on biodiversity, as described below:\n\n## 1. Avoid\n\nAs  a  priority,  the  Houses  avoid  sourcing  materials  with known negative impacts on the environment, particularly in areas of critical ecological importance. As specified in the  Kering  Standards,  this  includes  ensuring  that  our supplies are all sourced from materials that do not cause deforestation, as well as ensuring that materials adhere closely to the guidelines as published within the framework of CITES.\n\n## 2. Reduce\n\nAs  a  second  priority,  when  impacts  are  inevitable, Kering  and  its  Houses  strive  to  reduce  negative impacts  on  the  environment  by  sourcing  materials from  preferred  sources  as  defined  in  the  Kering Standards, which list recommended third-party certifications  in  our  supply  chains  that  guarantee low-impact  agricultural  practices,  such  as  organic farming  for  instance.  In  2019,  74%  of  raw  materials were aligned with the Kering Standards. The goal is to reach  100%  by  2025.  In  2020,  the  brands  made significant progress  in  this  area,  increasing  the percentage  of  materials  certified  in  accordance  with the various standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  is  continuing  its  partnership  with the  Wildlife  Friendly  Enterprise  Network  (WFEN)  to develop best practices and to promote the conservation of biodiversity in farming practices applied for producing raw materials. As a continuation of work begun in 2017, WFEN  issued  practical  recommendations  to  Kering  on ensuring  positive  cohabitation  between  endangered local species  and  sheep  farms  in  South  Africa, Australia  and  New  Zealand.  WFEN  recently  extended these recommendations to include Kering's projects in Mongolia  (cashmere)  and  mohair  producers  in  South Africa.\n\n## 3. Restore & Regenerate\n\nAs part of the biodiversity strategy, Kering's aim is no longer  to  simply  avoid  negative  impacts  but  to  bring about a paradigm shift by restoring and regenerating ecosystems.\n\nAccordingly,  in  2020,  the  Group  launched  the  Kering Regenerative Fund for Nature, which aims to convert one million  hectares  of  farms  and  rangelands  producing materials for its supply chain to regenerative agricultural practices  by  2025.  The  fund  has  been  created  in partnership with Conservation International, and focuses on leather, cotton, wool and cashmere.\n\nFurthermore,  to  extend  the  development  of  its sourcing programs relying on farming methods with a positive impact on the environment, Kering joined the Savory  Institute's  Frontier  Founder  initiative  in  2018. The aim of this program is to encourage regenerative grazing  practices  around  the  world.  It  will  further support  Kering's  sustainable  sourcing  approach  by promoting  the  identification  of  farms  that  produce such key raw materials as wool, shearling and leather. In addition, thanks to the Savory Institute's Ecological Outcome Verification  (EOV)  program,  Kering  will  have access  to  data  and  verifications  carried  out  by  the Institute  to  demonstrate  the  positive  impact  of  its sourcing  choices  on  soil,  water  management,  animal welfare  and  biodiversity.  In  2020,  the  collaboration with the Savory Institute focused on establishing and supporting wool and leather supply chains around the world (New Zealand, United Kingdom, Turkey, etc.).\n\n## 4. Transform\n\nIn  support  of  the  net  positive  impact  goal,  Kering continued  to  back  transformation  initiatives  that  are working  to  revolutionize  the  fashion  and  apparel industry, through initiatives outside the Group's direct supply chains.\n\n## 1) Linking carbon footprint and biodiversity\n\n- \u00b7 As part of its biodiversity strategy, Kering is committed to  having  a  net  positive  impact  on  biodiversity  by 2025.  To  that  end,  Kering  will  protect  an  additional one  million  hectares  of  essential  and  irreplaceable habitats outside of its supply chain, through programs that  will  be  beneficial  on  multiple  levels,  in  terms  of biodiversity  protection,  carbon  sequestration  and improved livelihoods for local people.\n- \u00b7 Kering continues to offset its residual Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, Kering took its long-term commitment to sustainability further by offsetting  its  residual  annual  emissions  across  its entire value chain, rounding out the efforts already made to avoid or reduce them. In 2020, the health situation  exceptionally  forced  the  Group  to  review its  offsetting.  It  offset  100%  of  its  Scope  1  and Scope 2 emissions, and a large part of its Scope 3 emissions.\n- \u00b7 Carbon credits have been obtained through support for several REDD+  (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation)  programs, with  VCS  (Verified  Carbon  Standard)  verification.  All projects  supported  by  Kering  are  certified  by  the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA), which recognizes the positive contribution of REDD+ projects  for  the  conservation  of  biodiversity  and ecosystems, but also for the living conditions of local populations. Kering makes multi-year commitments so  that  project  leaders  have  sufficient  visibility  to develop  their  business  models.  For  instance,  the Group  has  supported  the  Kasigau  Corridor  in  Kenya since 2012, In 2019, Kering began supporting Peru's Cordillera  Azul  National  Park,  which  makes  a  big contribution  to  the  fight  against  deforestation  in South America. This commitment was maintained in 2020.  The  Group  is  also  working  on  shifting  its carbon credits towards more innovative projects that are  integrated  into  its  supply  chain.  In  2020,  Kering began  investing  in  Low  Carbon  Label  projects,  in partnership  with  IDELE  ( Institut  de  l'Elevage ),  which support  French  cattle  breeders  in  developing  more carbon-efficient practices.\n\nGucci  offset  its  residual  greenhouse  gas  emissions across its entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) for the second  consecutive  year  through  four  REDD+  projects, supporting the conservation of the world's forests and mangroves, as well as regenerative agriculture projects.",

        "page_content": "## 2) Biodiversity awareness\n\n- \u00b7 To help other fashion companies go deeper into their own work on biodiversity,  Kering  joined  forces  with the University of Cambridge and NGO Biodiversify in February 2020 to publish a primer to raise awareness of this issue among companies in the fashion sector: 'Developing  a  Corporate  Biodiversity  Strategy: A Primer for the Fashion Industry'. Intended as a guide for companies on how to build a biodiversity strategy and  transform  their  relationship  with  nature,  the primer  sets  out  eight  practical  steps  to  assess  a company's impact on nature, guide decisions about how a company interacts with nature and ultimately develop strategic responses to climate and biodiversity  challenges.  As  an  example,  it  provides guidance  around  how  a  company  can  identify  a portfolio of mitigation actions to reduce impacts on and restore biodiversity.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, Kering continued its efforts to increase the visibility of biodiversity in the fashion industry and beyond. To that end, the Group took part in various conferences including United Nations General Assembly events, the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, the China International Import Expo, the 1.618 Paris x  Future  Fabrics  Expo,  Textile  Exchange's  annual Textile Sustainability Conference, the Wool Connect Conference,  the  Shan  Future  Forum  and  many others.  Kering  representatives  also  spoke  about biodiversity  at  events  organized  by  the  Savory Institute,  the  Cambridge  Institute  for  Sustainability Leadership,  Fashion  for  Good,  Common  Objective, the London School of Fashion and Institut Fran\u00e7ais de  la  Mode. These  conferences  offer  Kering  the opportunity  to  share  its  expertise  on  how  the private sector can appropriate and act on biodiversity challenges by adopting responsible and sustainable  supply  chain  management  practices, and  how  to  communicate  on  the  irrefutable contributions of Kering's EP&L measurement methodology in targeting priorities for action on the various links in the supply chain and especially on matters relating to raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Kering continues to invest in the act4nature movement created by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE), which the  Group  joined  when  it  was  launched  in  2018. Sixty-five  companies  joined  forces  on  the  act4nature commitment to protect, enhance and restore biodiversity. The initiative was an opportunity for these companies to  sign  joint  commitments  and  to  present their  individual  commitments  aimed  at  making  the protection  of  biodiversity  a  central  part  of  their business. The coalition, which targets French businesses  with  international  activities,  was  renamed 'act4nature international' in 2020 but is the continuation of the original 2018 act4nature movement.  Kering  updated  these  commitments  in June 2020.\n\n- \u00b7 Kering is also a member company of the One Planet for  Biodiversity  Business  (OP2B)  coalition,  launched in  September  2019  on  the  sidelines  of  the  UN Climate  Action  Summit  in  New  York.  OP2B  brings together 19 companies, largely from the agri-food  sector,  along  with  a  smaller  contingent from the cosmetics sector and the world of fashion, of which Kering is the sole representative. Its aim is to protect and restore biodiversity within the supply chains  of  member  companies  and  their  product portfolios, with actions focused around three pillars: scaling up regenerative agricultural practices, reintroducing cultivated biodiversity in supply chains, and protecting high-value natural ecosystems, notably by eliminating deforestation. Kering continued to play a major role within OP2B in 2020, particularly on topics related to regenerative agriculture.\n- \u00b7 In addition,  in  October  2019,  Kering  and  the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) announced  the  launch  of  a  partnership  -  the  first that IPBES has ever established with a private sector player. This global body of experts, founded with the support of the UN in 2012, is tasked with assessing the state of biodiversity around the world and raising awareness  on  this  issue.  The  support  provided  by Kering  contributes  to  the  work  conducted  by  the IPBES to supplement scientific data and, as such, to foster  more  informed  decisions  concerning  nature. Among  other  things,  this  involves  establishing political  support  and  capacity-building  activities, developing new knowledge, carrying out awareness-raising initiatives and providing assessments performed by scientific experts.  Kering continued this partnership in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Lastly, Kering, as a founding member of the Fashion Pact,  has  undertaken,  alongside  its  Houses,  to reverse the curve of biodiversity loss within ten years through the implementation of objectives based  on  scientific  criteria  in  order  to  restore natural  ecosystems  and  protect  species.  Kering  is also an active member of the Fashion Pact working group on biodiversity.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Houses  are  each  committed  to  their own  conservation  initiatives.  Qeelin,  for  instance,  has undertaken  to  provide  funding  to  the  WWF  Panda Conservation  Project  for  three  years.  Its  funding  goes towards  supporting  field  studies,  bamboo  replanting, human activity monitoring and panda habitat management, measuring the effectiveness of reforestation  actions,  training  teams,  promoting  and fostering  panda-friendly  agro-forestry  products,  and establishing learning platforms to facilitate the transfer of  knowledge  and  the  spread  of  solutions.  In  2019,  in collaboration with TreeDom, DoDo launched the 'A Tree for a Tree' campaign, which aims to create a new forest by supporting agro-forestry projects. This forest, which will  grow  over  time,  is  already  contributing  to  the protection of biodiversity and carbon sequestration; it is managed by cooperatives around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, Kering continued its reforestation program in French Guiana.\n\nIn  2020,  Gucci  joined  The  Lion's  Share,  an  initiative designed to support animal welfare and conservation projects by donating a percentage of its media spend on advertisements featuring animals. More locally, the House  joined  forces  with  ForestaMI  to  safeguard forests in Milan, in the Lombardy region. ForestaMI has undertaken  to  plant  3  million  trees  by  2030.  Gucci planted 4,500 trees as part of the project in 2020. In partnership  with  The  RealReal,  Gucci  launched  an initiative  to  promote  the  circular  economy  in  the luxury  industry.  For  each  item  purchased,  a  tree  was planted thanks to non-profit One Tree Planted.\n\nIn  response  to  Australia's  bush  fire  crisis  in  2020, Balenciaga  launched  a  collection  of  T-shirts  and hoodies featuring an image of the Australian koala. All proceeds  from  sales  went  to  the  Currumbin  Wildlife Hospital.  The  campaign  financed  an  upgrade  of  the hospital's  intensive  care  units,  a  program  to  plant 5,000 eucalyptus trees to provide food for hospitalized koalas, and the construction of new koala enclosures.\n\n## 4.4.2.4 Water management\n\n## Main impacts\n\nWater  security  is  a  major  global  challenge  in  view  of unanimous scientific findings underscoring the urgency and  criticality  of  climate  change  and  biodiversity  loss. The  analysis  carried  out  as  part  of  the  Group's  EP&L methodology  shows  that  water  use  and  pollution  can have  a  wide  range  of  impacts,  and  can  give  rise  to significant risks in respect of the availability and quality of  water  in  various  parts  of  the  world.  For  instance, water pollution can disrupt aquatic ecosystems through eutrophication,  and  mismanagement of water use can create life-threatening competition for local communities  (competition  between  the  production  of raw  materials  and  food,  for  example).  This  can  have adverse  human  health  impacts,  and  can  also  result  in reduced agricultural yields and other serious disruptions of ecosystem services.\n\nThe  Group's  EP&L  methodology  allows  it  to  track  and quantify its annual impact on natural capital, particularly with regard to water use and pollution. The Group's 2019 EP&L  results  show  that  19%  of  Kering's  environmental impacts relate to water use and pollution, and that they are  mostly  in  Tier  4  (production  of  raw  materials)  of  its supply chains.\n\nAs  such,  and  given  that  the  direct  environmental impact  of  the  Group's  water  consumption  is  not significant,  Kering's  water  management  strategy  is geared chiefly towards water supply chains outside its own  operations.  Initiatives  are  prioritized  using  the EP&L approach, which identifies the channels generating the greatest impacts.\n\nThis  strategy  is  made  public  and  described  in  the Group's  responses  to  the  2020  CDP  Water  Security Questionnaire, available at www.cdp.net. It sets out the Group's governance with respect to its water management, risk management, objectives and performance.\n\n## Commitment and initiatives\n\nAs shown by the results of the Group's 2019 EP&L, the main  impacts  from  water  use  and  pollution  are generated  above  all  in  Tier  4  for  the  production  of leather, metals, plant fibers and precious skins.\n\nAs Kering does not have direct control over Tier 4, the main levers used by the Group to act on these impacts are  the  circulation  of  requirements  throughout  its supply chains through the Kering Standards, the MRSL and  the  PRSLs,  and  the  development  of  specific cross-cutting  programs  with  producers  and  industry players, such as Clean By Design, and the various raw materials industries.\n\nThese  programs  are  described  for  each  material  in section 4.4.3 under 'Leather', 'Metals, stones and other precious  materials',  'Plant  textile  fibers'  and  'Precious skins  and  furs'.  Of  particular  note  are  the  metal-free tanning  program  for  leather  goods,  the  Scrap-less project  initiated  by  Gucci,  the  establishment  of  the Kering  Ethical  Gold  Platform,  a  responsible  gold sourcing platform that favors extraction methods built on  sound  chemicals  management  techniques,  and certification  requirements  for  organic  cotton  such  as GOTS and OCS in the Kering Standards for plant fibers.\n\nLastly,  Kering  has  committed  alongside  its  Houses  to eliminating  single-use  plastics  from  its  B2B  and  B2C packaging  by  2030.  Its  goal  is  to  develop  practical initiatives  to  protect  the  oceans  by  reducing  the negative impact of the fashion sector.",

        "page_content": "## 4.4.3 Sustainable use of raw materials\n\nThe Group's EP&L clearly shows that most environmental  impacts  (76%)  are  caused  upstream  of its supply chains by the production of raw materials and their  initial  transformation  (Tiers  3  and  4).  For  Kering, critical impacts are generated by the raw materials used in  large  quantities  and  whose  production  can  have  a significant impact on the environment, such as leather, or by raw materials used in small quantities but whose extraction or production can have a heavy impact. This is the case for animal fibers such as wool and cashmere, as  well  as  metals  and  precious  stones  (gold  and diamonds).\n\nKering  has  committed  to  reducing  its  environmental footprint in the pre-operations phase, starting with the production of its raw materials. To this end, the Smart Sourcing program, launched in 2013, provides recommendations  and  guidance  for  the  Houses, allowing them  to  use  raw  materials  produced sustainably and responsibly. This project draws on the Kering Standards and involves the Materials Innovation Lab  (MIL)  and  supply  chain  management,  R&D  and Sustainability  teams  working  closely  with  the  Group and its Houses to come up with responsible sourcing solutions tailored to the specific needs of each House.\n\n## 4.4.3.1 Circular economy\n\n## The Kering approach\n\nThe  transition  to  a  circular  economy,  which  means rejecting  the  linear  'take  -  make  -  consume  -  throw away'  model,  involves  more  than  the  simple  use  of recycled materials, or the design of recyclable products:  it  requires  real  change  in  practices  at  each stage  of  the  production  cycle.  As  such,  Kering participated in the construction of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's  vision  for  circular  fashion,  published  in October  2020  to  unite  the  sector  around  a  common frame of reference and definitions. The vision is based on  three  pillars:  'used  more',  'made  to  be  made again', and 'made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs', on which Kering and its Houses are rolling out their circular economy approach.\n\n## 1. 'Used More'\n\nThe first pillar of circular fashion is to create products that  last  and  retain  their  value  over  time,  and  to produce the right number of products so as to avoid unsold products.\n\nThe Kering group's luxury products combine strategic know-how with excellent craftsmanship in processing, cutting and assembly. They are designed and created from  unique  materials,  and  are  subject  to  rigorous quality controls to ensure their longevity and\n\ndurability.  Some  of  the  Group's  Houses  offer  their clients repair services to maintain the quality of their products  and  ensure  their  longevity.  For  example, Brioni offers its clients a reconditioning service, which it promotes via its e-commerce site. For some brands, Kering has set up multi-brand repair centers, making it possible  to  offer  repair  services  in  different  parts  of the  world  and  thereby  avoiding  the  need  to  return products  to  the  production  center,  often  located  in Italy. In addition, the ready-to-wear and leather goods brands offer a legal warranty as well as a repair service in the event of defects (a refund or credit note may be offered in some countries).\n\nExtending  the  useful  life  of  products  also  means looking  for  new  business  models  that  preserve  the value  of  the  product  and  keep  it  in  the  economy.  As such, the sale of second-hand products is growing in importance  and  is  a  strategic  focus  for  the  Group. Particularly noteworthy is the partnership established by  Gucci  in  2020  with  circular  fashion  consignment platform  specialist  The  RealReal  for  sales  of  its second-hand  items.  A  dedicated  section  presents  a selection  of  clothing  and  accessories  provided  by consignors  and  by  Gucci:  for  each  item  purchased  or sold,  a  tree  will  be  planted  as  part  of  the  One  Tree Planted reforestation initiative.\n\nTo limit the quantity of unsold products at the end of each  season,  the  Group  is  investing  in  artificial intelligence  technologies  to  improve  sales  forecasts and  therefore  optimize  production  and  distribution. The  machine  learning  models  put  in  place  allow  for better anticipation of demand seasonality and current trends,  thereby  reducing  possible  prediction  errors. Particular attention is paid to items likely to generate excess  stocks,  in  keeping  with  the  Group's  circular economy approach.\n\nProducts  that  are  not  sold  in  stores,  particularly  for quality  returns,  are  then  offered  for  sale  through channels dedicated to past collections, such as outlets or friends & family sales for employees and their families, or are donated. If products still remain unsold, pilot projects are  implemented  to  develop  upcycling  or  recycling  of those items, together with any damaged products. As the destruction  of  products  or  unsold  items  is  prohibited throughout  the  Group,  Kering  is  actively  working  to develop  operational  recycling  and  upcycling  solutions. Balenciaga and Saint Laurent - for shoes - and Alexander McQueen have developed pilot projects with Revalorem, which  offers  solutions  for  reusing,  repurposing  and recycling  unsold  items  for  the  luxury  industry.  Saint Laurent  also  recycles  some  of  its  damaged  handbags through a project with Vestisolidale, a social cooperative specializing  in  recycling.  To  encourage  these  initiatives, the House has also launched a training module on ecodesign and upcycling in partnership with the Accademia Costume  &  Moda in  Italy,  offering  a  second  life  to damaged products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

'Made to be made again'\n\nThe  second  pillar  of  circular  fashion  focuses  on efficiently  reusing,  upcycling  or  recycling  materials, products  and  packaging  while  working  to  strengthen the associated production channels, in close collaboration with public and private stakeholders.\n\nTo  support  and  accelerate  the  development  of industrial  recycling  infrastructure,  Kering  has  joined Fashion for Good's 'Full Circle Textiles Project: Scaling Innovations  in  Cellulosic  Recycling'  initiative,  which aims  to  test  and  eventually  scale  up  promising chemical recycling technologies.\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  have  also  launched  numerous initiatives  and  entered  into  multiple  partnerships  to collect  waste  and  scraps  from  production  processes and fashion shows with a view to recycling or reusing them, or to donate materials and raw materials such as fabrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Since  2015,  Kering's  Ready-to-Wear  Division  based in  Novara,  Italy,  has  made  agreed  donations  to fashion  schools  and  academies.  In  2020,  35,000 meters  of  fabric  were  shared  among  several European schools and recycling channels. Alexander McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Saint Laurent  also  made  several  donations  to  NGOs  and fashion  schools  during  the  year,  and  organized private sales for employees to give a second life to stocks  of  fabrics  from  previous  collections,  visual merchandising  tools  and  benches  used  during fashion  shows.  Brioni  regularly  donates  unused fabrics  to  international  fashion  schools  (including the  London  College  of  Fashion  and  Central  Saint Martins) and students at the Scuola di Alta Sartoria to recycle offcuts from previous collections.\n- \u00b7 Three  years  ago,  Kering  set  up  a  Group-level partnership with La R\u00e9serve des Arts , an association that supports the cultural and creative sector in the development of the circular and solidarity economy. It  collects  and  reuses  materials  from  companies and cultural institutions in the Greater Paris region and,  since  September  2020,  in  Marseille,  and  to make them available to its  members,  all  of  whom are professionals in the cultural and creative fields. In  2020, La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts partnered  with  Saint Laurent to collect and reuse materials from fashion shows  and  window  displays,  as  well  as  visual merchandising  materials.  Eco-design  consulting\n\nprojects  have  been  conducted  with  the  Houses: Saint  Laurent,  on  introducing  reusable  materials when putting on a fashion show, and Balenciaga on dismantling.  While  supporting  the  cultural  and creative sector, the association extends the lifespan of  the  materials  through  their  reuse  and  helps reduce waste from the sector.\n\n- \u00b7 With support from the MIL, Gucci has established an ambitious  collection  and  recycling  program  for ECONYL \u00ae offcuts.  Known  as  the  'ECONYL \u00ae -Gucci pre-consumer fabric take back program', it aims to maximize the benefits of this innovative material in Gucci's  ready-to-wear  collections.  ECONYL \u00ae is  itself a recycled fiber made from plastic waste, much of it recovered from the oceans, and produced in a fully traceable  supply  chain  in  Italy.  The  program  relies on  the  cooperation  of  Gucci's  suppliers  to  collect ECONYL \u00ae production offcuts and re-inject them into the  ECONYL \u00ae regeneration  process  in  order  to re-create  a  high-quality  yarn,  which  is  in  turn reused  in  the  production  of  Gucci  ready-to-wear collections.\n- \u00b7 Gucci-Up  is  a  circular  economy  initiative  aimed  at promoting  the  upcycling  of  leather  and  textile scraps  generated  during  the  production  process, developed  in  collaboration  with  social  NGOs  and cooperatives.  The  project  began  in  2018  with  the delivery of the first batch of leather offcuts, and saw 25 metric tons processed between 2018 and 2020. Within this initiative, Gucci has also set up a textile scrap recycling program with Green Line, a company based  in  Recanati,  Italy,  that  specializes  in  the collection  and  recycling  of  fabric  scraps,  the marketing of textile raw materials, and the storage of  fabrics  and  yarn  for  industry,  in  a  program  to recycle  fabric  offcuts.  Since  2015,  several  hundred metric tons of offcuts have been recycled under this project, in which Brioni now also participates. Saint Laurent  has  also  set  up  a  collection  system  for non-reusable  leather  offcuts  with  its  suppliers, mainly  in  its  activities  in  Tuscany.  The  offcuts  are recycled  by  an  exclusive  partner  using  technology that  guarantees  full  traceability.  In  2013,  Bottega Veneta  installed  a  leather  offcut  management system on its sites (Montebello workshop, Altavilla warehouse and Manifattura Veneta Pelletterie industrial  site),  the  aim  being  to  reuse  them  as fertilizer  while  ensuring  the  processing  of  chrome residues.  The  project  is  being  carried  out  in cooperation  with  ILSA  and  Waste  Recycling,  two companies  specializing  in  the  collection and treatment of production offcuts. In 2020, 170.2  metric  tons  (91%)  of  leather  offcuts  were collected and processed.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In  the  same way, Balenciaga's internal cutting center, located in Scandicci, Italy, and two of its manufacturers  are  involved  in  a  project  to  recycle scrap white and black leather from production, which is  then  passed  to  German-based  company Ledertech for recycling. Since the start of the project, nearly four metric tons of leather scraps have been recovered and recycled. The circular economy is central to Balenciaga's  processes.  The  House  is  introducing  an increasing number of recycled synthetic fibers, such as ECONYL \u00ae ,  into  its  collections.  The  impact of this work on  recycled  fibers  can  be  seen  in  all  product categories,  and  especially  key  lines  such  as  sneakers: in  2020,  Balenciaga  released  its  first  92%  recycled sneaker.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent continued work during the year on a comprehensive  recycling  program  at  its  industrial sites,  headquarters,  stores  and  showrooms.  The House  also  maintained  its  numerous  partnerships with  social  impact  companies,  such  as  Emma\u00fcs offshoot Le Relais for all used fabrics and uniforms, and Atelier du Bocage for used electronic equipment and ink cartridges, as well as Tissons La Solidarit\u00e9 , a solidarity network that sorts second-hand clothing, and  then  sews  and  resells  recycled  garments.  The House equips its sites -particularly its headquarters  -  using  recycled  materials,  such  as insulation  panels  made  using  fabrics  from  old collections.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga  also  continued  its  partnership  with Le Relais in France to collect and recycle fabrics that cannot  be  reused  in  their  original  form,  which  has already  recovered  more  than  eight  metric  tons  of textiles.  After  being  shredded,  these  fabrics  are transformed  into ecological building insulation known  as M\u00e9tisse . Le  Relais  is  a  member  of  the Emma\u00fcs network and works to promote reintegration through the employment of vulnerable people.\n- \u00b7 Alexander  McQueen  also  uses  circular  economy principles in its approach, by systematically sorting waste  fabrics  in  its  creative  studios.  It  has  also brought  its  stores  onboard:  78%  of  them  sort recyclable  materials.  The  brand  also  carried  out  a lifecycle  analysis  of  its  signature  sneaker  line  in order  to  assess  the  shoe's  full  impact  from  the production  of  raw  materials  to  the  end  of  the product's  life,  applying  three  potential  end-of-life scenarios, including resale and recycling.\n\nLastly, packaging is reduced to a minimum and made from certified and recyclable materials, in keeping with Kering's Fashion  Pact  commitment  to  eliminate unnecessary plastic in B2C packaging by 2025 and in B2B  packaging  by  2030,  and  to  ensure  that  at  least 50%  of  all  plastic  packaging  used  in  B2C  and  B2B packaging  is  fully  recycled  by  2025  and  2030,\n\nrespectively.  In  2020,  teams  from  Kering's  Operations Department  continued  their  efforts  to  reduce  plastic packaging  for  ready-to-wear  clothing,  including  via  a collective  waste  management  and  polybag  circularity project,  and  worked  on  e-commerce  by  removing unnecessary plastic packaging from shipments, notably with the systematic use of FSC-certified paper filling instead of plastic.\n\n## 3. 'Made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs'\n\nThe  third  pillar  of  the  vision  for  circular  fashion focuses on the sound management of chemicals, the maximum use of recycled or renewable materials, and recycling at every stage of production.\n\nAs regards the management of chemicals, the Group's products  are  designed  in  accordance  with  the  Kering Manufacturing  Substance  Restricted  List  (MRSL)  and the  Product  Restricted  Substance  List  (PRSL)  in  order to  prevent  the  use  of  hazardous  chemicals  in  the manufacturing  process,  ensure  that  workers  are  not exposed  to  hazardous  substances,  and  reduce  toxic discharges  into  water.  See  the  section  entitled 'Chemicals management'.\n\nAs regards materials used, the Kering Standards allow the Group's Houses to identify sourcing preferences recycled,  bio-sourced  or  certified  -  by  material.  In addition, the MIL provides House design teams with a pool  of  sustainable  and  innovative  materials  and assists  them  in  the  selection  of  circular  materials. However, brands sometimes face technological challenges,  largely  due  to  the  physical  properties  of recycled  materials,  which  can  be  less  efficient  than virgin  materials.  For  example,  recycled  cotton  fibers are shorter and therefore more likely to fray, creating a conflict between product durability and integration of recycled material.\n\nKering began work on measuring the circularity of its materials  at  the  end  of  2019,  drawing  on  the methodology  developed  by  the  Ellen  MacArthur Foundation  and  applying  it  to  the  Group's  raw materials. The  Kering  Materials  Circularity Index estimates that 40% of the materials used by the Group and  with  potential  for  circularity  are  already  circular, compared  with  39%  the  previous  year.  The  detailed methodology used in preparing the index is available in  the  environmental  methodological  note  available on  the  Group's  website.  The  index  measures  Kering's commitment  to  the  supply  of renewable and recyclable  materials.  Moreover,  when  virgin  materials are required to ensure product quality, Kering devises projects  to  promote  a  supply  of  materials  obtained through  regenerative  production  practices  that  have no  environmental  impact  and  guarantee  the  renewal of resources.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nine  Houses,  together  with  numerous suppliers and circular economy and chemicals experts, have joined forces to roll out this certification (such as Cradle to Cradle) through pilots initially covering seven materials and processes. 2020 saw the release of the first Circular Materials Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 the Global Fashion  Agenda:  in  2020,  Kering remained  a  strategic  partner  of  this  organization dedicated to promoting sustainability in the world of fashion. A veritable accelerator of good practices, this  platform  issued  a  call  to  speed  up  the transition to a circular economy in May 2017, and in 2018 published operational guidelines for achieving  circular  fashion.  In  2020,  the  Global Fashion  Agenda  coordinated  the  brands'  work  in favor  of  new  European  laws  for  more  circular fashion;\n- \u00b7 the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation:  in  2017,  Kering contributed  to  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation's Circular Fibres Initiative, whose major report, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion's Future ,  was published  in  November  2017.  In  2020,  Kering continued to participate by lending its expertise and resources  to  promote  and  co-construct  a  new vision  of  the  textile  industry: Vision  for  a  Circular Economy for Fashion .\n\n## 4.4.3.2 Leather\n\nLeather  is  one  of  the  key  raw  materials  used  by Kering's Houses. Cattle and sheep farming and leather processing  operations  (including  tanning)  together represent  one  of  the  most  significant  environmental impacts across the Group's supply chains (39% of the total impact - 2019 EP&L Report). A dedicated Idea Lab on leather, involving most of Kering's Houses, has met regularly over the last five years.\n\nThe concept of responsible leather, as defined in the Kering  Standards,  combines  traceability,  i.e.,  leather that can be traced back to all stages from slaughterhouse  and  farm,  sourcing  from  farms  that\n\nminimize  their  environmental  impact  and  respect animal welfare, and  tanning  using  chrome-free processes.  In  2019,  a  requirement  for  farms  to  allow soil regeneration was added to the Standards. In terms of  traceability,  in  2020  Kering  expanded  its  work  on the  investigation  and  traceability  of  hides,  most  of which come from Europe, by creating an in-depth map of  its  supply  chain,  making  it  possible  to  identify 274 slaughterhouses in some 30 countries worldwide. Purchases  in  2019  showed  that  96%  of  skins  are traceable  back  to  the  slaughterhouse  (96%  for  cattle skins,  and  95%  for  sheep  skins),  and  several  Houses have already begun to go further back in their supply chains. Kering's aim is for all skins to be traceable back to the farm by 2025. Kering and its Houses are testing and developing several technologies to trace leather at each stage of production, in particular to avoid losing the  trace  at  the  slaughterhouse,  which  is  the  most sensitive  link  in  the  chain.  An  internal  working  group was created in 2020 to discuss the various technologies and promote best practices.\n\nIn  terms  of  animal  welfare,  Kering  published  its Standards for all animal species present in its supply chains in May 2019, also releasing standards specifically  targeting  calves,  cattle,  sheep  and  goats, which account for a particularly sizable proportion of the leather supply chain. The Standards were published  alongside  specific  practical  guidelines  for slaughterhouses  (see  the  section  entitled  'Animal welfare:  the  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards').  In 2020,  Kering  also  completed  its  map  of  meat  labels that meet its Standards in terms of animal welfare and environmental protection, both at the farm and in the slaughterhouse.  The  chosen  approach  draws  on existing  standards  in  the  food  industry  and  creates links between the leather and meat supply chains. To date, 24 standards corresponding to the requirements set out in the Kering Standards have been identified in 32 countries around the world.\n\nIn 2020, Kering implemented an internal procedure for monitoring animal welfare in its leather supply chain to  ensure  that  practices  established  by  suppliers  are aligned with the requirements described in the Kering Standards. Depending in particular on the risk profile of the  various  sourcing  countries,  the  level  of transparency of the supply chain and the independent standards in place within it, a series of verification and risk  management  actions  have  been  defined.  The initial  plan  was  to  carry  out  physical  audits  to  verify compliance with  the  Kering  Standards,  particularly  in slaughterhouses,  but,  in  2020,  due  to  the  COVID-19 health  crisis,  these  audits  had  to  be  replaced  by self-assessments and documentary reviews of processes in place.",

        "page_content": "At the same time, an internal working group dedicated to responsible leather was created with representatives from all the Group's leather-using Houses to join forces and  make  progress  in  this  area.  In  2020,  the  working group launched a specific study to analyze the risks and opportunities  in  Kering's  supply  chains  for  goatskin, which often comes from countries where risks tend to be  greater  than  in  countries  supplying  cowhide  or sheepskin, and which therefore require special attention.  With  assistance  from  a  consulting  firm specializing  in  the  issue,  the  study  aims  to  identify practical  action  plans  and  to  draw  up  a  roadmap towards full alignment with the Kering Standards.\n\nKering also stepped up its collaborations with players in the food industry - and especially the meat industry - in 2020. As supply chains are shared, this will make for faster verification procedures and, where necessary, improved practices. Kering is jointly steering a working group on animal welfare alongside the National Leather Council, as part of the collective Paris Good Fashion initiative. Leather and collaboration  with  the  food  industry  are  central aspects of the issue, and the working group therefore includes representatives from the meat sector.\n\nAs  well  as  working  on  its  own  supply  chains,  Kering aims  to  encourage  and  promote  the  emergence  of more responsible practices in the industry, particularly through  the  development  of  certification  for  leather. Kering is a member of Textile Exchange, and sits on its Board of Directors. This organization is committed to promoting the production and use of more sustainable  textiles  throughout  the  clothing  industry. It  is  also  particularly  active  in  several  working  groups including  the  Responsible  Leather  Roundtable.  Since 2017,  Kering  has  been  involved  in  developing  a benchmark for  certifications  in  leather  supply  chains and  implementing  a  mechanism  for  rewarding  the most virtuous players in terms of animal welfare and respect for the environment.\n\nMetal-free tanning techniques are also a major focus of  Kering's  work on leather. For four years, the Group has  worked  closely  with  its  tanneries,  as  well  as  its Houses  and  their  suppliers,  to  promote  the  use  of leather  tanned  without  metals.  In  2020,  Kering advanced on the following  pillars,  continuing  actions taken in 2019:\n\n- 1. Development  of  chrome-  and  metal-free  tanning in  all  of  the  Group's  tanneries:  this  work  entailed R&D activities in tanneries, with the aim of testing articles made from leather tanned without metals and then putting them into production.\n\n- 2. Sector commitment: with a view to speeding up the transition  to  metal-free  tanning,  and  continuing the  work  of  the  Metal-Free  Technical  Roundtable held in 2018, Kering organized a Metal-Free Meeting in  Milan  in  2019.  The  first  meeting  of  its  kind,  it brought together 76 of the Group's key tanneries to present over 1,600 metal- or chrome-free products to more than 130 representatives from Kering and its  brands  (style,  operations,  merchandising  and sustainability  teams).  The  range  of  metal-free leather products produced by tanneries has increased substantially thanks to noteworthy advances in R&D and improvements in the quality of  this  new  technology.  The  event  contributed  to the increase in the proportion of metal-free leather used  within  the  Group.  In  2020,  while  the  health crisis  made  it  impossible  to  hold  a  new  edition  of the  Metal-Free  Meeting,  Kering  and  its  brands remained  focused  on  developing  new  metal-free tanned  items,  working  closely  with  tanneries  to gradually  increase  the  metal-free  quotas  in  their products. Significant progress has been made, and some  tanneries  have  started  to  convert  their facilities to fully metal-free production. In addition, private exhibitions organized by tanneries to show their  products  to  the  brands  included  metal-free sections showcasing new developments in metal-free products.\n- 3. Increase in the proportion of metal-free tanning in the collections of the Houses: in 2020, 29% of the Group's  leather  goods  purchases  were  metal  or chrome-free.\n\nThese  efforts  on  traceability,  the  optimization  of materials  and  animal  welfare  in  the  leather  industry have paid off for the Houses:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  traces  each  batch  of  leather  back  to  the slaughterhouse  and/or  farm,  and  ensures  that  the country  of  supply  complies  with  the  requirements laid down in the Kering Standards. In 2019, supplier data  show  that  99%  of  leather  was  traced  back  to the  slaughterhouse.  In  2019,  Gucci  improved  its data  collection  processes  and  continued  to  carry out traceability audits at tanneries.\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen launched a pilot project with its suppliers  and  tanneries  to  trace  the  supply  of leather  used  in  its  leather  goods  and  shoes,  in partnership with Oritain.\n- \u00b7 Bottega Veneta has also adopted a robust approach to traceability. Since the Cruise 2014/2015 collection,  the  House  has  been  committed  to tracing the leather of some of its Cabat Full Nappa styles,  in  line  with  Institute  of  Quality  Certification for  the  Leather  Sector  (ICEC)  regulation  TS-PM414 as  part  of  the  certification  process  for  finished leather products. This certification has been renewed  annually  since  September  2014,  with coverage progressively increasing from two styles of the iconic Cabat ( Cabat Nappa New Sauge and Cabat Stripes in  the  Cruise 2014/2015  collection)  to  all Cabat Nappa styles. The renewal of the certification in  2017  covers  the  new Cabat  Nappa  Expresso and\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  collaboration  with  the  ICEC,  Bottega Veneta encourages certification procedures with its key tanneries. Bottega Veneta also accompanied the luxury tannery in its TS412 certification process for tanning lambskin from Spain, obtained in September 2018 and renewed in October 2019. To date, 100% of Bottega Veneta's leather is traceable to the country of origin, and 80% of the leather used by  the  House  comes  from  countries  aligned  with the Kering Standards.\n\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  has  developed  a  set  of  specific  Key Performance  Indicators  (KPIs)  for  its  supplier evaluation system in its leather tanneries. Drawing on  the  extensive  collection  of  data  across  all product categories, levels of traceability, percentages of Kering Standards-compliant leather purchases  and  tannery  EP&L  performances  were calculated  and  monitored  on  a  monthly  basis throughout  2019  and  2020.  The  results  feed  into the supplier evaluation process. The House has also launched a project in partnership with a specialized consulting firm, aiming to trace and link its leather supply chain from South Africa to farms benefiting from  certification  for  their  meat,  guaranteeing environmental and animal welfare practices in line with the Kering Standards. In addition, slaughterhouse inspections were also carried out to assess  practices  in  light  of  Kering's  requirements. Starting on a small scale in 2019, this project, which uses  laser  technology  to  ensure  the  traceability  of lambskins  from  farm  to  finished  product,  is  to  be extended to other farms and slaughterhouses in the region.  In  2020,  a  laser  marking  station  was installed  at  slaughterhouses  to  mark  the  skins, which  can  be  read  by  machines  and  humans throughout  the  supply  chain.  This  project  will  be extended to an increasing number of slaughterhouses in 2021.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  circular  approach,  seeking efficiency  is  central  to  the  Houses'  approach,  as illustrated  by  the  following  initiatives  (other  initiatives are also described in section 4.4.3.1 'Circular economy'):\n\n- \u00b7 The  Scrap-less  project  initiated  by  Gucci  involves cutting  off  parts  of  hides  or  skins  that  cannot  be used in finished products due to their size or quality before tanning actually takes place. The outcome is a  greatly  reduced  environmental  impact,  achieved by reducing the surface needing to be tanned (50% reduction  in  scrap  leather),  which  in  turn  means reduced  use  of  water  (18%),  chemicals  (16%)  and\n\nenergy, and a lower impact from transportation. In 2020, the Scrap-less project covered 22% of Gucci's total  production,  up  from  10%  in  2019.  Examples include Ace sneakers,  the Gucci  Signature belt  and the  (medium) Rajah bag.  In  the  same  quest  for efficiency, Gucci is continuing its Gucci-Up initiative, an upcycling approach to scrap leather and fabrics resulting from production (25 metric tons between 2018 and 2020). Bottega Veneta has also established a leather scrap management system at its sites, as described in section 4.4.3.1.\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci has developed a best practice guide known as the 'Suppliers' Good Practices Guide for Sustainable  Leather'  and  describing  large-scale processes  that  can  be  adopted  in  tanneries  to remove  dangerous  heavy  metals  from  the  tanning process, to reduce or reuse production and tanning scraps and by-products, to cut water consumption and  pollution,  and  to  reduce  energy  consumption and emissions.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga's  internal  cutting  center  and  two  of  its manufacturers  are  involved  in  a  project  to  recycle leather scraps from production with recycling partner Ledertech. A pilot test has also been launched on the recycling  of  leather  scraps  with  Authentic  Materials for reuse as lining, etc.\n\nFor  metal-free  leather,  the  Houses  are  stepping  up initiatives in line with the Kering Standards:\n\n- \u00b7 At  Alexander  McQueen,  approximately  10%  of  the leather  goods  items  and  shoes  sold  were  made  of metalor chrome-free leather, and the House encourages  its  design,  merchandising  and  R&D  teams to  increase  the  proportion  of  metal-free  leather  in  its collections.  This  proportion  reached  30%  at  Saint Laurent in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Metal-free tanning, initiated in 2013, also continues to  progress  at  Gucci  and  Bottega  Veneta.  Examples include  the Dionysus and Gucci  1955  Horsebit bags (tote  bag  and  minibag)  as  well  as  the Princetown leather  mules  and Jordan moccasins  in  Gucci's current  collections,  all  of  which  are  metal-free.  The share  of  metal-free  tanning  represented  30%  in 2019.\n\nLastly,  the  Group's  strategy  on  the  management  of leather  sourcing  in  relation  to  deforestation  is  made public and described in Kering's responses to the 2020 CDP Forest Questionnaire, available at www.cdp.net. It sets  out  the  Group's  governance  with  respect  to leather,  risk  management  and  the  Group's  objectives and performance.",

        "page_content": "## 4.4.3.3 Plant textile fibers\n\nClose  attention  is  paid  to  cotton.  More  specifically, organic cotton has the major advantage of not being cultivated  using  pesticides  and  fertilizers,  meaning  a greatly  reduced  environmental  footprint  (up  to  80% reduction compared with conventional cotton). Kering therefore encourages its Houses to step up the use of organic cotton in their collections. It does this in two ways:  through  the  Kering  Standards  and  through  its new Group-wide purchasing platform.\n\nKering  takes  a  multi-level  approach  to  responsible cotton:\n\n## 1. Define and maintain high standards of supply\n\nThe  standards  laid  down  by  Kering  on  cotton  specify full  traceability  (to  avoid  sourcing  from  high-risk countries, as regards environmental and social impacts)  and  prohibit  the  use  of  chemicals  and pesticides.  To  ensure  that  these  standards  are  met, Kering  encourages  the  use  of  organic  cotton,  with  a preference for  Global  Organic  Textile  Standard  (GOTS) or Organic Content Standard (OCS) certification. Kering is  committed  to  ensuring  that  100%  of  the  key materials  used  by  the  Group  are  consistent  with  the Kering Standards by 2025, which means that all cotton used will be of organic origin by this date.\n\n## 2. Help the Houses increase the share of organic cotton in their purchases\n\nTo  support  work  on  reaching  this  ambitious  target, Kering  launched  its  Organic  Cotton  Platform  (OCP)  in 2016,  offering  the  Houses  technical  and  financial support to help them overcome the initial difficulties in switching  sourcing  to  organic  cotton.  The  OCP  has contributed  to  a  significant  increase  in  the  proportion of organic cotton used in the collections of the Group's Houses,  which  more  than  tripled  between  2016  and 2017.  As  the  Houses  had  reached  a  sufficient  level  of maturity and autonomy in sourcing their organic cotton supply  in  2018,  the  initiative  was  deemed  no  longer necessary and the decision was made not to renew it. In 2020, the Houses' maturity was demonstrated by their ongoing efforts to use organic cotton, as shown below by  the  growing  share  of  organic  cotton  in  their collections.\n\nSince  2013,  the  experts  at  the  MIL  (see  section  5.3) have been working closely with the individual Houses, Kering's  Sustainability  Department  and  their  strategic suppliers in order to integrate new, more sustainable textiles into the supply chains.\n\n## 3. Collaborate with other players in the sector to promote organic cotton and attract investors\n\nAs co-founder of the Organic Cotton Accelerator (OCA) alongside  Textile  Exchange  and  other  brands,  Kering continued its support for the development of organic cotton  farming  and  the  market  for  organic  cotton. Companies joining the OCA undertake to comply with a number  of  guiding  principles,  such  as  promoting organic  cotton  and  improving  the  environmental, social and economic aspects of production.\n\nKering  is  also  a  participant  in  and  member  of  the Organizing  Committee  for  the  Textile  Exchange's Organic  Cotton  Roundtable  (OCRT).  The  OCRT  is  a global  stakeholder  platform  that  supports  and  brings together the organic cotton community to be inspired, mobilized, and equipped to act. It has ongoing working groups  on  business  models,  seeds  and  soils,  and consumer engagement, as well as an innovation award that  seeks  out  and  celebrates  new  ideas  in  organic cotton.  Each  year,  the  OCTR  holds  a  global  in-person meeting, of which Kering is a sponsor. More recently, it has  also  started  holding  two  regional  meetings  and four virtual meetings annually.\n\nTrue to its goal of sharing, and keen to promote more sustainable practices within the industry, Kering joined forces  with  Textile  Exchange  in  2017  to  publish two detailed reports on the organic cotton market. The two  publications  also  provide  a  set  of  tools,  tips  and best  practices  for  companies  wishing  to  incorporate organic  cotton  into  their  supply  chain.  Encouraged  by the positive feedback received from the sector regarding these reports, Kering continued its partnership with the Textile Exchange in 2020 by jointly organizing  a  key  industry  event  to  discuss  how  to increase the global supply of organic cotton, notably by soliciting expert feedback on the challenges of transitioning from conventional to organic production.\n\n## 4. Support projects in the field\n\nIn  2019,  Kering  ended  its  partnership  with  Cotton Connect  on  a  pilot  project  to  secure  traceable  and reliable  organic  cotton  for  its  brands.  In  light  of  the pilot's  success,  responsibility  for  coordinating  the partnership  has  been  transferred  to  a  brand.  Cotton Connect  allows  the  Group  to  work  directly  with 150  organic  cotton  farmers  in  India  to  improve  the yield and quality of their cotton through training and advice on  farming  practices.  The  program  also includes a social module  involving community education  in  the  fight  against  child  labor,  the empowerment of women, the right to education, and health  and  safety  issues.  Initiated  in  2017  and renewed in 2018, a Farmer Business School (FBS) has been established to help farmers manage their farms by training them in basic accounting and raising their awareness about risk factors (especially weather).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Innovate for greater traceability of cotton\n\nKering's  MIL  has  worked  since  2018  to  obtain  the  first fully  traceable  organic  cotton  fabric  using  forensic science  methods.  The  project  was  carried  out  with two long-standing Kering partners, Italian weaver Albini and  Supima,  a  US-based  organization  advocating high-quality  cotton,  as  well  as  with  traceability  expert Oritain. The technology used fingerprints organic cotton, thereby  allowing  it  to  be  tracked  at  all  stages  of production. It draws on scientific and statistical studies that  have  analyzed  the  natural  chemical  properties  of cotton  fiber  to  create  a  unique  chemical  marker identifying  the  field  where  the  cotton  was  grown.  An exact match with the marker guarantees the authenticity  of  the  organic  cotton,  and  ensures  that neither  the  raw  material  nor  the  fabric  or  finished product has been substituted, mixed or modified at any stage.  The  procedure  is  a  guarantee  of  traceability throughout  the  supply  chain.  Tracked  cotton  was  put into production in 2018 in the ready-to-wear collections of several of Kering's Houses. In 2019 and 2020, the MIL continued  its  work  with  Oritain  for  the  large-scale roll-out  of  a  program  to  verify  the  origins  of  cotton provided  by  suppliers  to  Kering  brands.  This  program allows  the  Houses  to  verify  their  suppliers'  claims  and thereby ensure compliance with the rules restricting the origin of cotton  in accordance  with  the  Kering Standards. Alexander McQueen and MCQ took part in the cotton  traceability  pilot  launched  by  the  MIL  to  verify the traceability of cotton declared by suppliers.\n\nIn  total,  organic  cotton  now  accounts  for  51%  of cotton  used  across  the  Group.  The  Houses  have focused on their main product categories: ready-to-wear  for  Bottega  Veneta;  the  GOTS-certified capsule  collection  for  Brioni,  including  shirts,  denim and  organic  cotton  knitwear;  denim  and  jersey  for Alexander  McQueen,  MCQ  and  Saint  Laurent,  which chose  to  focus  on  its  permanent  collections  and  is now extending it to other categories such as shoes and the  iconic Classic  SL06 sneaker;  etc.  Since  the  end  of 2019, all the flannel used for packaging Saint Laurent's shoes,  handbags  and  ready-to-wear  items  has  been made  from  organic  cotton.  After  testing  the  use  of organic  cotton  in  various  product  lines  (shirts,  jeans, T-shirts, etc.), Gucci continued  to  increase  the quantities  used  in  its  collections  in  2019  and  2020, which include its new denim line, most of its T-shirts and sweatshirts and the linings of its ties. Nearly 73% of the total volume of cotton purchased by Balenciaga in 2019  for  its  production  and  packaging  was GOTS-certified organic, as were the flannel bags used for packaging. At Bottega Veneta, which has been very committed  to  the  subject  for  several  years,  organic cotton accounts for a significant portion of all cotton used  for  its  ready-to-wear  collections  and  for  the flannel  bags  protecting  leather  goods,  jewelry  and shoes.  Saint  Laurent  has  opted  to  focus  on  its permanent  collections  for  introducing  the  use  of organic cotton.\n\n## 4.4.3.4 Traceable and recyclable cellulosic fibers\n\nOther  than  cotton,  Kering's  sustainable  sourcing strategy  for  plant  textile  fibers  covers  cellulosic materials,  which  have  been  included  in  the  Kering Standards  since  2018  (standard  on  viscose  and cellulosic  fibers  from  wood  pulp).  The  Standards  are peer-reviewed  and  to  a  very  large  extent  follow  the logic and requirements of Canopy, an environment-focused  NGO  that  works  to  protect  the world's  forests,  species  and  climate.  In  addition,  in November  2018,  Canopy  launched  ForestMapper,  a Kering-funded  initiative  to  create  the  first  interactive map tracking ancient and endangered forests, thereby providing  businesses  with  tangible  decision-making support for their purchases of paper, packaging, wood and cellulosic textiles.\n\nIn  addition,  as  specified  in  the  Kering  Standards,  the Group and its Houses source primarily from suppliers that  have  achieved the 'green' level (score above 20) under the Canopy Hot Button Ranking methodology, as well  as  FSC-certified  cellulosic  fiber.  In  2020,  the Group's  main  suppliers  of  viscose  were  Enka  and Lenzing (Balenciaga for example); it also sourced small quantities from Asahi Kasei, Eastman, Aditya Birla and Jilin. Viscose  accounts  for  approximately  7%  of ready-to-wear raw materials, and in total less than 1% of the Group's raw material purchases.\n\nAnother  major  challenge  for  the  textile  sector  is  the large-scale  recycling  of  mixed  fibers,  especially  those containing cotton and cellulose. Kering is looking into a number of recycling technologies and, in September 2020, joined forces with Fashion For Good for the 'Full Circle Textiles Project: Scaling Innovations in Cellulosic Recycling' to research economically viable and scalable  solutions  for  chemical  recycling  of  cellulose to  enable  a  closed-loop  system  to  convert  textile waste  -  cotton  and  cotton  blends  -  into  new man-made cellulosic fibers.\n\nThe Houses continue to gradually incorporate sustainable cellulosic fibers into their collections:\n\n- \u00b7 Alexander  McQueen,  for  instance,  continued  to increase the share of sustainable cellulosic textiles used  in  its  collections:  sustainable  modal  and FSC-  or  PEFC-certified  viscose  are  now  an  integral part of the House's permanent collections, whether for ready-to-wear or accessories, where approximately 20% of products contain more than 50% of cellulose fibers produced in accordance with the Kering Standards.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Meanwhile, at Bottega Veneta, certified viscose was used in the Pre-Spring 2020 collection, as well as a new sustainable material composed of a mixture of cork  and  fennel  waste  from  the  agri-food  sector, produced entirely in Europe.\n- \u00b7 Gucci  continues  to  increase  the  proportion  of viscose from CanopyStyle certified suppliers, following on from 2019.\n- \u00b7 Moreover, for one brand, Kering Eyewear produces a range using bio-acetate M49, an innovative phthalate-free  material  derived  from  cottonseed fibers  and  wood  pulp,  whose  supply  is  certified  by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for  the  Endorsement  of  Forest  Certification  (PEFC) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI).\n\nLastly,  the  Group's  strategy  on  sourcing  wood-based products  (cellulosic  materials,  viscose,  etc.)  with  an impact in terms of deforestation is described in Kering's responses  to  the  2020  CDP  Forest  Questionnaire, available  at  www.cdp.net.  It  sets  out  the  Group's governance  with  respect  to  these  materials,  risk management and the Group's objectives and performance.\n\n## 4.4.3.5 Animal textile fibers\n\nAnimal fibers  such  as  wool  are  the  material  with  the second-greatest  impact  in  Kering's  EP&L  and  are central to many initiatives taken by the Group and its Houses.  Kering  and  the  MIL  accordingly  continued  to identify  new  sources  of  high-quality  fibers  that  meet the  Group's  sustainability  standards,  especially  as regards farming practices and animal welfare.\n\nTeams  from  Kering  and  the  Houses  have  carried  out numerous farm visits in recent years, notably to farms raising sheep for their wool in Australia and Italy, but they  could  not  continue  in  2020  due  to  the  global health  crisis.  In  2020,  Kering  focused  on  active engagement  with  the  various  potential  and  existing suppliers to assess and assist them in improving their sustainable  environmental,  biodiversity  and  animal welfare  management practices.  This  will  increase  the proportion  of  responsibly  sourced  wool  and  other animal  fibers.  Kering  also  provides  expertise  for various  wool  sector  initiatives  aimed  at  developing certifications and sustainable wool production methods, such as the Responsible Wool Standard, the Responsible  Mohair  Standard  and  the  Responsible Alpaca  Standard,  and  also  continues  to  work  with\n\nexperts in farming and sustainable land management practices, such as the Savory Institute, to promote the most  demanding  management  standards  for  wildlife and  biodiversity  conservation  among  sheep  farmers, as well as pastoral practices allowing soil regeneration.\n\nA  fabric  synonymous  with  luxury,  cashmere  has  been the subject of research and experimentation to improve the environmental footprint of its production. In 2015, Kering  and  the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society,  an international NGO, launched the Gobi Desert Cashmere program  in  the  Gobi  region  of  southern  Mongolia  to promote  sustainable  and  traditional  production  of high-quality cashmere in partnership with two cooperatives of nomadic herders representing 160  families  and  150,000  hectares  of  pasture  in \u00d6mn\u00f6govi  province.  In  addition  to  developing  the capacity of farmers to produce better quality wool, the program  focuses  on  pastoral  techniques  such  as rotating  herds  in  order  to  improve  the  impact  on biodiversity and animal welfare. In 2020, Kering joined the  new  Market  Sector  Advisory  Group  formed  at  the initiative  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Program (UNDP), which  works  with  other  stakeholders  in Mongolia  to  promote  harmonization  and  facilitate collaboration  between  various  existing  programs  there to support the emergence of a sustainable supply chain.\n\nKering's  sustainable  cashmere  program  is  now  a notable  source  of  high-quality  cashmere  for  the Group's  Houses,  as  it  meets  the  animal  welfare  and biodiversity  conservation  criteria  laid  down  in  the Kering  Standards,  with  the  added  bonus  of  reducing the environmental footprint. More than 22 metric tons of responsible cashmere have therefore been integrated  into  the  supply  chains  of  Gucci,  Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen since 2015.\n\nIn  a  complementary  effort  to  increase  efficiency  that reduces  pressure  on  the  already  degraded  areas  of  the Gobi region, certain Houses  including Gucci and Balenciaga use cashmere fibers from production offcuts thanks to an innovative process to recover scraps, which are sorted by quality and color and then transformed into regenerated cashmere fiber. Depending on the collection and the level of quality required, a certain percentage of virgin fibers can be added before the spinning stage. The whole  process  takes  place  in  Italy;  it  is  environmentally friendly and  fully traceable. Gucci  introduced  this innovative cashmere fiber in its ready-to-wear collections in  2016, and, along with Balenciaga, continued to use it in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2019, the Group released its silk requirements in the second version of its Kering Standards. To ensure their  adoption,  the  MIL  has  established  a  purchasing platform  with  the  main  suppliers  of  certified  silk  to guarantee  access  for  the  Group's  Houses  to  this high-quality fiber. This approach resulted in certified silk accounting for 16% of all purchases in 2019.\n\nIn  2020,  Balenciaga  continued  to  introduce  small quantities of organic wool (GOTS-certified) and ZQ-certified wool (guaranteeing regenerative agricultural practices and the consideration of animal welfare), regenerated  cashmere  and  organic  silk (GOTS-certified) into its collections.\n\nLikewise,  Alexander  McQueen  and  Saint  Laurent  are increasing the share of organic wool, ZQ-certified wool and  organic  silk  in  their  collections,  as  are  Bottega Veneta,  which  introduced  organic  wool  into  its Pre-Spring  2020  collection,  and  Brioni,  whose Brioni Sustainable capsule  collection  includes  a  selection  of pieces  in  ZQ-  and  Escorial-certified  wool.  MCQ  uses regenerated wool and cashmere in its collections.\n\nSaint  Laurent  aims  to  source  wool  from  farms  that protect the environment through management systems  that  ensure  the  regeneration  of  rangelands and follow best practices in terms of animal welfare. In particular,  the  House  promotes RWS certification, the most  advanced  animal  welfare  standard  in  the  wool industry.  For  example,  some  of  Saint  Laurent's  iconic jackets are made from wool bearing this certification. The  House  began  introducing  organic  cashmere  into its  collections  in  2020,  and  plans  to  continue  this initiative  in  2021,  working  with  Kering's  teams  to purchase  organic  cashmere  produced  as  part  of  the South Gobi Cashmere Project.\n\nBrioni  is  also  continuing  its  work  on  sustainable animal fibers: 2019 marked the House's launch of its limited  edition KMZERO capsule  collection  featuring items  made  exclusively  from  extremely  high-quality wool  from  Abruzzo,  the  region  in  which  Brioni's workshops are located. This collection is the result of a collaboration  dubbed Autoctonie , bringing  together local players  Confindustria  Chieti-Pescara,  Fratelli Piacenza,  Gran  Sasso  and  Monti  della  Laga  Park  with the  aim  of  reviving  the  production  of  wool  in  this region.\n\nThe  Houses  are  also  working  on  the  traceability  of their  wool  supplies.  Brioni,  for  instance,  is  working with  one  of  its  suppliers  in  Australia,  while  Saint Laurent launched a pilot project based on Oritain and blockchain  technologies  in  2019  to  trace  mohair supplies from farms in South Africa. Rolled out in 2020 across nearly all of its mohair supplies, the method is based  on  three  pillars:  mohair  certification  (CSM  or RMS),  secure  data  traceability  thanks  to  blockchain; and data verification with Oritain,  using  'fingerprints' that are specific to each farm.\n\n## 4.4.3.6 Precious skins and furs\n\nBecause  precious  skins  such  as  crocodile  and  snake skin are important raw materials for Kering, the Group places a strong emphasis on sustainable sourcing that also meets the strictest animal welfare standards. Over the  past  six  years,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have supported a range of initiatives on sustainable supply chains  for  crocodiles  and  pythons.  These  initiatives combine  the  Houses'  Sustainability  Departments  and the  Group's  operations  division  (which  manages  its own  tanneries  and  incoming  supplies)  and  various outside experts.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  continued  to  roll  out  its  action  plan for  verifying  the  alignment of the Kering Standards with practices in its exotic skin supply chains. The assessment is  carried  out  with  specific  programs  for  each  supply chain,  taking  into  account  the  characteristics  of  each animal species and each type of supplier.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  comply  with  national  and international  legislation  and  regulations  on  the  trade of  precious  skins:  all  skins  of  species  catalogued  as endangered  or  vulnerable  by  the  Convention  on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are obtained  with  certificates  attesting  to  their  legal origin,  issued  by  CITES  and  the  export  authority,  to ensure  that  trade  does  not  threaten  endangered species. Examples include Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin  for  the  supply  of  their  alligator  watch  straps, both  Houses  working  in  part  with  members  of  the Association  pour  l'Assurance  Qualit\u00e9  des  Fabricants  de Bracelets  Cuir (Swiss  association  of  quality  assurance for  leather  bracelets  manufacturers  -  AQC),  which  is active on traceability issues. The two Houses are also studying  alternatives  to  alligator  watch  straps  for certain  specific  markets.  Kering  continues  to  actively support the development of industry standards for all exotic  species,  such  as  crocodilians,  ostriches  and reptiles from Asia.\n\nIn  Southeast  Asia,  a  series  of  third-party  audits  were conducted  in  the  Group's  python  supply  chains representing all purchases of python skins by Kering's tanneries. They provided an opportunity to re-evaluate the  animal  welfare  practices  in  place  on  farms  and processing sites by reviewing their operating practices, in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Southeast Asian  Reptile  Conservation  Alliance  (SARCA  -  see below).  This  extensive  verification  program  brought the cumulative rate of coverage of tanneries' purchases of exotic skins by third-party audits to 70%. In 2021, the program will be extended to ostriches and Nile  crocodiles  (planned for 2020 but postponed due to the health crisis).",

        "page_content": "In  2020,  Kering  continued  to  provide  financial  and technical support to the Southeast  Asian  Reptile Conservation  Alliance  (SARCA),  which  specializes  in ethical  and  sustainable  trade  in  reptiles  in  Southeast Asia.  SARCA  is  a  multi-stakeholder  platform  that  brings together key players in the reptile trade, including luxury brands, tanneries, CITES, scientists  and  conservationists. SARCA  operates  a  study  and  research  program  in Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Thailand to gain a better understanding  of  the  various  sustainability  challenges generated by the trade in  reptile  skins,  particularly  with regard  to  natural  habitat  and  animal  welfare.  Players  in the  Kering  value  chain  were  also  provided  with  training on both matters. In 2020, SARCA's work included starting the process to draft a common animal welfare standard to cover the various species of snakes and lizards used in luxury  sector  supply  chains.  The  aim  is  to  finalize  and pilot these standards by 2021.\n\nIn  2019,  Kering  contributed  its  technical  expertise  to the drafting of animal welfare standards for the South African Ostrich Business Chamber (SAOBC), which were subsequently  approved  and  made  public  in  2020. These  standards  are  based  on  existing  codes  of conduct and the state of the art, and aim to provide a detailed  and  verifiable  best  practice  audit  program. They are for  the  most  part  aligned  with  Kering's  own Animal Welfare Standards for ostriches.\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  Houses  do  not  use  fur.  For example, Gucci is part of the Fur Free Retailer program promoted by NGO Fur Free Alliance,  and  has  banned the  use  of  furs  across  its  entire  range  since  its Spring/Summer 2018 collections. Gucci is also committed  to  no  longer  using  angora.  Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and MCQ also no longer use fur in their collections.\n\nWhen fur is used in a very limited way, it must strictly comply  with  the  standards  in  terms  of  traceability, breeding practices and animal welfare as set out in the Kering  Standard  for  fur.  In  these  Standards,  Kering recommends  the  use  of  furs  from  certified  channels such  as  Welfur  (a  scientific  assessment  program  for animal welfare established voluntarily by the European fur  industry  in  2009)  and  Profur  (a  demanding Finnish program for the documentation and ongoing improvement  of  breeding  standards  at  a  stricter  level than  that  of  European  legislation).  A  list  of  suppliers selected  for  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  Kering Standards has also been established.\n\n## 4.4.3.7 Metals, stones and other precious materials\n\nIllegal or unregulated mining can give rise to major social and environmental damage. Small-scale extraction work in  particular  can  endanger  communities  by  causing serious health and environmental damage if unregulated, whereas  properly  managed  mining  can  generate responsible  development  for  many  local  communities. Kering is therefore committed to limiting its purchases to metals  and  precious  stones  obtained  through  activities that minimize harmful impacts on the environment and generate opportunities for local communities.\n\nThe first key stage of this approach came in 2014 with the  purchase  of  55kg  of  Fairmined-certified  artisanal gold, which at the time was the largest ever purchase of such gold. Fairmined artisanal gold is extracted applying the  strict  standards  of  the  Alliance  for  Responsible Mining (ARM), whose criteria cover social responsibility, economic development of local  communities,  working conditions and proper management of chemicals.\n\nTo  encourage  its  Houses  to  source  responsible  gold (RJC Chain of Custody-certified, Fairtrade and Fairmined-certified  artisanal  gold  with  verified  and traced  provenance)  from  selected  partner  refiners, Kering has developed a dedicated buying platform, the Kering  Ethical  Gold  Platform.  The  goal  is  to  support responsible  gold  producers  and  contribute  to  their growth,  but  also  to  support  mining  communities through  the  Kering  Gold  Fund.  For  each  kilogram  of gold  purchased,  the  Group's  Houses  pay  a  premium used  to  endow  the  fund.  Each  year,  a  committee composed of representatives of Kering and its Houses selects  projects  to  be  supported  through  the  Kering Gold  Fund  in  favor  of  mining  communities  offering social  and  environmental  benefits.  Proof  of  the platform's success is that responsible gold purchases totaled one metric ton in 2020, bringing the volume of responsible  gold  purchased  to  more  than  six  metric tons since the platform was launched.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2020, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Pomellato,  DoDo,  Qeelin  and  Boucheron  used responsible  gold  for  all  of  their  Jewelry,  as  did Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin for their Watches.\n- \u00b7 In  turn,  Saint  Laurent  now  requires  that  its  gold suppliers  for  leather  goods  adhere  to  the  Kering Ethical Gold Platform.\n- \u00b7 Kering Eyewear sources its Maison Cartier Lunettes (MCL)  production  from  a  gold  supplier  that  is  a certified member of the RJC's 'Gold and/or Platinum Group Metals Trader and/or Refiner and/or Hedger' forum.\n\nFollowing this successful experience with gold, Kering is  considering  going  ahead  with  similar  programs  for silver.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This pilot project covers 34 hectares located on  alluvial  gold  mines  in  the  process  of  closing, bringing  together  Kering  with  Solicaz  (reforestation experts)  and  Forest  Finance  France  (experts  in  the development and management  of  reforestation initiatives),  and  resulting  in  the  reforestation  of  all former alluvial mining sites. This innovative partnership  goes  beyond  regulatory  requirements, under which only 30% of the mined surface must be restored - not enough to allow the reforestation of the Amazon.  For  the  first  time,  ecological  aspects  are taken into full account with 100% reforestation. In all, more  than  90,000  trees  prepared  in  nurseries  with ecological  engineering  based  on  biomimicry  have been planted on degraded sites. In addition, gold from these responsible alluvial  mines  has  been  purchased by Kering brands for use in their products since 2019;\n- \u00b7 in  Ghana,  Kering  and  NGO  Solidaridad  are  working together to help women in mining communities gain more  autonomy.  On-site  Solidaridad  teams  are helping 150 women living in five mining communities  to  develop  their  skills  and  confidence to  create  their  own  business,  as  well  as  to  organize themselves into cooperatives with a view to obtaining  local  permits,  concessions  and  funding. The  training  covers  such  topics  as  negotiation, business  management,  health  and  family  planning. Men  from  local  communities  are  stakeholders  in these groups to ensure acceptance of the project and a  genuine  opportunity  for  women's  empowerment. The  project,  which  started  in  July  2019,  saw  the establishment of a microfinance fund in 2020.\n\nIn response to the rising consumption of palladium for plating the metal parts in its leather goods and shoes, Gucci  has  developed  an  innovative  partnership  since 2018,  enabling  it  to  use  palladium  recycled  from catalytic  converters  used  in  medical  applications.  This recycled  palladium  is  produced  at  an  RJC  Chain  of Custody-certified plant in Italy, ensuring full traceability of this precious metal. Recycled palladium covers 100% of Gucci's needs.\n\nKering is working with its suppliers to ensure that all diamonds  used  in  its  products  comply  with  the Kimberley process, which aims to ensure the legality of trade on the international market, so that it does not serve to finance rebel-armed conflict. Kering has also worked with its Houses to roll out guidelines and best practices on the traceability and sustainable sourcing of  diamonds.  Pomellato,  for  example,  updates  the information provided on its diamond  suppliers annually.\n\nTo  go  further,  the  Group's  main  Jewelry  Houses  have joined  the  Responsible  Jewellery  Council  (RJC),  an international organization aiming to establish responsible and transparent business practices in the precious  metals  trade.  RJC  certification  attests  to  a company's  ethics,  respect  for  the  environment  and working  conditions  in  the  jewelry  and  watchmaking sectors.  It  ensures  supply  chain  transparency  for diamonds,  gold,  platinum  and  colored  gemstones, from the mine to the point of sale. It is rooted in ILO and Global Compact principles, as well  as  the  OECD's recommendations on due diligence.\n\nGirard-Perregaux, Pomellato and DoDo, Boucheron and Gucci (which is also RJC CoC-certified) are RJC-certified, Boucheron's certification was renewed in 2020,  and  Ulysse  Nardin  is  set  for  certification in 2021.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the emeralds and rubies used by Pomellato  are  sourced  from  a  responsible  gemstone producer, and that Boucheron is involved in mother-of-pearl supply projects with suppliers certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nKering was also one of the founding members in 2015 of  the  Coloured  Gemstones  Working  Group  (CGWG),  an initiative  bringing  together  prestigious  Jewelry  Houses with  the  aim  of  fostering  greater  transparency  and positive social and environmental impact in the colored gemstone  industry.  To  that  end,  the  CGWG  develops resources  and  tools  that  are  made  available  free  of charge  to  all  players  in  the  sector,  enabling  them  to identify,  avoid  and  manage  the  risks  and  impacts inherent  to  their  activities.  Kering  and  its  Houses worked actively on pilot projects for the tools developed by the CGWG. In May 2020, the CGWG posted a common vision  online  and  the  first  round  of  the  new  tools  on the  https://gemstones-and-jewellery.com  community platform,  where  all  sector  professionals  can  obtain dedicated  training,  and  evaluation  and  performance improvement tools.\n\nThe  Houses  also  make  use  of  other  lower-impact processes: Saint Laurent has been using physical vapor disposition (PVD) coating on stainless steel for several years now, for certain metal parts on its leather goods. Brass is being phased out in favor of steel, which has a lower environmental impact. And the steel is stabilized using  PVD,  a  vacuum  metallization  process  that deposits thin films of material in vapor form, and has a much  lower  environmental  impact  than  classic electrolytic plating processes.",

        "page_content": "## 4.4.3.8 Plastics\n\nThe use of plastics in the Houses' products is governed by  the  Kering  Standards,  which  include  a  dedicated section.  In  particular,  Kering  has  had  a  zero-PVC product  policy  in  place  since  2012.  Other  than  not using  PVC,  the  Houses  must  favor  plastics  with recycled content or, failing that, certified bio-sourced content,  and  ensure  that  the  chemicals  used  comply with  the  Group's  MRSL  and  PRSL.  For  the  product end-of-life  phase,  the  Kering  Standards  emphasize recyclability.\n\nBecause  of  the  very  many  alternatives  to  plastic available,  it  is  not  easy  to  compare  environmental performances  or  understand  supplier  claims.  This  is why  Kering  regularly  organizes  working  sessions  on these  subjects.  In  2019,  work  focused  on  increasing the  proportion  of  plastics  aligned  with  the  Kering Standards and innovation, in conjunction with experts from  Fashion  for  Good.  In  2020,  training  sessions focused  on  bioplastics  and  were  conducted  with  an expert  firm.  Kering  also  develops  plastic  evaluation tools that are made available to the Houses' logistics and purchasing departments as a decision-making aid for purchasing plastics.\n\nLastly, the MIL also offers a range of plastic materials compliant  with  the  Kering  Standards  to  enable  the Houses  to  incorporate  more  responsible  plastic  into their collections.\n\nConsistent with this approach,  Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Brioni and Balenciaga collections are using a growing  proportion  of  ECONYL \u00ae .  In  2019,  Alexander McQueen  consumed  approximately  650  meters  of ECONYL \u00ae for  the  production  of  its  umbrellas,  with Gucci  using  more  than  107,500  meters.  Since  2015, Gucci has been gradually replacing the plastic used on the  heels  of  its  shoes  with  recycled  ABS  plastic.  In 2019, it made 14,000 pairs of shoes with soles made of 50% bio-sourced TPU. Kering Eyewear favors the use of mineral glass lenses for sunglasses, a more robust and recyclable material than plastic.\n\nB2B packaging nevertheless remains the main use of plastic  for  the  Group.  Based  on  a  map  of  plastic consumption  plotted  in  2017  for  ready-to-wear packaging  and  logistics  to  determine  its  level  of compliance with the Kering Standards, the Group has implemented several substitution projects for recycled plastics since 2018. At the end of 2019, Kering joined the  Circular  Polybag  Pilot,  the  first  Fashion  For  Good pilot  project  on  this  issue,  which  aims  to  create  a circular  solution  for  polybags  in  the  fashion  industry. In  2020,  the  centralized  logistics  teams  worked  to remove  any  plastic  that  could  be  replaced  with certified cardboard from e-commerce shipments.\n\nIn  addition  to  eliminating  some  plastic  materials  in favor of more sustainable or recycled alternatives, the subject  of  microplastic  pollution  and  its  potential impacts  on  the  environment  and  human  health  is  a key  concern  for  the  textile  sector.  This  diffuse pollution, stemming in large part from the washing of synthetic fabrics, is very difficult to quantify, although the  scientific  community  appears  to  agree  on  the major risk it represents in terms of ocean pollution. In this  context,  Kering  took  part  in  the  work  of  the European Outdoor Association consortium on microplastic  pollution.  The  consortium's  work  is geared towards more accurately measuring the impact from  microplastic  pollution  and  developing  technical solutions to limit the impact. In 2018 and 2019, Kering also  worked  with  NGO  Fauna  and  Flora  International to draft recommendations for best practices in plastic pellet management and to avoid microplastic pollution in supply chains. This study was an essential first  step  towards  better  understanding  its  footprint upstream of the value chain.\n\nLastly,  Kering,  along  with  its  Houses,  has  pledged  to eliminate  single-use  plastics  from  its  B2B  and  B2C packaging by 2030 and - for residual plastic - to use only recycled plastic in order to protect the oceans by reducing the negative impact of the fashion sector.\n\n## 4.4.4 Animal welfare: the Kering Animal Welfare Standards\n\nKering  believes  that  the  products  developed  by  its Houses must meet the highest standards of quality in all  aspects  of  production,  including  those  related  to the  welfare  of  animals  supplying  many  of  the materials used by the Houses.\n\nWith this in mind, Kering published its Animal Welfare Standards  in  May  2019,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the highest standards of animal welfare across the Group's supply chain. They cover all the species featuring in the Group's supply chains around the world, namely cattle and  calves,  sheep,  goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles  and alligators, pythons, and mammals bred for their fur. For each  of  these  species,  the  open-source  Standards highlight the specific challenges, laying down breeding, transportation  and  slaughtering  requirements,  and provide  the  list  of  existing  certifications  serving  as benchmarks. In addition to this multi-species document, Kering has published more detailed individual Standards for cattle, calves, sheep and goats, as well as guidelines for slaughterhouses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nDeveloped  over  three  years  with  input  from  animal welfare  experts,  farmers  and  herders,  scientists  and NGOs,  the  Standards  are  based  on  the  latest  scientific research, as well as prevailing legislation and standards, best  management  practices  and  recommendations from  a  range  of  sectors.  As  such,  they  are  based  on external  expertise,  including  an  external  review  by several  specialized  associations  such  as  the  Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in  2017,  Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) and the Fondation Nicolas Hulot pour la nature et l'homme (FNH) in 2018.\n\nThe  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  lay  down  a number of requirements for animal management that would  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of  animals  in countries around the world if they were adopted by the industry  more  broadly.  They  are  structured  in  Bronze, Silver and Gold tiers to provide clear guidance on critical compliance  and  with  the  expectation  that  the  Group's suppliers will make continuous improvements:\n\n- \u00b7 the Bronze entry level reflects minimum requirements, which equal, and in some cases go beyond, European legislation.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards notably  advocate  that  the  best  practices  put  in place by the European Union be implemented on an international  scale,  which  would  already  be  a substantial improvement in many countries that have little or no animal welfare regulations in place;\n- \u00b7 the Silver level reflects the best practices currently in place worldwide;\n- \u00b7 the highest Gold level sets the bar for 'best-in-class' practices  that  can  fundamentally  transform  the industry. Some  of  these  requirements  include: prohibiting feedlots and intensive farming in favor of pasture-rearing  for  better  quality  of  life;  promoting regenerative grazing and avoiding 'food competition' with sources of human nutrition, which is a growing concern  given  the  world's  increasing  population; strict limitations on transportation; ensuring welfare for working farm animals; and prohibiting the use of sub-therapeutic  antibiotic  treatments,  which  avoids the unnecessary contribution to the rise of anti-microbial  resistance  that  is  threatening  human health.\n\nSpecific  audit  protocols  describing  how  Kering  and  its Houses  can  measure  their  suppliers'  compliance  with each  of  the  Standards  have  been  developed.  The protocols naturally cover livestock rearing, transportation and  slaughter  conditions,  but  also  include  broader criteria  such  as  farms'  environmental  performance  and their impact on local communities and people.\n\nThe Kering Animal Welfare Standards are the first ever set of full standards for luxury and fashion and aim to drive  positive  change  in  industry  practices,  and beyond.  Kering  now  plans  to  gradually  phase  in  the application of these Standards, based on collaborative implementation with its suppliers. Pilot projects have been  conducted  with  strategic  suppliers  involving Houses  representatives  and  animal  welfare  experts. Since  2017,  these  pilots  have  involved  82  farms covering  ten  different  animal  species  in  16  countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nKering has pledged that 100% of the key raw materials used  by  the  Group  and  the  associated  production processes  will  comply  with  the  Kering  Standards, including those in respect of animal welfare, by 2025. To  achieve  this  objective,  a  country-by-country  risk assessment  approach  is  implemented,  based  on  the Animal  Protection  Index  of  NGO  World  Animal Protection.  It  assesses  the  risks  inherent  to  each country  in  terms  of  animal  welfare,  based  on indicators  such  as  the  prevailing  legislation  and  the voluntary commitments  existing in the various countries.  The  level  of  verification  implemented  to ensure  compliance  with  Kering's  Standards  is  then adapted to this level of risk by country, as well as other factors such as the type and volumes of raw materials concerned.\n\nIn 2020, the monitoring and verification of compliance with  animal  welfare  standards  in  the  Group's  various supply  chains  focused  particularly  on  the  leather sector. A procedure to map the slaughterhouses in the Houses' value chains across the globe was carried out, identifying 274 slaughterhouses in some 30 countries. This led to the establishment of a case-by-case action plan  reflecting  the  risk  presented  by  the  countries  of operation and cross-referencing results with a benchmark of existing animal welfare certifications for slaughterhouses.  At  the  end  of  2020,  the  first  audits were carried out - remotely due to the health situation -  in  order  to  verify  that  Kering's  animal  welfare requirements were being met.\n\nFor  other  materials,  in  the  absence  of  field  visits,  a bibliographical evaluation was carried out of some ten standards and suppliers with regard to their approaches to animal welfare, particularly for the wool and alpaca supply chains.\n\nIn  addition  to  actions  in  respect  of  its  own  activities, Kering is therefore working with the sector to improve respect for animal welfare and the alignment of sector standards. In 2020, Kering was particularly active with the following groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Southeast Asian Reptile Conservation Alliance (SARCA)  for  precious  skins  from  reptiles  from Southeast Asia;",

It follows that Kering and its Houses  do  not  directly  manufacture  products  or conduct  animal  testing  in  this  segment.  The  players with which Kering and its Houses have signed licensing agreements  have  developed  strict  policies  on  animal testing,  compliant  with  internationally  recognized standards  and  best  practices.  Their  approaches  and requirements are set out in their respective reporting documents.\n\nGucci  has  also  laid  down  specific  requirements  for fragrances  and  cosmetics  in  its  Gucci  Sustainability Principles, available on its website.\n\n## 5 THE GROUP, ITS STAKEHOLDERS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY\n\n## 5.1 Stakeholder dialogue\n\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, players in the private  sector  need  to  pay  attention  to  and  maintain close relationships with their partners and stakeholders.  For  Kering,  the  goal  is  to  establish quality relationships built on trust with all its partners, regardless  of  their  location,  with  a  view  to  gaining  a full  appreciation  of  their  concerns  and  expectations, and,  as  far  as  possible,  incorporating  these  aspects into  its  strategy.  This  entails  developing  a  policy  of dialogue  and  analysis  of  stakeholder  expectations  at Group  level,  and  encouraging  each  House  to  develop its  own  platform  for  dialogue  at  a  more  operational level.\n\n## 5.1.1 Approach at Group level and value chain\n\nThe  Group's  value  chain,  which  is  structured  around five key  stages,  from  creation  to  the  customer experience, identifies the players involved and reflects Kering's  work  with  all  of  its  stakeholders.  Along  with the update to its materiality matrix (see section 1.4.1), Kering  has  also  updated  the  map  of  its  principal stakeholders.\n\nA  detailed  presentation  of  value  creation  at  each  of these  stages  is  provided  in  the  Group's  integrated report, available on kering.com.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5.1.3 Contribution to professional organizations and other institutions\n\nKering  takes  a  global  approach  to  dialogue  with stakeholders, and is ever attentive to the major issues they  face.  It  takes  part  in  a  number  of  initiatives involving  multiple  stakeholders,  such  as  professionand sector-specific associations. Kering's contributions to these associations is determined according to a set budget.\n\nThe Group allocated \u20ac1,492,922 to institutional affairs in 2020. The main items were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac70,000  contribution  to  the Association  fran\u00e7aise des  entreprises  priv\u00e9es (AFEP),  which  monitors French  and  European  government  policies  on  tax, legal, labor, financial and CSR matters;\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac20,000  contribution  to  Alliance  France  Tourisme, which focuses on tourism policies in France;\n- \u00b7 \u00a360,000 contribution to the British Fashion Council, which focuses on developing sustainable growth in the fashion industry.\n\nKering's Houses  also contributed to the main organizations for fashion and luxury, in France ( Comit\u00e9 Colbert , F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la haute couture et de la mode ), Italy (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana , Altagamma) and the UK (Walpole), in accordance with their respective budgets. Amounts were either fixed or proportional to brand revenue.\n\nIn  line  with  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics,  no  financial contributions  were  made  in  2020  in  the  name  or  on behalf  of  the  Group  to  any  political  organization  in exchange for any direct or indirect material, commercial or personal advantage.\n\n## 5.2 Community impact and preservation of know-how\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  play  a  major  role  in  the economic and social fabric of the regions where their sites are located. Community involvement is especially important  in  the  luxury  business:  Kering's  Luxury Houses draw expertise and know-how both from their directly  operated  workshops  and  from  a  network  of thousands of suppliers, nearly 90% of which are based in  Italy.  The  long-standing  success  of  the  Group's Houses  draws  upon  key  know-how  specific  to  the luxury business, which must be preserved. To this end, they support various craft guilds and have established a  number  of  professional  organizations  that  help  to ensure  the  survival  of  some  very  demanding  and unique  skills  and  support  long-term  employment  in the regions where these crafts originated.\n\nThe  positive  impacts  of  this  work  are  especially apparent  in  craftsmanship  in  leatherwork  in  Italy, watchmaking in the Jura Valley, and artistic creation in London, Paris and Milan.\n\nSome  Group  Houses  have  set  up  internal  centers  of excellence to preserve key skills and know-how. As well as  helping  to  promote  the  complex  and  unique  skills involved, this also helps to ensure long-term employment in the regions where the crafts originated:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Gucci  ArtLab,  which  opened  in  2018,  brings together the brand's leather goods and shoes operations at an ultra-modern site spanning 37,000  sq.m.  The  purposes  of  this  new  center  of excellence  are  to  preserve  the  unique  know-how\n\ndeveloped  by  Gucci  and  to  instill technological innovation  enabling  it  to  optimize  production,  a  key factor underpinning the House's strong growth. However,  the  health  crisis  forced  Gucci  to  suspend operations temporarily in 2020.\n\n- \u00b7 The ArtLab also now houses Gucci's \u00c9cole de l'Amour education program, which includes a craftsmanship school ( scuola dei mestieri ),  offering a six-month program to train students to professional  standards;  a  factory  school  ( scuola  di fabbrica ), which has been training technical production  operators  for  a  year  now;  and  a technical  academy  that  offers  expert-level  training in  advanced  technologies,  with  a  focus  on  digital techniques in the creation process.\n- \u00b7 The Saint Laurent women's  shoes  workshop, opened  in  2017  in  Vigonza,  Italy,  internalizes  all development  and  production  stages  (sketching, materials  research,  prototyping,  testing,  finishing, etc.).  The  workshop  deftly  balances  cutting-edge technology with the traditional practices of exceptional  craftspeople.  It  is  Saint  Laurent's  third internal  production  site,  after  the  ready-to-wear workshop in Angers, France, and the leather goods workshop in Tuscany, Italy.\n- \u00b7 In 2018,  Brioni  acquired  an  historic  tapestry production site in Penne as part of its support for Arazzeria  Pennese,  one  of  Italy's  most  important tapestry centers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are also involved in forward-looking endeavors for encouraging sustainable innovation and training future generations of craftspeople and designers:\n\n- \u00b7 Bottega  Veneta  backs  the Istituto  Professionale Montagna in  Vicenza,  which  is  putting  together  a Made  In  Italy teaching program  to develop Italian-bred  excellence  in  the  leather  goods  and textile  industries.  The  first  year  of  the  program,  a pilot leather goods laboratory, opened in September  2018.  The  program  was  attended  by 122 students in 2020, and training at the laboratory will continue in 2021.\n- \u00b7 The  House  also  organizes  training  sessions  on  its own  premises  as  part  of  the Scuola  dei  Maestri Pellettieri workshop  to  spread  and  transmit  the traditional  leatherworking  techniques  that  are  so specific and essential to the House. Created in 2006 and located since 2013 in the Montebello Vicentino workshop,  the  school  operates  as  a  permanent training  center  for  Bottega  Veneta  employees  and apprentices alike, allowing them  to  immerse themselves in the craftsmanship and values of the brand. In 2020, 37 employees were able to take part in  the  training  program,  half  in  person  and  half online, because of the public health crisis.\n- \u00b7 Boucheron enjoys a long-standing partnership with the \u00c9cole  Priv\u00e9e  de  Bijouterie  Joaillerie  de  Paris (BJOP).  As  part  of  this  initiative,  Boucheron  is sponsoring  the  2018-2020  class,  offering  students valuable  first-hand  insights  into  the  industry.  It organizes conferences and visits to workshops and production  sites,  offers  apprenticeships  to  some students (at least one per year), and works with the teaching team to organize competitions for creative and technical work. Since late 2019, Boucheron has also  been  running  monthly  workshops  on  its flagship  products  through  the  years,  to  develop employees'  appreciation  and  understanding  of excellent craftsmanship.\n- \u00b7 Brioni  continued  its  three-year  program  for  training exceptional  tailors  at  its Scuola  di  Alta  Sartoria school, as a preliminary to offering them employment in its workshops. More than a hundred tailors have graduated from this school and are now working  for  Brioni,  either  in  its  workshops  or boutiques.  In  September  2016,  Brioni  extended  the program  with  the  Ready,  Steady!  scheme,  which enables young tailors to acquire new skills through a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\none-year apprenticeship both in the House's production departments and stores. In the final stage of  the  Let's  Go!  program,  from  March  2018  to September  2019,  the  young  tailors  were  able  to switch  stores  every  three  months  over  a  one-year period  to  familiarize  themselves  with  different cultures  and  customer  profiles  across  the  world.  In 2020,  the  leatherwork  classes  (tanning,  cutting, sewing,  finishing,  etc.)  had  to  be  downsized  to comply with COVID-19-related government restrictions. A total of 37 employees took part in the training program, half online and half in person.\n\n- \u00b7 Alongside  its  center  of  excellence,  in  2017  Gucci began  a  three-year  strategic  partnership  with Bocconi  University  in  Milan  to  set  up  the  Bocconi Research Lab, whose four-strong research-teaching team  and  director  will  support  Gucci's  innovation strategy  and  cultivating  a  start-up  spirit  at  the House.  Also  at  Bocconi  University,  Gucci  partners the  Masters  in  Fashion,  Experience  &  Design Management (MAFED) course, offering five international students each year an opportunity to develop a project on sustainability in collaboration with Gucci. The  House  also  backs  the  New Sustainable  Fashion  program  run  by  the  Milano Fashion Institute, offering a yearly internship in its Sustainability Department to one of the students on the course.\n- \u00b7 In  partnership with the prestigious Institut  fran\u00e7ais de la mode (IFM), Saint Laurent founded the Institut de  Couture  Saint  Laurent,  running  a  six-month advanced  course  on  ready-to-wear,  with  theory classes, spotlights on iconic pieces from the brand's collections and practical classes balancing traditional craftsmanship with creativity and innovation. Sustainability  is  another  key  feature  of the  course,  which  addresses  both  students  and Saint Laurent employees, who can take part in some of the modules as part of their career development plans. Since it began in September 2017, the course has been attended by 263 people, including 109 in 2019/2020.\n- \u00b7 In  2017,  Pomellato  teamed  up  with  the  Galdus Goldsmith  Academy  to  launch  a  new  program named Virtuosi , offering a full curriculum over three to seven years to train highly qualified professionals  attuned  to  intensifying  needs  in  the competitive  world  of  jewelry.  Pomellato's  support takes the form of program sponsorship, involvement of Pomellato experts in the program's classes  and  seminars,  apprenticeships,  student grants,  and  a  joint  workshop  with  the  Galdus Goldsmith Academy.",

Personnel also receive in-house training by specialists.\n- \u00b7 Ulysse  Nardin  and  Girard-Perregaux  also  support apprentice  training  for  point  of  sales  personnel  at the Centre  professionnel  du  littoral  neuch\u00e2telois (CPLN) and CIFOM.\n- \u00b7 Ulysse  Nardin  supports  the  Watch  Museum  of Le  Locle  in  Switzerland  and  two  training  institutes in  the  field  of  watchmaking,  CIFOM  and  WOSTEP. This support involves taking on apprentices, developing training programs and offering evening courses for Ulysse Nardin employees to build on or hone  their  skills.  At  its  subsidiary,  Donz\u00e9  Cadrans, Ulysse  Nardin  also  runs  a  training  course  on enameling, a specialty not covered at watchmaking schools.\n\nand  the  Treviso  Belluno  Dolomiti  Chamber  of Commerce on a prototyping laboratory to strengthen  and  preserve  local  craftsmanship,  as well  as  to  support  creativity  and  develop  world leadership in the eyewear industry.\n\nAn  academic  partnership  strategy  is  being  developed at Kering, with the support of its Houses, so that more joint initiatives can be offered in 2021 (see section 3.1.2).\n\nCommunity  impact  is  at  the  heart  of  Kering's sustainability  strategy,  of  which  responsible  sourcing of  raw  materials  is  a  key  element.  In  practical  terms, responsible sourcing takes into account both environmental  and  social  issues,  in  particular  those related to the production of raw materials (extraction, cultivation  or  animal  rearing).  This  means  that  the Group  seeks  to  go  beyond  simply  reducing  any negative impacts to having a truly positive impact that directly  benefits  producers,  especially  as  regards human rights, as outlined in section 2.6 'Protection of human rights'.\n\n- \u00b7 To support the multi-sector craftsmanship tradition in  eyewear,  Kering  Eyewear  works  with  Certottica\n\n## 5.3 Crafting tomorrow's Luxury\n\n## 5.3.1 Developing responsible products: a long-term strategy\n\n## 5.3.1.1 The Kering approach\n\nBroadly  speaking,  Kering's  strategy  is  to  seek  to influence  the  way  in  which  products  are  designed  as far up the supply chains as possible and subsequently at every step of the value chain. This is due to two key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The  results  of  the  EP&L  carried  out  at  the  Group level  clearly  show  that  the  biggest  environmental concerns are located far upstream, in particular at the  raw  material  production  stage  (extraction, cultivation  or  animal  rearing),  rather  than  on  the Group's own operations and sites;\n- \u00b7 Designing  more  environmentally  friendly  products is  challenging  without  sustainable  materials  and processes. The most important advances in sustainability  are  likely  to  be  achieved  in  sourcing and by focusing on processing technologies.\n\nThe  Houses  are  therefore  focusing  their  efforts  on upgrading sourcing and improving their processes:\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to EP&L calculation and impact assessment tools, a new product simulation module enables  product  design  and  development  teams  to gauge  the  environmental  impact  of  alternative design options (choice of materials, sourcing countries, production processes, etc.). It indicates the most  environmentally  virtuous  options  to  guide design  choices  toward  optimization  on  an  EP&L footprint criterion.\n- \u00b7 The release of the Kering Standards marked a major step  forward,  providing  the  Houses  with  clear, detailed information in the form of lists of sourcing and process sustainability criteria for each material.\n- \u00b7 Kering sets up conditions conducive to stimulating innovation  in  its  Houses.  Initiatives  such  as  the Fashion  for  Good  partnership  keep  the  Houses  in touch with the start-up community, with a view to developing innovative and responsible products.\n- \u00b7 The Group's Houses also have permanent access to the Materials Innovation Lab (MIL). Five years after it was  first  launched,  the  lab  offers  the  brands  a library  of  more  than  3,800  ecological  fabrics  and fibers to use in their collections. Since February 2020, Kering's Watches  and  Jewelry Houses have also benefited from support from the Watch  &  Jewelry  Sustainable  Innovation  Lab  (SIL) with a view to including more responsible materials and technologies in their products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Houses  continued  the  move  to  chrome-  and metal-free  tanning  in  2020:  29%  of  the  Group's leather goods purchases were metalor chrome-free  this  year,  compared  to  24%  in  2019. For example, Gucci continued the roll-out of metalfree tanning for its iconic handbag  models, customizable  small  leather  items  and  shoes.  In 2016, Kering extended  metal-free  tanning  to crocodile skins, notably those used for watchbands designed by its France Croco tannery, a first in the luxury industry.\n- \u00b7 The  proportion  of  organic  cotton  used  in  the ready-to-wear collections continues to increase. In 2020, Balenciaga continued the phase-in of GOTS-certified organic cotton for its collections and packaging.  Gucci  and  Alexander  McQueen  also continued  to  increase  the  proportion  of  organic cotton used in their ready-to-wear and accessories collections. Saint Laurent has opted to focus on its permanent  collections  for  introducing  the  use  of organic  cotton:  in  its  jersey  category  (T-shirts, sweatshirts,  polo  shirts,  etc.)  in  2017,  followed  in 2018  by  other  categories  such  as  shoes,  with organic  cotton  featuring  in  the  emblematic Classic SL06 sneaker.  The  House  has  now  succeeded  in incorporating a high level of organic cotton into its jersey  and  denim  categories,  with  denim  being predominantly  made  using  GOTS-certified  organic cotton and recycled GRS-certified elastane.\n- \u00b7 Precious  fiber  sourcing,  particularly  cashmere,  has also progressed within the Group. This is due to an innovative  process  to  recover  scrap  production, which is sorted by quality and color to be converted into  a  regenerated  cashmere  fiber.  Depending  on the  collection  and  the  level  of  quality  required,  a certain  percentage  of  virgin  fibers  can  be  added before the spinning stage. The whole process takes\n\n- 206\n\nplace in Italy; it is environmentally friendly and fully traceable. Gucci introduced this innovative cashmere  fiber  in  its  ready-to-wear  collections  in 2016, and, along with Balenciaga, continued to use it  in  2020.  In  2019,  Brioni  introduced  its KMZERO limited edition capsule collection, comprising pieces made exclusively from the finest quality wool from  the  Abruzzo  region,  home  to  the  House's workshops.\n\n- \u00b7 Cellulosic fibers such as viscose are also attracting great  attention,  in  so  far  as  they  are  made  from wood  pulp  and  as  such  carry  significant  risks  in terms of deforestation. In 2018, a new standard on viscose  and  cellulosic  fiber  from  wood  pulp  was included  in  the  Kering  Standards.  The  Kering Standards  are  peer-reviewed  and  to  a  very  large extent follow the logic and requirements of Canopy, an environment-focused NGO that works to protect the  world's  forests,  species  and  climate.  Alexander McQueen  continues  to  increase  the  proportion  of sustainable cellulosic textiles used in its collections: sustainable  modal  and  FSC-  or  PEFC-certified viscose  are  now  an  integral  part  of  the  House's permanent collections, in ready-to-wear and accessories, where around 20% of products contain more  than  50%  of  cellulosic  fibers  sourced  in accordance with the Kering Standards.\n- \u00b7 Responsibly  sourced  materials  have  also  taken pride  of  place  in  Alexander  McQueen  collections, since Fall/Winter 2017. In the Fall/Winter 2019 and Spring/Summer 2020 collections, responsibly sourced  materials  (organic  wool,  silk  and  cotton, and modal and ECONYL \u00ae ) are used in around 30% of ready-to-wear  pieces  and  in  56%  of  accessories. For Balenciaga, 93.5% of the plain materials used in its Summer  2021  collection  were  certified  as sustainably  sourced  or  upcycled,  and  100%  of printed  materials  were  certified  as  sustainably sourced.\n- \u00b7 A good example of the circular economy approach under way at the Group's Houses is the increasing use  of  ECONYL \u00ae textile,  made  entirely  from  plastic waste,  in  collections  from  Alexander  McQueen, Brioni, Balenciaga and Gucci. High-quality ECONYL\u00ae yarn  is  spun  from  plastic  waste,  much  of  it recovered  from  oceans,  such  as  fishing  nets  and discarded  carpets,  including  plastics  that  harm marine life and other materials that would end up in landfill.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In Jewelry, the Kering Ethical Gold Platform purchasing platform facilitated a significant increase  in  the  proportion  of  responsibly  sourced gold (RJC Chain of Custody-certified gold, Fairtrade-  and  Fairmined-certified  artisanal  gold, and  gold  from  verified  traceable  sources)  used  by the Group's Houses, up to more than six metric tons since  the  platform  was  launched  (including  one metric ton in 2020). In 2020, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Pomellato,  DoDo,  Qeelin  and  Boucheron  used responsible  gold  for  all  of  their  Jewelry,  as  did Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin for their Watches.  Pomellato  crossed  a  further  threshold with  its  new Nuvola collection,  which  uses  100% Fairmined gold from a Peruvian artisanal mine.\n\nKering's  Houses  are  increasingly  intent  on  measuring and monitoring the sustainability performance of their collections. Saint Laurent, for example, has developed a set of indicators for tracking the performance of its ready-to-wear  categories  twice  a  year,  with  its ready-to-wear product teams.\n\nContinuing  this  momentum,  certain  Houses  are  also developing sustainable collections and capsule collections, strengthening the positive impact of their flagship products and thereby raising client awareness of  the  issues  at  hand,  meeting  growing  demand  for responsible  products,  and  involving  clients  in  the endeavor.\n\n- \u00b7 In  June  2020,  for  example,  Gucci  launched Off  the Grid ,  the  first Gucci Circular Lines collection. Off  the Grid uses  recycled  materials  and  textiles  with  the aim of combating waste and minimizing the use of new  resources.  It  comprises  five  product  lines covering accessories, ready-to-wear and travel bags, all  made  from  recycled,  regenerated,  organic  and biosourced materials from sustainable sources. The lead material in the collection is ECONYL \u00ae regenerated nylon. In support of a continuous loop approach,  ECONYL \u00ae scraps  are  recovered  from  the production  processes  of  Gucci's Off the Grid products  and  recycled  to  create  new  ECONYL \u00ae materials as part of the Gucci-ECONYL \u00ae Pre-Consumer  Fabric  Take  Back  Program.  Leather scraps  from  the  collection  are  also  recovered  and recycled under the Gucci-Up program.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, Balenciaga released its first sneakers made using  92%  recycled  materials.  In  addition,  the House  regularly  releases  capsule  collections  with non-profit  organizations,  such  as  2020's We  Are Pink collection, a series of unisex products made to support research into breast cancer. 2019 saw the collection with IUCN for the protection of endangered species, and a second collection for the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\n- \u00b7 Bottega  Veneta  released  its The  Puddle boots  in Fall  2020,  as  a  reinterpretation  of  the  classic rainboot  format.  The  ultra-lightweight,  waterproof ankle  boots,  in  bright  colors  or  earth  tones,  are made  from  an  innovative,  long-life,  biodegradable polymer material.  The polymer is made in Europe from  fossil  fuels  and  decomposes  under  specific conditions.  It  biodegrades  in  waste  treatment plants under  the  standard  ASTM  D5511  test method.\n- \u00b7 Brioni's  capsule  collection Brioni  Sustainable -launched in 2019 - is growing with each successive release. It groups together all of the brand's pieces with a sustainability component (ZQ wool, ECONYL \u00ae , Escorial wool, organic cotton, etc.).\n- \u00b7 In  2020,  Ulysse  Nardin  launched  two  products designed to limit their impact on the environment and promote sustainability, without compromising on product excellence. The first step in the House's commitment to the marine circular economy came in  October  2020  with  its  new R-Strap watchband. Compatible  with  the Diver , Marine and Freak  X models,  the  band  is  made  from  recycled  fishing nets,  a  major  source  of  marine  plastic  pollution. Subsequently, in November  2020,  the  House launched Diver Net ,  an innovative upcycled concept watch in which each trim feature is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible.\n- \u00b7 DoDo released a limited edition special bracelet in recycled  plastic,  under  its  partnership  with  Tenaka on  a  project  to  restore  1,000  sq.m  of  Malaysian coral reef.\n\nSome Houses go so far as to rewrite the codes to offer clients  new  experiences  consistent  with  a  circular model, as with Gucci's collaboration with consignment site TheRealReal  and  the  launch  of  the  MyMCQ collaborative  platform.  In  September  2020,  Alexander McQueen relaunched its MCQ brand with a new circular economy  model,  taking  the  form  of  an  innovative digital  platform that merges fashion with technology. Items  are  registered  using  blockchain  technology, enabling  consumers  to  interact  and  engage  on  the platform  by  means  of  the  NFC  tags  attached  to  each garment. MCQ's goal is to further the circular economy by  extending  product  lifespans  through  reuse  and repurposing  via  a  community  of  users  connected  to the peer-to-peer platform.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With  this  in  mind,  the  Group  and  its Houses are stepping up their training and awareness-raising  operations  for  their  sales  and merchandising  teams,  and  in  their  interactions  with clients and consumers. Some of the Houses organized Kering  Standards  training  sessions  for  their  sales teams in association with Corporate. Examples include Brioni's training course on the environmental footprint  of  its  Spring/Summer  2021  collection  and the Gucci Retail Academy, the House's internal training platform  via  which  it  provided  specific  training modules  for  retail  sales  personnel  worldwide  on  the launch of the new Gucci Equilibrium website and the Gucci sustainability strategy. These modules cover:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  Equilibrium  and  the  sustainability  pillars, including  the  brand's  environmental  strategy.  The Equilibrium  online  learning  module  has  reached 90% of the target population (retail staff), compared with  an  average  take-up  rate  of  72%  for  online training;\n- \u00b7 the  launch  of Off  the  Grid , Gucci's  first  100% sustainable collection, which expresses the House's commitment to a circular economy model. Designed  to  raise  employee  awareness  of  the House's  commitment,  this  module  has  achieved  a take-up rate of 85%;\n- \u00b7 new sustainable, ecological packaging (take-up rate awaiting calculation).\n\nIn  addition  to  its  Gucci  Equilibrium  sustainability platform,  in  June  2020  Gucci  also  began  posting sustainability data for 400 products on its online sales site and Gucci App.\n\nKering's  spirit  of  sharing  and  its  desire  to  encourage the  world  of  fashion  to  adopt  more  sustainable practices  permeate  all  the  Group's  Houses,  and  is expressed  through  initiatives  targeting  their  clients and  the  general  public,  as  well  as  through  their websites and social media accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 at  Design  Miami,  for  example,  Balenciaga  joined forces  with  artist,  architect  and  designer  Harry Nuriev  in  an  environmentally  conscious  project  to create  an  upcycled  couch  filled  with  discarded Balenciaga clothing and labels;\n- \u00b7 in 2020,  with  many  counties  under  lockdown, Alexander McQueen launched the #McQueenCreators series  of  free  tutorials  on  its  website  to  share  its creation and design techniques with its followers;\n\n- \u00b7 Kering Eyewear, Girard-Perregaux and Pomellato all communicate to the general public on sustainability and Group and House strategy, via dedicated pages on their websites and client newsletters;\n- \u00b7 in  June  2020,  Gucci  launched  a  new  Instagram profile  and  upgraded  its  Equilibrium  website  to spotlight  its  ongoing  commitment  to  instigating positive  change  for  people  and  the  planet,  and  to sharing, engaging  and  uniting  its  community around these initiatives;\n- \u00b7 with  an  innovative  initiative  to  raise  awareness  on protecting  oceans,  Gucci  created  a  video  game inviting  players  to  take  the  role  of  Italy's  celebrity surfer  Leonardo  Fioravanti  in  collecting  plastic waste. The House also worked with environmentalist David de Rothschild for a podcast in  honor  of  Beat  Plastic  Pollution  Day  (June  7),  as part of World Environment Day;\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga took part in the 2020 edition of Go For Good,  an  innovative  initiative  organized  by  French department store Galeries Lafayette to raise public awareness on sustainable consumer goods.\n\n## 5.3.2 Crafting tomorrow's Luxury by supporting innovation\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Supporting innovation within the Group\n\nTo  significantly  reduce  its  environmental  footprint, Kering aims to stimulate disruptive innovation, transform its traditional processes and encourage the widespread adoption of more sustainable practices. An illustration of this determination is the Create pillar of its  2025 strategy, which makes innovation one of the drivers of the Group's sustainability approach.\n\n## Partnership with Fashion for Good\n\nKering  is  a  founding  partner  of  Fashion  for  Good,  a platform created in 2017 to accelerate innovation in the luxury and fashion industries by factoring in sustainability criteria and supporting the development of start-ups through an intensive accelerator program. This comprehensive  industry-wide  innovation  ecosystem  is expanding: in 2020, Fashion for Good boasted 20 corporate partners, including fashion brands, suppliers  and  financial  institutions,  which  take  part  in pilot  programs,  publish  industry  reports,  and  provide support for  more  than  115  innovators.  Partners  include the  Galeries  Lafayette  group,  Target,  PVH  Corp.  and Adidas.",

        "page_content": "The program  helps  partners  identify the most compelling  innovative  start-ups  in  the  sector  and support them  in their development. Candidate start-ups  must  take  a  360\u00b0  approach  to  innovation, focusing  on  three  priority  areas:  the  supply  of  raw materials,  the  manufacture  of  fabrics  and  garments (dyeing,  processing,  sewing)  and  product  end-of-life (recycling,  circular  economy). The accent is placed on projects and technologies that can help players in the textile industry reduce their consumption of water and energy,  their  waste  production  and  their  use  of chemicals, and help improve their working methods. In 2020, the research field was expanded to include the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic (responsible anti-bacterial technologies, digital solutions for virtual try-ons, 3D design, etc.).\n\nA  total  of  115  high-potential  start-ups  joined  the accelerator, from among the 2,000 shortlisted. Kering has  approached  61%  of  the  start-ups  to  discuss  a range  of  innovations,  such  as  eco-friendly  dyes  and alternatives  to  leather,  polyester,  etc.  Of  the  83  pilot projects launched  via  the  accelerator,  18  were coordinated with Kering Houses through the MIL and at Group level. In 2020, these included:\n\n- \u00b7 two projects on polybag recycling;\n- \u00b7 the Full Circle Textile Project, announced  in September 2020, involving a consortium of brands, suppliers  and  innovators  working  together  on textile recycling technologies;\n- \u00b7 a project on viscose traceability using the innovative TextileGenesis platform and building on the  results  of  an  initial  Fashion  for  Good  pilot operation  conducted  in  2018-2019  on  cotton traceability, in which Kering was also involved;\n- \u00b7 a  hydroponic  cotton  project,  growing  cotton  in conditions  similar  to  those  of  a  greenhouse,  with considerable  reductions  in  the  use  of  water, chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.\n\nThe  partnership  is  also  a  powerful  force  in  building commitment  across  Group  and  House  teams  and start-ups  at  the  accelerator.  Though  the  health  crisis precluded the usual in-person meetings with innovators,  online  meetings  and  virtual  pitches  did take  place,  followed  up  by  tests  and  pilot  operations where applicable.\n\n## Materials Innovation Lab (MIL)\n\nKering's Houses have access to the Materials Innovation  Lab  (MIL),  opened  in  2013  at  the  heart  of the  Group's  production  operations  in  Italy.  The five-strong MIL team has three main missions:\n\n## 1. Integrating responsible raw materials into the supply chain\n\nThe  MIL  helps  the  Group's  ready-to-wear  Houses source responsible, sustainable raw materials. It works closely  with  suppliers  both  on  improving  alignment with  the  Kering  Standards  for  existing  fabrics  and  on developing new, more sustainable fabrics. The MIL also offers  the  development  of  a  collaborative  approach with  stakeholders  in  the  supply  chains,  from  raw material producers to weavers and spinners, to ensure that the availability of sustainable materials is in step with production cycles. The Group's Houses are offered a continually updated library of certified fabrics, fibers and  materials.  These  undergo  in-depth  scrutiny,  and are  assessed  in  light  of  both  external  standards  and certification,  and  by  a  tool  exclusive  to  the  MIL, developed in line with the EP&L methodology;\n\n## 2. Driving change\n\nThe  MIL  drives  change  toward  more  responsible fashion  through  close  and  regular  contact  with in-house  teams  (design,  production,  merchandising), internal  and  supplier  training  and  webinars  on  the Kering Standards and sustainability, and participation in sector-specific conferences and working groups;\n\n## 3. Leading innovation\n\nThe  MIL  incubates  sustainable  innovation  in  textiles and accessories by meeting innovators, assessing their techniques for application by the Group's Houses, and working  on  pilot  operations  involving  new  processes and materials. It also supports pilot projects from the Fashion for Good accelerator.\n\nThe main MIL advances in 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 involvement of 100 yarn and fabric suppliers using sustainable  materials  in  the  launch  and  follow-up of  403  specific  developments  (78  for  yarn  and 325  for  fabrics) concerning  various  materials (cashmere, wool, silk, cotton, mohair, nylon, polyester, viscose, and acetate);\n- \u00b7 joint development with key suppliers of sustainable raw  material  platforms  for  cashmere  and  wool fibers,  in  addition  to  the  silk  platform,  to  ensure that materials are available in phase with production cycles, at fair prices, and with the quality required by Kering's Houses;\n- \u00b7 ongoing  updates  to  the  library  of  fabrics  and  other sustainable solutions for ready-to-wear and accessories (textiles,  trims,  non-woven  fabrics,  technologies,  etc.), and  their  assessment  in  light  of  internal  and  external standards;\n\n<!-- image -->",

A total of 38 pilot projects were under way in 2020, and another 31 being studied.\n\n## Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL) for watches and jewelry\n\nIn addition to the MIL and in keeping with the Group's strategic commitments, Kering launched its Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL) in early 2020. Based at  the  Group's  watchmaking  sites  in  Switzerland,  the SIL  deals  with  materials  used  by  the  Jewelry  and Watches brands. One of the SIL's missions is to forge ties  between the Group and academic experts on the development  of  technologies  for  more  responsible products.\n\nIn  2020  the  SIL  Steering  Committee,  comprising  the CEOs of the Group's Watches and Jewelry Houses, met twice to establish the lab's goals and roadmap. During the  year,  the  SIL  launched  11  collaborative  applied research  projects,  each  bringing  together  several Houses,  to  open  the  way  toward  new  product applications.  It  also  ran  an  Innovation  Day  with specialist research institutes, and three workshops.\n\n## Impact Space\n\nThe  series  of  workshops  on  responsible  innovation launched in 2019 under the name 'Impact Space' was continued  in  2020.  These  workshops  seek  to  nurture collaborations on major sustainable innovation topics across  Group  and  House  employees  from  different departments.  The  subjects  tackled  in  2020  were e-commerce,  eco-design  for  improved  recyclability, traceability  and  biomaterials.  The  2019  workshops covered  subjects  including  packaging  and  plastics, alternatives  to  leather,  and  sustainable  innovation trends in China.\n\n## K Generation Award\n\nKering  teamed  up  with  start-up  incubator  Plug  and Play China to launch the K Generation Award in China. As well as identifying innovators in sustainable fashion in  China,  this  award  program  also  seeks  to  educate the  Chinese  fashion  ecosystem  on  the  importance  of more responsible fashion. A panel of experts narrowed down  the  fifty-strong  shortlist  to  select  the  three winning start-ups to be presented at the K Generation Talks  and  an  award  ceremony  held  at  Shanghai Fashion  Week  in  October  2019.  Toward  the  end  of 2019,  the  prizewinners  came  to  Europe  to  visit production  sites  and  meet  Kering  and  brand  teams, investors  and  experts.  A  similar  trip  had  been scheduled  to  the  United  States  for  2020,  including  a visit to the Plug & Play accelerator site in Silicon Valley, but  had  to  be  canceled  because  of  the  health  crisis. Again  because  of  the  health  crisis  and  its  travel restrictions,  the  second  edition  of  the  K  Generation Award, which was to be organized in 2020, had to be canceled.  In  2020,  a  pilot  project  with  one  of  the winners  of  the  2019  edition  entered  development  at Kering.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Innovation-oriented initiatives from Kering's Houses\n\nIn  addition to Group-level initiatives, the Houses also run their own innovation-oriented initiatives, addressing  their  own  activities  and  priorities,  in  line with the objectives of the Group's 2025 strategy.\n\nAt  Balenciaga,  innovation  is  central  to  creativity,  and greater  sustainability.  The  Design  and  Development teams  work  with  a  number  of  start-ups  through  the Plug  and  Play  accelerator,  and  with  others  identified directly  by  the  House  for  their  work  on  innovative sustainability solutions (alternative materials, innovative  processes  and  tools,  etc.).  In  response  to the clear need for closer cooperation across different functions,  Balenciaga  set  up  its  Material  Innovation Unit  (MIU)  to  mobilize  designers,  developers  and operations  specialists  around  common  practices  and processes.  This  platform  is  also  useful  for  training teams  and  putting  them  in  touch  with  NGOs  and experts  from  the  academic  world  on  responsible sourcing matters.\n\nIn  addition  to  Fashion  For  Good,  Gucci  works  with incubator investment funds and acceleration programs  such  as  H-Farm  to  stimulate  disruptive innovation  in  sustainable  materials  and  processes. Saint  Laurent's  Sustainability  Department  works  with the  materials  research  and  product  development teams for its various ranges to increase the proportion of sustainable materials in the House's collections.",

The House's R&D specialists regularly  take  part  in  professional  conferences  on innovation,  such  as  EPHJ (Environnement  Professionnel Horlogerie  Joaillerie) in  Geneva  and  M2I  ( Mat\u00e9riaux Innovants  et  Intelligents ). Ulysse  Nardin's  efforts  are focused on research and development for solutions to the  growing  crisis  caused  by  marine  plastic  pollution. The  watchmaker  has  set  up  a  research  unit  to  study materials from the sea, investigating the characteristics of  oyster  shells,  algae,  PET  from  discarded  plastic bottles, and polyamides from fishing nets. The team is currently examining a number of sustainable innovation openings for future watchmaking projects.\n\nLastly, Kering Eyewear is seeking innovation in multiple ways, including a blockchain pilot project to develop a more  transparent,  secure,  traceable  and  efficient business  solution  across  all  supply  chain  processes through a cooperative approach with partners.\n\n## 5.3.3 Sustainable fashion: rethinking fashion shows and managing event footprints\n\nFashion shows are an essential part of the operations of  Kering's  Houses,  enabling  them  to  share  their creative vision and present new collections. They also provide a unique opportunity for raising awareness on sustainability,  and  mobilizing  all  the  parties  involved (brands, model agencies, event organizers, media, etc.) on this important quest.\n\nIn  2019,  all  of  the  Houses  took  up  the  Green  Fashion Shows internal guidelines on minimizing the environmental impact of fashion shows, while allowing the creative directors to express their artistic potential. The topics covered by the guidelines include governance, stakeholder relations, energy management, waste  management,  elimination  of  single-use  plastics, food  and  transportation.  The  procedure  for  verifying compliance  with  the  guidelines  was  finalized  in January 2020. Kering also participates in working groups on  this  topic,  set  up  by  fashion  industry  associations and non-profit organization Paris Good Fashion.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  and  its  Houses  worked  with  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and all the parties  involved  in  putting  on  a  fashion  show  to develop  a  tool  for  measuring  the  environmental impacts  of  such  an  event.  The  tool  factors  in  all  the operations  involved,  including  digital  and  media impact.  An  example  of  this  sustainability  focus  came with  Saint  Laurent's  February  show:  all  the  main materials used in the show were recycled, the energy consumed came from renewable sources (biofuels and green electricity), and single-use plastics were banned from catering  operations.  Most  of  the  materials  were then  reused  through La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts ,  a  French non-profit  organization  that  collects  various  types  of materials from events and shows and offers them via a dedicated  platform  to  members  of  its  network  of artists at preferential prices.\n\nBalenciaga's efforts to minimize the overall impact of its  March  2020  fashion  show  (Winter  2020)  included initiatives in the following areas: waste reduction and sorting; measures to eliminate single-use plastics; the use  of  compostable  cups  and  plates;  the  reuse  or recovery  of  stage  materials  (wood,  steel,  synthetic materials,  carpets,  seating,  etc.);  the  reduction  and optimization of transportation for materials, merchandise and employees; and carbon offsetting for the entire show via support for a reforestation project. Balenciaga  worked  with  specialist  NGO  Up2Green Reforestation, choosing to support a project based in the  Indian  province  of  Gujarat.  To  offset  carbon emissions from fashion shows, more than 4,000 fruit trees were planted in 2020 as part of a project run with a  local  NGO,  VIKALP,  which  seeks  to  improve  living conditions  for  local  communities  and  women  in particular.\n\nIn line with Gucci's approach on carbon neutrality, all CO2  emissions  generated  by  the  release  of  Epilogue, the brand's digital campaign released on July 17, 2020, were  measured  and  offset.  The  data  were  measured by a third party on the basis of the number of views for each website and platform. As well as being carbon-neutral, Epilogue was also certified to ISO 20121, which examines environmental, social and economic factors to determine whether an event can qualify as sustainable. Live coverage for Epilogue and the  campaign  came  from  Palazzo  Sacchetti  in  Rome. On-set  production  arrangements  included  the  use  of plastic-free catering and compostable packaging, plus best  practices  in  on-site  waste  sorting  and  recycling. Gucci obtained ISO 20121  certification for its advertising  campaigns  and  its  fashion  shows,  both physical  and  virtual.  In  addition,  it  applied  Kering's Green Fashion Shows guidelines to all these events.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  was recycled  to  produce  tables  that  were  to  be  displayed and sold for charity at Milan Design Week in 2020, an event  that  was  rescheduled  for  2021  because  of  the health  crisis.  The  February  2020  fashion  show  also complied  with  the  Kering  Green  Fashion  Shows guidelines.\n\nAlexander  McQueen's  Fall/Winter  2020  event  was  its first  'green  fashion  show'.  The  show  took  place  in Paris  in  February  2020  and  was  planned  from  the outset for minimum  environmental  impact.  An internal  communication  operation  was  run  ahead  of the  show to ensure that all employees involved were aware of the new policies. Measures included working with  a  local  network  of  subcontractors,  all  based  in Paris  or  its  outskirts.  Waste  sorting  was  applied systematically,  from  the  workshop  through  to  the actual  show  venue.  Most  of  the  materials  used  for building the catwalk were either rented or made from materials that will be reused in coming shows.\n\n## 5.3.4 Crafting tomorrow's Luxury by conveying our vision\n\n## 5.3.4.1 Transmitting our values to future generations\n\nKering  continues  its  policy  of  international  partnerships with prestigious business and design schools worldwide, with  a  view  to  raising  awareness  among  designers  and future  fashion  industry  leaders  on  the  major  social  and environmental challenges in store. In addition to training programs  designed  to  promote  and  develop  know-how (see section 5.2), details of the main  academic partnerships are provided in section 3.1.1.2.\n\n## 5.3.4.2 Sharing our vision\n\n## \u00b7 2017-2020 Progress Report\n\nIn 2017, Kering unveiled its 2025 sustainability strategy, targeting a 40%  reduction  in its environmental footprint.  In  2020,  Kering  issued  a  progress  report  on this 2025  sustainability  strategy,  in  line  with  its commitment to report on the progress achieved during the first three years on the strategy's three pillars - Care, Collaborate,  Create  -  as  well  as  the  challenges  that remain  to  be  addressed,  through  an  ever-stronger emphasis on innovation.  The  report  was  released  at  a press conference, open to all the Group's stakeholders, during the changeNOW Summit, on January 30, 2020 at the  Grand  Palais  in  Paris.  It  is  available  on  Kering's website  and  on  a  dedicated  website:  https://progressreport.kering.com/.\n\n## \u00b7 Biodiversity strategy\n\nAlongside  experts  from  Conservation  International, Kering  presented  its  new  biodiversity  strategy  at  an online master class co-organized with Global Fashion Agenda on the importance of integrating  biodiversity into  the  core  of  business  operations.  The  strategy  is accompanied  by  a  new  ambition  to  achieve  a  net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025 (see  section  3.2.1).  Measures  included  the  launch  of the  Kering  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  to  support the fashion  industry's transition to regenerative agriculture.\n\n## \u00b7 Fashion Pact progress report\n\nThe  Fashion  Pact  issued  a  report  setting  out  the progress achieved in its first year of operation. Created further to a mission entrusted to Kering Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  by  the French  President  Emmanuel  Macron,  the  coalition brings  together  more  than  60  companies  from  the industry (ready-to-wear, sportswear, lifestyle and luxury, along with suppliers and distributors), all committed to a  common  core  of  ambitious  environmental  goals regarding  climate,  biodiversity  and  protecting  the oceans. Progress made so far includes the identification of seven strategic tangible targets, particularly in those areas  where  collaborative  action  is  needed  to  scale solutions in order to achieve critical impact on a global scale. The coalition has also implemented an operations structure, developed a dashboard of KPIs to measure joint impact, and began the first collaborative activity on  biodiversity  drawing  on  the  technical expertise of industry experts.\n\n## \u00b7 ChangeNOW Summit\n\nKering supported the third edition of changeNOW, the international  summit for positive  change,  which  took place on January 30, 2020 at the Grand Palais in Paris. Over three days, 20,000 attendees learned from more than  1,000  start-ups  and  speakers  from  all  over  the world  about  innovative  solutions  for  ocean  clean-up, renewable energies and many other topics relating to the critical social and environmental challenges of our times.  At  the  event,  Kering  presented  a  report  the progress  achieved  over  the  past  three  years  on  its sustainability  objectives  through  to  2025.  A  dozen  or so start-ups from the Kering ecosystem were invited to present their solutions at the changeNOW Sustainable Fashion  Corner,  while  the  Group's  key  contacts enjoyed guided visits of the summit. The next edition of the summit is set for May 2021.\n\n## \u00b7 We Love Green TV\n\nThe environment is at the heart of Parisian electro-pop music festival We Love Green. Kering joined the festival's select  Patron's  Club,  formed  in  2017,  and  renewed  its support for the event in 2020. Having quickly earned a reputation  for  its  quality  line-up,  We  Love  Green  has gradually extended its reach to include a think tank on environmental  innovation  in  partnership  with  French",

Adapting  to  the  health  crisis  in  2020,  We  Love Green put out a 100% digital edition under the name We Love  Green  TV,  with  an  innovative  interactive  map enabling  attendees  to  browse  the  various  activities offered by the virtual festival. The two-day digital event backed  by  Kering  drew  an  audience  of  82,000  festival goers.\n\n## \u00b7 ELLE aime la plan\u00e8te\n\nKering  partnered  the ELLE  aime  la  plan\u00e8te event  that took place on October 3 and 4, 2020 at the GoodPlanet Foundation, in Paris' Bois de Boulogne. This first event on  sustainability  issues  from  the  teams  at  ELLE France was aimed at the general public, the goal being to raise awareness among readers and consumers on environmental issues and encourage them to take up effective everyday practices to reduce their environmental impact. As part of the event, Kering ran an upcycling workshop for adults and children, and put on  a  presentation  on  sustainable  fashion,  with  the Group  Chief  Sustainability  Officer,  Marie-Claire  Daveu, in attendance. The two-day ELLE aime la plan\u00e8te event drew in 1,331 visitors plus an audience of 5,074 on the digital platform developed for the operation.\n\n## \u00b7 Talking about sustainability\n\nThroughout  the  year,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  the Kering Corporate Sustainability team, led by the Group Chief  Sustainability  Officer  and  Head  of  International Institutional Affairs, shared the Group's vision, 2025  strategy  and  actions  with  various  audiences, mainly  at  virtual  events  owing  to  the  global  health context. The principal venues included the Sustainable Leather Forum, the Vogue Business Seminar, Premi\u00e8re Vision, CFS+  (digital  version  of  the  Copenhagen Fashion Summit), the Milano Fashion Global Summit, the Women's Forum, the Green Tech Festival, the BSR Conference  2020,  and  a  webinar  on  non-financial reporting held by the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance. Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri also took part in various international events, relayed within the Group via  Workplace,  including  the  World  Economic  Forum Annual  Meeting  in  Davos,  speaking  on  the  subject  of biodiversity,  CFS,  and  the  Vogue  Business  Summit  in November 2020.\n\n## 5.4 Initiatives carried out by the Kering Foundation and sponsorship programs\n\n## 5.4.1 The Kering Foundation reasserts and strengthens its commitment to preventing violence against women, a front-line combat in 2020\n\nFormed  in  2008,  the  Kering  Foundation  combats violence  against  women,  across  all  cultures  and  all social  classes.  Worldwide,  one  woman  in  three  is  or will be a victim of violence in her life. The Foundation runs  on  five-yearly  program  with  Kering  corporate funding of \u20ac10 million (\u20ac2 million per year).\n\nThe  health  crisis  this  year  had  a  significant  impact  on violence  against  women,  often  confining  victims  with their aggressors. Throughout this period, the Foundation offered tangible and flexible responses to input from its partner  organizations  and  their  day-to-day  needs.  The situation put great pressure on the Foundation's partner organizations,  which  faced  exponential  growth  in  cases of  violence  against  women,  and  exceptionally  difficult working conditions in terms of providing help to victims.\n\nThe combat against violence to women is a key issue for Kering,  consistent  with  the  operations  and  customer base  of  its  Houses.  Alongside  public  authorities  and\n\nNGOs,  Kering  has  a  vital  role  to  play  here,  and  its commitment  to  this  cause  is  channeled  through  the Kering Foundation. The Foundation has put together an impact-focused  strategy,  working  closely  with  local partners  in  six  specific  countries:  China,  the  United States, France, Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn  each  country,  the  Foundation  supports  a  limited number of local organizations helping women who are victims  of  violence  and  working  on  ways  to  prevent violence. Support is provided at three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 to  specialist  associations  providing  support  and accommodation  for  women  victims  of  domestic violence, at national level;\n- \u00b7 to pilot initiatives run by NGOs  and  social enterprises  that  address  needs  not  met  otherwise and test the impact of new models prior to roll-out;\n- \u00b7 to grassroots associations and women's groups, by contributing  to  funds  for  women,  to  strengthen prevention and inclusion initiatives aimed at young people and victims of violence, respectively.\n\nThe Kering Foundation also works to nurture a lasting shift in behavior patterns, throughout the Group and in society in general.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Support for these associations comes in the form of non-earmarked financing, enabling them  to strengthen  their  means  of  action  efficiently  and optimally.\n\nIn  addition,  in  each  of  the  six  countries  it  covers,  the Foundation backs pilot initiatives such as La Maison des Femmes  de  Saint-Denis in France,  alongside  other corporate  foundations  such  as  Raja  and  Sanofi  Espoir. Under a partnership with the Foundation dating to 2014, La Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis opened in 2016. A team  of  gynecologists,  midwives,  nurses,  psychologists, sexologists, osteopaths, police officers and lawyers offer comprehensive  attention,  care,  support  and  guidance addressing medical, psychological, emotional and material  needs.  In  2020,  4,850  women  benefited  from shelter and support, and 14,000 from consultations.\n\nThe  Foundation's  partnership  with  the  organization Accompagnement hospitalier des victimes de violences conjugales  et  intrafamiliales ,  which  seeks  to  improve medical and social care for adult and child victims of domestic  and  intrafamily  violence  at  the  Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Malo in Brittany, came to an end in 2020. Support from the Kering Foundation contributed to providing the credibility needed for the hospital's management to include the program under its own  scope  of  operations.  Consultations  on domestic  violence  are  now  fully  integrated  into  the hospital's  standard  services.  The  Saint  Malo  site  has also been designated as pilot site for support services aimed  at  children  victims  of  domestic  violence (120 consultations in 2019).\n\nIn Italy, the Kering Foundation is partnering the social enterprise Colori  Vivi for  the  third  year  running. Colori Vivi provides  protection  and  support  for  refugee women through a Made in Italy creative workshop. The women  receive  guidance  from  qualified  volunteer tailors and stylists, who show them the basics behind making quality clothes and accessories.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Foundation's partnership with Birmingham and Solihull Women's Aid (BSWA) ended in September  2020.  Over  the  three-year  partnership,  the association  provided  medical,  psychological,  linguistic and  legal  aid  to  465  survivors  of  female  genital\n\nmutilation. Its initiatives to raise awareness of the issue reached  920  people  concerned  by  the  problem  and 1,087 young people. The 74 training sessions run by the association have reached 1,261 healthcare professionals, bringing  them  the  confidence  they  need  to  provide effective support to survivors of female genital mutilation.  In  March  2020,  the  Kering  Foundation enabled BSWA to raise a year's funding, by taking part in a gala event with a fundraising component.\n\nAgain in the United Kingdom, social enterprise Chayn a  Foundation  partner  since  2018  -  supports  women victims of violence by providing easy-to-access interactive  online  resources  in  several  languages.  In the  last  seven  years,  380,000  women  have  accessed Chayn's  resources,  with  1.3  million  page  views  since 2013.\n\nSince 2017, the Kering Foundation has also supported Callisto,  a  US-based  social  enterprise  running  an online  platform  for  detecting  repeat  sexual  violence offenders  and  providing  survivors  with  the  resources they  need  to  take  the  action  they  deem  appropriate. This  initiative  is  now  available  to  162,000  students across 12 university campuses.\n\nThe  Kering  Foundation  also  supports  grassroots associations,  working  with  funds  for  women  such  as the HER Fund in Hong Kong, which the Foundation has partnered  since  2016.  The  HER  Fund  provides  funds and other resources to support three small grassroots organizations  run  by  marginalized  women  who  are victims of domestic violence. One association addresses the LGBTQI+ community; another works on the  prevention  of  image-based  sexual  violence;  and the third runs an online platform on sex education for teenagers,  with  awareness-raising  on  the  dangers  of cyber-bullying.\n\nOne of the associations, Les Corner, works with lesbian women  to  combat  domestic  violence.  Over  the  past three years, this organization, founded by eight young Hong Kong volunteers, has been running awareness-raising  courses  on  domestic  violence, specifically addressing the LGBTQI+ community. It has also been  able  to  engage  dialogue  with  local authorities  and  the  police  on  procedures  in  tackling matters that affect this community in particular.\n\nFor  a  closer  reach  to  communities,  in  2019  and  2020 the  Foundation  initiated  five  partnerships  with  funds for  women:  Rosa  Fund  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the Mediterranean Women's Fund in France, Fondo Semillas in  Mexico,  Women  Win  in  Italy,  and  the  Women Foundation  of  California  in  the  United  States.  Each  of the funds presents projects run by grassroots organizations  or  women's  groups  developing  and deploying prevention actions addressing young people and inclusion initiatives for women victims of violence.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4.1.2 Preventing violence\n\nAs well as providing support for victims, it is essential to  tackle  the  origins  of  violence  with  a  view  to preventing it occurring in the first place. In 2020, the Kering Foundation  stepped  up  its  support  for prevention  initiatives  aimed  at  breaking  cycles  of violence.\n\nIn New York, the Foundation continues its work with the New  York  City  Alliance  Against  Sexual  Assault  and  its Project  Dream-Own-Tell  (DOT),  an  innovative  program helping young people from underprivileged communities defend  themselves  against  sexual  violence.  Project  DOT offers these young people, who are often overlooked by traditional prevention campaigns, a platform for creating and sharing positive messages with their communities. In  2020,  45  young  people  from  different  social backgrounds  took  part  in  the  program.  However, in-person  meetings  and  certain  activities  had  to  be suspended owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn  parallel,  since  2018  the  Foundation  has  been working  with  the  American  NGO  Promundo  and  its Manhood  2.0  program,  which  studies  potentially harmful  gender  norms.  The  program  seeks  a  shift  in outlook  among  young  men  and  adolescent  boys, encouraging them to take a closer look at the unequal value system in which they have been raised, at what it really  means  'to  be  a  man',  and  at  the  impact  this system has on health, relationships,  violence,  mental well-being,  drug  use  and  other  issues.  Since  the project  started,  21  educators  have  been  trained  and 36  young  men  have  taken  part  in  the  program.  The results are positive, with 90% of the people leaving the course  feeling  better  prepared  for  implementing Manhood  2.0.  The  program  was  impacted  by  the COVID-19  crisis,  since  the  in-person  support  group sessions could no longer go ahead.\n\nIn 2020,  the  Kering  Foundation  and  Promundo launched the Global Boyhood Initiative to provide boys from  4  to  13  (and  the  adults  around  them)  with educational tools to help them grow up with a view of masculinity  that  is  healthy  and  respectful  of  gender equality. Drawing input from interviews with boys and their parents,  and  from  research  into  the  way masculinity  is  represented  in  television  programs  in the  United  States,  this  initiative  focuses  on  four fundamentals for positive masculinity: share emotions in  healthy  ways,  accept  &  connect  with  others,  break free  from  stereotypes,  and  stand  up  and  speak  out against  bullying  &  inequality.  In  October  2020,  the Global  Boyhood  Initiative  reached  out  to  the  general public in the United  States  via  the  #BraveryIs campaign,  which  gained  an  audience  of  more  than seven million people and provided a valuable foothold for discussions on a healthy conception of masculinity.\n\nGendes ,  a  Mexico-based  member  of  the  Foundation's Social  Entrepreneurs  Community,  runs  weekly  men's group sessions to encourage a shift in mindsets with regard  to  the  definition  of  masculinity.  Given  the problems  raised  by  the  health  crisis  in  2020, Gendes\n\nopened  a  hotline  to  offer  individual  support  to  men about to commit violence. From March to November 2020, 610 men contacted the hotline.\n\nIn 2020, the Kering Foundation continued its commitment to work on breaking the intergenerational cycle  of  violence  and  the  climate  of  silence  that surrounds the subject of incest. According to the World Health  Organisation,  20%  of  women  and  between  5% and 10% of men declare having suffered sexual abuse during  childhood,  with  incest  cited  in  80%  of  these cases.\n\nTo  help  address  this  unacceptable  situation,  in  2019 the Foundation provided support for the opening of a unit specializing in care for victims of incest situations at La Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis .  This support continued in 2020. Since the unit was opened, support has  been  offered  to  close  to  100  women  victims  of incest.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Foundation  also  joined  Make.org  for  the launch  of  the Grande  Cause  pour  la  Protection  de l'Enfance , a program backed by the French Secretary of State  for  Children  and  Families,  Adrien  Taquet,  the actor Andr\u00e9a Bescond (co-scriptwriter and director of the film Les Chatouilles ), and a network of associations on collective action to protect children and put an end to this intolerable violence.\n\nThe Foundation also chose to support the Association Internationale  des  Victimes  de  l'Inceste (AIVI)  -  now named Face \u00e0 l'inceste  ! -  in  France,  with  help  on  its repositioning  strategy,  along  with  the  Louie  Media podcast Ou  peut-\u00eatre  une  nuit ,  which  is  breaking  the wall of silence around the subject of incest and comes with  an  audio  guide  addressing  both  the  general public and healthcare professionals providing support for incest victims.\n\n## 5.4.1.3 Strengthening the Kering Foundation Social Entrepreneurs Community\n\nSince  2008,  supporting  innovative  social  entrepreneurs has  been  the  central  focus  of  the  Kering  Foundation's work  to  combat  violence  against  women.  In  2020,  the Foundation formed an international Social Entrepreneurs Community,  in  partnership  with  Empow'Her,  a  French organization supporting women entrepreneurs.\n\nIts ambition is to create synergies and share innovative alternative models, which can be workshopped through the community of innovators and experts from different industries  and  countries,  to  achieve  a  greater  impact. Member  social  entrepreneurs  benefit  from  financial support from the Kering Foundation, follow an incubation  program,  have  access  to  the  Foundation network, and take part in annual workshops to develop contacts  and  pursue  innovation  alongside  other  social entrepreneurs. To date, the Community counts 11  members,  including  Callisto,  Chayn, Gendes and Colori Vivi.\n\n<!-- image -->",

France, for  example,  has  reported  a  30%  rise  in  cases  of domestic  violence  since  the  first  lockdown.  For  this reason, in March 2020, the Kering Foundation took an inventory of its partners' needs in this unprecedented global situation, and the impact of the crisis on victims of violence. In response to this consultation, it set up an emergency fund for immediate release to specialist organizations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the  United  States,  to  support  them  in  the  crisis situation.\n\nThe  Foundation  also  adjusted  its  support  to  the changing needs of each partner against the backdrop of  uncertainty:  extended  project  terms,  flexibility  in reporting,  reallocation  of  programs  in  response  to shifting priorities, additional grants, etc.\n\nAs  well  as  providing  this  material  support,  the Foundation also ran three awareness-raising campaigns, broadening  the  catchment  area  of  its  network  to  raise funds and provide victims with information on resources available during lockdown:\n\n- \u00b7 Based  on  the  observation  that  isolation  brings  a dramatic  increase  in  the  danger  faced  by  victims locked down with their aggressors, the Foundation ran a campaign  entitled  #YouAreNotAlone  to provide  victims  of  violence  with  information  and local support during the lockdown period. Resources  fielded  by  the  Foundation's  partners were  shared  over  social  media  by  Kering  and  its Houses.\n- \u00b7 OneInThreeWomen,  the  first  European  network  of companies  committed  to  ending  violence  against women,  co-founded  by  the  Kering  Foundation  and French  organization Fondation  Agir  Contre  l'Exclusion (FACE), ran a campaign entitled Les violences conjugales  ne  sont  pas  priv\u00e9es  de  sortie (Domestic violence is not under lockdown). As well as addressing\n\nvictims  and  witnesses  of  domestic  violence,  the campaign also sought to raise funds for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale  Solidarit\u00e9  Femmes (FNSF)  organization.  It reached a wide virtual audience over social networks and  radio,  plus  a  considerable  physical  audience through  billboards  in  Paris  subway  stations.  FNSF resources benefited very largely from the OneInThreeWomen initiative, with donations 7.5 times higher than in 2019. Funds approaching \u20ac75,000 were collected in April and May 2020, and were used to pay for  emergency  hotel  accommodation,  equipment  for FNSF  personnel,  and  direct  financial  aid  for  women victims of violence. Visits to the solidaritefemmes.org website  rose  five-fold  during  this  period,  reflecting  a considerable success in awareness-raising.\n\n- \u00b7 The Kering Foundation also joined forces with Gucci's Chime  For  Change  on  the  #StandWithWomen campaign to boost funding for front-line organizations providing support for women and girls worldwide, with an emphasis on relief against gender bullying and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional funding helped the beneficiaries  -  Chayn  Italia,  Equality  Now,  Global Fund  for  Women,  Elas,  HER  Fund,  Mediterranean Women's  Fund, Fondo  Semillas, Ms.  Foundation  for Women, and Rosa Fund - to move forward with their essential work on ensuring health, safety and justice for all women.\n\n## 5.4.1.5 Working together for a greater impact\n\n- \u00b7 Through internal and external campaigns, the Kering Foundation seeks a lasting shift in behavior patterns and greater awareness of violence against women.\n- \u00b7 Since  2011,  the  Kering  Foundation  has  been training employees from the Group and its Houses on understanding, listening to and helping victims of domestic violence. The program began in France, with training developed jointly with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF), and  was followed in Italy in 2013, in partnership with Donne in  Rete  contro  la  violenza (D.i.Re),  in  2015  in  the United Kingdom with Women's Aid and in 2016 in the United States with the National Alliance to End Sexual  Violence  (NAESV)  and  the  National  Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV). This training has reached  a  total  of  1,402  employees,  including  the members  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee. Because  of  the  health  crisis,  in-person  training  is currently  on-hold.  The  Foundation  is,  however, working  with  its  partners  on  a  digital  version,  to address  employees  based  in  France,  the  United Kingdom, Italy and the United States.",

This policy guarantees confidential and appropriate support  to  victims  of  violence  within  the  Group. Support  measures,  operated  in  partnership  with specialist  associations,  include  flexible  working hours, special leave and financial help. In 2019, the Foundation backed the approval of the International Labour Organization's Convention 190 on violence and harassment in the workplace.\n- \u00b7 In  2020,  the  Kering  Foundation  and  Led  By  HER, with support from TrustLaw, the Thomson Reuters Foundation's pro bono legal program, and law firm Dentons,  issued  a  report  on  best  practices  and policies addressing domestic  violence  in the workplace. This comparative report, covering Australia,  New  Zealand,  Italy,  the  United  Kingdom, France  and  Canada  (Ontario),  sets  out  clear  and applicable  measures  that  could  be  adopted  by governments and implemented by employers.\n- \u00b7 On November 23, 2020, the Kering Foundation and Make.org  announced  the  next  stage  in  the Grande Cause  Stop  aux  Violences  Faites  aux  Femmes program  launched  in  2017  with  more  than 60 partners.  It  will  involve  four  concrete  measures to  improve  support  for  women  survivors  and counter everyday sexism from the earliest age.\n- \u00b7 On November 25, the Kering Foundation partnered Modern Films in the '16 Days 16 Films' short films competition  in  the  United  Kingdom,  France  and Italy,  plus  for  the  first  time,  Mexico and the United States, with the participation of non-profit organizations En Avant Toute(s) ,  Chayn Italia, Fondo Semillas , National Network to End Domestic Violence,  and  the  UK  SAYS  NO  MORE  campaign. Sixteen  films  were  posted  on  social  media  on November 25, International Day for the Elimination of  Violence  Against  Women  and  on  December  10, International Human Rights Day, in connection with the UN international campaign '16 Days of Activism Against  Gender-Based  Violence'.  In  2020,  the campaign  reached  more  than  752,000  people  via social  media  and  more  than  152,000  via  the traditional media.\n- \u00b7 The Kering Foundation encourages Group employees to use their professional or personal skills to support NGOs or social enterprises. Since 2014, its International  Volunteer  Program  has  offered  two  to four  days'  paid  leave  to  employees  who  take  two weeks'  solidarity  leave  to  volunteer  in  a  foreign country with the Foundation's partner, MovingWorlds. In 2020, only one employee was able to  leave  for  a  volunteer  assignment  in  India,  just before  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  forced  the Solidarity  Leave  program  to  be  suspended  for  the rest of the year.\n\n## 5.4.2 Philanthropic actions by Kering's Houses\n\nAlongside  the  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Kering Foundation,  each  House  supports  causes  of  its  own choice,  by  donating  products,  running  special  sales, taking  part  in  charity  dinners,  seconding  personnel,  or forming long-term partnerships with non-profit organizations. In 2020, support from Kering's Houses for causes  in  education,  training,  healthcare  and  disease prevention, environmental protection and poverty relief reached nearly \u20ac4.3 million. Examples of specific causes are outlined in sections 5.4.2.3 to 5.4.2.6. Several of the operations in question -in education, training, healthcare, etc. - are specifically addressed to women, consistent  with  the  Group's  priorities,  and  children.  In 2020,  these  operations  accounted  for  \u20ac1.3  million  of the  \u20ac4.3  million  total  (see  section  5.4.2.2).  Other operations  focus  on  causes  such  as  professional integration,  the  preservation  of  cultural,  artistic  and historical heritage, and support for local associations.\n\nExamples  in  2020  included  contributions  toward combating the bush fires in Australia and dealing with the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  Group's  Houses  also muster  exceptional  support  on  an  individual  or collective  basis,  or  with  assistance  from  Kering  (as outlined in section 5.4.2.1, for example).\n\n## 5.4.2.1 Support from Kering and the Houses to combat the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nSince  January  2020,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have  also launched a  number of  initiatives  to  help  combat  the COVID-19  pandemic,  assist  healthcare  professionals and institutions, and support those affected. Given the scale of the crisis, the Group has been active in many regions, adapting its support to local needs. Donations by the Group and its Houses on exceptional aid in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic totaled \u20ac14.8 million.\n\nKering's  Houses  acted  quickly  and  decisively,  offering valuable  aid  to  the  hardest  hit  healthcare  structures and populations.\n\nIn China, as early as the end of January, Kering and its Houses announced a donation to the Hubei Red Cross Foundation to help fight the spread of the virus.\n\nIn  France,  Kering  imported  3  million  surgical  masks from China, for the French health service. At the same time, the Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent workshops  began  manufacturing  officially  approved face masks. Kering also made a financial donation to the Institut Pasteur for its research into COVID-19, and to  Cochin  public  hospital  in  Paris  for  its  '3D  COVID' project to purchase 60 3D printers in order to rapidly produce large quantities of medical components.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  donation  helped  support  front-line health workers in the United States - and particularly the  hardest  hit  States  -  as  well  as  in  a  number  of regions in Latin America.\n\nIn March,  the  Group  announced  a  donation  of \u20ac2 million to four major Italian hospital foundations, in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio, four regions in which the Group and its Houses have a particularly high profile. Contributions to this donation came from Group's  Italian  Houses  and  those  operating  in  Italy: Gucci,  Bottega  Veneta,  Saint  Laurent,  Balenciaga, Alexander  McQueen,  Brioni,  Pomellato  and  Kering Eyewear.\n\nIn  Italy  again,  Alexander  McQueen,  Pomellato,  Gucci, Bottega  Veneta  and  Saint  Laurent  took  part  in  the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana solidarity project #ItaliaWeAreWithYou,  which  raised  \u20ac3  million  for  the Italian healthcare system.\n\nGucci  responded  to  the  appeal  launched  to  the  fashion industry  by  the  Tuscany  regional  authorities,  supplying 1.1 million surgical masks and 55,000 medical overalls to health  workers.  It  also  donated  \u20ac495,000  to  support UNICEF  and  its  project  for  the  fair  distribution  of  a vaccine  against  COVID-19.  Subsequently,  as  part  of  the 'We  Are  All  In  This  Together'  campaign,  Gucci  donated \u20ac2 million to support two crowdfunding campaigns:\n\n- \u00b7 in  Italy,  the  House  gave  \u20ac1  million  to  support  the country's Civil Protection Department ( Dipartimento della protezione civile ).  The funds were allocated to assist the Italian health services and other organizations working at the heart of the emergency, with a priority  focus  on  increasing  the capacity of intensive care units;\n- \u00b7 on an international scale, Gucci contributed \u20ac1 million to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund,  via  a  Facebook  donations  campaign  to collect USD 10 million.\n\nIn April 2020 in Montebello, Italy, Brioni launched the Filo Rosso campaign,  under  which  60  volunteer employees  made  more  than  92,000  masks.  Around 80,000  of  these  were  given  to  the  Civil  Protection Department for distribution to healthcare institutions and local communities, and the remainder distributed to Brioni employees.\n\nIn the Veneto region of Italy, heavily affected by COVID-19, Kering Eyewear donated to Assindustria Venetocentro ,  an association  for  entrepreneurs  in  Padua  and  Treviso,  to finance the purchase of respirators and other equipment and  help  local  health  services  deal  with  the  emergency situation.\n\nIn  the  United  Kingdom  and  Italy,  Alexander  McQueen provided  support  for  the  Italian  Civil  Protection Department and the British Fashion Council Foundation.\n\nGirard-Perregaux made product donations to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, and in the United States,  it  organized  an  auction  for  the  benefit  of  City Harvest,  New  York's  largest  food  relief  organization, which  saw  rocketing  demand  with  the  onset  of  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 5.4.2.2 Support for women and children\n\nIn  2020,  the  Houses  backed  several  programs  and organizations  working  on  various  aspects  of  support for women and children:\n\n- \u00b7 Brioni  continued  to  run  the  psychological  support and hotline service set up in 2017. Operated by the women's  rights  organization Unione  Donne  Italiane (UDI) in Pescara, the service is open to all employees, with special attention to women . It seeks to promote workforce  well-being  and  provide  employees  with the  right  tools  to  manage  and  defuse  conflicts  and stressful situations. Because of the COVID-19 crisis, in 2020  the  support  component  became  a  telephone service,  with  reach extended to cover all production sites, including Curno, in addition to Penne, Civitella and Montebello.\n- \u00b7 Again in Italy, Pomellato continued its partnership with CADMI, a member of D.i.Re, the nationwide network of organizations offering medical, psychological, emotional  and  legal  assistance  to  women  victims  of violence.  In  response  to  the  rise  in  violence  against women  during  the  lockdown,  in  2020  Pomellato unblocked  \u20ac90,000  in  emergency  funds  and  began  a public campaign to raise funds for D.i.Re and its shelter facilities.  In  France,  the  House  donated  \u20ac40,000  to La Maison  des  Femmes  de  Saint-Denis , which  provides attention,  care,  support  and  guidance  for  victims  of violence.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 With  its  global  Chime  for  Change  campaign,  Gucci continued  to  extend  and  celebrate  the  worldwide community of voices raised on gender equality and personal  expression  by  supporting  projects  such  as UN  Women  in  Brazil  and  Promundo  in  the  United States.  The  House  provided  financial  support  of \u20ac60,000 for the I Was a Sari social enterprise, which recycles  saris  to  produce  quality  fashion  items. Women  from  underprivileged communities in Mumbai  are  trained  in  the  craftsmanship  skills required  to  produce  the  items  by  hand,  and  can therefore acquire financial independence. In addition,  through  the  volunteer  program  Gucci Changemakers,  Gucci  employees  supported  I  Was  a Sari  by  volunteering  time  and  skills  to  create  a  new collection  of  products  made  from  recycled  saris. Some 115 employees made contributions, opening a dozen  or  so  creative  opportunities.  Because  of  the health situation, the program had to be interrupted in  March,  to  be  replaced  where  possible  by  remote sessions supporting local communities and organizations.\n- \u00b7 Boucheron's support for child welfare took the form of assistance for the Sport dans la Ville organization, which uses sport to help young people build  values  for  personal  development  and  open pathways to success.\n- \u00b7 Product  donations  from  Kering  Houses  included Alexander  McQueen's  support  for  Women  for Women  International  (WfWI),  whose  programs provide year-long financial and emotional empowerment  support  to  vulnerable  women  in war-torn regions.\n\n## 5.4.2.3 Diversified resources for education and training\n\nIn  2020,  the  Houses  also  turned  their  attention  to education and training endeavors:\n\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen invested more than \u20ac35,000 in education and training initiatives for young people. For  example,  since  2014,  the  House  has  offered  a yearly  grant  for  study  at  London's  prestigious Central  Saint  Martins  fashion  school.  This  year, Bottega  Veneta  also  financed  grants  for  three students  at  Central  Saint  Martins,  with  funds totaling \u20ac62,000.\n- \u00b7 Gucci Changemakers  continued  its  support  on accelerating  positive  social  change  in  the  industry through community action. This global initiative has three  components:  a  worldwide  Gucci  employee volunteer  program,  the  Gucci  Changemakers  Impact fund,  and  a  student  grant  program.  The  fund\n\nallocated \u20ac825,000 to support 16 non-profit organizations  in  various  communities  in  12  North American towns. Through the student grant program, Gucci provides \u20ac1,237,500 over a four-year period to offer opportunities and fashion industry employment experience  to  a  cross-section  of  young  people. Twenty-two  students  have  already  benefited  from this aid, and applications are open for 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 In the difficult economic  situation  caused  by COVID-19, Boucheron is supporting the French Haute Ecole  de  Joaillerie , a  driving  force  in  developing jewelry practices and training the talents of tomorrow.  Founded  in  1867,  the Haute  Ecole  de Joaillerie is  the  world's  most  prestigious  jewelry schools.  Boucheron's  support  takes  the  form  of  a sponsorship program opening employment prospects  for  the  young  apprentices  trained  there. During the European Heritage Days, Boucheron also opened  the  doors  of  its  historic  Place  Vend\u00f4me boutique  to  offer  high  school  student  visitors insights  into  Haute  Joaillerie  crafts  and  awaken possible vocations.\n- \u00b7 In the  United  States,  Bottega  Veneta  donated \u20ac50,000  to  the  Thurgood  Marshall  College  Fund (TMCF), the largest US  non-profit organization exclusively representing the black college community,  to  help  develop  a  mentoring  program focusing  on  professional  development.  The  House's commitment to supporting education opportunities for  black  and  marginalized  communities  in  the United States also extended to offering its Instagram platform and billboards in Piccadilly Circus (London) and Times Square (New York) to boost the visibility of the TMCF and black community voices.\n\n## 5.4.2.4 Healthcare and disease prevention\n\nHealthcare and disease prevention are further priorities for the Houses. In addition to the exceptional contributions  made  by  the  Group  and  its  Houses  to the  global  fight  against  COVID-19,  support  was  also offered  to  initiatives  and  programs  such  as  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 On October 1, 2020, Balenciaga launched its We Are Pink capsule collection, a series of unisex products created  to  support  research  on  breast  cancer prevention. Ten percent of the income from We Are Pink products will go to funding a research program at the Institut Curie.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  donated  \u20ac111,000  to  the  New  York City  Health  and  Hospitals  Corporation  and  the  Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A donation totaling \u20ac620,000 was made across a selection of local organizations, chosen by  the  Group's  sustainability  experts  on  the  basis  of the  skills  fielded.  In  addition  and  in  line  with  Group strategy, various Houses also supported sustainability and environment initiatives including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga began support on a reforestation project in the Gujarat province of India, in partnership with NGO  Up2Green  Reforestation.  With  a  view  to offsetting  the  House's  residual  carbon  emissions, more than 4,000 fruit trees were planted as part of a project that seeks to improve living conditions for local  communities  and  combat  malnutrition.  The reforestation  project  aims  to  improve  community resilience,  with  a  particular  focus  on  women.  The initiative also includes direct financial aid of \u20ac7,700.\n- \u00b7 In China, Qeelin continued its support for the World Wildlife  Fund  (WWF)  with  donations  of  more  than \u20ac50,000  to  restore  and  protect  ravaged  bamboo forests, the natural habitat of pandas.\n- \u00b7 Gucci entered into a three-year partnership with the Lion's Share (a United Nations Development Programme  Multi-Partner  Trust  Fund),  a  wildlife conservation  and  animal  welfare  fund,  making  an annual donation of USD 150,000.\n\n## 5.4.2.6 Poverty relief\n\nPoverty relief initiatives supported by Kering's Houses in 2020 included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga  continued  its  partnership  with  the  UN World  Food  Programme  (WFP),  which  aims  to  end hunger and achieve food security. This took the form of \u20ac15,000 in donations, together with a promotional campaign  involving  photo  shoots  with  celebrities  in South  Korea  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  WFP's work.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent renewed  its support for NGO charity:  water,  which  works  with  local  associations worldwide to bring safe drinking water supplies to people  in  need.  Over  the  last  three  years,  projects financed by Saint Laurent in Ethiopia, Rwanda and India  have  brought  drinking  water  to  more  than 6,000  people.  The  NGO  received  a  donation  of \u20ac457,000 from Saint Laurent in 2020. Kering, as well as  Saint  Laurent,  has  entered  into  a  multi-year partnership  with  charity:  water.  With  this  support, the organization is financing new-generation sensors  to  ensure  access  to  water  for  vulnerable communities worldwide.\n- \u00b7 In  Japan,  Gucci  donated  more  than  \u20ac50,000  in support  of  UNHCR,  the  United  Nations  Refugee Agency, a global organization dedicated to assisting and protecting refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and helping them return home, integrate local communities or resettle in  other  countries.  These  population  groups  are especially vulnerable and  heavily impacted  by difficulties arising from the COVID-19 crisis.\n- \u00b7 In December 2020, Saint Laurent donated \u20ac100,000 to French charity Restos du C\u0153ur , whose volunteers provide assistance to the underprivileged, especially through  food  aid  and  support  with  social  and economic  integration.  Owing  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic, the beneficiaries of this support included  a  higher  than  usual  proportion  of  young people, deprived of their earnings from student jobs in areas such as recreation and catering.",

These  procedures  were  conducted  for  a selection of contributing entities (3) and covered between 44% and 99% of the consolidated data for the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the company.\n\nWe believe that the procedures we have performed, based on our professional judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for a limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.",

It notably describes membership of the Board of  Directors  and  application  of  the  principle  of balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  on  the Board,  the  conditions  for  preparing  and  organizing work performed by the Board, the Corporate Governance  Code  to  which  the  Company  refers,  and the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors  and  corporate officers,  as  defined  by  the  Board.  In  addition,  this\n\nreport  indicates  any  potential  limitations  set  by  the Board  on  the  powers  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  full  report, including  the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors  and corporate officers, at its meeting on February 16, 2021 in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-37 and L. 225-10-8 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## 1.1 Reference Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code of Listed  Corporations  resulting  from  the  consolidation  of the  October  2003  AFEP  and  MEDEF  reports,  the  January 2007 and October 2008 AFEP-MEDEF recommendations on  company  officer  compensation,  the  April  2010 recommendations  concerning  the  strengthening  of  the representation  of  women  within  boards,  the  June  2013 recommendations  on  'say-on-pay'  shareholder  votes,\n\nstricter 'comply  or  explain'  requirements  and  the establishment  of  the  High  Committee  on  Corporate Governance ( Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  Gouvernement  d'Entreprise ), the November  2016  recommendations  relating  in particular  to  independence,  CSR  and  company  officer compensation,  and  the  June  2018  recommendations relating notably to the tasks of the Board of Directors, as amended on January 30, 2020 (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code').\n\n## 1.2 Combination of management roles\n\nIn  2005,  PPR  adopted  a  governance  structure  with  a Board  of  Directors  and  appointed  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFurther  to  discussions  within  the  Appointments Committee, the Board elected to combine the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and to  renew  this  choice  after  the  Combined  General Meeting  of  June  18,  2013,  when  the  shareholders decided  to  reappoint  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  as  a Director, considering that this arrangement was more in  tune  with  Kering's  specific  characteristics.  The decision  to  combine  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the Board and Chief Executive Officer was considered best suited  to  the  Group's  organization,  modus  operandi and businesses. Following the Annual General Meeting of April 27, 2017, the Board of Directors confirmed its decision  to  appoint  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  as  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  its  decision,  the  Board  took  particular  note  of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's specific position as controlling shareholder and his close involvement in conducting the Group's  business,  of  which  he  has  in-depth  operational knowledge  and  extensive  experience.  The  Board  also\n\nunderlined the benefits of combining management roles in the context of the Group's transformation drive on the grounds  that  this  guarantees  an  effective  strategic decision-making process, enables the Group's economic and financial performance to be optimized, and ensures strong, consistent communication.\n\nThis  arrangement  is  also  aligned  with  the  Group's shareholder structure, which includes individual share ownership, a controlling shareholder and institutional shareholders,  all  of  whom  have  a  stake  in  Kering's long-term development.\n\nFran\u00e7ois  Pinault,  founder  of  the  Group,  is  Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors, but is not a Director.\n\nIn  addition,  given  that  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the Board and Chief Executive Officer are combined and to provide  additional  assurance  with  regard  to  the Board's  smooth  operation  and  balance  of  power,  the Board of Directors decided at its meeting  of February  11,  2019,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  to  create the role of Lead Independent Director, with the duties described in section 1.5 of this chapter.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Complementary nature of the duties of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nPursuant  to  a  decision  made  on  February  26,  2008, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Palus,  at  that  time  PPR  Chief  Financial Officer, was appointed Group Managing Director. At the Combined  General  Meetings  of  June  18,  2013  and April  27,  2017,  the  shareholders  twice  decided  to reappoint  him  as  a  Director  for  four  years.  At  their meetings  held  subsequent  to  each  of  the  Combined General Meetings, the Board of Directors also decided to  reappoint  him  as  Group  Managing  Director  for  the same  period,  acting  on  a  recommendation  of  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAlongside  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer, the Group Managing Director is directly responsible for operations at several of Kering's Houses and participates actively in defining the Group's overall strategy.\n\nIn  his  capacity  as  Group  Managing  Director  and  in compliance with the authorizations expressly granted to  the  Group  Managing  Director  by  the  Board  of Directors  pursuant  to  the  Company's  Articles  of Association,  the  Board  has  granted  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus the same  powers  of  representation  and commitment  with  regard  to  third  parties  as  those conferred upon the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 1.4 Balance of power on the Board of Directors\n\nWith  a  view  to  achieving  and  maintaining  an appropriate balance of power on its Board, the Group strives to ensure that membership is suitably balanced and diverse. Members of the Board have backgrounds in  a  variety  of  industries  and  are  mainly independent (seven out of the twelve Board members, including the Lead Independent Director, are classified as independent  Directors,  not  including  the  Directors representing  employees).  Nine  women  sit  on  the Board.  This  proportion  exceeds  the  requirements  set out  in  France's  Cop\u00e9-Zimmerman  law,  which  states that at least 40% of Board members must be women.\n\nThe  operating  rules  and  procedures  of  the  Board  of Directors  are  defined  by  law  and  the  Company's Articles of Association, along with the internal rules of the  Board  and  its  four  specialized  Committees,  as described in section 2 of this chapter:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee;\n- \u00b7 Appointments and Governance Committee;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe  specific  provisions  of  the  Company's  Articles  of Association  regarding  Directors  are  in  line  with  basic legal requirements. There are special provisions for the term of office of Directors (four years, renewable), the age limit (no more than one-third of the Directors may be  over  70),  the  Directors  representing  employees (one  appointed  by  the  Kering  Social  and  Economic Committee  and  the  other  by  the  European  Works Council) and the minimum number of shares (50) that must be owned by each Director, except the Directors representing employees, in accordance with Article L. 225-25 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  a  streamlined  renewal  process  for membership  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  the Combined  General  Meeting  of  May  7,  2009  the shareholders chose to introduce a staggered procedure for reappointing Directors.\n\nDirectors are expected to be diligent and fully committed to  the  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees,  which benefit from the diverse backgrounds, skills and expertise of their members. Directors with in-depth, long-standing knowledge  of  the  Group  are  a  perfect  complement  to newly appointed Directors, who bring a fresh perspective on the Group and help it evolve.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  legal  provisions  governing  the authorizations  that  must  be  granted  by  the  Board (related-party agreements, endorsements, suretyships and guarantees, divestments of shareholdings or sale of real estate, etc.), Article 15 of the Company's Articles of  Association  states  that  the  following  decisions require the prior approval of the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 matters  and  transactions  that  have  a  substantive effect on the strategy of the Company or the Kering group  more  generally,  its  financial  structure  or  its scope of business activity;\n- \u00b7 except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual General  Meeting,  issues  of  securities  of  all  types, that  are  liable  to  cause  a  change  in  the  share capital;\n- \u00b7 the  following  transactions  by  the  Company  or  by any entity controlled by the Group, insofar as they each exceed \u20ac500 million, an amount set annually by the Board of Directors:\n- - all  investments  or  divestments,  including  the acquisition,  sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all existing or future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Group real estate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  assesses the position of the Directors with regard to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe  internal  rules  are  revised  on  a  regular  basis  to bring  them  into  line  with  changes  in  governance recommendations and practices.\n\nThe  internal  rules  are  published  in  full  on  the Company's website.\n\nAs  indicated  above,  each  Committee  has  its  own internal  rules,  which  are  updated  on  a  regular  basis. The most recent update concerned the internal rules of the Audit Committee, which now includes rules for the  approval  of  non-audit  services  that  may  be provided by Statutory Auditors or their networks.\n\nAll  Directors  are  entitled  to  attend,  without  voting rights,  particular  meetings  of  Committees  of  which they are not members, if they so wish.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  every  three  years  the  Board  of Directors appoints an independent expert to carry out a  formal  assessment.  Each  year,  the  Board  also organizes  a  discussion  on  its  work.  This  annual assessment  by  the  Board  concerns  its  membership, organization  and  operation.  It  takes  place  in  two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 a questionnaire is issued to each Director;\n- \u00b7 each Director meets with the Chairman of the Board or a person designated by the Chairman, using the questionnaire as the starting point for discussions.\n\nAt  the  end  of  these  meetings,  the  Directors  set  new objectives for improving the quality of their organization and ensure that all important issues have been suitably prepared and addressed.\n\nTo ensure the balance of power among the Company's governance  bodies,  meetings  are  organized  without the executive corporate officers at least once a year, in line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nIn  addition,  at  the  initiative  of  its  Board  of  Directors and in order to promote long-term value creation and establish  and  maintain  dialogue  on  environmental, social  and  governance  (ESG)  issues,  the  Company  is increasingly  seeking  to  meet  with  its  shareholders. From November 16 to 24, 2020, an ESG roadshow was held with various institutional  investors,  representing around  32.4%  of  the  free  float  (18.8%  of  total  share capital).  The  presentation  used  at  the  roadshow  is available from the Company's website.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are  described  in section 2.2 of this chapter.\n\n## 1.5 Role and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director\n\n## 1.5.1 Appointment of the Lead Independent Director\n\nIn  light  of  recent  changes  to  the  membership  of  the Board of Directors and following a discussion with the Company's  shareholders  in  late  2018,  the  Board  of Directors  decided  to  include  a  Lead  Independent Director  in  its  membership  to  provide  additional assurance with regard to the Board's smooth operation and balance of power.\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments and Governance  Committee,  at  its meeting  of February 11, 2019, the Board of Directors created the role  of  Lead  Independent  Director  and  appointed Sophie L'H\u00e9lias to carry out that role.\n\n## 1.5.2 Lead Independent Director's responsibilities and powers\n\n## Organization of the work of the Board of Directors and relationship with Directors\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 is  consulted on the agenda and schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman;\n- \u00b7 acts as a liaison between the independent Directors, other  Board  members and Executive Management. This  includes  maintaining  regular,  open  dialogue with each of the Directors, particularly the independent Directors, and organizing at least one meeting  per  year  without  the  executive  corporate officers;",

The  Board  has  the  resources  to  freely  discuss  all matters that concern it, particularly issues relating to the  Group's  strategies,  the  implementation  of  those strategies and their follow-up. The Directors also have all of the information needed to freely make informed decisions  and  help  Executive  Management  draw  up meeting agendas.\n\nThe Board may call on any advisors or consultants to obtain  an  independent  expert  opinion  on  any  topics presented to it by the Company.\n\nThe  Board  can  meet  with  Group  senior  executives  at certain  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  its Committees.\n\nEach Director is also entitled, if they so wish, to meet the Group's senior executives outside these meetings in  order  to  gain  a  better  insight  into  the  Group's businesses or certain operational issues.\n\nThe Board's membership and role ensures that it acts in  compliance  with  the  Group's  best  interests  at  all times.  It  provides  a  platform  for  reflection  and  is  an invaluable source of support for Executive Management,  while  ensuring  that  it  protects  the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nAs  part  of  the  regular  procedure  for  reviewing agreements,  including  those  entered  into  in  the ordinary  course  of  business  and  at  arm's  length conditions,  as  described  in  section  2.2.1  of  this chapter, the Directors may be required to consult the Legal  Department  and,  where  necessary,  the  Finance Department.\n\n## 2 MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND INFORMATION ON DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS\n\n## 2.1 Membership of the Board of Directors as of February 16, 2021\n\nThe  Board  is  composed  of  Directors  with  wide  and diversified experience, relating in particular to corporate  strategy,  finance,  governance,  insurance, economics,  corporate  social  responsibility,  the  retail sector, industry, accounting, management and supervision of commercial and financial corporations. The  Articles  of  Association  provide  for  a  renewable four-year term of office for Directors.\n\nIn  order  to  avoid  reappointing  the  entire  Board simultaneously  and  to  facilitate  a  smooth  renewal process,  at  the  Combined  General  Meeting  held  on May 7, 2009 the shareholders adopted an amendment to  Article  10  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association introducing  a  staggered  procedure  for  reappointing Directors.\n\nAfter reviewing the Board of Directors' report and the favorable opinion issued by the Company's Social and Economic Committee, the shareholders decided at the General Meetings of May 6, 2014 and June 16, 2020 to amend Article 10 of the Articles of Association in order to  establish  the  procedure  for  appointing  Directors representing employees in accordance with the French law dated June 14, 2013 in relation to job security.\n\nOn  February  16,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  was composed of fourteen  members,  seven  of  whom  are independent  Directors  according  to  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code and the Board of Directors' criteria (see  section  2.2.5  of  this  chapter),  and  two  of  whom were  appointed  to  represent  employees,  one  by Kering's Social and Economic Committee and the other by the European Works Council.",

Subject  to  the  powers  expressly granted  to  Annual  General  Meetings  and  within  the limit  of  the  corporate  purpose,  the  Board  reviews  all issues concerning the smooth running of the Company and acts on all matters over which it has authority.\n\nThe Board carries out the controls and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nIn compliance with AMF recommendation no. 2012-05, the Board has adopted internal guidelines on the identification, control and evaluation of  related-party  and  ordinary  agreements,  allowing  it to ensure that agreements entered into in the ordinary course  of  business  and  at  arm's  length  conditions effectively  meet  the  required  criteria,  in  accordance with  Article  L.  22-10-12  of  the  French  Commercial Code.\n\nIn  addition  to  reiterating  the  regulations  applicable  to the identification and classification of related-party and ordinary  agreements  (notably  by  the  Company's  Legal Department,  with  the  assistance,  where  necessary,  of the Finance Department), the guidelines also provide for the regular control and evaluation of related-party and ordinary  agreements  by  the  Audit  Committee  and  the Board of Directors. Anyone directly or indirectly involved in an agreement cannot participate in its evaluation.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors are defined by law, the Company's Articles of Association, the internal rules of the Board and the work of its specialized Committees. The  Board  has  established  internal  rules  for  each Committee.\n\nUnder  its  internal  rules  and  by  law,  the  Board  of Directors  meets  at  least  four  times  a  year.  To  allow Directors  to  prepare  in  the  best  possible  way  for  the topics to be examined  during  the  meeting,  a comprehensive pack of information is sent to them in due  time  ahead  of  the  meeting;  it  includes  the necessary information on all items on the agenda.",

        "page_content": "In  line  with  the  relevant  regulatory  requirements,  the internal rules also set the rules applicable to Directors in relation to restrictions on trading in the securities of the Company, or more generally the Group, by establishing black-out periods:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Directors  must  refrain  from  trading  directly  or indirectly  in  the  listed  securities  and  financial instruments  of  the  Company  and  the  Group  for  a period  of  30  calendar  days  preceding  each  of  the periodic  publications  relating  to  the  annual  and half-year  consolidated  financial  statements  and 15  calendar  days  preceding  each  of  the  quarterly publications  relating  to  consolidated  revenue  and ending at the close of the trading day following the publication of the relevant official press release. In no way does this black-out period replace the legal and regulatory provisions regarding insider trading with which each member of the Board must comply at  the  time  they  decide  to  trade,  no  matter  when this  might  occur  outside  the  defined  black-out periods;\n- \u00b7 the same obligations apply to each Director insofar as  they  have  knowledge  of  inside  information.  In compliance  with  current  regulations,  the  internal rules  also  require  Directors  to  declare  trading  in these securities.\n\nThe internal rules set the frequency and conditions of Board meetings and provide for meeting participation by videoconference and/or conference call.\n\nThey also establish the principle of regular assessment of the functioning of the Board and set the terms and conditions by which Directors' remuneration is allocated.\n\nAccording to the internal rules, Directors are required to inform the Chairman of the Board of any conflicts of interest, even potential conflicts, between their duties towards  the  Company  and  their  private  interests and/or  other  duties,  and  they  may  not  vote  on  any matters that concern them directly or indirectly.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  may  ask  the Directors at any time for a written statement confirming that they do not have any conflicts of interest.\n\nTo  reinforce  its  methods  of  functioning  and  in  the interests of good governance, the internal rules of the Board of Directors set forth and formally lay down the rules governing the organization and operating methods of  the  Board  as  well  as  the  role  of  its  four  specialized Committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Appointments and Governance Committee, and the Sustainability Committee.\n\nExecutive  Management  may  in  all  circumstances  be heard within said Committees.\n\n## Diversity policy for the Group's management bodies\n\nThe Board sets gender diversity targets for the Group's management  bodies,  on  the  recommendation  of Executive Management. The diversity principles applied  to  membership  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are also  applied  more  broadly  across  the  Group  via  a gender  diversity  policy  for  its  management  bodies. Pursuant to this policy, women accounted for 33% of Kering's Executive Committee members as of the date of this report.\n\nThe  appointment  on  October  1,  2019  of  a  Chief Diversity,  Inclusion  and  Talent  Officer,  reporting  to  the Chief People Officer, marked a new milestone in Kering's commitment to accelerating and expanding its actions in  support  of  diversity,  equality  and  inclusion  -  in  the broadest sense of the term. In addition, in line with the Group's 2025 sustainability strategy, a criterion in favor of diversity in the workforce, with a particular emphasis on  achieving  gender  balance,  is  taken  into  account  in determining  the  annual  and  multi-annual  variable remuneration  of  the  Group's  executive  corporate officers.  This  criterion  is  described  in  section  4  of  this chapter.\n\nGoing further than its commitment  to social responsibility,  the  Group  believes  that  diversity  and inclusion is a source of creativity and innovation, and as such of economic performance. This is why Kering makes every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization. As part of its sustainability  strategy,  Kering  has  set  a  target  of achieving a balanced gender mix and equal pay at all levels of the organization by 2025.\n\nKering has defined and put in place an action plan to achieve a balanced gender mix - especially within the Group's management (Top 450 roles) - by 2025. This will notably involve:\n\n- \u00b7 measuring  the  representation  of  women  in  talent pools and succession plans;\n- \u00b7 integrating gender equality in the recruitment process;\n- \u00b7 monitoring promotions within the Group by gender and management level;\n- \u00b7 measuring gender parity at each management level on a quarterly basis in all Houses using key indicators.\n\nThe  means  put  in  place  to  achieve  these  objectives include:\n\n- \u00b7 encouraging participation in women's leadership programs;\n- \u00b7 introducing  a  mentoring  program  for  women  at the international level;\n- \u00b7 the employee training program;\n- \u00b7 the global parental policy;\n- \u00b7 giving  women the opportunity to have their say via  the  Diversity  &  Inclusion  Committees  put  in place at all of the Group's Houses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to their ability to act in the interest of all shareholders, the Directors are also chosen  for  their  expertise,  experience  and understanding  of  the  strategic  challenges  in  the market in which the Group operates. The membership of  the  Board  of  Directors  must  be  as  diverse  as possible, with a wide range of technical skills.\n\nThe Board of Directors first considers how it wishes its membership to evolve in the short and medium term, particularly by assessing the skills it wishes to bring to\n\nthe Board, and by taking into account the findings of the  external  assessment  of  the  Board's  work  carried out  every  three  years  by  an  external  consultant responsible  for  mapping  expertise  and  identifying possible needs.\n\nAccordingly, with the support of Executive Management and the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board defines diversity objectives for its members in terms of  nationality,  independence,  representation  between men  and  women,  cultural  origin,  expertise  and  seniority, with  the  aim  of  achieving  a  balanced  representation  of Directors with complementary backgrounds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFor  this  purpose,  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee  has  established  a  procedure  for  selecting future members of the Board of Directors. The procedure reflects the Board of Directors' focus on its membership and particularly on the diversity of its members, which is a source of creativity and performance.\n\nAccordingly,  when  considering  potential  profiles  for appointment  as  Director,  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee should discuss the experience, expertise, special skills  and talents of each candidate in relation to the objectives and characteristics of the diversity policy for members of the Board of Directors, particularly  in  terms  of  nationality,  representation between  men  and  women,  cultural  origin,  expertise and seniority.\n\nWhen a seat falls vacant or, more generally, when the Board has expressed its intention to appoint additional members or change its membership, this information is reviewed again.\n\n## 2.2.3 Executive Management\n\nAfter the Combined General Meeting on May 19, 2005, when  the  shareholders  adopted  the  new  Articles  of Association of Kering (then PPR), introducing governance  by  a  Board  of  Directors,  the  Board  of Directors  opted  to  combine  the  duties  of  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and maintained this option in  May  2009.  This  choice  has  contributed  to  efficient governance  in  light  of  the  organization  of  the  Kering group,  within  which  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  is  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Kering,  the Group's parent  company.  He  is  related  to  the controlling shareholder, is closely involved in conducting  the  Group's  business,  and  has  specific operational knowledge and in-depth experience of this business.  At  the  proposal  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Board  of  Directors  appointed  a Group  Managing  Director  ( Directeur  g\u00e9n\u00e9ral  d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ) whose term of office  was  renewed  on  April  27,  2017 and who has the same powers with regard to dealings with  third  parties  as  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  The Group Managing Director was appointed as a Director at the Combined General Meeting on May 7, 2009 for a four-year term, renewed on April 27, 2017 for another four years.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Group Managing Director both participate, on an equal footing, in the work of the Board of Directors, 58% of whose members are independent Directors. The Board operates  smoothly  as  a  result  of  frequent  meetings, the regular attendance of its members, the assistance of  its  specialized  Committees,  and  the  presence  of  a Lead Independent Director.\n\n## 2.2.4 Limitations by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  statutory role  of  determining  the  business  orientation  of  the Company  and  ensuring  its  implementation,  and without prejudice to the legal provisions governing the authorizations  that  must  be  granted  by  the  Board (related-party agreements, endorsements, suretyships and guarantees, divestments of shareholdings or sales of real estate, etc.), the Company's  Articles  of Association provide that certain decisions of the Chief Executive  Officer  and  Group  Managing  Director,  by virtue of their nature or significance, require the prior approval of the Board of Directors:\n\n- a) matters and transactions that have a substantive effect  on  the  strategy  of  the  Group,  its  financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- b) except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual General  Meeting,  issues  of  securities  of  all  types, that  are  liable  to  cause  a  change  in  the  share capital;\n- c) the following transactions by the Company or any entity  controlled  by  the  Group,  insofar  as  they each exceed an amount set annually by the Board of Directors (\u20ac500 million in 2020):\n- - all  investments  or  divestments,  including  the acquisition,  sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all existing or future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Company real estate.\n\nThese  transactions  are  regularly  submitted  to  the Board of Directors, which examines them carefully.\n\n## 2.2.5 Director independence\n\nIn order to assess the independence of a Director and to  avoid  possible  risks  of  conflicts  of  interest,  the Board applies the criteria defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, whereby a Director cannot:\n\n- \u00b7 be an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company, or have been in such position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be  an  employee,  executive  corporate  officer  or Director  of  the  Company's  parent  company  or  of  a company that the latter consolidates, or have been in such a position in the past five years;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 be  an  executive  corporate  officer  of  a  company  in which the Company holds a directorship, directly or indirectly,  or  in  which  an  employee  appointed  as such  or  a  Director  or  corporate  officer  of  the Company  (currently  in  office  or  having  held  office within the past five years) is a Director;\n- \u00b7 be  a  significant  customer,  supplier,  investment banker  or  commercial  banker  of  the  Company  or the Group, or for which the Company or the Group represents a significant portion of the activity;\n- \u00b7 have  any  close  family  ties  with  a  Director  or corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 have  been  the  auditor  of  the  Company  within  the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be  a  Director  of  the  Company  for  more  than twelve  years,  the  maximum  period  for  which  a Director is considered independent.\n\nEach year, the Appointments and Governance Committee reviews the independence of each Director in light of the criteria  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  In  reviewing independence  with  regard  to  the  direct  or  indirect business  relationship  criteria,  an  additional  quantitative and  qualitative  analysis  is  performed,  if  necessary,  in order  to  determine  the  independence  of  individual Directors where any such business relationship exists.\n\nIn 2020, further to a review by the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors meticulously analyzed - along with all other criteria any business relationships that may exist between the Kering  group  and  the  entities  or  groups  in  which independent Directors exercise their duties. Based on the Board's analysis, with the exception of Yseulys Costes, no independent Directors and none of the  entities  or  groups  in  which  they  exercise  their duties have a business relationship with the Company, its  Group  or  its  management  team.  The  Board  of Directors  carried  out  a  qualitative  and  quantitative review  of  the  situation  of  Yseulys  Costes,  Chair  and Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Numberly  (1000mercis Group), along with the business relationships existing between Numberly (1000mercis Group) and Kering in 2020.  Global  business  between  these  two  companies for  all  activities  and  for  each  of  the  parties  is  well below the 1% materiality threshold set by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore considers Yseulys Costes to be an independent Director, particularly because there is  no  relationship  of  economic  dependence  on  either side,  and  sees  value  in  continuing  to  benefit  from  her renowned expertise.\n\nThe Board of Directors applied the same qualitative and quantitative review process to the situation of Emma Watson. As a result of a partnership entered into between  Emma  Watson  and  the  Group,  and  acting further to a review by the Appointments and Governance Committee  on  July  24,  2020,  the  Board  had  deemed  it inappropriate  to  consider  this  Director  as  independent. Since the partnership was not finally implemented, acting on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee, at its meeting of February  16,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  ultimately considered Emma Watson as independent, as there was no business relationship between the Kering group and this Director.\n\nAs of the date of this report on corporate governance, seven  of  the  twelve (1) Directors  serving  on  the  Board are therefore classified as independent: Yseulys  Costes,  Daniela  Riccardi,  Sophie  L'H\u00e9lias, Ginevra Elkann, Jean Liu, Emma  Watson  and Tidjane Thiam. The Group thus satisfies the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  namely that 'at least one-third' of Board members should be independent  Directors  in  companies  with  controlling shareholders, which is the case for Kering.\n\n## 2.2.6 Succession plan\n\nIn collaboration with the Company's management, the Appointments and Governance Committee periodically reviews  the  succession  plan  for  the  Group's  senior executives and for current or prospective members of its Executive Committee. This allows it to establish and update  a  succession  plan  that  covers  different  time frames:\n\n- \u00b7 short  term:  unplanned  succession  (resignation, death, sudden inability to perform role);\n- \u00b7 medium term: accelerated succession (performance problem, management error);\n- \u00b7 long  term:  planned  succession  (retirement,  end  of term of office).\n\nThe overall coherence of the succession plan and the monitoring  of  key  positions  is  ensured  by  the  joint efforts of the Appointments and Governance Committee and  the  Company's  management.  The  effectiveness  of the approach has been demonstrated, when the arrival of executives or Creative Directors of certain Houses has led  to  a  rebound  or  an  acceleration  in  organic  growth for the Houses concerned.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee continues  to  apply  the  same  method  to  prepare  a succession plan for the Executive Committee and for a certain  number  of  key  positions  within  the  Group.  In addition,  the  Company's  management  continued  the process  for  defining  a  management  succession  plan, which  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee in 2021. The method selected\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first involves determining the potential  changes  in  governance  that  would  be required  in  the  event  of  a  change  at  the  Company's helm,  based  on  an  extensive  study  of  organizational practices  in  the  industry  and  among  Kering's  CAC  40 peers.  The  next  phase  involves  identifying  the  key characteristics  required  to  implement  the  strategic plan  defined  by  the  Board  and  the  principles  that govern  the  relationship  between  the  Corporate  and House teams. This will serve as the groundwork for the final  phase,  which  consists  in  drawing  up  a  list  of potential candidates.\n\n## 2.2.7 Director induction and training\n\nUpon  joining  the  Board,  new  Directors  may  receive training  adapted  to  their  specific  needs  within  the Board,  should  they  deem  it  necessary.  Meetings  are organized  with  the  Group  Managing  Director  and  with the Group's executive corporate officers to give them an insight into the Group and into each of its businesses.\n\nIn 2020,  the  new  Directors  (Concetta  Battaglia, Jean  Liu,  Tidjane  Thiam  and  Emma  Watson)  all attended information meetings organized by the Chief\n\nFinancial  Officer,  the  Internal  Audit  Director  and  the Chief  Sustainability  Officer  on  the  Group's  businesses and other topics specific to their duties as Directors.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  French  law no. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 on business growth and transformation  (known  as  the  PACTE  law)  on  the  time needed  for  Directors  representing  employees  to  carry out their duties and the basis for their instruction within the Company, the Board of Directors decided (i) to allow Directors  representing  employees  sufficient  time  to prepare for each Board meeting and (ii) to provide them with  a  minimum  of  40  hours'  instruction  per  year during their term of office. In this respect, since joining Kering's Board of Directors, Claire Lacaze has attended a training  course  organized  by  the  French  Institute  of Directors ( Institut Fran\u00e7ais des Administrateurs - IFA), as well as internal training sessions given by some of the Company's  functional  divisions.  The  second  Director representing employees, Concetta Battaglia, has not yet received  any  training  since  joining  the  Board  of Directors  on  October  22,  2020.  However,  pending  this training and  to  familiarize  her  with  the  Board's particular  characteristics,  she  has  met  with  the  Group Managing Director,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and the Board secretary on several occasions.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board's  work  is  assessed  regularly,  as described in section 2.3.2 of this chapter.\n\n## 2.3 Activity of the Board of Directors and its specialized Committees\n\n## 2.3.1 Activity of the Board of Directors in 2020 and up to February 16, 2021\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors in 2020\n\nDuring 2020, the Board met eleven times with an average attendance rate of 97%. The Chairman of the Board chaired all Board meetings.\n\n## Agenda and attendance rate of Board of Directors' meetings\n\n| Date              | Main items on the agenda                                                           | Attendance rate   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| February 11, 2020 | Report on the work of the Remuneration and Appointments and  Governance Committees | 100%              |\n|                   | Total remuneration awarded to Directors                                            |                   |\n|                   | Management Report and the report on corporate governance                           |                   |\n|                   | Assessment of the Board's work                                                     |                   |\n|                   | Review and approval of the 2019 financial statements                               |                   |\n|                   | Report on the work of the Audit Committee                                          |                   |\n|                   | Statutory Auditors' report                                                         |                   |\n|                   | Proposed appropriation of net income/dividend amount/payment date                  |                   |\n|                   | Related-party agreements                                                           |                   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The relevant Committee Chair reports on these preliminary meetings at each Board meeting.\n\nIn addition,  at  the  Lead  Independent  Director's initiative, members of the Board met several times in 2020,    during  individual  meetings  and  interviews, without  the  Company's  executive  corporate  officers (the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Group Managing Director).\n\nTo  maintain  ongoing  dialogue  with  its  investors,  the Company  continued  to  organize  meetings  with  its shareholders  and  other  members  of  the  financial community in 2020.\n\nAt the initiative of its Board of Directors, the Company has strengthened dialogue with investors since 2018, particularly  on  governance  issues.  Given  that  the approach was unanimously applauded by the investors  involved,  this  approach  was  pursued  in  the subsequent  years,  broadening  the  scope  to  include environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  issues.  A roadshow  program  dedicated  to  ESG  matters  was therefore  prepared  by  the  Lead  Independent  Director (whose role is described in detail in section 1.5 of this chapter),  with  support  from  the  Board  secretary,  the Chief Sustainability Officer and  the  Director  of Financial  Communications  and  Market  Intelligence. The program is described in section 1.4 of this chapter.\n\n- 266\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors in 2021, up to February 16\n\nSince  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors has  met  once,  on  February  16,  2021,  to  approve  the 2020  annual  financial  statements  and  reports  to  be submitted  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting,  as  well  as this  report.  It  also  heard  a  report  on  the  Group's financial position. The  Board  then  granted  and allocated  the  Directors'  remuneration  for  2020  in accordance  with  the  criteria  adopted  in  March  2014 and  amended  on  February  11,  2020,  taking  into account the decisions taken by the Board of Directors at its meeting on April 21, 2020.\n\nIn  addition,  at  this  meeting,  the  Board  defined  the diversity policy applicable to the Group's management bodies,  by  setting  diversity  objectives,  the  method  to implement  them,  and  the  time  horizon  to  achieve them.\n\n## 2.3.2 Assessment of the Board of Directors' work\n\nSince  2004,  in  accordance  with  its  internal  rules,  the Board  of  Directors  has  dedicated  one  item  on  its agenda,  at  least  once  a  year,  to  a  discussion  of  its work. Every three years, this discussion is backed up by a  formal  assessment  of  the  Board,  carried  out  by  an independent member or a third-party expert.\n\nAn assessment of this kind, conducted by a third-party expert  with  recognized  experience  in  the  governance of boards of directors of listed companies, was carried out in 2019.\n\nIn  2020,  Sophie  L'H\u00e9lias  carried  out  an  internal assessment of the Board of Directors' work based on a detailed  questionnaire  sent  to  the  members  of  the Board,  followed  by  individual  interviews  with  each Director.  She  reported  on  the  conclusions  of  this assessment to the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 16, 2021. Overall, the summary presented by the Lead Independent Director revealed a very positive view  of  how  the  Board  operates.  In  particular,  the Board  members  commended  the  designation  of  a Lead Independent Director to promote sound governance, the relationship of trust established with Executive Management  and  the  quality  of  the Committees'  work.  In  addition,  the  Board  members continued to support access to management regardless of the position and would like initiatives in this  area  to  be  pursued.  There  was  also  positive feedback on the quality of the documents supplied to them,  the  training  given  at  the  year-end  meeting without  the  executive  corporate  officers,  and  the assistance provided to them.",

The Committee is notified of the main issues identified by the Kering group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  reports  to  the  Board  on  a  regular basis and provides it with opinions or recommendations on all matters within its scope of duties. Meetings of the Audit  Committee  give  rise  to  a  written  and  approved report.\n\n67 % of independent Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n96 % Attendance rate\n\nin 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee may call on external experts and hear any person.\n\nEach year, it reviews the fees charged by the Company's Statutory  Auditors  and  assesses  their  independence. The  Committee  also  considers  potential  Statutory Auditors for appointment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Committee  issues  recommendations to  the  Board  of  Directors  in  relation  to  the  regular assessment of the terms of the Group's related-party and  ordinary  agreements.  In  this  context,  it  reviews payments  made  under  the  agreement  entered  into between Kering and Art\u00e9mis (described in Note 34 to the consolidated financial statements, included in this document), as well as any changes in such payments, on an annual basis.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  all  have recognized  financial  or  accounting  skills,  combining their expertise in general and operational management of banks  and  businesses  as  confirmed  by  their professional careers (see section 2.1 of this chapter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  this  Annual  General Meeting,  which  will  be  held  in  2022,  it  will  not  be possible  to  propose  the  reappointment  of  KPMG  SA, the  firm  having  reached  the  maximum  engagement period for Statutory Auditors according to the transitory  provisions  of  the  EU  Audit  Regulation  (the first appointment of KPMG SA dating back to 1992).\n\nFor the purpose of effectively managing the transition between  KPMG  and  a  new  audit  firm,  as  well  as avoiding  the  risk  that  a  firm  accepts  an  engagement that is incompatible with the performance of its duties prior  to  its  appointment,  it  was  decided  to  launch  a tender to identify the firm that would replace KPMG as from 2022, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\nOn February 6, 2020, the methodology and timetable of the tender were presented to the Audit Committee, which approved the main principles.\n\nThe  tender  took  place  from  May  to  October  2020  in compliance  with  the  specifications  reviewed  by  the Audit  Committee  on  June  4,  2020  and  sent  to  four major  audit  firms  (EY,  Grant  Thornton,  Mazars  and PwC).  Meetings  were  organized  with  Kering's  senior managers to give  these  firms  a  better  understanding of  the  Group's  main  financial  issues  as  well  as  its  IT and  internal  control  environment.  Following  this process,  the  firms  were  invited  to  formally  present their bids.\n\nA  Selection  Committee, comprising the Internal Audit Director,  the  Head  of  the  Legal  Department,  the Financial  Control  Director  and  the  Chief  Financial Officer,  met  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  responses received  based  on  12  criteria,  only  one  of  which concerned the amount of fees.\n\nThe Selection Committee recommended that the two highest  rated  firms  meet  with  the  Group  Managing Director and the Audit Committee.\n\nAfter these meetings, which were held in November  2020,  a  consensus  was  reached  to designate  the  firm  to  be  proposed  as  the  Group's Statutory  Auditor  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  in 2022.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit Committee submitted the conclusions of the tender to each member of the Audit Committee  in  December  2020.  The  topic  was  then included  as  an  item  on  the  agenda  of  the  Audit Committee's meeting of February 11, 2021 to confirm the  choice  and  enable  the  Finance  Department  to organize the transition year.\n\n## Activity of the Audit Committee in 2020 and up to February 16, 2021\n\nThe  Committee  met  four  times  in  2020,  with  an average attendance rate of 96%.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Group Internal  Audit  Director  were  regularly  invited  to present their work and answer questions at meetings of the Committee.\n\nOn  January  14,  2020,  the  Audit  Committee  reviewed Internal Audit activities (audit engagements and action plan tracking) and Group risk exposure, and heard the Internal Audit Director's presentation of the 2020 audit plan. With a view to submitting its recommendations to  the  Board  of  Directors,  it  also  reviewed  the accounting options for the annual financial statements,  the  off-balance  sheet  commitments,  the scope  of  the  Statutory  Auditors'  engagement,  the independence  of  the  Statutory  Auditors,  and  their general program for audit work. A progress report on the  initiatives  being  undertaken  to  comply  with  the European  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR) was also presented to the Committee, before a review of  the  guidelines  on  the  identification,  control  and evaluation of related-party and ordinary agreements.\n\nOn February 6, 2020, the Committee met prior to the Board  meeting  held  to  adopt  the  2019  financial statements,  a  topic  to  which  it  devoted  most  of  its work (with a presentation of the financial statements by  the  Group  Chief  Financial  Officer),  and  heard  the Statutory  Auditors  in  relation  to  their  reports  on  the financial statements.  It  also  discussed  disputes, reviewed the services provided by Art\u00e9mis in 2019, and approved  the  report  on  corporate  governance  for 2019.  In  addition,  the  Committee  discussed  the Group's  financing  and  cash  management  and  the performance of the Kering share.",

The remuneration  policy  for  all  corporate  officers  is  an integral part of Kering's report on corporate governance.\n\n## 4.1 Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director (executive corporate officers) for 2021, subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of April 22, 2021 ( ex-ante vote)\n\nActing  on  a  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee, on February 16, 2021, the Board of Directors approved  the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director for 2021.\n\nIn compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 22-10-8 and R. 22-10-14 of the French Commercial Code, the 2021  remuneration  policy  described  below  includes the  general  principles  and  criteria  for  determining, allocating  and  awarding  the  fixed,  variable  and exceptional components making up total remuneration  and  benefits  in  kind  granted  to executive corporate officers in respect of their duties. It will be submitted to the approval of the shareholders at Kering's Annual General Meeting, to be held on April 22, 2021.\n\n## 4.1.1 General principles of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nThe  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  executive corporate officers is defined by the Board of Directors, based  on  recommendations  from  the  Remuneration Committee, and approved each year by the shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting.  The remuneration structure and the criteria on which it is based  are  defined  and  modified  over  time  to  ensure that  the  amounts  paid  are  closely  aligned  with  the extent  to  which  the  Group's  strategic  financial  and non-financial objectives have been met.\n\nA  large  proportion  of  the  remuneration  of  executive corporate officers is subject to performance conditions (77% for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 72%  for  the  Group  Managing  Director),  reflecting  their obligation to create medium- and long-term value.\n\nThe  variable  portion  of  executive  corporate  officers' remuneration  is  subject  to  performance  conditions relating  to  financial  criteria  as  well  as  corporate  social responsibility, reflecting the Group's ambitious objectives in  these areas, and encouraging the executive corporate officers  to  base  their  decisions  and  actions  on  ensuring long-term profitability.\n\nThe decision approved at the Annual General Meeting of  June  16,  2020  to  replace  Kering  Monetary  Units (KMUs)  with  performance  shares  in  the  long-term incentive  component  of  executive  corporate  officers' remuneration  illustrates  the  Group's  desire  to  make the  alignment  between  executive  remuneration  and shareholder interests even clearer.\n\nThe  performance  criteria  for  the  executive  corporate officers' annual and multi-annual variable remuneration are  clear,  specific  and  varied.  They  include  both financial criteria - recurring operating income (ROI), free cash flow from operations (FCF) and recurring operating  margin  (ROM)  -  and  non-financial  criteria, relating  in  particular  to  sustainability,  corporate  social responsibility, and organization and talent management.\n\nThe  level  of  achievement  of  the  financial  targets  is determined  by  the  Group's  Finance  Department.  The level  of  achievement  of  the  non-financial  targets  is first assessed by the Remuneration Committee, which reports  thereupon  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  This assessment  is  based  on  information  provided  by the Legal, Sustainability and Human  Resources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These proposals are based,  in  turn,  on  analyses  and  recommendations provided by the Group's Human Resources, Remuneration  and  Employee  Benefits,  and  Legal Departments.\n\nA review of the existing system is carried out annually to assess whether changes should be made, based on continuous monitoring of market practice and in line with any legislative developments. External consultants  may  be  called  on  to  assist  in  the  review process,  where  necessary.  When  market  practices  are benchmarked  (both  in  terms  of  remuneration  levels and  the  principles  for  determining  and  managing remuneration), comparisons are made with reference companies selected from the French and international markets  on  the  basis  of  their  size  and  sector  of activity.\n\nThe  decision-making  process  for  the  remuneration policy is also designed to avoid or address conflicts of interest.  The  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing  Director  and  the  payment  of  the  variable components  due  to  them  based  on  the  principles applied are discussed and decided on by the Board of Directors, based  on  recommendations  from  the Remuneration Committee and following the approval of the financial statements for the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe  components  that  make  up  the  remuneration policy are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, in compliance with Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Group  Managing  Director  do  not  participate  in  either the  discussion  or  the  vote  during  Remuneration Committee or Board meetings on these topics.\n\n## 4.1.2 Components of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nFor  2021,  the  remuneration  structure  for  executive corporate  officers  will  comprise  three  components: fixed remuneration, annual variable remuneration and multi-annual variable remuneration.\n\nThe  relative  weight  of  each  component  will  be  as follows:\n\n## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) LTI:  100%  of  the  fixed  remuneration  for  year  Y  +  annual variable remuneration for year Y-1.\n- (2) Annual variable remuneration: 120% of fixed remuneration.\n\n## Group Managing Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) LTI:  80%  of  the  fixed  remuneration  for  year  Y  +  annual variable remuneration for year Y-1.\n- (2) Annual variable remuneration: 100% of fixed remuneration.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  is determined  by  taking  into  account  various  factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the level and  complexity  of the tasks and responsibilities associated with their roles, it being noted that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and  the  Group  Managing  Director  are  vested  with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company and to represent it in its dealings with third parties;\n- \u00b7 the  incumbents'  experience,  background  and  level of expertise;\n- \u00b7 market  research  and  analyses  relating  to  the remuneration  of  people  in  similar  positions  in comparable  companies.  The  proposed  amount  of fixed  remuneration  is  in  line  with  executive  pay practices  implemented  by  the  Group's  CAC  40  and (international) luxury market peers.",

        "page_content": "Fixed remuneration serves as the basis for calculating annual  variable  remuneration  and  determining  the value of long-term remuneration. In line with recommendation 25.3.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it is not reviewed systematically each year.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore proposes to maintain the  annual  fixed  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing Director  at  \u20ac1,200,000  each,  unchanged  for  the  last four years (1) .\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nVariable  remuneration  is  designed  to  align  the  reward accruing to executive corporate officers with the Group's annual financial performance and its strategic long-term objectives on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Variable remuneration is expressed as a percentage of annual fixed remuneration.\n\nWhen targets are met, annual variable remuneration is equal to 120% of fixed remuneration for the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  100%  of  fixed remuneration for the Group Managing Director.\n\nWhen targets are exceeded, annual variable remuneration may equal up to 162% of fixed remuneration for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and up to 135% of fixed remuneration for the Group Managing Director, provided that the achievement of the financial targets reaches  125%  of  the  thresholds  set  and  that  all non-financial targets are met.\n\nIn 2016, in line with the Group's long-term strategy on ESG issues, the Board decided, at the recommendation of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  to  introduce  equally weighted non-financial performance criteria that would account  for  30%  of  annual  variable  remuneration.  The criteria are based on three key areas: organization and talent management, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  annual  variable  remuneration  of  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Group Managing Director is determined as follows:\n\n## Distribution of the annual variable remuneration criteria\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Financial criteria                          | Weighting   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Consolidated recurring operating income     | 35%         |\n| Consolidated free cash flow from operations | 35%         |\n| SUB-TOTAL                                   | 70%         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Payment  is  also  subject  to  the shareholders'  approval  of  the  2021  remuneration policy.\n\n## Factors determining the payment of annual variable remuneration\n\nThe  factors  determining  payment  of  annual  variable remuneration are the same as for 2020 and function as described in the table below, it being specified that for  confidentiality  reasons,  specific  quantified  targets will  only  be  disclosed a  posteriori at  the  time  of payment.\n\nFor  the  financial  targets  (70%  of  annual  variable remuneration), the achievement rate must be at least 75%  for  each  target  for  variable  remuneration  to  be paid. If targets are met exactly, the variable remuneration  awarded  corresponds  to  100%  of  the target  amount.  If  the  percentage  achieved  reaches 125%, the variable remuneration awarded is increased to 150% of the target amount.\n\nFor  the  non-financial  targets  (30%  of  annual  variable remuneration), the percentage of the bonus awarded depends  on  the  achievement  of  each  of  the  three criteria: if none of the criteria are met, no bonus will be paid;  if  one  criterion  is  met,  one-third  of  the  bonus will  be  paid;  if  two  criteria  are  met,  two-thirds  of  the bonus will be paid; and if all the criteria are met, the bonus will be paid in full.\n\nAs a % of fixed remuneration\n\n|                                                                                                    | % of bonus awarded   | Chairman and CEO (120% of fixed remuneration)   | Group Managing Director (100% of fixed remuneration)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Achievement rate of financial  targets (70% of the bonus) (1)                                      |                      |                                                 |                                                        |\n| \u226475%                                                                                               | 0%                   | 0%                                              | 0%                                                     |\n| 100%                                                                                               | 100%                 | 84%                                             | 70%                                                    |\n| \u2265125%                                                                                              | 150%                 | 126%                                            | 105%                                                   |\n| Achievement rate of non-financial  targets (30% of the bonus)                                      |                      |                                                 |                                                        |\n| 0 criteria                                                                                         | 0%                   | 0%                                              | 0%                                                     |\n| 1 of 3 criteria                                                                                    | 1/3                  | 12%                                             | 10%                                                    |\n| 2 of 3 criteria                                                                                    | 2/3                  | 24%                                             | 20%                                                    |\n| 3 of 3 criteria                                                                                    | 100%                 | 36%                                             | 30%                                                    |\n| Maximum bonus (for achieving 125% of the financial targets and 100%  of the non-financial targets) |                      | 162%                                            | 135%                                                   |\n\n- (1) See graph below illustrating the rate of payment of the bonus depending on the achievement of financial targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, if an executive corporate officer were to achieve 90% of the target, he would receive 60% of his annual variable remuneration; if he were to achieve 110% of the target, he would receive 120% of the remuneration.\n\n## Multi-annual variable remuneration\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Board  of Directors and following the approval of the shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of June  16,  2020,  the  executive  corporate  officers' long-term remuneration was modified, effective from 2020, by replacing Kering Monetary Units (KMUs) with performance share awards.\n\nThis  system  serves  to  reinforce  the  relationship between  the  remuneration  of  executive  corporate officers  and  their  direct  contribution  to  long-term performance,  while  also  aligning  their  interests  with the interests of shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  performance  share  award  plan  for  executive corporate  officers  is  accompanied  by  a  share  award plan  for  other  employees  in  key  positions  within  the Group.

These changes aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 make  the  number  of  shares  actually  obtained following the three-year vesting period conditional upon  an  overall  performance  not  limited  to  the achievement of financial targets, with an additional focus on the Group's strategic commitment to ESG issues;\n\n- \u00b7 introduce  stricter  requirements  for  the  financial criteria;\n- \u00b7 maintain the significant impact of the performance of  the  Kering  share  relative  to  that  of  a  reference index of luxury goods companies.\n\nAccordingly, the number  of  performance  shares awarded to executive corporate officers that ultimately vest  is  now  subject  to  the  criteria  and  weightings indicated in the table below:\n\n| Criterion

in price between the award date of the performance shares and the end of the  vesting  period)  relative  to  the  performance  of  a reference  index  (followed  in  the  same  way)  over  the same

The  reference  index  comprises  the\n\nshares  of  the  following  eight  listed  companies: Burberry,  Ferragamo,  Herm\u00e8s,  LVMH,  Moncler,  Prada, Richemont and Swatch.\n\nIt  follows that the number of vested shares based on financial and non-financial criteria may be reduced by half  if  the  Kering  share  underperforms  the  reference index  by  more  than  50%.  Conversely,  if  the  Kering share outperforms, the number of vested shares based on  financial and  non-financial  criteria may  be increased in proportion to this outperformance by up to 50%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  also  in  line  with  the Company's strategy of aligning Directors' remuneration with the corporate interest.\n\nThe  variable  remuneration  allocated  to  Directors  is notably based on their actual presence at meetings of the Board and its specialized Committees and on the investment  required  of  them  to  prepare  for  and participate  in  these  meetings.  The  Lead  Independent Director  receives  additional  remuneration,  which  is subject  to  the  achievement  of  predefined  objectives relating to their duties. The  Lead  Independent Director's duties are described in section 1.5.2 of this chapter.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee prepares and monitors the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors.  The  total amount  of  remuneration  allocated  to  Directors  and the allocation criteria are approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  and  Remuneration  Committee  meetings that deal with the remuneration policy are carried out in strict compliance with the procedures for preventing  and  managing  conflicts  of  interest,  which are  described  in  the  Board's  internal  rules,  and Directors do not participate in discussions or votes on resolutions that relate to their own remuneration.\n\nCorporate  Board  member  (and  controlling  company) Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has  waived  all  remuneration  in respect  of  its  duties  as  a  Director  or  Committee member within the Group.\n\nClaire  Lacaze  and  Concetta  Battaglia,  the  Directors representing  employees,  both  have  a  permanent employment  contract  with  the  Company  or  a  Kering group company.\n\n## 4.2.2 Components of the remuneration policy for members of the Board of Directors\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee,  at  its  meeting  of  February  16,  2021,  the Board of Directors proposed a modification of the total remuneration  allocated  to  Directors  from  \u20ac877,000, unchanged  since  2017,  to  \u20ac1,400,000.  The  proposed remuneration notably takes into account the increase in  the  number  of  Board  members,  the  additional remuneration  allocated  to  the  Lead  Independent Director,  and  the  special  portion  allocated  to  the Sustainability Committee Chair.\n\nIn 2020, at its meeting held on February 11, the Board of  Directors  had  proposed  to  increase  the  total remuneration allocated to Directors. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on business activity,  at  its  meeting  of  April  21,  2020,  the  Board subsequently decided to maintain the total remuneration allocated to Directors, i.e., \u20ac877,000.\n\nDirectors' remuneration is allocated on the basis of the actual presence of members at meetings of the Board and  its  specialized  Committees  during  the  year.  In accordance with applicable legislation and other than in  the  special circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic,  members  may  not  use  videoconferencing or  other  remote  communication  technologies  to attend  meetings  discussing  the  annual  financial statements and the Management Report. Accordingly, Directors  not  physically  in  attendance  at  the  Board meeting  approving  the  financial  statements  are deemed  absent  and  are  not  eligible  for  the  related remuneration.\n\nThe breakdown between fixed and variable remuneration  remains  unchanged,  at  40%  fixed  and 60% variable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Board  of  Directors  establishes  the  rules for  setting  the  remuneration  each  year  based  on  the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe components of remuneration - including the way in  which they contribute to the Company's long-term performance  and  the  way  performance  criteria  have been  applied  -  have  been  established  in  compliance with  the  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing Director  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual General Meeting of June 16, 2020 (13 th resolution).\n\nIn  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on business activity, and at the request of the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing Director, at its meeting of April 21, 2020 the Board of Directors  decided  to  amend  the  remuneration  policy applicable to executive corporate officers for 2020, by reducing  the  proposed  fixed  remuneration  for  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to an amount of \u20ac960,000 and eliminating the annual variable remuneration  for  executive  corporate  officers.  The shareholders approved the 2020 remuneration policy at the Annual General Meeting of June 16, 2020.\n\nAccordingly,  the  remuneration  structure  for  executive corporate officers for 2020 comprises two components (and  not  three,  as  initially  proposed  by  the  Board  of Directors  at  its  meeting  of  February  11,  2020):  fixed remuneration and multi-annual variable remuneration.

The  reference  index  comprises  the  shares  of  the following eight listed companies: Burberry, Ferragamo, Herm\u00e8s, LVMH, Moncler, Prada, Richemont  and Swatch.\n\nIt  follows that the number of vested shares based on financial criteria may be reduced by half if the Kering share underperforms the reference index by more than\n\n50%. Conversely, if  the  Kering  share  outperforms,  the number  of  vested  shares  based  on  financial  criteria may be increased in proportion to this outperformance by up to 50%.\n\nThe performance shares awarded to the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  to  the  Group  Managing Director in 2020, represent 0.003% and 0.002% of the Company's share capital, respectively.\n\n## Performance shares that became available during the year\n\nNone  of  the  performance  shares  awarded  to  the executive  corporate  officers  became  available  during 2020.",

The  previous  long-term  incentive  system (which  applied  from  2013  to  2019)  was  based  on Kering Monetary Units (KMUs). The value of these KMUs is  indexed  equally  to  both  absolute  changes  in  the Kering share price and to changes in the Kering share price  relative  to  a  basket  of  seven  luxury  stocks (Burberry, Ferragamo, LVMH, Prada, Richemont, Swatch and Tod's).\n\nKMUs  have  a  vesting  period  of  three  years  as  from January 1 of the year in which they are granted, after which they may be cashed in by the beneficiaries over a  two-year  period  (during  two  windows  each  year), when the beneficiaries may receive the cash equivalent  of  their  KMUs  based  on  the  last  assessed value. Past awards of KMUs to the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director, which  have  become  available  or  are  still  vesting,  are presented in the tables on page 302.\n\nTo  align  the  multi-annual  variable  remuneration system  with  the  Group's  long-term  performance, vesting  of  the  KMUs  awarded  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing Director  is  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  performance criteria based on three financial indicators assessed at Group level:\n\n- \u00b7 recurring operating income (ROI);\n- \u00b7 free cash flow from operations (FCF);\n- \u00b7 recurring operating margin (ROM).\n\nUnder this system put in place in 2017, if an increase is  observed  in  at  least  one  of  these  three  indicators between  the  average  amount  over  the  three-year vesting  period  and  the  amount  shown  in  Kering's consolidated financial statements for the year preceding  the  year  of  the  grant,  100%  of  the  KMUs granted  may  be  cashed  in  (the  change  in  each indicator  is  measured  at  constant  scope  and  as reported). Failing this, no KMUs may be cashed in.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The mechanism in place meets stricter requirements, since the KMU value is not in itself a performance condition but influences the amount actually paid at the exercise date.\n\n- \u00b7 one of three criteria met: 50% of the KMUs vest;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code and of the Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  on March  10,  2017  to  remove  the  lock-in  obligation  on Kering  shares  obtained  by  cashing  in  KMUs,  because these  instruments  provide  exclusively  for  a  cash settlement.\n\n## Method applied to value KMUs\n\nChanges  in  the  KMU  value  are  assessed  on  a six-monthly basis (at June 30 and December 31 each year), based on the Kering share price during the last 30  trading  days.  This  value  is  then  weighted  for  the performance of the Kering share relative to the basket of benchmark stocks.\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  six-month  period,  the  value  of  a KMU is calculated as follows:\n\nUVs+1 = UVs x ([1+VKs+1] + ([1+VKs+1] x [1+VKs+1] / [1+VPVs+1])) / 2\n\nWhere:\n\nUV = Unit of Value.\n\ns+1 = the six-monthly closing date at which the unit of value is assessed (06/30 or 12/31).\n\n- s = the previous six-monthly closing.\n\nVK  =  the  change  in  the  Kering  share  price  over  the six-month  period,  using  the  average  share  price  over the 30 days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nVPV = the change in the price of a basket of stocks over the six-month period, equal to the arithmetic average change in these stocks, using the average share price over the 30 days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nThe  following  companies  were  used  to  compile  the benchmark: Burberry, Ferragamo, LVMH, Prada, Richemont, Swatch and Tod's.",

However,  in  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its impact  on  business  activity,  at  the  Annual  General Meeting  of  June  16,  2020  the  shareholders  approved the  Board  of  Directors'  subsequent  decision  taken  at its  meeting  held  on  April  21,  2020  to  reduce  the Directors'  remuneration  by  30%,  by  maintaining  the total  amount  of  remuneration  at  the  level  applied  in previous years despite the increase in the number of Board members.\n\nOut  of  the  total  amount  set  at  the  Annual  General Meeting,  the  rule  followed  by  the  Board  in  order  to comply  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  recommendation for  a  significant  variable  component  with  respect  to remuneration  awarded  to  Directors  is  to  divide  the total amount between a 40% fixed portion and a 60% variable portion. The remuneration is thus allocated in the  following  manner  (Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has  waived all remuneration in respect of its duties as a Director):\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus  (i) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Chairs of the  Audit,  Remuneration,  and  Appointments  and Governance  Committees  (\u20ac23,000  each)  and  (ii)  a special  portion  allocated  to  the  Lead  Independent Director  for  their  role  on  the  Board  (\u20ac50,000  for 2020), the balance being allocated with a coefficient of 1 by Board membership, increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 a variable portion, allocated with a coefficient of 1 per presence at each meeting of the Board and 0.5 for each attendance of a Committee meeting.\n\nFor 2020, a total amount of \u20ac877,000 will be paid to the Directors, allocated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac350,800 for the fixed portion, of which \u20ac46,000 for the special portion for the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration  Committees  and  \u20ac50,000  for  the special  portion  allocated  to  the  Lead  Independent Director (40% of the total remuneration awarded to Directors);\n- \u00b7 \u20ac526,200 for the variable portion (60% of the total remuneration awarded to Directors).\n\nCorporate  Board  member  (and  controlling  company) Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has  waived  all  remuneration  in respect  of  its  duties  as  a  Director  or  Committee member within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The downturn was felt particularly in  the  first  half  (down  30.1%  on  a  comparable  basis), with  the  majority  of  the  Group's  stores  gradually forced  to  close  owing  to  the  health  crisis  and lockdown  measures  (on  average,  12%  of  stores  were closed in the first quarter and 42% in the second). This has significantly impacted the Group's second-quarter performance (down 43.7% on a comparable basis) and to some extent on its performance for the first quarter (down 16.4% on a comparable basis), despite a strong start to the year. The decline was limited in the second half  (down  3.2%  on  a  comparable  basis),  despite further  restrictions  and  store  closures  during  the fourth quarter.\n\nRecurring  operating  income  for  2020  came  in  at \u20ac3,135 million, down 34.4% year on year. Once again, the picture was very different in the first and second halves  of  the  year,  with  recurring  operating  income retreating 57.7% in the first half but only 13.5% in the second.  Recurring  operating  margin  for  the  year  was 23.9%. The dilution in the recurring operating margin compared  to  the  previous  year  was  limited  to 6.2  percentage  points.  The  Group  has  put  in  place cost-saving  measures  to  safeguard  its  profitability while continuing to invest in its Houses.\n\nFor  more  details  concerning  the  impact  of  the COVID-19 crisis on the market as a whole and on the Group's  businesses,  along  with  the  measures  and initiatives  taken  by  the  Group  to  mitigate  the  various impacts  of  the  crisis,  see  Chapter  1  (section  6  Impacts of the COVID-19 crisis) and Chapter 2 (section 3 - Our markets).\n\nOther than the items mentioned below - which were accounted for  as  non-recurring  operating  expenses  all of the impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic described in the paragraphs  above  have  been recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  2020  and essentially affect recurring operating income.\n\nIn particular, the costs related to health measures put in place (purchases of hand sanitizer and face masks, exceptional measures for regularly disinfecting premises,  etc.)  have  been  accounted  for  as  recurring operating expenses.\n\nThe rent concessions negotiated with landlords due to the  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  were immediately  recognized  within  recurring  operating income  as  negative  variable  lease  payments  rather than as an amendment to the associated leases. This accounting  method  complies  with  the  practical expedient provided for in the Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases , issued  by  the  IASB  on  May  28,  2020  and adopted by the European Union on October 9, 2020.\n\nImpairment losses on current assets (inventories and trade receivables) - caused indirectly by the pandemic due  to  slow-moving  inventory  items,  primarily  from the  Spring/Summer  collections,  and  the  difficulties suffered  by  many  wholesale  accounts  -  have  been recognized as recurring operating expenses.\n\nExcluding the impact of the gain on the disposal of an additional 5.83% stake in PUMA in October 2020, other non-recurring operating income and expenses represented  a  \u20ac542  million  net  expense  (versus  a \u20ac168  million  net  expense  for  2019).  The  COVID-19 impact recognized as non-recurring expenses therefore  amounted  to  \u20ac390  million,  essentially breaking down as \u20ac15 million in exceptional donations to support various organizations in their fight against the  pandemic  and  \u20ac368  million  in  asset  impairment losses.  The  asset  impairment  losses  were  recognized following  impairment  tests  performed  by  estimating the recoverable amount of the Houses' assets that had already  been  written  down  in  2019.  The  Houses concerned  were  Brioni  and  the  watches  brands (Girard-Perregaux  and  Ulysse  Nardin),  which  were  hit particularly hard by the pandemic while in the midst of an  ambitious  but  demanding  transformation  project. Impairment losses recognized in 2020 mainly related to brands (\u20ac328 million) and a lease right-of-use asset (\u20ac30 million).\n\nTo  date,  the  Group  considers  that  the  contraction  in business in 2020 and the outlook for the luxury goods market are not sufficient indicators that the recoverable amount of the assets of the Group's other brands  may  be  impaired,  except  those  mentioned  in the above paragraph (see Note 9 - Other non-recurring operating  income  and  expenses,  and  Note  15  Cash-generating  units  and  impairment  tests,  to  the consolidated financial statements).",

        "page_content": "The  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  have  also been  taken  into  consideration  for  calculating  the Group's corporate income tax. The global decrease in profits  for  the  vast  majority  of  multinationals  has raised the question of how profits and losses should be allocated by country. In connection with this, on December 18, 2020 the OECD published guidance on the  transfer  pricing  implications  of  the  pandemic, offering a wide range of different proposals. Based on this guidance, Kering considered it was reasonable to keep the main principles of its current transfer pricing policy, but to adapt some of its aspects where necessary to the particular conditions caused by the pandemic. The Group is confident that its estimates at December 31, 2020 are fair and prudent (See Note 11 Income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nLastly,  the  Group  has  analyzed  its  exposure  to  the financial  risks  set  out  in  its  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nIn  particular,  it  found  no  significant  escalation  of credit  risk  across  the  Group.  In  fact,  as  it  has  a  large number  of  clients  in  a  wide  range  of  business segments and realizes a significant portion of its sales directly  with  the  end  customer,  direct  sales  do  not\n\nexpose the Group to any credit risk. For sales through wholesalers, there is no  strong  dependency  or concentration  whereby  the  loss  of  one  or  more wholesalers  could  significantly  affect  the  Group's earnings. Credit risk with respect to wholesalers is also minimized  by  taking  out  credit  insurance  and implementing an appropriate  and  prudent  credit  risk strategy managed Group-wide by a dedicated team.\n\nConcerning  liquidity  risk,  the  Group  took  action  very early  on  in  the  pandemic,  when  countries  started going  into  lockdown  after  China.  In  order  to  ensure liquidity,  the  Group  now  has  \u20ac4,365  million  in  total confirmed  credit  lines  (versus  \u20ac3,035  million  as  of December  31,  2019),  of  which  \u20ac4,365  million  is undrawn.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group  had \u20ac3,443 million in available cash. In addition, in order to  pro-actively  manage  the  Group's  liquidity,  in  the first  half  of  2020  Kering  carried  out  a  \u20ac1.2  billion dual-tranche bond issue comprising (i) a \u20ac600 million tranche  with  a  three-year  maturity  and  a  0.25% coupon,  and  (ii)  a  \u20ac600  million  tranche  with  an eight-year maturity and a 0.75% coupon (See Note 23 - Net debt, to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Significant events of 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  significant  events  below  have  already  been disclosed  by  the  Group  in  press  releases  related  to regulated  information.  Most  significant  events  took place in the first half of the year.\n\n## Postponement of the Annual General Meeting to June 16, 2020\n\nIn  view  of  the  circumstances,  on  March  30,  2020, Kering's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  postpone  the 2020  Annual  General  Meeting  initially  scheduled  for Thursday April 23, 2020. On April 21, 2020, the Board set the new Meeting date as June 16, 2020.\n\n## Revised dividend per share for 2019\n\nIn  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on business  activity,  on  April  21,  2020  the  Board  of Directors  decided  to  revise  the  amount  allocated  to the  2019  dividend  payment  and  to  recommend  to shareholders at Kering SA's Annual General Meeting on June  16,  2020  that  the  total  dividend  payout  should amount  to  \u20ac1,010  million,  corresponding  to  \u20ac8  per\n\nshare.  This  is  \u20ac442  million  lower  than  the  amount announced when the Group released its 2019 results on  February  12,  2020  (\u20ac1,452  million,  or  \u20ac11.50  per share).\n\n## Reduction in remuneration for 2020 for Kering's executive corporate officers\n\nIn  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on business  activity,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  Chairman and CEO of Kering, decided to reduce the fixed portion of  his  salary  from  April  1,  until  the  end  of  2020.  In addition,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, Group Managing Director, decided to waive the entirety  of  the  variable  portions  of  their  annual remuneration for 2020. These decisions were approved by Kering's Board of Directors on April  21,  2020.  The  Board  therefore  submitted  a revised  2020  remuneration  policy  to  the  vote  of  the shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on June 16, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  the  same  time,  the  Balenciaga  and  Yves Saint Laurent workshops began manufacturing officially  approved  face  masks.  Kering  also  made  a financial  donation  to  the  Institut  Pasteur  for  its research into COVID-19, and to Cochin hospital in Paris for its '3D COVID' project to purchase 60 3D printers in order  to  rapidly  produce  large  quantities  of  medical equipment.  In  Italy,  Kering  and  its  Houses  made donations  to  four  major  hospital  foundations  in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio. Gucci responded  to  the  appeal  launched  to  the  fashion industry by the Tuscany regional authorities, supplying 1.1 million surgical masks  and  55,000  medical overalls to health workers. In China, as early as the end of  January,  Kering  and  its  Houses  announced  a donation to  the  Hubei  Red  Cross  Foundation  to  help fight  the  spread  of  the  virus.  In  the  United  States, Kering and its Houses entered into a partnership with the  CDC  Foundation,  giving  a  $1  million  donation  to provide  personal  protection  equipment  and  other essential  supplies  to  health  workers.  This  donation helped support front-line health workers in the United States - and particularly the hardest hit States such as New York, New Jersey, California and Florida - as well as in a number of regions in Latin America.\n\n## Pro-active management of the Group's liquidity - a new bond issue and extension of syndicated loan facilities\n\nIn May  2020,  Kering  carried  out  a  \u20ac1.2  billion dual-tranche bond issue comprising (i) a \u20ac600 million tranche  with  a  three-year  maturity  and  a  0.25% coupon,  and  (ii)  a  \u20ac600  million  tranche  with  an eight-year maturity and a 0.75% coupon. In line with the Group's pro-active liquidity management approach,  this  issue  enables  Kering  to  diversify  its sources of financing and enhance its funding flexibility through  refinancing  of  existing  debt  and  extending the  maturity  of  its  financing  facilities.  Investors'  high take-up  rate  of  the  issue  confirmed  the  market's confidence  in  the  Group's  creditworthiness.  Kering's long-term debt is rated 'A-'  with  a  stable  outlook  by Standard & Poor's.\n\nThe  Group  also  extended  its  credit  facilities  from  its banks in an aggregate amount of \u20ac1,330 million, giving it  \u20ac4,365  million  in  total  confirmed  credit  lines  as  of December  31,  2020,  versus  \u20ac3,035  million  as  of December  31,  2019  (see  Note  23  -  Net  debt,  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Other significant events of 2020\n\n## Sale of an additional 5.83% stake in PUMA\n\nOn  October  8,  2020,  the  Group  further  reduced  its investment in PUMA by selling a 5.83% stake through an  accelerated  bookbuilding  process  with  qualified investors at a price of \u20ac74.50 per share, corresponding to  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac656  million.  Following  this transaction, Kering retains a 9.87% interest in PUMA.\n\n(See  Note  9  -  Other  non-recurring  operating  income and expenses, Note 18 -Investments in equity-accounted companies and Note 19 - Financial assets, to the consolidated financial statements).",

The presentation of the personal luxury goods market (page 35) also provides an analysis of  trends  and  developments  in  the  industry  based  on region, distribution channel and product category.\n\nRegarding  the  impact  of  exchange  rates  on  the  Group's performance during the year, the euro's strong appreciation against the world's other major currencies, primarily as from the end of the second quarter, weighed\n\non  reported  growth  for  markets  outside  the  eurozone. Overall,  the  Luxury  Houses'  performance  was  110  basis points  better  at  constant  exchange  rates  than  as reported. This difference was as high as 310 basis points in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  after  the  first  six-month period  when  the  average  euro  exchange  rate  was conversely very slightly weaker than in 2019. In absolute value  terms,  the  figure  at  constant  exchange  rates  was approximately  \u20ac208  million  better  than  on  a  reported basis.  Apart  from  the  yen,  which  remained  very  stable against  the  euro,  fluctuations  in  all  of  the  world's  other major currencies - particularly the US dollar, the Chinese yuan  and  the  Korean  won  -  contributed  to  this difference.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  revenue  decline  was particularly  marked  in  the  first  half  (30.2%),  as  the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures significantly  impacted  performance,  not  just  in  the second quarter (which saw a 43.4% revenue drop) but also  in  the  first  three  months  of  2020  (down  16.9%), despite  a  very  good  start  to  the  year.  In  the  second half,  sales  retreated  by  just  3.3%.  The  recovery  in revenue seen during the summer (with a contraction of  just  1.6%  in  the  third  quarter)  continued  in  some regions  in  the  fourth  quarter,  but  new  COVID-19 restrictions  -  particularly  in  Europe  -  weighed  on performance in the markets concerned. Consequently, revenue declined 4.8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nSales  in  directly  operated  stores  and  online  sales amounted to \u20ac9,927 million in 2020, down 15.9% year on year, despite an almost stable performance in the second  half  when  they  edged  down  just  1.5%.  The pandemic  drove  huge  growth  in  e-commerce,  which surged 67.5% for the Group's brands and accounted for around 13% of the Luxury Houses' total direct sales.\n\nDirectly  operated  stores  accounted  for  78.3%  of  total revenue  generated  by  the  Luxury  Houses  in  2020, versus  78.0%  in  2019.  This  apparent  year-on-year stability is a direct consequence of the unprecedented conditions  that  affected  the  Houses'  operations  in 2020  and  does  not  reflect  the  long-term  strategy implemented by all of the brands, which is aimed at more effectively controlling their distribution, including  online,  and  strengthening  their  exclusivity while  prudently  managing  the  expansion  of  the directly  operated  store  network  and  the  related investments.\n\nWholesale  sales  retreated  17.4%  over  the  full  year based  on  comparable  data,  reflecting  the  Group's strategy of continuing to focus the wholesale business of  the  Couture  and  Leather  Goods  Houses  on  the highest-quality distributors. The decrease was a steep 33.4%  at  Gucci,  which  was  the  Group's  first  brand  to embark  on  the  process  of  radically  streamlining  its distribution network. Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga  also  took  a  very  selective  approach  to distribution in 2020, only working with key wholesalers. Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta which was buoyed by its new creative direction - saw an increase in their wholesale business as a result of market share gains, while remaining highly selective in their  choice  of  distributors.  Another  contributing factor to the overall decline in wholesale sales was the financial  difficulties  suffered  by  department  stores  in North America.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nRevenue  trends  by  region  were  particularly  mixed during the year in view of how the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world, initially hitting Asia in the first quarter before being more or less controlled there as it  spread  across  the  other  continents  without  ever really being curbed, except during the summer. These trends were exacerbated by the lack of tourism, which penalized  markets  in  Western  Europe  but  benefited China in view of demand being repatriated to the local market.  As  a  result,  revenue  decreased  7.4%  in emerging  markets,  whereas  it  fell  22.5%  in  mature markets.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region (which accounts for the bulk of the Luxury Houses' sales in emerging markets), the year-on-year  revenue  contraction  was  6.1%.  Revenue generated in Mainland China rose sharply, especially as from  the  second  quarter,  partly  to  the  detriment  of other Asian markets. Hong Kong and Macao experienced particularly marked declines, although the fourth quarter  saw  an  improvement  helped  by favorable  bases  of  comparison.  South  Korea  -  the region's  second-largest  market  -  saw  excellent  sales momentum with local clients but this barely offset the revenue losses triggered by the lack of Chinese clients, particularly  for  Gucci,  whose  South  Korean  duty  free business is based on a retail model.\n\nIn  Western  Europe,  sales  were  29.2%  lower  than  in 2019,  dragged  down  by  the  lack  of  tourists  as  of mid-February,  the  national  lockdowns  in  the  spring, and  further  closures  towards  the  end  of  the  year (affecting around a quarter of the region's network in the  fourth  quarter).  Targeted  clienteling  initiatives, together with distance selling techniques and numerous  in-store  events  nevertheless  helped  to shore up revenue streams with local clients throughout the year.\n\nIn  Japan,  revenue  was  also  hit  hard  by  the  COVID-19 crisis  (down  28.9%),  reflecting  the  lack  of  Chinese tourists  and  an  eroded  local  consumer  environment, although  the  picture  began  to  brighten  towards  the end of the year.\n\nIn North America, the Luxury Houses fared better, with revenue down by just 8.3% overall. Following a sharp 34.1% drop in the first half of the year, sales picked up as  soon  as  stores  re-opened  and  even  advanced strongly in the third quarter. Growth remained solid in the  fourth  quarter  but  gradually  returned  to  more normal  levels, particularly after the presidential elections  in  the  United  States.  2020  also  saw  further growth  for  e-commerce,  despite  the  fact  that  the region's markets are very mature. Revenue from online sales almost doubled during the year and represented around 24% of sales generated directly by the brands.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue by product category\n\nAll  of  the  main product categories registered revenue decreases in 2020. However, the quality of the Group's brand  portfolio  and  the  effective  strategies  put  in place  by  the  Houses  helped  contain  the  declines across the different product categories.\n\nThe revenue contraction for the leather goods category was  generally  in  phase  with  market  trends,  despite very  high  bases  of  comparison  and  an  operating context  in  which  the  brands  privileged  healthy inventory  management,  which  meant  they  were especially  vigilant  about  the  number  of  product references and pieces available in stores.\n\nContrary to market trends, ready-to-wear sales decreased  in  proportions  comparable  to  the  other categories  thanks  to  the  appeal  of  the  Houses' offerings.\n\nSales of shoes were lifted by a rebound in purchases of luxury products in the second half of the year, after a first half that followed the same trends as in the other market segments.\n\nIn  addition,  in  line  with  the  favorable  trends  seen  in 2019, jewelry sales held firm overall, thanks to strong market  momentum  in  Asia  and  Qeelin's  successful business development in China. High jewelry suffered more  though  from  the  travel  restrictions  and  store closures in Western Europe.\n\nLastly, for both Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin, sales were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as was the case for the watchmaking industry as a whole.\n\nRoyalties and other revenues dived by 29.3%, weighed down  by  a  much  lower  performance  from  Gucci's fragrances  and  cosmetics  license.  The  decrease  in royalties  received  by  Kering  Eyewear  remained  very contained, however.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nRecurring  operating  income  for  the  Group's  Luxury Houses totaled \u20ac3,367 million in 2020, down \u20ac1,675 million on 2019 (of which \u20ac1,307 million in the first  half  alone).  Recurring  operating  margin  came  to 26.6%, 6.2 points lower than in 2019 for the year as a whole  but  only  2.6  points  for  the  second  half.  This downturn  in  profitability  was  due  to  an  adverse operating leverage effect after several fiscal years when it  was  very  favorable.  Rather  than  the  contraction  in gross margin, the dilution in recurring operating margin\n\nwas more a reflection of the sharp fall  in  sales,  which led  to  lower  absorption  of  fixed  costs  (despite  lower expenditure). The dilution was relatively even across the main  brands  (between  4  and  6  points  in  general). Among the other Houses, Balenciaga - and to a lesser degree Alexander McQueen - were able to increase their recurring  operating  margins,  whereas  other  brands  in the  segment  that  are  closer  to  break-even  recorded higher margin declines, which is logical.\n\nEBITDA  for  2020  amounted  to  \u20ac4,605  million  versus \u20ac6,122 million in 2019. At 36.3%, EBITDA margin was still at a very high level, and was just 3.5 points lower than the previous year.\n\nThe combined effect of exchange rate fluctuations and currency  hedges  was  slightly  favorable  for  both recurring  operating  income  and  recurring  operating margin.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe Luxury Houses' operating investments - which do not  include  the  vast  majority  of  investments  in logistics  and  information  systems  centralized  by  the Corporate  entity  for  all  of  the  brands  -  totaled \u20ac461 million in 2020, 29.3% lower than in 2019. As a proportion  of  revenue,  gross  operating  investments represented  3.6%  in  2020.  This  slight  decrease compared  to  the  4.2%  figure  for  2019  reflects  the Houses' ability to adapt by allocating their resources to the highest priority and most strategic projects. Some 56% of the investments made in 2020 were incurred in the  second  half  of  the  year  -  a  slightly  less  marked seasonal  difference  than  in  2019  thanks  to  tight management of investment needs and pace.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses had  a  network  of  1,433  directly  operated  stores, including  770  (54%)  in  mature  markets  and  663  in emerging  markets.  Net  store  additions  during  2020 totaled 52, representing a 3.8% increase, which is one of  the  lowest  growth  figures  reported  for  years.  This reflects the brands' prudent approach in 2020 in view of the pandemic and the maturity of their networks in mature markets. Most new store openings during the year  were  in  Asia,  mainly  in  Greater  China  and  South Korea  (accounting  for  almost  three-quarters  of  net openings),  and  the  vast  majority  of  the  overall year-on-year  increase  was  due  to  the  scheduled expansion  of  the  Yves  Saint  Laurent,  Balenciaga  and Alexander McQueen networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The brand continued to roll out its most recent store concept as far as it was able to, stabilized its network of  points  of  sale  by  concentrating  store  openings  in growth  markets,  and  took  the  deliberate  measure  of drastically  reducing  the  proportion  of  the  wholesale distribution channel. 2020 was a very good year for the expansion  of  e-commerce  managed  directly  by  Gucci -  a  distribution  channel  that  is  beginning  to  account for a significant weighting of the brand's revenue (just over  12%  of  overall  sales  in  2020).  As  a  result,  Gucci was  able  to  capitalize  on  its  recognized  digital expertise  and  the  quality  of  its  online  stores.  It  also stepped  up  the  development  of  new  sales  channels and  client  touchpoints,  notably  through  the  Gucci  9 service  center,  which  allows  the  brand  to  manage client  expectations  and  requests  remotely  (by  phone and online).\n\nWith  the  Group's  support,  Gucci  pursued  its  plan  for modernizing and optimizing its supply chain, logistics, and  information  systems  to  make  them  more  agile, responsive  and  capable  of  absorbing  rising  demand over  the  long  term  and  endorsing  the  omni-channel model. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting health  measures  weighed  on  the  supply  chain's responsiveness  during  the  year.  Gucci  supported  its suppliers  and  Italy's  general  economy  as  much  as  it could by paying particular attention to order levels and payment conditions.\n\nOn  the  eve  of  its  100 th anniversary,  which  it  will celebrate  in  2021,  Gucci  continued  to  shape  and change its creative offerings. The number of collections  shown  formally  was  reduced  to  two  in 2020,  but  the  launch  of  new  lines  and  the  regular reinvention of iconic pieces will help fuel in-store sales throughout the coming year. The brand's aesthetic is evolving  subtly  to  meet  customer  expectations  and respond to changing attitudes. It is leveraging Gucci's unique heritage while remaining resolutely contemporary  and  modern.  The  brand's  creative  and\n\nmerchandising teams work ceaselessly to achieve this balance,  with  an  ongoing  focus  on  maximizing  the growth potential of each product category by constantly honing the overall offering to engage with the  widest  possible  range  of  clients,  and  optimizing the mix between carryovers and novelty.\n\nGucci's  communications  are  designed  to  sustain  the brand's desirability and raise the engagement levels of existing and future clients of all ages and nationalities. Digital  communication  is  particularly  effective  for creating  a  brand  universe  that  is  both  unique  and inclusive.  In  2020,  Gucci  once  again  proved  its  ability to  innovate  in  this  field.  One  example  of  this  is GucciFest,  the  digital  festival  hosted  by  the  brand  in November  during  which  it  unveiled Ouverture  of Something That Never Ended , a seven-episode mini-series  directed  by  Gus  Van  Sant  presenting  the House's new creations.\n\n## Revenue\n\nGucci posted \u20ac7,441 million in revenue in 2020, down 21.5%  year  on  year  at  comparable  exchange  rates (down 22.7% as reported). This performance obviously needs to be assessed in light of the global impact that the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  on  the  luxury industry,  as  well  as  the  high  basis  of  comparison resulting from the very strong growth delivered by the brand since the start of its rejuvenation in mid-2016. Despite  the  revenue  contraction  during  the  year, Gucci's overall growth  between  2017  and  2020 exceeded 20%.\n\nIn the first half of 2020, sales fell 33.8%, reflecting the significant  impact  of  store  closures  and  the  lack  of tourists,  but  in  the  second  half,  the  year-on-year decrease was only 9.6%.\n\nRetail  sales  generated  in  directly  operated  stores retreated  19.5%  at  constant  exchange  rates  for  2020 as  a  whole  and  by  just  5.9%  in  the  second  half.  This revenue  performance  -  which  was  achieved  on  a practically  same-store  basis  -  reflects  the  slump  in sales to tourists (who accounted for slightly over one third of the brand's global revenue in 2019). Excluding the  impact  of  the  store  closures  resulting  from COVID-19  prevention  measures,  Gucci  recovered  a robust  and  encouraging  sales  momentum  with  local",

In  addition,  while  Gucci was already one of the sector's front-running brands in terms of  e-commerce development, growth in online sales was particularly robust during the year, approaching +70%. E-commerce directly managed by the brand, or operated under concession agreements, grew in all regions.\n\nSales  generated  in  the  wholesale  network  contracted 33.4%  on  a  comparable  basis.  This  year-on-year contraction  was  partly  due  to  a  lower  number  of orders  from  key  accounts,  particularly  in  the  United States, but it also stems from the brand's decision to embark  on  a  new  phase  in  the  transformation  of  its distribution  network  with  a  view  to  making  it  more exclusive.  Revenue  generated  with  wholesalers  is expected to contract further in 2021 (by around 30%), with a reduction in the number of active accounts and volumes delivered.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn  view  of  the  proportion  of  Gucci's  sales  that  are generated in directly operated stores (87.4% in 2020), the following revenue analysis by region only concerns the retail business.\n\nIn  mature markets, revenue decreased 27.6% year on year.  Western  Europe  was  the  most  affected  region, with  46.7%  negative  revenue  growth.  Sales  suffered due  to  the  lack  of  tourists,  a  long  period  of  store closures  in  the  second  quarter,  and  then  more sporadic closures in the fourth quarter. The consumer environment was morose overall in the region, even if Gucci  successfully  stepped  up  its  investments  and action  plans  to  increase  sales  with  local  clients.  In Japan,  sales  fell  31.9%,  and  consumer  trends  were fairly  similar  to  those  in  Europe:  tourist  numbers plummeted  (albeit  with  less  of  an  impact  than  in Western  Europe  because  local  sales  represented  the vast  majority  of  Gucci's  2019  revenue  in  Japan)  and local consumer demand was sluggish for part of 2020 before picking up right at the end of the year. In North America,  revenue  was  stable,  edging  up  0.1%.  This performance  -  which  was  achieved  despite  a  very negative contribution from Hawaii - reflects the range of  measures  taken  by  Gucci  since  the  last  quarter  of 2019 to boost its US sales as well as very robust online sales,  which  surged  91.3%  year  on  year.  Growth  was particularly strong in the third quarter after lockdown measures were lifted,  and  remained  very  solid  in  the fourth quarter.\n\nIn emerging markets, revenue declined 10.1% at constant exchange  rates.  Gucci's  sales  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region retreated 8.1% for the year as a whole but climbed 9.3% in the  second  half.  In  Mainland  China  -  the  region's  largest market - growth was strong from mid-April onwards as\n\nlockdowns  were  eased.  The  brand  doubled  its  online sales  in  this  country  compared  with  2019  without cannibalizing  in-store  sales,  which  benefited  from demand being repatriated to the local market. South Korea is also a very dynamic market for Gucci's stores, except  for  duty  free  points  of  sale,  which  the  brand integrates into its network of directly operated stores and whose sales decreased sharply due to the lack of Chinese tourists. This falloff in tourist numbers in the Asia-Pacific area also significantly impacted performance in the vast majority of the region's markets. For example, revenue generated in Hong Kong fell sharply year on year, although  the  decrease  was  less  marked  in  the  fourth quarter due to more favorable bases of comparison.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nAll  of  the  brand's  main  product  categories  registered sales  decreases  in  directly  operated  stores  during 2020. The proportion of carryovers - which had been kept stable for several quarters at the target level set by  Gucci  for  all  of  its  product  categories  -  increased slightly over the year due to a more restricted offering of  new  products.  Apart  from  the  effects  of  the COVID-19  crisis,  the  trends  for  the  brand's  main product categories are encouraging, illustrating a very favorable reception from  clients for the latest collections. For some categories, sales even increased in the second half of the year.\n\nRoyalties were much lower than in 2019, primarily due to  the  weak  sales  recorded  in  connection  with  the license granted to Coty for fragrances and cosmetics.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nGucci's  recurring  operating  income  amounted  to \u20ac2,615  million  for  2020,  down  33.8%  on  2019. Recurring operating margin narrowed by 5.9 points but still came in at 35.1%, representing a remarkably high level in a year of sales contractions. In the second half, it  even  reached  38.6%  and  was  only  2.7  points  lower than in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe dilution of recurring operating margin  was attributable  to  a  leverage  effect  that  was  logically unfavorable  as  a  result  of  the  year-on-year  revenue decline.  Gross  margin  narrowed  slightly  in  light  of inventory writedowns, temporarily higher unit production costs, and a product mix effect. At the same time, the cost base was considerably reduced due to the automatic  decrease  in  variable  costs  combined  with systematic  optimization  of  fixed  costs.  This  agile  cost management  enabled  Gucci  to  continue  making  the investments  required  to  drive  the  expected  upturn going  forward  by  reallocating  resources  to  clienteling activities,  in-store  events,  targeted  communications actions and upgrading information systems in line with the sector's fast-paced digital transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This resilience in terms of EBITDA - which fared better than EBIT  -  is  due  to  the  high  amount  of  depreciation related to the operating investments made during the expansion phase of the brand's store network.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Gucci  operated  483  stores directly,  including  212  in  emerging  markets.  A  net 4  new  stores  were  closed  during  the  year.  The  brand now  has  an  overall  network  that  is  adapted  to  its operations  in  terms  of  store  numbers  but  it  is continuing  to  identify  opportunities  for  improving  its distribution  in  certain  regions  and  sales  channels.  To this  end,  in  2020  it  very  slightly  extended  its  store network  in  Asia  and  reduced  its  exposure  in  mature\n\nmarkets.  Gucci's  priority  remains  organic  growth, especially as it prepares for a revenue recovery in the shortand mid-term. It therefore pursued its refurbishment  program  for  existing  stores  in  2020, although this had to be partly put on hold during the year due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. As of December 31, 2020, around 60% of the store network had  adopted  the  new  concept,  below  the  original target.\n\nGucci's  gross  operating  investments  amounted  to \u20ac206  million  in  2020,  39.0%  lower  than  in  2019. Although this decrease reflects the constraints resulting  from  the  pandemic,  which  led  to  some projects being postponed, it was above all due to the brand's  ability  to  agilely  and  rigorously  adapt  its investment plan to the changes in its revenue levels.\n\n## Yves Saint Laurent\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                      | 2020    | 2019    | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Revenue                                                              | 1,744.4 | 2,049.1 | -14.9%   |\n| Recurring operating income                                           | 400.0   | 562.2   | -28.9%   |\n| as a % of revenue                                                    | 22.9%   | 27.4%   | -4.5 pts |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 589.9   | 733.7   | -19.6%   |\n| as a % of revenue                                                    | 33.8%   | 35.8%   | -2.0 pts |\n| Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets | 52.7    | 98.0    | -46.2%   |\n| Average FTE headcount                                                | 3,810   | 3,606   | +5.7%    |\n\nThe unprecedented crisis caused in the luxury industry by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  obviously  affected Yves  Saint  Laurent,  which,  in  2020,  saw  its  sales  fall back  to  their  2018  level.  However,  thanks  to  its heritage, its indisputable position as a flagship brand in the world of fashion and Luxury, and its successful business  development  over  the  past  few  years,  the House's potential for further growth remains intact.\n\nIn  fact,  2020  gave  the  brand  the  opportunity  to accelerate the implementation  of  its  long-term strategy.\n\nIn  terms  of  distribution,  for  example,  Yves  Saint Laurent continued to expand its store network in the regions where its penetration could be improved, and to  boost  its  e-commerce  activities  by  internalizing them  following  the  end  of  the  partnership  set  up  in 2012 with Yoox Net-A-Porter. In line with the Group's overall distribution strategy, the brand applied a highly selective  approach  during  the  year  in  its  choice  of wholesalers and determining delivery volumes.\n\nAlso in 2020, Yves Saint Laurent intensified its efforts and  investments  concerning  innovation  and  the digitalization  of  its  operations.  This  reflects  its  firm belief that digital solutions - including e-commerce offer new opportunities in the areas of creation (virtual fashion  shows  and  events),  communication,  and customer relationship management. These new solutions  particularly  proved  their  relevance  in  2020, when  the  pandemic  meant  it  was  vital  to  have  a targeted, personalized and virtual relationship not only with  existing  clients  but  with  all  stakeholders  in general.\n\nAll the conditions are therefore in place to ensure the success of Yves Saint Laurent's future collections, with a  constant  focus  on  maintaining  a  balance  between the  modernity  brought  by  Antony  Vaccarello  and  the House's rich heritage.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue\n\nYves Saint Laurent's sales amounted to \u20ac1,744 million in  2020,  down  13.8%  year  on  year  at  constant exchange rates.  After  a  30.6%  contraction  in  the  first half of the year, revenue advanced 2.1% in the second half.\n\nRevenue from directly operated stores, which accounted for almost 70% of the total, retreated 13.4% year  on  year.  This  decrease  stemmed  from  lower in-store  footfall,  directly  impacted  by  the  forced closures  in  the  store  network,  and  could  not  be  fully offset  by  the  near-80%  jump  in  online  sales.  The development of Yves Saint Laurent's e-commerce was spurred  by  the  launch  of  an  online  store  in  China  in June, and then in the fourth quarter, the internalization  of  operations  that  were  previously managed by the joint venture with Yoox.\n\nSales generated in the wholesale network were down 13.7%  year  on  year  on  a  comparable  basis.  The majority  of  the  revenue  loss  was  concentrated  in (i) the United States, reflecting the financial difficulties faced by US wholesalers, and (ii) South Korea, due to the  sharp  decline  in  footfall  for  duty  free  points  of sale.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn view of the proportion of Yves Saint Laurent's sales that  are  generated  in  directly  operated  stores,  the following revenue analysis by region only concerns the retail business.\n\nIn  line  with  the  situation  for  the  luxury  industry  as  a whole,  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  performance  was  mixed across  its  different  geographic  regions,  with  stable sales  in  emerging  markets  and  steep  revenue  falls  in mature markets.\n\nRevenue in the brand's heritage markets fell 21.2%. In North America, the House's penetration in the United States  and  its  buoyant  online  sales  enabled  it  to contain  the  region's  sales  decline,  with  revenue decreasing by just 2.4% for the year as a whole, and a particularly  solid  recovery  in  the  second  half.  In Western  Europe,  revenue  fell  33.8%,  as  the  good performance  generated  from  local  clients, who continued  to  demonstrate  loyalty  to  the  brand,  was not  sufficient  to  offset  the  impact  of  the  collapse  in tourism. In Japan, sales dropped 23.7% due to a poor first  half  and  despite  improved  trends  in  the  last quarter.\n\nIn  emerging  markets,  sales  generated  in  directly operated stores edged up 0.4% compared with 2019. In  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  which  accounted  for  the bulk  of  the  brand's  sales  in  emerging  markets, momentum was very strong in Mainland China, Taiwan and  South  Korea.  However,  the  store  network  in Mainland  China  is  still  being  expanded  and  its  size\n\ndoes not yet match the renown that Yves Saint Laurent enjoys in this country. This meant that the brand was not  able  to  fully  capitalize  on  the  repatriation  of Chinese spending to the local market. Performance in the region's other major countries, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, was weighed down by travel restrictions and the resulting very low tourist numbers.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nGiven the unprecedented situation in 2020, all of Yves Saint  Laurent's  product  categories  recorded  negative performances.\n\nLeather  goods  was  once  again  the  brand's  leading category and was the most resilient. This reflects the initiatives  taken  by  Yves  Saint  Laurent  over  the  last several  years  to  constantly  renew  and  refresh  its leather  goods  offering,  with  a  specially  dedicated creative team, which has helped it to both attract new clients and retain existing clients on all its markets.\n\nReady-to-wear  and  shoes  saw  fairly  similar  revenue trends during the year. However, following the change in  the  brand's  merchandising  strategy  implemented over the past few quarters with the aim of making its offerings  and  price  architecture  for  these  categories more  relevant, the new  collections have been extremely well received by clients, and fourth quarter trends were very promising, especially in Asia.\n\nRoyalties  received  from  Kering  Eyewear  were  lower year  on  year  but  the  decrease  was  contained.  The market  was  less  buoyant  overall  for  fragrances  and cosmetics, and as a result the contraction in L'Or\u00e9al's royalties was more marked.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nYves Saint Laurent ended  2020  with  recurring operating income of \u20ac400 million, versus \u20ac562 million in  2019,  representing  a  year-on-year  decrease  of 28.9%.\n\nRecurring operating margin narrowed by 4.5 points to 22.9% for the full year. It picked up significantly in the second  half,  however,  coming  in  at  28.0%,  just 0.9 points lower than in the same period of 2019.\n\nAs was the case for the Group's other brands, the cost base was reduced throughout the year in order to limit the  dilution  in  profitability  without  too  drastically cutting the operating expenses needed to pursue Yves Saint Laurent's business development in the medium term.\n\nEBITDA  retreated  by  \u20ac144  million,  coming  in  at \u20ac590  million,  with  almost  all  of  the  decrease concentrated in the first half of the year. EBITDA  margin  was  33.8%,  versus  35.8%  as  reported in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There were 17 net store openings during the year,  reflecting  the  brand's  store  network  expansion plan implemented over the past few years and taking into account the restrictions on construction work and store  openings  caused  by  lockdown  measures.  More\n\nthan  half  of  the  openings  were  in  Greater  China  or South Korea - regions where the brand's distribution network does not yet match its potential.\n\nThe House's investments were particularly well managed,  with  prudent  choices  made  in  terms  of prioritizing  capital  expenditure  projects.

Having already won over clientele in mature markets,  the  House's  new  aesthetic  has  now  been taken up by clients within the main Asian markets. In line with its growing momentum, throughout the year the  brand  stepped  up  its  initiatives  in  terms  of communication and engagement with clients  and  all those interested in Bottega Veneta. The brand's digital footprint  broadened  considerably  in  2020,  propelled by its e-commerce activities (whose revenue increased 2.5-fold year on year).\n\n## Revenue\n\nBottega Veneta generated revenue of \u20ac1,210 million in 2020, up 4.8% based on comparable data and 3.7% as reported.  After  retreating  9.5%  in  the  first  half  of  the year  as  a  logical  consequence  of  the  lockdown measures  imposed  in  the  brand's  main  markets, revenue swung back up in the second half, advancing 18.0% at constant exchange rates.\n\nWith  the  aim  of  preserving  its  high-end  positioning and exclusivity, Bottega Veneta's preferred distribution channel  is  its  directly  operated  stores.  However,  as was  the  case  in  2019,  in  2020,  the  brand's  growing appeal  among  wholesale  buyers  enabled  Bottega Veneta to regain market share with wholesalers.\n\nDirectly  operated  stores  accounted  for  73.2%  of  the brand's total sales in 2020  and  their  revenue contracted by 5.3% for the year as a whole. However, it advanced  7.2%  in  the  second  half,  driven  by  strong sales  momentum  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  and e-commerce.\n\nWholesale  sales  jumped  48.5%,  testifying  to  the brand's renewed appeal with professional buyers and market  share  gains  among  key  accounts  in  Western Europe and North America. This excellent performance benefited from the actions taken over the past several years to reorganize the wholesale distribution channel. The underlying aim of these measures, which are set to accelerate, is to only work with best-in-class partners and avoid the risk of saturation at points of sale.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue by region\n\nIn view of the proportion of Bottega Veneta's sales that are generated in directly operated stores, the following revenue  analysis  by  region  only  concerns  the  retail business.\n\nBottega Veneta's appeal grew considerably stronger in Asia  during  2020  after  clients  took  up  the  creative aesthetic of its new collections in most of its mature markets in 2019.\n\nIn  emerging  markets,  the  brand's  sales  advanced 17.5%  year  on  year,  based  on  comparable  data,  with particularly  strong  growth  in  Mainland  China  and South Korea, its two main markets in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn mature markets, revenue retreated 22.9%. In North America,  the  House  contained  its  sales  decrease  to 8.9%,  with  modest  growth  in  the  United  States  and Canada  despite  lockdown-related  store  closures,  but with  a  sharp  drop  in  Hawaii.  In  Western  Europe, revenue generated with local clients increased significantly  but  overall  performance  in  this  market was down 28.6%, hampered by the near-total collapse of  tourism  in  the  region.  In  Japan,  sales  contracted 24.1%,  but  trends  in  the  fourth  quarter  showed  a marked  improvement,  with  Bottega  Veneta's  new artistic direction resonating with clients.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nThe  leather  goods  category  -  which  is  still  Bottega Veneta's core business, accounting for almost 74% of its  total  sales,  including  to  wholesalers  -  posted  a slight revenue decrease for the year as a whole, mainly due to poor performance in the second quarter. In the second half of 2020, sales for this category picked up however. New lines registered very solid performances throughout  the  year,  increasingly  being  used  as carryovers,  while  the  decline  in  sales  of  older  lines became more pronounced.\n\nTotal  revenue  for  all  of  the  brand's  other  categories rose  strongly  in  2020,  buoyed  by  the  success  of  its Women's ready-to-wear and shoes collections, as well as much more favorable bases of comparison than for leather goods.\n\nThe  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  forced Bottega Veneta to postpone the implementation of its planned measures to re-energize its Men's collections, whereas  its  Women's  collections  were  the  first  to benefit  from  Daniel  Lee's  revamping  of  the  brand's offering as from 2019. Year-end trends seem to show a  clear  upturn  in  revenue  for  the  brand's  Men's collections,  which  are  still  a  growth  driver  for  the medium term.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nBottega Veneta's recurring operating income for 2020 totaled  \u20ac172  million,  down  \u20ac43  million  (or  20.1%) compared with 2019.\n\nRecurring operating margin narrowed by 4.2 points to 14.2%  for  the  year  as  a  whole,  but  picked  up  in  the second half, coming in at 18.2% (0.2 points higher than in the same period of 2019).\n\nThe  margin  dilution  was  mainly  attributable  to  a particularly  unfavorable  leverage  effect  in  the  first six  months  of  the  year  due  to  the  sales  decline. Another  contributing  factor  was  an  increase  in operating  expenses  as  the  brand  is  still  in  the investment phase needed to make its revamp a lasting success.  Certain  expenses  aimed  at  helping  Bottega Veneta  in  its  transformation  and  relaunch  processes therefore continued to rise, whereas priorities were set and  cost-saving  plans  launched  for  other  types  of expenditure  as  part  of  an  overall  financial  discipline strategy.  Going  forward,  the  brand's  profitability  is expected  to  improve  gradually,  but  in  the  medium term  it  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  these investments,  which  are  necessary  and  are  being carefully controlled.\n\nEBITDA  totaled  \u20ac333  million  in  2020  and  EBITDA margin narrowed by 4.5 points to 27.6%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Bottega  Veneta  had 261  directly operated stores, including 122  in emerging  markets.  There  were  7  net  store  closures during  the  year.  The  brand  focused  its  investment efforts  on  relocating  and  refurbishing  its  existing stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of  gradual  and targeted  openings  of  new  flagships  (notably  the Omotesando store in Tokyo).\n\nIn  view  of  this  measured  store  network  management and  the  postponement  of  projects  as  a  result  of  the lockdowns during the year, Bottega Veneta's operating investments amounted to \u20ac48 million in 2020, down \u20ac10 million (or 16.3%) on 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its sales  generated  in  directly  operated  stores  were very  robust  and  felt  the  beneficial  effects  of  few store openings and very strong growth for e-commerce. With revenue well above the \u20ac1 billion mark, the brand maintained a high level of  profitability,  even  managing  to  improve  on  its 2019 figure. At the same time, it continued to invest in order to strengthen its organization and operating  structures,  with  a  view  to  sustainably positioning  the  House  at  the  top  of  the  ranks  in terms of creativity, renown and distribution.\n- \u00b7 2020  was  another  year  of  growth  for  Alexander McQueen, which pursued its strategy of enhancing its collections in all of its product categories. During the  year,  it  drew  on  the  success  of  its  sneakers  to extend  its  offering  to  cover  all  segments  in  the shoes  category  and  continued  to  expand  its ready-to-wear  offering,  which  remains  central  to the brand's identity and famous creative edge. The House also enlarged its store network, developed its online sales and improved its profitability in 2020.\n\nPerformances for the jewelry brands were particularly mixed  in  2020.  Boucheron,  Pomellato  and  DoDo entered into new phases in their projects to structure their product  offerings, adapt  their  distribution, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and deploy more ambitious communication  plans. However, their revenue  in  Western  Europe  was  heavily  impacted  by pandemic-related  travel  restrictions,  which  weighed both on the purchasing behavior of major clients and on  tourist  numbers.  In  Asia,  the  jewelry  Houses  saw strong  sales  growth  thanks  to  investments  made  in recent  years  and  a  more  favorable  economic  and health situation. This was notably the case for Qeelin,\n\nwhich is mainly distributed in Greater China and has a design aesthetic directly influenced by Chinese culture. Qeelin  delivered  the  best  revenue  growth  out  of  the entire Group in 2020.\n\nBrioni  and  the  watches  brands  (Girard-Perregaux  and Ulysse  Nardin)  were  hit  hard  by  the  impacts  of  the pandemic.  These  impacts  particularly  affected  the markets (Western Europe) and segments (formal wear) to which these Houses are the most exposed, and also contributed  to  further  polarizing  the  global  watches sector.  The  difficult  situation  was  exacerbated  for these brands in that they had already launched major transformation  and  restructuring  programs.  However, the results for 2020 - both for Brioni and the watches brands  -  do  not  alter  their  strategic  directions,  as there  were  encouraging  signs  in  late  2019  and  the second half of 2020 that they are on the right track.\n\n## Revenue\n\nOverall  revenue  generated  by  the  Other  Houses contracted  9.4%  on  a  comparable  basis  (exchange rates and scope) in 2020, coming in at \u20ac2,282 million. After  a  first  half  that  was  obviously  impacted  by  the lockdown  measures  (with  revenue  down  25.8%), performance improved in the second half with growth of 6.4%.\n\nFollowing  on  from  their  excellent  performances  in 2019, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen held firm in 2020 and both recorded slight sales increases. Qeelin was  the  only  Group  brand  to  report  high  revenue growth, buoyed  by  a  sales  recovery  in  China. Boucheron posted a very solid performance in Asia but suffered from its exposure to the Japanese market - in spite of a sharp upswing in the fourth quarter - and, like Pomellato,  from  its  extensive,  long-standing presence in Western Europe. Sales for the Houses that have  launched  in-depth  transformation  processes  such as Brioni and the watches brands - were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nRevenue generated in stores directly operated by the Other  Houses  retreated  4.9%.  However,  despite  the numerous  store  closures  throughout  the  year,  the proportion  of  sales  contributed  by  this  distribution channel rose from 56% to 58%. This increase was to a large  extent  due  to  the  brands'  strategy  of  increasing",

        "page_content": "exclusive  distribution,  which  led  them  to  open  new stores  during  previous  quarters.  The  rapid  growth  in online sales during the COVID-19 pandemic was also a contributing factor.\n\nSales  in  the  wholesale  network  retreated  13.0%  on  a comparable basis versus 2019, reflecting the combined  effect  of  the  difficulties suffered by distributors  in  North  America  and  the  impacts  of  the pandemic  on  franchisees  and  the  distributors  of  the watches and jewelry brands in Europe and the Middle East.  The  decline  in  wholesale  sales  also  stemmed from the distribution strategy currently being implemented by the main brands, which is  aimed  at concentrating  the  wholesale  business  on  a  restricted number of top quality partners.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nAs was the case for all of the Group's Houses, revenue for the Other Houses was hindered by performances in mature  markets,  where  sales  fell  by  15.3%.  The bearish  consumer  environment  and  lack  of  tourists weighed on sales in Western Europe, which were down 18.7%  year  on  year.  The  watches  and  jewelry  brands were  the  worst  affected,  whereas  Balenciaga  and Alexander  McQueen  proved  more  resilient,  although still reported  negative  growth.  Despite  markedly improved  trends  in  the  fourth  quarter,  revenue  in Japan  contracted  24.7%  for  the  year  as  a  whole.  In North  America,  sales  rebounded  in  the  second  half, which enabled the region to end the year up 1.8% on 2019.\n\nGrowth  in  emerging  markets  (4.1%)  was  closely correlated  to  the  trends  observed  in  the  Asia-Pacific region,  particularly  in  Mainland  China,  where  revenue for  the  Other  Houses  almost  doubled  between  2019 and 2020.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nOver  the  past  year,  the  shoes  and  ready-to-wear categories were  once  again  the  most  dynamic categories, driven by the appeal of the Balenciaga and Alexander  McQueen  collections,  especially  in  the second half.\n\nSales of leather goods held up remarkably well, in both the first and  second  halves  of  the  year.  This performance was closely related to the growing appeal of Balenciaga's offering in the handbags segment.\n\nPerformances  for  the  jewelry  brands  were  mixed across  the  various  regions.  Good  momentum  in emerging markets, combined with the development of e-commerce (which is still marginal for these brands) was  not  sufficient  to  offset  the  revenue  falls  in Boucheron and Pomellato's historical markets.\n\nThe revenue decline for the watches brands was very significant during the period.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nRecurring  operating  income  for  the  Other  Houses amounted  to  \u20ac180  million  in  2020,  representing  a 43.2%  decrease  compared  with  the  \u20ac318  million recorded in 2019. Recurring operating margin narrowed  by  4.6  points  to  7.9%.  This  dilution  was  in line  with  that  of  the  Group's  other  Houses  and  was contained  overall  thanks  to  a  good  second-half performance (when recurring operating margin rose by 0.4 points year on year to 14.1%), following on from a \u20ac12  million  recurring  operating  loss  in  the  first six months.\n\nFor 2020 as a whole, the impact of the revenue decline took  a  particularly  heavy  toll  on  the  profitability  of certain  brands  that  had  neared  break-even  in  2019 and  are  exposed  to  regions  where  fixed  costs represent  a  high  proportion  of  the  overall  cost  base. The  size  of  Balenciaga  and  Alexander  McQueen, however,  meant  that  these  two  brands  were  able  to adjust the amount of their operating costs and, thanks to  their  sales  growth,  were  able  to  increase  their profitability. Conversely, Brioni and the watches brands saw  their  losses  worsen  during  the  year  despite  the cost-saving measures put in place.\n\nEBITDA came in at \u20ac457 million, down just \u20ac93 million on 2019, while EBITDA margin narrowed by 1.7 points to 20.0%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe  Other  Houses  directly  operated  450  stores  as  of December  31,  2020,  or  46  units  more  than  at December 31, 2019. As of the end of 2020, the network comprised  234  stores  in  mature  markets  and  216  in emerging  markets.  Three  quarters  of  the  net  store openings  during  the  year  were  in  the  Asia-Pacific region, mostly in Mainland China and South Korea. The new  openings  mainly  concerned  Balenciaga  and Alexander  McQueen,  which  pursued  their  respective growth  and  exclusive  distribution  strategies,  while adapting them to the changing circumstances.\n\nOperating  investments  for  the  Other  Houses  totaled \u20ac154 million, down 3.2% on 2019. Many projects that had  been  launched  in  the  last  few  months  of  2019 were  not  actually  affected  in  2020,  particularly because they were largely concentrated in Asia, where market momentum for the Other Houses is strong. The investment  program  for  the  second  half  of  the  year was revised in order to allocate resources to the most strategic  projects  and  to  enable  the  brands  -  whose growth  potential  is  still  intact  -  to  roll  out  the expansion plans for their store networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After  a  slight  1.5%  decrease  in  the  first  quarter  reflecting a year-on-year high comparison base due to the  launch  of  the  Balenciaga  and  Montblanc  licenses in early 2019 - in the second quarter Kering Eyewear's business  was  heavily  impacted  (down  49.3%)  by  the brands'  store  closures,  the  virtual  shutdown  of  travel retail, and  distributors'  prudent  buying  behavior. Revenue  picked  up  in  the  second  half  of  the  year despite  the  operating  environment  remaining  very uncertain  for  the  segment,  particularly  due  to  the ongoing decline in orders in the travel retail channel. The contraction in sales during those six months was a contained 8.6%, thanks to the dedicated, high-quality work of Kering Eyewear's teams.\n\nExcluding sales to major international distributors and stores  operated  by  the  Group's  brands,  EMEA  was once again Kering Eyewear's main market, followed by the Americas. The proportion of revenue generated in the  Asia-Pacific  region  (including  Japan)  narrowed slightly  in  2020  due  to  the  strong  weighting  of  travel retail in that region. In terms of distribution channels, local chains and the three 'Os' (Opticians, Optometrists  and  Ophthalmologists)  constitute  the main  sales  channel  for  Kering  Eyewear  (representing over 50% of total sales in 2020). This channel was the most resilient  during  the  year,  with  revenue  more  or less  stable  -  a  performance  that  testifies  to  the effectiveness of Kering Eyewear's commercial set-up.\n\nKering Eyewear's contribution to consolidated revenue for  2020  totaled  \u20ac399  million  (after  eliminating intra-group  sales  and  royalties  paid  to  the  Group's brands),  representing  a  15.0%  year-on-year  decrease at constant exchange rates.\n\nDespite  lower  sales  volumes  and  the  amortization expense recognized on the portion of the compensation paid to Safilo for the early termination of  the  Gucci  license  (which  was  capitalized  in  the Group's balance sheet in an amount of \u20ac14 million as of December 31, 2019 to be amortized in 2020), Kering Eyewear  ended  2020  with  slightly  higher  recurring operating income thanks to the agility and rigor of its management processes.\n\nOverall,  net  costs  recorded  by  the  'Corporate  and other'  segment  for  2020  came  to  approximately \u20ac232 million, \u20ac32 million lower than in 2019.\n\nThe cost of long-term incentive plans, including those of  corporate  officers,  decreased  by  \u20ac21  million  to \u20ac47  million,  in  line  with  the  movement  in  Kering's share price and the number of KMUs awarded.\n\nExcluding the effect of long-term incentive plans, the segment's  recurring  operating  income  rose  by  5.1%, reflecting (i) slightly higher positive contributions from KGS and Kering Eyewear, and (ii)  the  measures  taken to  contain  Corporate  organization  costs  despite  the Group stepping up its digital and innovation initiatives.\n\nGross operating investments amounted to \u20ac326  million,  up  \u20ac22  million  on  2019  due  to  the acceleration of  projects  to  upgrade  all  of  the  Group's information  systems  and,  above  all,  the  logistics operations managed by the Corporate teams on behalf of  the  Group's  brands.  These  investments,  which  are of strategic importance to the Group, were maintained despite the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The 2020 figure includes \u20ac1,631 million in dividends received from subsidiaries (versus \u20ac930 million in 2019).\n\n## 1.6 Transactions with related parties\n\nTransactions  with  related  parties  in  2020  are  described  in  Note  34  -  Transactions  with  related  parties,  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.7 Subsequent events\n\nNo significant events occurred between December 31, 2020 and February 16, 2021 - the date on which the Board of Directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issue.\n\n## 1.8 Outlook\n\nPositioned in structurally fast-growing markets, Kering enjoys  very  solid  fundamentals  and  a  balanced portfolio  of  complementary,  high-potential  brands with clearly focused priorities. The Group's strategy is focused  on  achieving  same-store  revenue  growth while ensuring the targeted and selective expansion of the  store  network  in  order  to  sustainably  grow  its Houses, strengthen the exclusivity of their distribution and consolidate their profitability  profiles.  The  Group is also proactively investing to develop cross-business growth  platforms  in  the  areas  of  e-commerce, omni-channel distribution, logistics and technological infrastructure, expertise, and innovative digital tools.\n\nThe health and subsequent economic crises caused by the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2020  have  had  major consequences  on  consumption  trends,  tourism  flows and  global  economic  growth.  Along  with  the  luxury sector, the Group was deeply impacted by the effects of  the  pandemic  on  its  customers  and  its  business operations, primarily in the first six months of the year. More  favorable  trends  emerged  in  the  second  half, although these remain closely linked to developments in  the  health  situation  and  associated  restrictions across countries and regions.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  Kering  has  taken  all  necessary measures to adapt its cost base, limit the decline in its profitability  and  preserve  its  cash  flow  generation, while  maintaining  the  expenditure  and  investments required  to  protect  its  Houses'  market  positions  and ensure  their  potential  to  bounce  back.  Kering  also continues  to  resolutely  pursue  its  strategy  and  will continue to manage and allocate its resources in order to  support  its  operating  performance,  maintain  high cash  flow  generation  and  optimize  return  on  capital employed.\n\nThanks  to  its  strong  business  model  and  structure, along with its robust financial position, Kering remains confident in its growth potential for the medium and long  term.  While  the  current  environment  remains subject to a number of uncertainties, the crisis has not called  into  question  the  structural  growth  drivers  of the  worldwide  luxury  market,  fully  validating  the pertinence of Kering's strategy and enabling the Group to emerge stronger from the crisis.",

        "page_content": "## 1.9 Definitions of non-IFRS financial indicators\n\n## 'Reported' and 'comparable' revenue\n\nThe Group's 'reported' revenue corresponds to published revenue. The Group also uses 'comparable' data to measure  organic growth. 'Comparable' revenue refers to 2019 revenue adjusted as follows by:\n\n- \u00b7 neutralizing  the  portion  of  revenue  corresponding to entities divested in 2019;\n- \u00b7 including  the  portion  of  revenue  corresponding  to entities acquired in 2020;\n- \u00b7 remeasuring 2019 revenue at 2020 exchange rates.\n\nThese  adjustments  give  rise  to  comparative  data  at constant  scope  and  exchange  rates,  which  serve  to measure organic growth.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these  revenues  and  expenses  are  recurring  or  arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses consist  of  items  that,  by  their  nature,  amount  or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating  performance  as  reflected  in  its  recurring operating  income.  They  include  changes  in  Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\n\n'Recurring  operating  income'  is  therefore  a  major indicator  for  the  Group,  defined  as  the  difference between  operating  income  and  other  non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating  performance  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses and  can  therefore  be  used  as  a  way  to  estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner  that  is  consistent  and  stable  over  the  long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe  Group  uses  EBITDA  to  monitor  its  operating performance.  This  financial  indicator  corresponds  to recurring  operating  income  plus  net  charges  to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current  operating  assets  recognized  in  recurring operating income.\n\n## Free cash flow from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow\n\nThe Group uses an intermediate line item, 'Free cash flow from  operations',  to  monitor  its  financial performance.  This  financial  indicator  measures  net operating  cash  flow  less  net  operating  investments (defined  as  acquisitions  and  disposals  of  property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).\n\nThe Group has also defined a new indicator, 'Available cash  flow  from  operations',  in  order  to  take  into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of  principal  and  interest)  pursuant  to  IFRS  16,  and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.\n\n'Available cash flow' therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends  received,  less  interest  paid  and  equivalent (excluding leases).\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet  debt  is  one  of  the  Group's  main  financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash  equivalents.  Consequently,  the  cost  of  net  debt corresponds  to  all  financial  income  and  expenses associated  with  these  items,  including  the  impact  of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings.\n\nBorrowings  include  put  options  granted  to  minority interests.\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to  the  effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.\n\n## IAS 17-adjusted financial indicators\n\nCertain  key  indicators  such  as  recurring  operating income and EBITDA may be presented on an adjusted IAS 17 basis, i.e., as if IAS 17 had been applied instead of IFRS 16. In such cases, the indicator will be followed by the phrase '(adjusted for IAS 17)'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial  investments  represented net  cash  inflows  of  \u20ac6.2  million  for  2020,  relating mainly  to  the  consolidation  of  the  cash  and  cash equivalents of acquired entities (compared to \u20ac42.4  million  in  net  cash  outflows  for  2019,  relating mainly to measures taken to internalize the production chain and the distribution network).\n\nThe cash impact of the sale of discontinued businesses  (mainly  Sergio  Rossi  and  the  retail businesses  -  Conforama,  Fnac,  Darty  and  Redcats) restated  in  accordance  with  IFRS  5  is  shown  on  the line  'Net  cash  received  from  (used  in)  discontinued operations'  and  represented  a  cash  outflow  of \u20ac4.3 million in 2020 (net cash inflow of \u20ac132.7 million in  2019,  mainly  relating  to  the  disposal  of  Stella McCartney and Volcom).\n\n## 2.2 Operating investments\n\nThe  Group  conducts  a  targeted  investment  policy designed  to  reinforce  both  its  image  and  the  unique positioning  of  its  brands,  as  well  as  to  increase  its return on capital employed.\n\nThe  Group's  investment  policy  is  focused  on  the development of its store network, the conversion and renovation of its existing points of sale, the establishment  and  maintenance  of  manufacturing units  in  the  luxury  sector,  and  the  development  of  IT systems.\n\nGross operating investments amounted to \u20ac787  million  as  of  December  31,  2020,  down  17.7% year on year. For Luxury activities, the 29.3% decrease in investments  reflects  the  continued  focus  on consolidating the existing store network and achieving organic growth, and selective store openings. In 2020, 50%  of  the  Group's  gross  operating  investments concerned the store network (versus 59% in 2019).\n\nGross  operating  investments  for  the  'Corporate  and other'  segment  came  to  \u20ac326  million,  \u20ac22  million higher than in 2019, reflecting the ongoing projects to upgrade  IT  systems  and  measures  taken  to  enhance the Group's logistics capabilities.\n\n## Luxury Houses\n\nThe  Luxury  activities'  gross  operating  investments amounted  to  \u20ac461  million  in  2020,  \u20ac191  million  (or 29.3%) lower than in 2019. As a proportion of revenue, gross operating investments represented 3.6% in 2020 (versus 4.2%  in  2019).  This  slight year-on-year decrease  reflects  the  Houses'  ability  to  adapt  by allocating  their  resources  to  the  highest  priority  and most strategic projects.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group's  Luxury  Houses had  a  network  of  1,433  directly  operated  stores, including  770  (54%)  in  mature  markets  and  663  in emerging  markets.  Net  store  additions  during  2020 totaled 52, representing a 3.8% increase, which is one of  the  lowest  growth  figures  reported  for  years.  This reflects the brands' prudent approach in 2020 in view of the pandemic and the maturity of their networks in mature markets. Most new store openings during the year  were  in  Asia,  mainly  in  Greater  China  and  South Korea  (accounting  for  almost  three  quarters  of  net openings),  and  the  vast  majority  of  the  overall year-on-year  increase  was  due  to  the  scheduled expansion  of  the  Yves  Saint  Laurent,  Balenciaga  and Alexander McQueen networks.\n\nstrong  growth  potential  and  market  positions  that perfectly complement its existing assets.\n\nOperating  investments  are  designed  to  accelerate organic growth for the Group's brands. This is achieved by,  for  example,  developing  and  renovating  the  store network  and  by  investing  in  logistics  centers  and  IT systems.",

        "page_content": "## Gucci\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Gucci  operated  483  stores directly,  including  212  in  emerging  markets.  A  net four new stores were closed during the year. The brand now  has  an  overall  network  that  is  adapted  to  its operations  in  terms  of  store  numbers  but  it  is continuing  to  identify  opportunities  for  improving  its distribution  in  certain  regions  and  sales  channels.  To this  end,  in  2020  it  very  slightly  extended  its  store network  in  Asia  and  reduced  its  exposure  in  mature markets.  Gucci's  priority  remains  organic  growth, especially as it prepares for a revenue recovery in the shortand mid-term. It therefore pursued its refurbishment  program  for  existing  stores  in  2020, although this had to be partly put on hold during the year due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. As of December 31, 2020, around 60% of the store network had  adopted  the  new  concept,  below  the  original target.\n\nGucci's  gross  operating  investments  amounted  to \u20ac206  million  in  2020,  39.0%  lower  than  in  2019. Although this decrease reflects the constraints resulting  from  the  pandemic,  which  led  to  some projects being postponed, it was above all due to the brand's  ability  to  agilely  and  rigorously  adapt  its investment plan to the changes in its revenue levels.\n\n## Yves Saint Laurent\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Yves  Saint  Laurent  directly operated  239  stores,  including  113  in  emerging markets. There were 17 net store openings during the year,  reflecting  the  brand's  store  network  expansion plan implemented over the past few years and taking into account the restrictions on construction work and store  openings  caused  by  lockdown  measures.  More than  half  of  the  openings  were  in  Greater  China  or South Korea - regions where the brand's distribution network does not yet match its potential.\n\nThe House's investments were particularly well managed,  with  prudent  choices  made  in  terms  of prioritizing  capital  expenditure  projects.  Altogether, they  totaled  \u20ac53  million,  down  \u20ac45  million  (46.2%) on 2019.\n\n## Bottega Veneta\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Bottega  Veneta  had 261  directly operated stores, including 122  in emerging markets. There were seven net store closures during  the  year.  The  brand  focused  its  investment efforts  on  relocating  and  refurbishing  its  existing stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of  gradual  and targeted  openings  of  new  flagships  (notably  the Omotesando store in Tokyo).\n\nIn  view  of  this  measured  store  network  management and  the  postponement  of  projects  as  a  result  of  the lockdowns during the year, Bottega Veneta's operating investments amounted to \u20ac48 million in 2020, down \u20ac10 million (or 16.3%) on 2019.\n\n## Other Houses\n\nThe  Other  Houses  directly  operated  450  stores  as  of December  31,  2020,  or  46  units  more  than  at December 31, 2019. As of the end of 2020, the network comprised  234  stores  in  mature  markets  and  216  in emerging  markets.  Three  quarters  of  the  net  store openings  during  the  year  were  in  the  Asia-Pacific region, mostly in Mainland China and South Korea. The new  openings  mainly  concerned  Balenciaga  and Alexander  McQueen,  which  pursued  their  respective growth  and  exclusive  distribution  strategies,  while adapting them to the changing circumstances.\n\nOverall,  gross  operating  investments  for  the  Other Houses  totaled  \u20ac154  million,  down  3.2%  on  2019. Many projects that had been launched in the last few months  of  2019  were  not  actually  affected  in  2020, particularly because they were largely concentrated in Asia, where market momentum for the Other Houses is strong. The investment program for the second half of the year was revised in order to allocate resources to the most strategic projects and to enable the brands whose growth potential is still intact - to roll out the expansion plans for their store networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The downturn was felt particularly in  the  first  half  (down  30.1%  on  a  comparable  basis), with  the  majority  of  the  Group's  stores  gradually forced  to  close  owing  to  the  health  crisis  and lockdown  measures  (on  average,  12%  of  stores  were closed in the first quarter and 42% in the second). This has significantly impacted the Group's second-quarter performance (down 43.7% on a comparable basis) and to some extent on its performance for the first quarter (down 16.4% on a comparable basis), despite a strong start to the year. The decline was limited in the second half  (down  3.2%  on  a  comparable  basis),  despite further  restrictions  and  store  closures  during  the fourth quarter.\n\nRecurring  operating  income  for  2020  came  in  at \u20ac3,135 million, down 34.4% year on year. Once again, the picture was very different in the first and second halves  of  the  year,  with  recurring  operating  income retreating 57.7% in the first half but only 13.5% in the second.  Recurring  operating  margin  for  the  year  was 23.9%. The dilution in the recurring operating margin compared  to  the  previous  year  was  limited  to 6.2  percentage  points.  The  Group  has  put  in  place cost-saving  measures  to  safeguard  its  profitability while continuing to invest in its Houses.\n\nOther than the items mentioned below - which were accounted for  as  non-recurring  operating  expenses  all of the impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic\n\ndescribed in the paragraphs  above  have  been recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  2020  and essentially affect recurring operating income.\n\nIn particular, the costs related to health measures put in place (purchases of hand sanitizer and face masks, exceptional measures for regularly disinfecting premises,  etc.)  have  been  accounted  for  as  recurring operating expenses.\n\nThe rent concessions negotiated with landlords due to the  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  were immediately  recognized  within  recurring  operating income  as  negative  variable  lease  payments  rather than as an amendment to the associated leases. This accounting  method  complies  with  the  simplification measure provided for in the Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases , issued  by  the  IASB  on  May  28,  2020  and adopted by the European Union on October 9, 2020.\n\nImpairment losses on current assets (inventories and trade receivables) - caused indirectly by the pandemic due  to  slow-moving  inventory  items  from  the Spring/Summer collections and the difficulties suffered  by  many  wholesale  accounts  -  have  been recognized as recurring operating expenses.\n\nExcluding the impact of the gain on the disposal of an additional 5.83% stake in PUMA in October 2020, other non-recurring operating income and expenses represented  a  \u20ac542  million  net  expense  (versus  a \u20ac168  million  net  expense  for  2019).  The  COVID-19 impact recognized as non-recurring expenses",

        "page_content": "therefore  amounted  to  \u20ac390  million,    essentially breaking down as \u20ac15 million in exceptional donations to support various organizations in their fight against the  pandemic  and  \u20ac368  million  in  asset  impairment losses.  The  asset  impairment  losses  were  recognized following  impairment  tests  performed  by  estimating the recoverable amount of the Houses' assets that had already  been  written  down  in  2019.  The  Houses concerned  were  Brioni  and  the  watches  brands (Girard-Perregaux  and  Ulysse  Nardin),  which  were  hit particularly hard by the pandemic while in the midst of an  ambitious  but  demanding  transformation  project. Impairment losses recognized in 2020 mainly related to brands (\u20ac328 million) and a lease right-of-use asset (\u20ac30 million).\n\nTo  date,  the  Group  considers  that  the  contraction  in business in 2020 and the outlook for the luxury goods market are not sufficient indicators that the recoverable amount of the assets of the Group's other brands  may  be  impaired,  except  those  mentioned  in the above paragraph (see Notes 9 and 15).\n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have also been taken  into  consideration  for  calculating  the  Group's corporate income tax. The global decrease in profits for the  vast  majority  of  multinationals  has  raised  the question of how profits and losses should be allocated by country. In connection with this, on December  18,  2020  the  OECD  published  guidance  on the  transfer  pricing  implications  of  the  pandemic, offering  a  wide  range  of  different  proposals.  Based  on this  guidance,  Kering  considered  it  was  reasonable  to keep the main principles of its current transfer pricing policy, but to adapt some of its aspects where necessary\n\nto  the  particular  conditions  caused  by  the  pandemic. The Group is confident that its estimates at December 31, 2020 are fair and prudent (see Note 11).\n\nLastly,  the  Group  has  analyzed  its  exposure  to  the financial  risks  set  out  in  its  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nIn  particular,  it  found  no  significant  escalation  of credit  risk  across  the  Group.  In  fact,  as  it  has  a  large number  of  customers  in  a  wide  range  of  business segments and realizes a significant portion of its sales directly  with  the  end  customer,  direct  sales  do  not expose the Group to any credit risk. For sales through wholesalers, there is no  strong  dependency  or concentration  whereby  the  loss  of  one  or  more wholesalers  could  significantly  affect  the  Group's earnings. Credit risk with respect to wholesalers is also minimized  by  taking  out  credit  insurance  and implementing an appropriate  and  prudent  credit  risk strategy managed Group-wide by a dedicated team.\n\nConcerning  liquidity  risk,  the  Group  took  action  very early  on  in  the  pandemic,  when  countries  started going  into  lockdown  after  China.  In  order  to  ensure liquidity,  the  Group  now  has  \u20ac4,365  million  in  total confirmed  credit  lines  (versus  \u20ac3,035  million  as  of December  31,  2019),  of  which  \u20ac4,365  million  is undrawn.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group  had \u20ac3,443 million in available cash. In addition, in order to  pro-actively  manage  the  Group's  liquidity,  in  the first  half  of  2020  Kering  carried  out  a  \u20ac1.2  billion dual-tranche bond issue comprising (i) a \u20ac600 million tranche with a three-year maturity and a 0.25% coupon, and (ii) a \u20ac600 million tranche with an eight-year maturity and a 0.75% coupon (see Note 23).\n\n## 2.2 Significant events of 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  significant  events  below  have  already  been disclosed  by  the  Group  in  press  releases  related  to regulated  information.  Most  significant  events  took place in the first half of the year.\n\n## Postponement of the Annual General Meeting to June 16, 2020\n\nIn  view  of  the  circumstances,  on  March  30,  2020, Kering's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  postpone  the 2020  Annual  General  Meeting  initially  scheduled  for Thursday April 23, 2020. On April 21, 2020, the Board set the new Meeting date as June 16, 2020.\n\n## Revised dividend per share for 2019\n\nIn  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on business  activity,  on  April  21,  2020  the  Board  of Directors  decided  to  revise  the  amount  allocated  to the  2019  dividend  payment  and  to  recommend  to shareholders at Kering SA's Annual General Meeting on June  16,  2020  that  the  total  dividend  payout  should\n\namount  to  \u20ac1,010  million,  corresponding  to  \u20ac8  per share.  This  is  \u20ac442  million  lower  than  the  amount announced when the Group released its 2019 results on  February  12,  2020  (\u20ac1,452  million,  or  \u20ac11.50  per share).\n\n## Reduction in remuneration for 2020 for Kering's executive corporate officers\n\nIn  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on business  activity,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  Chairman and CEO of Kering, decided to reduce the fixed portion of  his  salary  from  April  1,  until  the  end  of  2020.  In addition,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, Group Managing Director, decided to waive the entirety  of  the  variable  portions  of  their  annual remuneration for 2020. These decisions were approved by Kering's Board of Directors on April  21,  2020.  The  Board  therefore  submitted  a revised  2020  remuneration  policy  to  the  vote  of  the shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on June 16, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  the  same  time,  the  Balenciaga  and  Yves Saint Laurent workshops began manufacturing officially  approved  face  masks.  Kering  also  made  a financial  donation  to  the  Institut  Pasteur  for  its research into COVID-19, and to Cochin hospital in Paris for its '3D COVID' project to purchase 60 3D printers in order  to  rapidly  produce  large  quantities  of  medical equipment.  In  Italy,  Kering  and  its  Houses  made donations  to  four  major  hospital  foundations  in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio. Gucci responded  to  the  appeal  launched  to  the  fashion industry by the Tuscany regional authorities, supplying 1.1 million surgical masks  and  55,000  medical overalls to health workers. In China, as early as the end of  January,  Kering  and  its  Houses  announced  a donation to  the  Hubei  Red  Cross  Foundation  to  help fight  the  spread  of  the  virus.  In  the  United  States, Kering and its Houses entered into a partnership with the  CDC  Foundation,  giving  a  $1  million  donation  to provide  personal  protection  equipment  and  other essential  supplies  to  health  workers.  This  donation\n\nhelped support front-line health workers in the United States - and particularly the hardest hit States such as New York, New Jersey, California and Florida - as well as in a number of regions in Latin America.\n\n## Pro-active management of the Group's liquidity - a new bond issue and extension of syndicated loan facilities\n\nIn May  2020,  Kering  carried  out  a  \u20ac1.2  billion dual-tranche bond issue comprising (i) a \u20ac600 million tranche  with  a  three-year  maturity  and  a  0.25% coupon,  and  (ii)  a  \u20ac600  million  tranche  with  an eight-year maturity and a 0.75% coupon. In line with the Group's pro-active liquidity management approach,  this  issue  enables  Kering  to  diversify  its sources of financing and enhance its funding flexibility through  refinancing  of  existing  debt  and  extending the  maturity  of  its  financing  facilities.  Investors'  high take-up  rate  of  the  issue  confirmed  the  market's confidence  in  the  Group's  creditworthiness.  Kering's long-term debt is rated 'A-'  with  a  stable  outlook  by Standard & Poor's.\n\nThe  Group  also  extended  its  credit  facilities  from  its banks in an aggregate amount of \u20ac1,330 million, giving it  \u20ac4,365  million  in  total  confirmed  credit  lines  as  of December  31,  2020,  versus  \u20ac3,035  million  as  of December 31, 2019 (see Note 23).\n\n## NOTE 3 - OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2020\n\n## Sale of an additional 5.83% stake in PUMA\n\nOn  October  8,  2020,  the  Group  further  reduced  its investment in PUMA by selling a 5.83% stake through an  accelerated  bookbuilding  process  with  qualified investors at a price of \u20ac74.50 per share, corresponding\n\nto  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac656  million.  Following  the transaction,  Kering  retains  a  9.87%  interest  in  PUMA (see Notes 9, 18 and 19).\n\n## NOTE 4 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nNo significant events occurred between December 31, 2020 and February 16, 2021 - the date on which the Board of Directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issue.",

The  Group recognizes  its  obligation  as  services  are  rendered  by the beneficiaries, over the period from the grant date to the vesting date:\n\n- \u00b7 the grant date is the date on which the plans were individually approved by the relevant decision-making body (Board of Directors or other) and corresponds to the initial measurement date of the plans;\n- \u00b7 as from the grant date, the rights vesting period is the  so-called  'lock-in'  period  during  which  the specified  vesting  conditions  are  to  be  satisfied\n\n- (service conditions for all beneficiaries, plus performance  conditions  for  executive  corporate officers);\n- \u00b7 the  exercise  date  is  the  date  at  which  all  of  the specified  vesting  conditions  have  been  satisfied, and as of which the beneficiaries are entitled to ask for  payment  of  their  rights.  Vested  rights  may  be exercised over a period of two years, during which beneficiaries can opt to cash out some or all of their KMUs in April or October, at their discretion, based on the most recently determined value.\n\nThe unit value of the KMUs awarded is determined and changes  based  on  intrinsic  movements  in  the  Kering share and in comparison with the average increase in a basket of seven stocks from the luxury industry.",

The performance  adjustment  ratio  used  to  calculate  the final  number of shares to be delivered is determined in  line  with  Kering's  share  performance  over  the three-year  vesting  period  versus  the  performance  of the  industry  as  a  whole,  as  measured  based  on  an index  of  eight  European  luxury  stocks.  As  well  as  the performance conditions applicable to all beneficiaries, specific performance conditions apply to the corporate  officers,  as  outlined  at  the  Annual  General Meeting of June 16, 2020.\n\n## Other free share and performance share plans\n\nKering  may  also  include  share-based  payments  in plans  specifically  introduced  for  key  executives  from the  Houses,  reflecting  the  creation  of  value  at  their respective brands.\n\nA plan of this type was set up in 2020 and provides for settlement  in  Kering  shares  after  a  vesting  period  of five  years.  The  fair  value  of  this  benefit  at  the  grant date  was  calculated  by  an  independent  expert  using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods, and was finalized in the second half of the year, amounting to \u20ac54.7 million.\n\n## NOTE 9 - OTHER NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nSee Note 35.1.3 for details of other non-recurring operating items shown within operating income.\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                              | Notes   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Non-recurring operating expenses                             |         | (542.4) | (173.0) |\n| Impairment of goodwill, brands and other non-current  assets | 15      | (446.6) | (94.9)  |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                       |         | (51.1)  | (8.6)   |\n| Impairment of brands                                         |         | (327.7) | (68.1)  |\n| Impairment of other non-current assets                       |         | (67.8)  | (18.2)  |\n| Other non-recurring operating expenses                       |         | (95.8)  | (78.1)  |\n| Restructuring costs                                          | 27      | (41.3)  | (28.5)  |\n| Other                                                        |         | (54.5)  | (49.6)  |\n| Non-recurring operating income                               |         | 705.4   | 4.5     |\n| Capital gain on PUMA shares                                  | 18, 19  | 704.6   | -       |\n| Other non-recurring operating income                         |         | 0.8     | 4.5     |\n| TOTAL                                                        |         | 163.0   | (168.5) |\n\n## Impairment of goodwill, brands and other non-current assets\n\nIn 2020, asset impairment represented \u20ac446.6 million (2019: \u20ac94.9 million) and chiefly concerned the Ulysse Nardin, Girard-Perregaux and Brioni brands (\u20ac327.7 million), particularly hard hit by the pandemic.

The remaining balance of other non-recurring operating expenses essentially relates to expenses incurred in connection with disputes.\n\n## Non-recurring operating income\n\nThe  Group  continued  to  reduce  its  investment  in PUMA,  selling  a  5.83%  stake  at  a  price  of  \u20ac74.50  per share  on  October  8,  2020.  As  a  result,  it  booked  a capital gain on the sale of its 5.83% interest and on the remeasured value of its remaining 9.87% shareholding.

Other non-recurring operating expenses related mainly to expenses incurred in connection with disputes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They reflect  the  Group's  application  of  the  latest  OECD transfer  pricing  guidelines  dated  December  18,  2020, which take into account the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n'Permanent  differences'  result  from  expenses  not deductible and/or income not taxable pursuant to the tax  laws  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  does\n\nbusiness.  A  significant  permanent  difference  arose  in France  in  2020  upon  the  sale  of  the  Group's  5.83% stake in PUMA as a long-term equity investment, and was  recognized  within  'Differences  relating  to  other non-recurring operating income and expenses'.\n\n'Other  differences'  mainly  relate  to  other  taxes,  such as the IRAP regional production tax in Italy, the CVAE tax on value-added in France, tax credits, and possibly tax reassessments.\n\nThe  Group's  entities  frequently  undergo  tax  audits carried  out  by  the  tax  authorities  in  the  countries  in which  it  does  business.  Uncertain  tax  positions  are analyzed  and  reviewed  internally  in  accordance  with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23.\n\n## 11.3 Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                               | Dec. 31, 2019   | Income statement   | Gains and losses recognized in equity   | Other changes (1)   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                           | 1,367.6         | (158.9)            | (5.6)                                   | (25.7)              | 1,177.4         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                      | (1,530.4)       | 53.8               | (8.2)                                   | (0.3)               | (1,485.1)       |\n| Net deferred tax assets  (liabilities)                        | (162.8)         | (105.1)            | (13.8)                                  | (26.0)              | (307.7)         |\n| Value of brands                                               | (1,503.5)       | 48.1               |                                         | (0.1)               | (1,455.5)       |\n| Inventories: elimination  of internal margins  and impairment | 803.8           | (5.4)              |                                         | (8.3)               | 790.1           |\n| Other adjustments                                             | 396.9           | (82.9)             | (13.8)                                  | (15.9)              | 284.3           |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                                        | 140.0           | (64.9)             |                                         | (1.7)               | 73.4            |\n\n## 11.4 Unrecognized deferred tax assets\n\n(in \u20ac millions)\n\nDeferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards\n\n288.5\n\n356.7\n\nDeferred tax assets on other temporary differences\n\n35.6\n\n34.6\n\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets\n\n324.1\n\n391.3\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                             | Notes   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Unrecognized tax loss carryforwards expiring in  (tax base) |         | 825.5   | 902.2   |\n| less than five years                                        |         | 420.4   | 418.2   |\n| more than five years                                        |         | 405.1   | 484.0   |\n| Indefinite unrecognized tax loss carryforwards  (tax base)  |         | 607.3   | 679.8   |\n| Total unrecognized tax loss carryforwards  (tax base)       |         | 1,432.8 | 1,582.0 |\n\nNotes\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  redemption  and/or  exchange price  of  these  bonds  is  therefore  linked  to  changes  in the PUMA share price. As of December 31, 2020 and at the issue date, the reference exchange price was set at \u20ac92.17.\n\nBased on market data as of December 31, 2020, a 10% increase  in  PUMA's  share  price  would  have  a  positive \u20ac137  million  impact  on  the  total  value  of  the  PUMA shares  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet,  but  a\n\nnegative  \u20ac33  million  impact  on  the  Group's  pre-tax consolidated  income  owing  to  the  \u20ac33  million increase  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  equity component recognized  as  a  derivative  liability  at  fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Conversely, a 10%  decrease  in  PUMA's  share  price  would  have  a negative \u20ac137 million impact on the total value of the PUMA shares in the consolidated balance sheet, but a positive  \u20ac27  million  impact  on  the  Group's  pre-tax consolidated  income  owing  to  the  \u20ac27  million decrease  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  equity component recognized  as  a  derivative  liability  at  fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOther shares held in connection with non-consolidated investments represent a low exposure risk for the Group and are not hedged.\n\n## 24.4 Exposure to precious metals price risk\n\nThe Group may be exposed to fluctuations in the price of  certain  precious  metals  within  the  scope  of  its brands' activities in the Watches and Jewelry segments. Hedges may therefore be put in place by contracting derivative  financial  instruments  to  fix  the  production cost or by negotiating prices with refiners or manufacturers of semi-finished products.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, these hedging transactions with  a  residual  maturity  of  less  than  one  year  are\n\n## 24.5 Exposure to counterparty risk\n\nThe  Group  trades  derivatives  over-the-counter  in compliance  with  its  internal  control  procedures.  The trades  are  carried  out  with  bluechip  companies  that\n\nhave signed FBF or ISDA-type agreements. The impact of  counterparty  risk  on  the  fair  value  of  derivative instruments pursuant to IFRS 13 is deemed to be zero.\n\ntreated as forward purchases for a notional amount of \u20ac9.4  million.  Their  market  value  is  not  material (notional amount of \u20ac6.3 million as of December 31, 2019).\n\nA sudden 1% increase or decrease in precious metals prices  would  have  a  direct  impact  of  \u20ac0.1  million (excluding the tax effect) on equity on the revaluation reserve line.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  additional  benefits take  the  form  of  defined  contribution  or  defined benefit plans.\n\nUnder  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Group  is  not obliged  to  make  any  additional  payments  beyond contributions  already  made.  Contributions  to  these plans are expensed as incurred.\n\nAn actuarial valuation of defined benefit plans is carried out  by  independent  experts.  These  benefits  primarily concern  mandatory  supplementary  pension  plans  in Switzerland,  statutory  dismissal  compensation  in  Italy, and retirement termination payments and long-service bonuses in France.\n\n## Mandatory supplementary pension plans (LPP) - Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, pension plans are defined contribution plans that guarantee a minimum yield and provide for a fixed salary conversion rate on retirement. However, the pension plans operated by the Group's entities in Switzerland  offer  benefits  over  and  above  those stipulated in the LPP/BVG pension law. Consequently, a provision is booked in respect of defined benefit plans for  the  amounts  that  exceed  LPP/BVG  pension  law requirements.\n\nThese  pension  plans  are  generally  operated  as separate  legal  entities  in  the  form  of  a  foundation, which may be a collective institution or affiliated to a specific plan. The  Board  of  Trustees  of  these\n\nfoundations, comprising an equal number of employer and  employee  representatives,  is  responsible  for administering the plan and bears the investment and longevity  risks.  Collective  foundations  insure  some  of their risk with an insurance company.\n\n## Statutory dismissal compensation (TFR) - Italy\n\nThe  TFR (Trattamento  di  Fine  Rapporto) plans  in  Italy were created by Law no. 297, adopted on May 29, 1982, and are applicable to all workers in the private  sector  on  termination  of  employment  for whatever  reason  (resignation,  termination  at  the employer's initiative,  death,  incapacity  or  retirement). Since  2007,  companies  with  at  least  50  employees have had to transfer their TFR funding to an external fund  manager.  This  concerns  the  large  majority  of plans operated by Kering group companies.\n\n## Retirement termination payments and long-service bonuses - France\n\nIn  France,  retirement  termination  benefits  are  fixed and  paid  by  companies  to  their  employees  on retirement. The amount paid depends on the years of service  on  retirement,  and  is  defined  in  the  relevant collective bargaining agreement. The payments do not confer any vested entitlement to employees until they reach retirement age. Retirement termination benefits are not related to other statutory retirement benefits such  as  pensions  paid  by  social  security  bodies  or top-up  pension  funds  such  as  ARRCO  and  AGIRC  in France, which are defined contribution plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nevertheless,\n\nsome  of  Kering's  French  entities  choose  to  pay long-service bonuses after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of service.\n\n## 26.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                             | Notes   |   Dec. 31, 2020 |   Dec. 31, 2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Non-current provisions                                      |         |           107.5 |           106.5 |\n| Current provisions                                          |         |            12.2 |             8.9 |\n| Provisions for pensions and other  post-employment benefits |         |           119.7 |           115.4 |\n\n|                                             | 2020                                | 2020                      | 2020                                                         | 2020                                   | 2020                 | 2019                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             |                                     |                           |                                                              | Change of the period                   | Change of the period |                                                              |\n| (in \u20ac millions)                             | Present value of benefit obligation | Fair value of plan assets | Provisions for pensions and other post- employment  benefits | Gains and losses recognized  in equity | Income statement     | Provisions for pensions and other post- employment  benefits |\n| As of January 1                             | 217.5                               | 102.1                     | 115.4                                                        |                                        |                      | 96.6                                                         |\n| Current service cost                        | 14.5                                |                           | 14.5                                                         |                                        | (14.5)               | 11.9                                                         |\n| Plan amendments                             |                                     |                           | -

The impact  on  the  Group  of  the  other  new  standards, amendments and interpretations whose application is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 is not material.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  will  apply  the  amendments  to IFRS  9  and  IFRS  7  Interest  Rate  Benchmark  Reform Phase 2 as of 2021, as required by the IASB.\n\n## 35.1.2 Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements requires  Group  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  can  affect  the  carrying  amounts  of certain assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and the  disclosures  in  the  accompanying  notes.  Group management reviews these estimates and assumptions on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  their  pertinence  with respect  to  past  experience  and  the  current  economic situation.  Items  in  future  financial  statements  may differ  from  current  estimates as a result of changes in these assumptions. The impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognized during the period in which the change occurs and all affected future periods.\n\nThe  main  estimates  made  by  management  in  the preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements concern  goodwill  and  brands,  the  useful  lives  of property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets, contingency  provisions  and  uncertain  tax  positions, inventory impairment provisions, assumptions used to calculate lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, provisions  for  pensions  and  long-term  remuneration including  share-based  payment,  the  recognition  of deferred tax assets and certain financial instruments.\n\nIn addition to the use of estimates, Group management uses judgment to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for certain transactions, pending the clarification of certain IFRSs  or  where  prevailing standards do not cover the issue at hand. Put options granted to minority interests, for example, are a case in point.\n\n## 35.1.3 Use of alternative performance indicators\n\nThe  alternative  performance  indicators  used  by  the Group  and  presented  in  the  consolidated  financial statements are:\n\n## Recurring operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these  revenues  and  expenses  are  recurring  or  arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses consist  of  items  that,  by  their  nature,  amount  or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating  performance  as  reflected  in  its  recurring operating  income.  They  include  changes  in  Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes (see Note 9).\n\n'Recurring  operating  income'  is  therefore  a  major indicator  for  the  Group,  defined  as  the  difference between  operating  income  and  other  non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating  performance  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses and  can  therefore  be  used  as  a  way  to  estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner  that  is  consistent  and  stable  over  the  long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information (see Note 5).\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe  Group  uses  EBITDA  to  monitor  its  operating performance.  This  financial  indicator  corresponds  to recurring  operating  income  plus  net  charges  to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current  operating  assets  recognized  in  recurring operating income (see Note 5).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nConsolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to  the  effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses (see Notes 9 and 11).\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet  debt  is  one  of  the  Group's  main  financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and\n\n## 35.2 Consolidation principles\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the  financial  statements  of  the  companies  listed  in Note  36.  They  include  the  financial  statements  of companies acquired as from the acquisition date and companies sold up until the date of disposal.\n\n## 35.2.1 Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured entities)  over  which  the  Group  exercises  control. Control is defined according to three criteria: (i) power over  the  investee;  (ii)  exposure,  or  rights,  to  variable returns  from  involvement  with  the  investee;  and (iii)  the  ability  to  exert  power  over  the  investee  to affect  the  amount  of  the  investor's  returns.  This definition  of  control  implies  that  power  over  an investee  can  take  many  forms  other  than  simply holding  voting  rights.  The  existence  and  effect  of potential voting rights are considered when assessing control, if the rights are substantive. Control generally implies directly or indirectly holding more than 50% of the voting rights but can also exist when less than 50% of the voting rights are held.\n\nSubsidiaries  are  consolidated  from  the  effective  date of control.\n\nIntercompany  assets  and  liabilities  and  transactions between  consolidated  companies  are  eliminated. Gains  and  losses  on  internal  transactions  with controlled companies are fully eliminated.\n\n## 35.2.2 Associates\n\nAssociates are all entities in which the Group exercises a  significant  influence  over  the  entity's  management and financial policy, without exercising control or joint control. This generally implies holding 20% to 50% of the voting rights.\n\nAssociates  are  recognized  using  the  equity  method and  initially  measured  at  cost,  except  when  the associates were previously controlled by the Group, in which case they are measured at fair value through the income statement as of the date control is lost.\n\ncash  equivalents.  Consequently,  the  cost  of  net  debt corresponds  to  all  financial  income  and  expenses associated  with  these  items,  including  the  impact  of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings  (see  Note  10).  Borrowings  include  put options granted to minority interests (see Note 35.21).\n\nSubsequently,  the  share  in  profits  or  losses  of  the associate  attributable  to  the  Group  is  recognized  in 'Share in earnings (losses) of equity-accounted companies',  and  the  share  in  other  comprehensive income of  associates  is  carried  on  a  separate  line  of the  statement  of  comprehensive  income.  If  the Group's  share  in  the  losses  of  an  associate  equals  or exceeds its investment in that associate, the Group no longer recognizes its share of losses, unless it has legal or  constructive  obligations  to  make  payments  on behalf of the associate.\n\nGoodwill  related  to  an  associate  is  included  in  the carrying amount of the investment, presented separately  within  'Investments  in  equity-accounted companies' in the balance sheet.\n\nGains or losses on internal transactions with equity-accounted  associates  are  eliminated  in  the amount of the Group's investment in these companies.\n\n## 35.2.3 Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations,  where  the  Group  acquires control of one or more other activities, are recognized using the acquisition method.\n\nBusiness combinations are recognized and measured in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  revised IFRS  3.  Accordingly,  the  consideration  transferred (acquisition price) is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities  incurred  by  the  acquirer  at  the  date  of exchange. Identifiable assets and liabilities are generally measured  at  their  fair  value  on  the acquisition  date.  Costs  directly  attributable  to  an acquisition are recognized within other non-recurring operating expenses in the income statement.",

If the difference is negative, the  gain  on  the  bargain  purchase  is  immediately recognized  in  the  income  statement  within  other non-recurring operating income.\n\nThe  Group  may  choose  to  measure  any  minority interests resulting from each business combination at fair value (full goodwill method) or at the proportionate  share  in  the  identifiable  net  assets acquired,  which  are  also  generally  measured  at  fair value (partial goodwill method).\n\n## 35.3 Foreign currency translation\n\n## 35.3.1 Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each Group entity  are  valued  using  the  currency  of  the  primary economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates (functional currency). The Group's consolidated financial statements  are  presented  in  euros,  which  serves  as  its presentation currency.\n\n## 35.3.2 Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are recognized  in  the  entity's  functional  currency  at  the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nMonetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the closing exchange rate at the end of each reporting period. Any  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses resulting from this translation or from the settlement of  these  monetary  items  are  recognized  within  other financial income  and  expenses  in  the  income statement.\n\nNon-monetary  items  in  foreign  currencies  valued  at historical cost are translated at the rate prevailing on the  transaction  date,  and  non-monetary  items  in foreign currencies measured  at fair value are translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  date  the  fair value  is  determined.  When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a non-monetary  item  is  recognized  directly  in  equity within other comprehensive income, similar treatment is  applied to the foreign exchange component of this gain  or  loss.  Otherwise,  the  component  is  recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe  treatment  of  currency  hedges  in  the  form  of derivatives is described in Note 35.17.\n\nGoodwill  is  determined  at  the  date  control  over  the acquired  entity  is  obtained  and  may  not  be  adjusted after the measurement period. No additional goodwill is recognized  on  any  subsequent  acquisition  of minority  interests.  Acquisitions  and  disposals  of minority  interests  are  recognized  directly  in  equity attributable to the Group.\n\nThe  accounting  for  a  business  combination  must  be completed within 12 months of the acquisition date. This applies to the measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities,  consideration  transferred  and  minority interests.\n\n## 35.3.3 Translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe  income  statement  and  balance  sheet  of  Group entities  with  a  functional  currency  that  differs  from the presentation currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 items  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  other  than equity  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the end of the reporting period;\n- \u00b7 income  and  cash  flow  statement  items  are translated  at  the  average  exchange  rate  for  the period,  corresponding  to  an  approximate  value  for the  rate  at  the  transaction  date  in  the  absence  of significant fluctuations;\n- \u00b7 translation  differences  are  recognized  directly  in equity  within  other  comprehensive  income  as currency translation adjustments.\n\nGoodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising  from  a business  combination  with  a  foreign  activity  are recognized  in  the  functional  currency  of  the  entity acquired.  They  are  subsequently  translated  into  the Group's presentation currency at the closing exchange rate,  and  any  resulting  differences  are  recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.\n\n## 35.3.4 Net investment in a foreign subsidiary\n\nCurrency  translation  adjustments  arising  on  the translation of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive income, and are transferred to income on the disposal of the net investment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  operating segment is monitored separately for internal reporting purposes, according to performance indicators common to all of the Group's segments. The segments presented are operating segments or groups of similar operating segments.\n\nFinancial information provided on operating segments is  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  same  accounting rules as in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  performance  of  each  operating  segment  is measured based on recurring operating income, which is  the  approach  used  by  the  Group's  chief  operating decision maker.\n\n## 35.5 Revenue\n\nRevenue  mainly  comprises  sales  of  goods,  together with  income  from  associated  services,  and  income from royalties and operating licenses.\n\n## 35.5.1 Sales of goods and associated services\n\nSales  of  goods,  whether  through  a  retail  network, online  or  wholesale  operations,  are  recognized  when the  Group  satisfies  its  performance  obligation  to  its clients, typically upon delivery.\n\nSales of goods are measured:\n\n- \u00b7 at the fair value of the consideration received;\n- \u00b7 excluding taxes;\n- \u00b7 net of any rebates or discounts;\n\nto  the  extent  that  the  hedge  is  effective.  They  are transferred  to  the  income  statement  on  the  disposal of the net investment hedged.\n\nNet  recurring  charges  to  depreciation,  amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets reflect net charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions  on  intangible  assets,  lease  right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment recognized in recurring operating income.\n\nAcquisitions  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible  assets  correspond  to  gross  non-current asset purchases, including cash timing differences, as presented in the consolidated cash statement.\n\nSegment assets comprise goodwill, brands and other intangible  assets,  lease  right-of-use  assets,  property, plant and  equipment,  other  non-current  assets, inventories, trade receivables and other current assets.\n\nSegment liabilities comprise deferred tax liabilities on brands,  lease  liabilities,  trade  payables  and  other current liabilities.\n\nThe  presentation  of  revenue  by  geographic  area  is based on the geographic location of clients. Non-current segment assets are not broken down by geographic  area  since  these  assets  largely  consist  of goodwill and brands, which are analyzed based on the revenue  generated  in  each  region,  and  not  based  on their geographic location.\n\n- \u00b7 net of any returned goods, when a wholesaler has a contractual  right  of  return  or  routinely  makes returns,  in  which  case  a  specific  provision  is  set aside.  When  such  returns  are  not  contractual,  the provision for returns is estimated  based  on historical data. Provisions for returns are presented in  the  balance  sheet  under  liabilities  in  respect  of future  refunds.  A  corresponding  asset  (with  an offsetting adjustment to cost of sales) representing the right to recover the goods from the client is also recognized;\n- \u00b7 in  the  event  of  deferred  payment  beyond  habitual credit  terms  that  is  not  backed  by  a  financing institution,  the  revenue  from  the  sale  corresponds to the discounted price. The difference between the discounted  price  and  the  cash  value  is  recognized under  other  financial  income  and  expenses  within 'Financial result'.",

Wages,  salaries  and  payroll  taxes  include  fixed remuneration, variable short-term remuneration,\n\nlong-term  remuneration  plans,  expenses  related  to employee  profit-sharing  and  other  incentive  plans, and  any  associated  payroll  taxes.  Other  personnel expenses notably include severance paid to individual employees  or  as  part  of  a  restructuring  plan,  and directors' fees paid to directors of Group entities.\n\n## 35.7 Share-based payment\n\nThe Group may operate long-term variable remuneration plans that feature share-based payments.  These  plans  are  classified  as  either cash-settled plans or plans settled in Kering shares.\n\nCash-settled plans result in the recognition of personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement  spread over the rights vesting period and a matching liability in  the  balance  sheet.  The  fair  value  of  the  benefit granted to the beneficiaries is remeasured at the end of  each  reporting  period,  taking  into  account  any changes  in  market-based  or  internal  performance conditions.\n\nPlans settled in Kering shares result in the recognition of personnel expenses in the income statement spread over the rights vesting period and an offsetting entry in  equity  attributable  to  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of the  benefit  granted  to  the  beneficiaries  is  set  at  the grant date of the plan using the Black & Scholes and\n\n## 35.8 Income taxes\n\nIncome  tax  expense  comprises  the  current  and deferred tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the liability method on all temporary differences between  the  carrying amount  recorded  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet and  the  tax  value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  except  for goodwill  that  is  not  deductible  for  tax  purposes  and certain other exceptions. The valuation of deferred tax balances  depends  on  the  way  in  which  the  Group intends  to  recover  or  settle  the  carrying  amount  of assets  and  liabilities,  using  tax  rates  that  have  been enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  end  of  the reporting period.\n\nMonte  Carlo  models,  which  take  into  account  the impacts of any market-based performance conditions as from the inception of the plan. The impacts of any internal-based performance conditions are remeasured at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe payroll taxes relating to these long-term variable remuneration  plans  are  also  recognized  in  personnel expenses in the income statement as the rights under the plans vest, with a matching liability in the balance sheet,  regardless  of  whether  the  plans  are  settled  in cash  or  in  Kering  shares.  These  payroll  taxes  are remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on  the  most  certain  assumptions  as  regards  the outcome  of  the  plans.  Payroll  taxes  relating  to  plans settled in Kering shares reflect the best estimate of the number of shares to be delivered upon expiry of  the plan at the end of each reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  not  discounted and  are  presented  separately  in  the  balance  sheet within non-current assets and liabilities.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognized  on  deductible temporary differences and for tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits to the extent that their future offset is probable.\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  is  recognized  on  taxable temporary  differences  relating  to  investments  in subsidiaries and associates unless the Group is able to control  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference,  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## 35.5.2 Royalties from operating licenses\n\nRoyalties  received  with  respect  to  operating  licenses are  recognized  in  accordance  with  the  contractual obligations  specific  to  each  agreement,  over  time  as the  performance  obligation  is  satisfied,  for  example, when calculated based on the value of the underlying sales generated by the licensee under the agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Dilution is determined separately for each instrument based on the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 when  the  proceeds  corresponding  to  potential future share issues are received at the time dilutive securities  are  issued  (e.g.,  convertible  bonds),  the numerator  is  equal  to  net  income  before  dilution\n\n## 35.10 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill  is  determined  according  to  the  method indicated in Note 35.2.3.\n\nGoodwill  is  allocated  as  of  the  acquisition  date  to cash-generating  units  (CGUs)  or  groups  of  CGUs defined by the Group.

The  impairment  tests  are  performed each  year,  or  whenever  events  or  circumstances indicate that an impairment loss is likely. A CGU is the smallest  group  of  assets,  including  goodwill,  that\n\ngenerates  cash  inflows  from  continuing  use  that  are largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows  from  other assets or CGUs.\n\nCGUs  or  groups  of  CGUs  as  defined  by  the  Group represent the operating segments in which the Group's brands operate (see Note 35.4).",

        "page_content": "Impairment  tests  seek  to  determine  whether  the recoverable  amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net carrying amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the  higher  of  its  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  its value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is  determined  with respect  to  future  cash  flow  projections,  taking  into account the time value of money and the specific risks attributable to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nFuture cash flow projections are based on medium-term  budgets  and  plans.  These  plans  are drawn up for a period of five years with the exception of certain CGUs or groups of CGUs undergoing strategic repositioning,  for  which  a  longer  period  may  be applied (typically ten years). To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the perpetual capitalization of a  normative  annual  cash  flow  is  added  to  the estimated  future  cash  flows.  The  perpetual  growth rates  are  appropriate  in  view  of  the  country  mix  (the Group  now  operates  in  regions  whose  markets  are enjoying faster-paced growth than in Europe), the rise in the cost of raw materials and inflation.\n\n## 35.13 Leases\n\n## 35.13.1 Scope of IFRS 16\n\nA lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset)  for  a  given  period  of  time  in  exchange  for consideration.\n\nThe Group applies the recognition principles set out in IFRS 16 for all of its leases, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 short-term leases, with a lease term of 12 months or less as of the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, based on the value of the asset when it is new.\n\nThe  lease  payments  associated  with  these  leases outside  the  scope  of  IFRS  16  are  recognized  as  an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nWhere  certain  lease  agreements  include  explicitly identifiable  non-lease components, those components are recognized in the appropriate item under recurring operating expenses.\n\nWhen the CGU's recoverable amount is less than its net carrying  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized. Impairment is charged first to goodwill and recognized under  'Other  non-recurring  operating  income  and expenses' in the income statement (see Note 35.1.3).\n\nImpairment recognized in respect of brands and other intangible  assets  along  with  property,  plant  and equipment may be reversed at a later date if there is an  indication  that  the  impairment  loss  no  longer exists.  Impairment  recognized  in  respect  of  goodwill may not be reversed.\n\nGoodwill relating  to  the  disposed  portion  of  a  CGU  is measured on a proportionate basis,  except  where  an alternative method is more appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the projected future cash flows method, the  Group  applies  the  royalties  method  to  test  the value of its brands. This method  consists  of determining  the  value  of  a  brand  based  on  future royalty revenue receivable where it is assumed that the brand will be operated under license by a third party.\n\n## 35.13.2 Recognition of leases under IFRS 16\n\nUnder  IFRS  16,  for  each  affected  lease,  the  following items  are  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  as  of  the commencement date:\n\n- \u00b7 a lease liability, corresponding to the present value of all fixed future payments for the estimated term of  the  lease.  The  current  and  non-current portions of the liability are presented separately. Fixed future lease payments include the remeasurement of any payments that depend on an index or a growth rate established in the lease. They may also include the value of any  purchase  options  or  estimated penalties for terminating the lease, where the Group is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  these  options.  In addition,  any  lease  incentives  receivable  as  of  the commencement  date  are  deducted  from  fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 a  lease  right-of-use  asset,  corresponding  to  the value  of  the  lease  liability  less  any  incentives received from the lessor and plus any prepaid lease payments,  initial  direct  costs  and  the  estimated cost  of  restoring  the  asset  where  required  by  the terms and conditions of the lease.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the life of a lease, the Group reestimates the lease term at the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  taking  into account  recent  operating  decisions  that  factor  in any extension or termination options that had not been  considered  reasonably  certain  at  the  end  of previous reporting periods;\n- \u00b7 other  properties  (offices,  logistics  and  production centers):  the  lease  term  corresponds  to  the  initial term of the lease together with any periods covered by  an  extension  option  if  Kering  is  reasonably certain  to  exercise  that  option,  based  on  expected future usage of the underlying assets.\n\nIn the specific case of '3-6-9'-type commercial leases in  France,  the  Group  has  adopted  nine  years  as  the enforceable  lease  term  as  of  the  commencement  of the lease, in accordance  with  the  conclusions published  by  the  French  accounting  standard  setter ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC) in its position statement  of  July  3,  2020  (replacing  the  position statement  of  February  16,  2018).  At  the  end  of  the enforceable  lease  term  and  during  any  subsequent automatic  renewal  period  while  renegotiations  are ongoing,  the  lease  term  is  determined  based  on  the date  on  which  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to renew  the  lease  beyond  its  contractual  term.

The position taken by the ANC also applies to Italian leases in the event of automatic renewal during any renegotiations following the end of their 12-year term.\n\nIn accordance with the IFRIC interpretation published on December 16, 2020, the Group estimates the term of  its  automatically  renewable  or  indefinite-term leases mainly by reference to the expected useful life of the underlying non-movable assets. As a reminder, the Group depreciates improvements to its stores and other  buildings  consistently  with  the  term  of  the underlying leases. Many different factors are taken into account  in  determining  the  maximum  depreciation period of leasehold improvements, including the term of the underlying lease.\n\n## 35.13.4 Determination of the discount rate applicable to lease liabilities\n\nThe  Group  believes  that  there  is  no  readily  available means of determining the interest rates implicit in its leases and has thus elected to apply the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe  incremental  borrowing  rate  corresponds  to  the rate  of  interest  that  the  Group  would  have  to  pay  to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the  funds  necessary  to  obtain  an  asset  of  a  similar value  to  the  lease  right-of-use  asset  in  a  similar economic environment.\n\nThe  rates  applied  by  the  Group  are  based  on  a combination  of  risk-free  interest  rate  curves  per currency/country,  euro/foreign  currency  swap  points, and the Group's credit spread, also accounting for the nature of the underlying asset (property).\n\n## 35.14 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment,  with the  exception  of  land,  which  is  not  depreciated.  The various components of property, plant and equipment are recognized separately when their estimated useful life and  therefore  their  depreciation  periods  are significantly different. The cost of property, plant and equipment  includes  the  expenses  that  are  directly attributable to its acquisition.\n\nAn 'industry' beta is added to these inputs to reflect the specific risk of each activity, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering and the principal Couture and Leather Goods Houses:  Gucci,  Yves  Saint  Laurent  and  Bottega Veneta;\n- \u00b7 Other  Houses  -  Couture  and  Leather  Goods: Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Brioni;\n- \u00b7 Other  Houses  -  Watches  and  Jewelry:  Boucheron, Pomellato, Qeelin, Sowind and Ulysse Nardin.\n\nThe  rate  curves  take  into  account  the  average  lease term and are prepared on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 35.13.5 Lease rights taken into account when calculating lease right-of-use assets\n\nLease rights are a separate component of right-of-use assets  and  are  depreciated  over  the  term  of  the underlying leases, less any residual value. This residual value  is  tested  for  impairment  each  year  and  an impairment loss is recognized where necessary.\n\n## 35.13.6 Amendment to IFRS 16 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\nThe  Group  chose  to  apply  the  practical  expedient provided  for  in  the  amendment  adopted  by  the  IASB on May 28, 2020 and approved by the European Union on  October  9,  2020.  This  allows  lessees  to  recognize any  concessions  granted  due  to  the  health  crisis  as negative  variable  lease  payments  (i.e.,  directly  in  the income statement), without having to assess whether the concessions were granted pursuant to contractual or  legal  clauses  governing  the  performance  of  the lease in question.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the carrying amount of  the  asset  or  recognized  as  a  separate  component, where necessary, if it is probable that future economic benefits  will  flow  to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the asset can be reliably measured. All other routine repair and  maintenance  costs  are  expensed  in  the  income statement in the year they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are three categories of financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement (profit or loss);\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  in  equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon  initial recognition, based  on  their characteristics and the management objective behind the asset's purchase. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the transaction date, which is the  date  the  Group  is  committed  to  the  purchase  or sale  of  the  asset.  A  financial  asset  is  derecognized  if the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred.\n\n## 35.15.1 Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial  assets  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  if  they are held as part of a business model whose objective is  to  collect  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes loans and receivables, deposits and  guarantees,  trade  receivables  and  most  other current and non-current receivables.\n\nThese  financial  assets  are  initially  recognized  at  fair value  and  subsequently  at  amortized  cost  using  the effective interest method.\n\nThe  effective  interest  rate  is  determined  for  each transaction  and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would provide the net carrying amount of the financial asset by  discounting  its  estimated  future  cash  flows  until maturity.  The  calculation  includes  transaction  costs and any premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond  to  the  costs  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition or issue of a financial asset. Net gains and losses  on  loans  and  receivables  relate  to  interest income and impairment allowances.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment  are tested for impairment when an indication of impairment exists, such  as  a  scheduled  closure  of  a  store  or  site,  a redundancy  plan  or  a  downward  revision  of  market forecasts. When an asset's recoverable amount is less than  its  net  carrying  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is recognized.  Where  the  recoverable  amount  of  an individual  asset  cannot  be  determined  precisely,  the Group determines the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs to which the asset belongs.\n\nImpairment allowances are recognized in the income statement based on the expected loss model:\n\n- \u00b7 for  its  trade  receivables,  the  Group  applies  a provision  matrix  for  each  country/brand  based  on historical  loss  data.  Credit  insurance  that  may  be taken out by the Group is taken into account in the evaluation of the risk and therefore of the provision;\n- \u00b7 for  other  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized cost,  an  analysis  is  carried  out  taking  into  account the probability of counterparty default.\n\n## 35.15.2 Financial assets measured at fair value thr ough the income statement\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the income  statement  mostly  comprise  financial  assets giving rise to contractual cash flows that are not solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-consolidated  investments  and  other  financial investments, unless the Group has chosen to carry specific  investments  at  fair  value  under  the  fair value  option,  in  which  case  they  are  recognized directly  in  equity  through  other  comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  held  by  the  Group  for  trading purposes  that  the  Group  intends  to  resell  in  the near  future  and  that  are  part  of  a  portfolio  of financial  instruments  that  are  managed  together and for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a  recent  actual pattern of short-term profit-taking;\n- \u00b7 assets  designated  as  at  fair  value  under  the  fair value option.\n\nChanges in the fair value of these assets are taken to the  income statement. Net gains or losses arising on financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the income  statement  generally  correspond  to  interest income,  dividends,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the assets (unrealized gains or losses) and capital gains or losses on disposals (realized gains or losses).",

There are two categories of financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  through the income statement (profit or loss).\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities  upon  initial  recognition,  based  on  their characteristics.\n\n## 35.16.1 Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities are carried at amortized cost if they are held as part of a business model whose objective is  to  disburse  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal amount outstanding.\n\n## 35.15.4 Fair value hierarchy and associated valuation methods\n\nThe fair  value  of  financial  assets  is  determined  using one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: financial assets quoted on an active market;\n- \u00b7 Level  2:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is determined using valuation techniques drawing on observable market inputs;\n- \u00b7 Level  3:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is determined using valuation techniques drawing on non-observable  inputs  (inputs  whose  value  does not  result  from  the  price  of  observable  market transactions  for  the  same  instrument  or  from observable  market  data  available  as  of  the  end  of the reporting period) or inputs which are only partly observable.\n\nThis category includes borrowings (with the exception of  put  options  granted  to  minority  interests  -  see Note  35.21),  trade  payables  and  most  other  current and non-current liabilities.\n\nThese financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value  less  transaction  costs,  and  subsequently  at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nThe  effective  interest  rate  is  determined  for  each transaction  and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would provide  the  net  carrying  amount  of  the  financial liability by discounting its estimated future cash flows until  maturity.  The  calculation  includes  transaction costs and any premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs  correspond  to  the  costs  directly  attributable  to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability.\n\nThe  net  carrying  amount  of  financial  liabilities measured  at  amortized  cost  that  qualify  as  hedged items  as  part  of  a  fair  value  hedging  relationship  is adjusted with respect to the hedged risk (see Note 35.17.1).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  this case,  unlike  in  the  amortized  cost  method,  the transaction  costs  associated  with  setting  up  these financial liabilities are recognized immediately within other  financial  income  and  expenses  in  the  income statement.\n\n## 35.16.3 Convertible bonds: separating the debt and equity components\n\nBonds  convertible  into  Kering  shares  have  both  a standard debt component and an equity component. These  bonds  are  considered  hybrid  instruments insofar  as  the  conversion  option  provides  for  the repayment of the instrument against a fixed number of equity instruments.\n\n## 35.17 Derivative instruments\n\n## 35.17.1 Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe  Group  uses  various  derivative  instruments  to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and  equity  risk.  These  instruments  are  listed  on organized  markets  or  traded  over  the  counter  with leading counterparties.\n\nDerivative  instruments  are  recognized  in  the  balance sheet  within  current  or  non-current  financial  assets and current or non-current financial liabilities, depending  on  their  maturity.  They  are  recognized  at fair value as from the transaction date.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  are  always recorded in income except in the case of cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\nDerivatives  designated  as  hedging  instruments  are classified by category of hedge based on the nature of the risks being hedged:\n\n- \u00b7 a  cash  flow  hedge  is  used  to  hedge  the  risk  of changes in future cash flow from recognized assets or  liabilities  or  a  highly  probable  transaction  that would impact the income statement;\n\nThe two components of a convertible bond are:\n\n- \u00b7 a  debt  component,  recognized  within  bond  debt and representing the financial liability related to the contractual commitment to pay cash;\n- \u00b7 an  equity  component  corresponding  to  the  option to  convert  the  bonds  into  a  fixed  number  of ordinary  shares,  which  resembles  a  sale  of  call options by Kering.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  applicable  to  each  of  these components, at the issue date and at the end of each subsequent reporting period, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 debt component: the amount initially recognized as debt corresponds to the present value of the future cash  flows  arising  from  interest  and  principal payments at the market rate for a similar bond with no  conversion  option.  The  debt  component  is subsequently recognized at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 equity  component:  the  value  of  the  conversion option  is  determined  as  the  amount  of  the  issue less  the  carrying  amount  of  the  debt  component. The conversion option continues to be recorded in equity at its initial value. Changes in the value of the option are not recognized;\n- \u00b7 transaction  costs  are  allocated  pro  rata  to  each component.\n- \u00b7 a  fair  value  hedge  is  used  to  hedge  the  risk  of changes  in  the  fair  value  of  recognized  assets  or liabilities or a firm commitment not yet recognized that would impact the income statement;\n- \u00b7 a  net  investment  hedge  is  used  to  hedge  the translation risk arising on operations denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nHedge  accounting  can  only  be  applied  if  all  of  the following conditions are met.\n\n- \u00b7 the hedged instrument and the hedging instrument are both eligible;\n- \u00b7 there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging  relationship as of the date of inception;\n- \u00b7 there  is  an  economic  relationship  between  the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe  remaining  ineffective  portion  of  the  hedge  is recognized in the income statement at each reporting date, on the other financial income and expenses line within 'Financial result'.",

        "page_content": "The  accounting  treatment  of  derivative  instruments qualified as hedging instruments, and their impact on the  income  statement  and  balance  sheet,  differs depending on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- \u00b7 for cash flow and net investment hedges, fair value gains  and  losses  attributable  to  the  effective portion  of  the  hedging  derivative  are  recognized directly  in  equity  through  other  comprehensive income. For foreign currency derivatives, changes in the  time  value  of  the  options  and  changes  in premiums  and  discounts  are  also  recognized  in other  comprehensive  income.  These  amounts  are reclassified to the income statement to match the recognition  of  the  hedged  items,  mainly  in  gross margin  for  the  effective  portion  of  commercial transaction  hedges,  and  in  financial  result  for financial hedges and the time value of commercial hedges;\n- \u00b7 for  fair  value  hedges,  the  hedged  component  of these items is measured in the balance sheet at fair value  with  respect  to  the  hedged  risk.  Fair  value gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  the  income statement and are offset, to the extent the hedge is effective,  by  simultaneously  matching  fair  value gains and losses on the hedging instrument in the income statement.\n\n## 35.18 Inventories\n\nInventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated sale  price  in  the  normal  course  of  operations,  net  of costs to be incurred to complete the sale.\n\nThe same method for determining costs is adopted for inventories  of  a  similar  nature  and  use  within  the Group. Inventories are valued using the retail method or  weighted  average  cost  method,  depending  on  the Group activity.\n\n## 35.19 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents recorded on the assets side of  the  balance  sheet  include  cash,  mutual  or  similar funds, short-term investments and other highly liquid instruments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known amounts  of  cash,  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of changes  in  value,  and  have  a  maximum  maturity  of three months as of the purchase date.\n\n## 35.17.2 Derivative instruments designated as trading instruments\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments that the  Group  cannot  or  does  not  wish  to  designate  as hedging  instruments  are  recognized  in  full  in  the income statement on the other financial income and expenses line within 'Financial result'.\n\n## 35.17.3 Embedded derivatives\n\nCertain  financial  assets  or  liabilities  may  contain  a derivative  instrument.  When  they  are  not  closely related to the underlying instrument, these embedded derivatives  are  recognized  separately  in  the  balance sheet as a derivative instrument held for trading. Any changes in their fair value are taken in full to income on the other financial income and expenses line within 'Financial result'.\n\nThe  Group  may  recognize  an  inventory  allowance based  on  expected  turnover,  if  inventory  items  are damaged,  have  become  wholly  or  partially  obsolete, the selling price has declined, or if the estimated costs to completion or to be incurred to make the sale have increased.\n\nInvestments with a maturity exceeding three months, and  blocked  or  pledged  bank  accounts,  are  excluded from cash and cash equivalents.\n\nBank  overdrafts  are  presented  in  borrowings  on  the liabilities  side  of  the  balance  sheet.  In  the  cash  flow statement, cash and cash equivalents at the opening and  closing  of  the  reporting  period  include  bank overdrafts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On disposal, the consideration  received  for  these  shares,  net  of transaction costs and the related tax impacts, is also recognized directly in equity attributable to the Group.\n\n## 35.21 Put options granted to minority interests\n\nThe Group has undertaken to repurchase the minority interests  of  shareholders  of  certain  subsidiaries.  The strike  price  of  these  put  options  may  be  set  or determined  according  to  a  predefined  calculation formula, and the options may be exercised at any time or on a specific date.\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial liability in respect of any  put  options  granted  to  minority  interests.  This liability is recognized at the present value of the best estimate of the strike price, with an offsetting entry in equity  attributable  to  the  Group.  Any  subsequent changes in the liability relating to put options granted to minority interests are recognized directly in equity, including the impact of unwinding the discount.\n\nThe  financial  liability  recognized  in  respect  of  put options granted to minority interests is shown in the balance sheet within current and non-current borrowings,  as  appropriate.  Put  options  granted  to minority interests are therefore included in consolidated net debt (see Note 35.1.3).\n\nDepending  on  the  agreements  signed  by  the  Group with minority interests, minority shareholders may in some  cases  waive  their  dividend  rights  until  the  put option  is  exercised.  In  this  case,  the  corresponding minority interests are canceled, with a direct offsetting entry  in  equity  attributable  to  the  Group.  If  the minority interests retain their dividend rights until the option  is  exercised  however,  the  minority  interests continue to be shown in the balance sheet.\n\n## 35.22 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nBased on the laws and practices of each country, the Group recognizes various types of employee benefits, including pensions and other post-employment benefits.\n\nUnder  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Group  is  not obliged to make additional payments over and above contributions already made to a fund, if the fund does not  have  sufficient  assets  to  cover  the  benefits corresponding  to  services  rendered  by  personnel during the current period and prior periods. Contributions  paid  into  these  plans  are  expensed  in the income statement as incurred.\n\nUnder  defined  benefit  plans,  obligations  are  valued using  the  projected  unit  credit  method  based  on agreements  in  effect  in  each  entity.  Under  this method,  each  period  of  service  gives  rise  to  an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation. The  obligation  is  then  discounted.  The  actuarial assumptions  used  to  determine  the  obligations  vary according  to  the  economic  conditions  of  the  country where the plan is established. These plans are valued by  independent  actuaries  on  an  annual  basis.  The valuations  take  into  account  the  level  of  future compensation, the probable active life  of  employees, life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nThe  provision  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet corresponds  to  the  present  value  of  the  obligations calculated  as  described  above,  less  the  fair  value  of plan assets under wholly funded pension plans.\n\nThe current service cost for these plans is recognized within  personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement. The interest cost relating to the benefit obligation net of interest income on plan assets under wholly funded plans  is  recognized  in  other  financial  income  and expenses  within  'Financial  result'.  Past  service  cost, designating the increase in an obligation following the introduction  of  a  new  plan  or  the  impact  of amendments  to  an  existing  plan,  is expensed immediately in the income statement within personnel expenses, regardless of whether or not the benefit  entitlement  has  already  vested  or  is  still vesting.\n\nChanges  in  actuarial  assumptions  and  the  impact  of experience adjustments (the difference between outcomes estimated using actuarial assumptions and actual  outcomes)  give  rise  to  actuarial  gains  and losses,  which  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  within other  comprehensive  income.  These  actuarial  gains and  losses  are  never  transferred  to  the  income statement.",

The discount rate used reflects current assessments of the time value of money and specific risks related to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognized when there  is  a  formal  and  detailed  restructuring  plan  and the  plan  has  begun  to  be  implemented  or  its  main features have been announced before the end of the reporting  period.  Restructuring  costs  for  which  a provision  is  made  essentially  represent  employee costs (severance pay, early retirement plans, payment in lieu of notice, etc.), work stoppages and compensation  for  breaches  of  contract  with  third parties.\n\n## 35.24 Discontinued operations, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 5, which requires the separate recognition and presentation of non-current assets (or disposal  groups)  held  for  sale  and  discontinued operations.\n\nNon-current assets, or groups of assets and liabilities directly  associated  with  those  assets,  are  considered as  held  for  sale  if  it  is  highly  probable  that  their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are measured and  recognized  at  the  lower  of  their  net  carrying amount and their fair value less the costs of disposal. These assets are no longer depreciated from the time\n\nthey  qualify  as  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held  for sale.  They  are  presented  on  separate  lines  in  the consolidated  balance  sheet,  without  restatement  for previous periods.\n\nA discontinued operation is defined as a component of a group that generates cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  from  the  rest  of  the  Group  and represents a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. For all periods presented, the net income  or  loss  from  these  activities  is  shown  on  a separate line of the income  statement  within discontinued  operations  and  is  restated  in  the  cash flow statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors,  for  the  period  from January 1, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of  the  French  Commercial  Code  relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.",

        "page_content": "These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and  in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\n\nNotes 9, 15 and 35.12 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  goodwill  and  brands  are recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  for  a  net  carrying amount  of  \u20ac2,452.2  million  and  \u20ac6,402.2  million, respectively, or 9% and 23% of the total consolidated assets.\n\nThe Group tests the value of its assets for impairment by allocating them to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs. The impairment tests are performed each  year,  or  whenever  events  or  circumstances indicate that an impairment loss is likely.\n\nCGUs  or  groups  of  CGUs  as  defined  by  the  Group represent the operating segments in which the Group's brands operate.\n\nImpairment  tests  seek  to  determine  whether  the recoverable  amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net carrying amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the  higher  of  its  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  its value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is  determined  with respect  to  future  cash  flow  projections,  taking  into account the time value of money and the specific risks attributable to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nFuture cash flow projections are based on medium-term budgets and plans.\n\nWhen the CGU's recoverable amount is less than its net carrying  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized. Impairment is charged first to goodwill and recognized under  'Other  non-recurring  operating  income  and expenses' in the income statement.\n\nIn addition to the projected future cash flows method, the  Group  applies  the  'royalties'  method  to  test  the value of its brands. This method  consists  of determining  the  value  of  a  brand  based  on  future royalty  revenue  receivable  where  it  is  assumed  that the  brand  will  be  operated  under  license  by  a  third party.\n\nIn 2020, asset impairment represented \u20ac446.6 million (2019: \u20ac94.9 million) and mainly concerned the Ulysse Nardin, Girard-Perregaux and Brioni brands (\u20ac327.7 million), particularly hard hit by the pandemic.\n\nGiven the significant amount of goodwill and brands in the consolidated financial statement as at December 31, 2020 consolidated assets and uncertainties  inherent  in  certain  assumptions  and notably, the probability of achieving forecasts used to calculate  the  recoverable  amount,  we  considered  the valuation  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with indefinite lives to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe have examined the compliance of the impairment testing  methodology  adopted  by  the  company  with prevailing accounting standards. We have also carried out  a  critical  review  of  the  implementation  of  this methodology.\n\nOur procedures consisted in, for the CGU, or groups of CGUs  with  a  risk  of  impairment  loss,  with  the assistance of our valuation specialists:\n\n- \u00b7 examining  the  items  comprising  the  carrying amount  of  the  CGUs  to  which  the  goodwill  and brands have been allocated by the Group;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the consistency of cash flow projections with  Management  assumptions  and  the  economic environments  in  which  the  Group  operates  and more  particularly  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic  crisis context;\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  consistency  of  the  growth  rates adopted  for  projected  cash  flows  with  available external analyses;\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  reasonableness  of  discount  rates applied  to  estimated  cash  flows,  verifying  notably that the  different  parameters  comprising  the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  each CGU  enable  the  return expected by market participants for similar activities to be reached;\n- \u00b7 compare  the  projected  cash  flows  of  previous business plans with the actual cash flows to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions;\n- \u00b7 assessing Management analyses of the sensitivity of the value in use to a change in the main assumptions;\n- \u00b7 assessing the royalty rates applied to brands in the calculation of future revenue;\n- \u00b7 confirming  that  Notes  9,  15  and  35.12  to  the consolidated  financial  statements  provide  appropriate disclosures,  notably  on  sensitivity  analyses  performed on the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to changes in the main assumptions adopted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As disclosed in Note 35.18 to the consolidated financial  statements,  inventories  are  valued  at  the lower of cost and net realizable value:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost is  determined according to the retail method or weighted average cost, depending on the Group business;\n- \u00b7 Net  realizable  value  is  the  estimated  sale  price  in the  normal  course  of  operations,  net  of  costs incurred to complete the sale.\n\nThe  Group  may  recognize  an  inventory  allowance based on the expected turnover if inventory items are damaged,  if  the  selling  price  has  declined,  or  if  the estimated  costs  to  completion  or  to  be  incurred  to make the sale have increased.\n\nThe  performance  of  the  Houses,  determined  by  the frequency  of  collections  and  turnover  of  inventory, depends  heavily  on  the  commercial  success  of product portfolios within each brand of the Group.\n\nGiven  the  significant  amount  of  inventories  in  the consolidated  assets  and  the  degree  of  judgment inherent in certain assumptions  underlying  the valuation of inventory depreciation, namely related to sales or obsolescence projections, we considered this topic to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  methods  used  to  value  inventory depreciation  and  confirming  the  consistency  of accounting methods;\n- \u00b7 testing  the  appropriateness  of  the  design  and effectiveness of the implementation of the controls set up by Management to prevent or detect possible errors in the valuation of inventory depreciation;\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  data  and  assumptions  adopted  by Management  to  determine  the  prospects  for inventory turnover and the resulting provisions and more  particularly  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic  crisis context;\n- \u00b7 assessing  forecast  and  budget  figures  which  may impact the valuation of inventory depreciation;\n- \u00b7 assessing the assumptions  and  implementing measures used to determine the specific depreciations of inventories.\n\n- 418",

Therefore,  this  report  does  not  include  a conclusion  on  the  compliance  with  this  format  of  the  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ).\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed statutory auditors of Kering SA by the Shareholders' Meeting of June 18, 1992 for KPMG SA and May 18, 1994 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, KPMG SA was in its 29 th year of uninterrupted engagement and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s in its 27 th year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal control and risks management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nAs specified by Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.",

The  risk  of  not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company  to  cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory  auditor  concludes  that  a  material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and  the  audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant deficiencies  in  internal  control  regarding  the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  that  we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming  our  independence  pursuant  to  the  rules  applicable  in  France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles  L.  822-10  to  L.  822-14  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  in  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  for  statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 23, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nKPMG Audit\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDivision of KPMG SA\n\nIsabelle Allen\n\nGr\u00e9goire Menou\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Margerin\n\n<!-- image -->",

The adjustment  ratio  will  apply  to  all  beneficiaries.  The performance shares will be delivered to the\n\nbeneficiaries  provided  that  the  service  condition  and performance  conditions  are  met  at  the  end  of  the three-year vesting period, which closes on October 1, 2023.\n\nOn  July  15,  2020  Kering  redeemed  a  bond  issue  of \u20ac360 million maturing on the same date.\n\nIn  October  2020,  Kering  sold  approximately  5.83%  of its stake in PUMA for a total amount of approximately \u20ac655.6 million, corresponding to a sale price of \u20ac74.50 per  PUMA  share.  Following  this  transaction,  Kering retains a 9.87% stake in PUMA.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, 1,261,406 Kering shares held in  treasury  in  respect  of  two  tranches  of  shares purchased  on  October  29,  2018  and  June  14,  2019 under  the  stock  repurchase  program  were  canceled. Accordingly, the share capital was reduced by \u20ac5 million.",

Depreciation  and  amortization  are  calculated using  the  straight-line  method  based  on  the  nature and useful life of each component.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets are  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  and the following useful lives:\n\n## 2.2 Long-term investments\n\n## Investments\n\nSecurities classified as 'Investments' are those considered  necessary  for  the  Company's  activities, particularly  because  they  provide  the  Company  with influence over, or control of, the issuer.\n\nPursuant to notice no. 2007-C issued by the Emerging Issues  Taskforce  of  the  French  accounting  standards authority ( Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9 - CNC) on June  15,  2007,  the  Company  elected  to  recognize acquisition fees as part of the cost of investments.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  gross amount of investments is compared to their value in use to the Company, determined with reference to the subsidiary's estimated economic value and taking into consideration the purpose of the original transaction. Value  in  use  is  determined  using  a  multi-criteria approach  based  on  future  cash  flow  projections,  the revised  asset  value  and  the  share  of  consolidated  or revalued shareholders' equity. Other methods are used where necessary.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recorded  when  this  value  falls below the gross value.\n\nSoftware\n\n1 to 5 years\n\nInternally generated software\n\n3 to 10 years\n\nImprovements to property\n\n10 to 24 years\n\nTechnical installations, tools and equipment\n\n10 to 15 years\n\nComputer equipment\n\n1 to 10 years\n\nOffice furniture\n\n10 years\n\n## Other long-term investments\n\nOther long-term investments include other investments and certain treasury shares.\n\n## Other investments (excluding treasury shares)\n\nOther investments are investments that the Company plans or is required to hold on a long-term basis, but which  are  not  deemed  necessary  for  the  Company's activities.\n\nThe gross amount of these investments is equal to the acquisition cost plus any related acquisition fees.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized based on the value in use of these securities to the Company.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  under  liquidity  agreements are  recorded  under  'Other  long-term  investments'. These  shares  are  written  down  where  necessary  to reflect the average share price over the last month of the fiscal year.\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  for  the  express  purpose  of being  used  in  a  future  capital  reduction  are  also classified under 'Other long-term investments'. These shares are not written down to reflect the share price.\n\n## 2.3 Receivables\n\nReceivables are recorded in the balance sheet at their nominal value, and are written down where they present a risk of non-recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No  impairment  is  recognized on treasury shares to reflect the share price.\n\n## Other shares\n\nShares  are  recorded  at  their  acquisition  cost.  An impairment loss is recognized when their closing price falls below their carrying amount.\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds are recorded on the acquisition date at their par value adjusted for any premium or discount. Accrued interest as of the acquisition date and as of the end of the reporting period is recorded in an accrued interest account.\n\nAs of the end of the reporting period, the cost of the bonds is compared to the market value of the principal over  the  last  month  of  the  year,  excluding  accrued interest.  An  impairment  loss  is  recorded  when  this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## 2.5 Financial instruments\n\nAll  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  positions  are taken  via  instruments  listed  on  exchange-traded  or over-the-counter markets representing minimal counterparty  risk.  Any  gains  or  losses  generated  on financial instruments used in hedging transactions are offset  against  the  corresponding  gain  or  loss  on  the hedged items.\n\nWhere financial instruments do not qualify as hedges, any  gains  or  losses  resulting  from  changes  in  their market  value  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement, except  for  over-the-counter  transactions.  For  these transactions, a provision is recorded for any unrealized losses, while unrealized gains are not recognized.\n\nANC  Regulation no. 2015-05  of  July 2, 2015, concerning forward financial instruments and hedges, entered into force as of  January  1,  2017  but  was  not applicable to the Company's transactions during fiscal year 2020.\n\n## Mutual funds (Sicav)\n\nShares  in  mutual  funds  are  recorded  at  their acquisition cost excluding subscription fees, and their net  asset  value  is  estimated  as  of  the  end  of  the reporting  period.  A  provision  for  impairment  is recorded  in  respect  of  any  unrealized  capital  losses. No unrealized capital gains are recognized.\n\n## Negotiable certificates of deposit, certificates of deposit and notes issued by financing companies\n\nNegotiable  debt  securities  are  subscribed  on  the primary market or purchased on the secondary market. They  are  recorded  at  acquisition  cost  less  accrued interest  as  of  the  acquisition  date  when  purchased  on the secondary market.\n\nPrepaid interest is recognized as financial income on a proportional basis for the fiscal year.\n\nThe accounting principles are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the principle of symmetrically offsetting the realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging instruments with those of their underlying assets in the income statement is applied across the board:\n- - hedge accounting is not optional,\n- - as regards foreign exchange rate risk, non-derivative  instruments  such  as  borrowings or  cash  deposits  denominated  in  a  foreign currency may now qualify as hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 hedging  instruments:  changes  in  the  value  of hedging  instruments  are  not  recognized  on  the balance sheet, unless their full or partial recognition offsets gains or losses in the underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 underlying asset: a derivative may be an underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 isolated open positive derivatives:\n- - recognition  on  the  balance  sheet  of  changes  in value and provisions for unrealized losses for all derivatives not recognized as hedging instruments,\n- - detail on calculations used to determine provisions on  currency  positions  (currency  by  currency,  the maturity  dates  of  the  elements  included  in  the position must be included in the same fiscal year).",

        "page_content": "## 2.6 Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at their euro-equivalent value on  the  transaction  date.  Borrowings,  receivables  and liquidity  positions  denominated  in  foreign  currencies are translated at the closing exchange rate. In the case of foreign currency hedging, borrowings and receivables are translated at the hedging rate.\n\nAny translation differences resulting from the valuation of foreign currency borrowings and receivables  are  recorded  in  accrual  accounts,  as  an asset  for  unrealized  losses  and  as  a  liability  for unrealized gains. A contingency provision is recorded to  cover  any  unhedged  unrealized  losses.  Where borrowings  and  receivables  are  hedged  by  financial instruments,  any  foreign  currency  gains  or  losses  are immediately recorded in the income statement.\n\n## 2.7 Bond issue and capital increase fees - Bond redemption premiums\n\nBond issue fees are recognized as of the issue date.\n\nCosts associated with increases in capital, mergers or restructuring are charged  against  the  additional paid-in capital arising from the merger or restructuring.\n\nBonds are recorded at their par value.\n\nAny issue or redemption premiums are assigned to the relevant  balance  sheet  item  and  amortized  over  the term of the bond.\n\n## 2.8 Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognized  in  accordance  with  CNC regulation no. 2000.06 and include pension and other employee benefit obligations pursuant to ANC recommendation no. 2013-02.\n\nUnder  defined  benefit  plans,  obligations  are  valued using  the  projected  unit  credit  method  based  on agreements  in  effect  in  the  Company.  Under  this method,  each  period  of  service  gives  rise  to  an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation. The  obligation  is  then  discounted.  The  actuarial assumptions  used  to  determine  the  obligations  vary depending on economic conditions.\n\n## 2.9 Tax consolidation\n\nKering has set up a tax consolidation group in France with several sub-groups and subsidiaries.\n\nEach  subsidiary  recognizes  a  tax  expense  for  the amount  of  tax  it  would  have  paid  on  a  stand-alone\n\nFor  convertible  bonds,  the  redemption  premium  is recognized over the term of the bond, in accordance with the benchmark accounting treatment.\n\nIn  the  case  of  an  indexed  bond  issue,  a  contingency provision must be recorded in respect of redemption when the  estimated  amount  required  to  redeem  the bonds as  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  exceeds the  amount  of  the  issue.  This  provision  is  calculated on a proportional basis over the term of the bond.\n\nThese benefit obligations are assessed by independent actuaries on an annual basis. The valuations take into account  the  level of future compensation,  the probable active life of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nKering  applies  the  notice  relating  to  CRC  regulation no.  2008-15  of  December  4,  2008  on  the  accounting treatment  of  stock  option  and  employee  free  share plans.\n\nbasis.  The  tax  savings  generated  by  the  Group  as  a result of tax consolidation are retained by Kering SA as the parent company of the tax consolidation group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Treasury share transactions\n\nIn 2020, the Group purchased 104,728 shares and sold the same number under the liquidity agreement.\n\nNo  stock  subscription  options  were  exercised  during 2020.\n\nOn May 26, 2004, Kering signed an agreement with a financial broker in order to improve the liquidity of the Group's  shares  and  ensure  share  price  stability.  This agreement  complies  with  the  Professional  Code  of Conduct  drawn  up  by  the  French  association  of financial  and  investment  firms  ( Association  fran\u00e7aise des march\u00e9s financiers -  AMAFI)  and  approved by the French  financial markets  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF). The agreement was initially endowed  with  \u20ac40.0  million,  half  of  which  was provided  in  cash  and  half  in  Kering  shares.  An additional  \u20ac20.0  million  in  cash  was  allocated  to  the agreement  on  September  3,  2004,  and  a  further \u20ac30.0 million on December 18, 2007.\n\nIn accordance with the amendment dated December 15, 2016, Kering maintains a credit balance of  \u20ac5.0  million  in  the  liquidity  account  with  the financial broker.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020  and  December  31,  2019, Kering  held  no  shares  in  treasury  under  the  liquidity agreement.\n\n## Stock repurchase program\n\nAs  part  of  the  repurchase  program  announced  on October  29,  2018  covering  up  to  1.0%  of  its  share capital over a 12-month period, Kering set up a stock repurchase  agreement  with  an  investment  services provider. Between October 29, 2018 and February  28,  2019,  a  total  of  603,406  shares  were repurchased under a first tranche of the program.\n\nUnder  the  new  agreement,  a  second  tranche  of  the program  will  be  launched,  covering  a  maximum volume  of  658  shares.  As  a  reminder,  the  maximum purchase  price  set  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of April  24,  2019  in  the  tenth  resolution  was  \u20ac580  per share.\n\nThe purchased shares will subsequently be canceled.\n\nAs of December 18, 2020, 1,261,406 Kering shares held in  treasury  in  respect  of  the  two  tranches  purchased on October 29, 2018 and June 14, 2019 were canceled. Accordingly, the share capital was  reduced  by \u20ac5,045,624.  The  total  purchase  price  of  the  canceled shares  was  \u20ac570,817,043.24,  which  was  allocated  to the following accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac5,045,624 to 'Share capital';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac45,306,456.77 to 'General reserves';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac195,012,500 to 'Ordinary reserves';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac325,452,462.47 to 'Retained earnings'.\n\nThe June 16, 2020 Annual General Meeting authorized the  implementation  of  a  new  stock  repurchase program.  For  this  purpose,  Kering  instructed  an investment services provider to purchase, by March 31, 2021 at the latest and depending on market conditions, up to 50,000 ordinary Kering shares. These shares  were  to  be  allocated  to  free  share  plans  and other long-term incentive plans granted to employees and  payable  in  Kering  shares.  This  purchase  was carried out between December 11 and 16, 2020.\n\nOn  December  21,  2020,  the  initial  instruction  was extended to cover an additional 75,000 shares, to be purchased  by  March  31,  2021  at  the  latest.  The  unit purchase  price  of  the  shares  may  not  exceed  the maximum price set at the Annual General Meeting on June 16, 2020.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  95,000  shares  were purchased for an amount of \u20ac53.9 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code  ( Code  de  commerce )  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors,  for  the period from January 1, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1, of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of  the  French  Commercial  Code  relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  also  takes account of the requirements set out in Article 173 of French law no. 2015-992 of August 17, 2015 on energy transition for sustainable development.\n\nThe  AMF's  framework  is  based  not  only  on  the aforementioned French and EU legislation and regulations,  but  also  on  internal  control  and  risk management good practices and international standards, in particular ISO 31000 and COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations), which were analyzed  in  depth  when  the  risk  management  policy was  drafted.  This  policy  is  set  out  in  the  section entitled 'Components of risk management'.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ordinance  order  no.  2017-1180  of July 19,  2017  on  non-financial  reporting  and  its implementing decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, the Kering group presents the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) for 2020 in Chapter 3 of this  Universal  Registration  Document.  The  following sections include references to the NFIS.\n\n## 1.1 Scope and principles of organization\n\nKering  is  the  parent  company  of  the  Kering  group, whose  entities  operate  in  the  luxury  industry.  The following report aims to describe the internal control procedures in the Group  and  especially those procedures relating to the preparation and processing of financial and accounting information. The scope of the  Group  covered  by  the  report  includes  all  fully consolidated subsidiaries, i.e., the companies in which the  Group  directly  or  indirectly  exercises  exclusive control.\n\nAs a holding company, Kering's own operations consist of (i)  defining and implementing its strategy, (ii) organizing and  managing  its  holdings,  (iii)  stimulating  the development  of  its  activities  and  coordinating  their\n\nfinancing,  (iv)  providing  support  and  communication functions,  and  (v)  defining  and  implementing  the insurance coverage policy.\n\nThe  internal  control  function  follows  the  general organization of the Group. It is both:\n\n- \u00b7 decentralized at the level of the activities: Executive Management of the operating  and  legal  entities  is responsible  for  managing  and  coordinating  the internal control process;\n- \u00b7 unified  around  a  common  methodology  and  a  single set of standards. The Kering holding company coordinates its deployment across the Group, supported  by  teams  at  Kering  Asia-Pacific  and Kering Americas.\n\n## 1.2 General principles of risk management\n\nAccording to the definition of the AMF, risks represent the possibility that an event may occur and could have an  impact  on  people,  assets,  the  environment,  the Company's objectives and its reputation.\n\nRisk  management  covers  areas  that  are  much  wider than  just  financial  risks:  for  example,  operational, labor-related, environmental and compliance risk. Risk management is a key management tool that helps:\n\n- \u00b7 create and preserve the value, assets and reputation of the Company;\n\n- \u00b7 render  the  Company's  decision-making  and  other processes secure in order to support the achievement of its objectives;\n- \u00b7 mitigate  the  risk  of  unexpected  outcomes  and operating losses;\n- \u00b7 ensure  that  initiatives  are  consistent  with  the Company's values;\n- \u00b7 bring  Company  employees  together  to  develop  a shared view of the main risks.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Components of risk management\n\nThe  Group  constantly  strives  to  make  its  operations more  secure  and  to  improve  its  methodology  to identify and deal with risks. In 2020, the Group pressed ahead with changes to its risk management methodology initiated in 2011 and the means used for its  risk  management  system.  The  Group's  system provides for an organizational framework, a three-step risk management process and continuous monitoring.\n\n## 1.3.1 Organizational framework\n\nThis organizational framework includes:\n\n- \u00b7 an  organization  that  sets  out  the  roles  and responsibilities of the various persons involved and sets out procedures, as well as consistent and clear standards, for the system;\n- \u00b7 a risk management policy that sets out the objectives of the system in line with the Company's culture, the shared  language  used,  and  the  process  to  identify, analyze and deal with risks;\n- \u00b7 an IT system that makes it possible to enter information about risks;\n- \u00b7 planned reporting of risk information to stakeholders identified  within  the  Group,  as  well  as  an  annual presentation to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nWithin  the  scope  of  the  Group's  risk  management policy  and  in  accordance  with  Kering's  corporate governance, Kering's Executive Management created a 'Kering  group  Risk  Committee'  in  2011.  It  comprises the  Group  Managing  Director,  the  Chief  Financial Officer,  the  Head  of  the  Legal  Department,  the  Chief Audit Executive, the Head of the Security Department, the  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  and  the  Risk Manager.  As  the  Group's  operations  and  activities expand,  and  become  more  complex  and  more international,  the  Risk  Committee  helps  identify  and rank the main risks that could have an impact on the Group's business operations. Internal rules determine how the Committee is managed, and how it operates.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  reviews  (i)  the  validation  and monitoring  process  for  the  Group's  risk  management policy; (ii) the monitoring of the topicality and relevance of analyses  relating to operational, labor-related, environmental,  financial  and  compliance  risks;  (iii)  the analysis  summaries  of  general  and  specific  risks;  and (iv) the validation and monitoring of action plans rolled out with the aim of controlling identified risks.\n\nThe Risk Committee's work is brought to the attention of  the  Audit  Committee,  which  is  informed  of  the Committee's  internal  rules  and  has  access  to  the minutes of its meetings.\n\n## Risk Manager\n\nThe  Risk  Manager  function  was  created  within  the Company to coordinate this reinforced risk management system, ensure that the Executive Management teams of the Group's activities analyze the main risks within their  scope of business, and provide the members of the  Risk  Committee,  prior  to  each  meeting,  with  the information  and  documents  necessary  for  their  work and their discussions.\n\n## Risk management policy\n\nAfter  reviewing  the  COSO  internal  control  frameworks in particular, the Group implemented a risk management  policy  that  was  sent  to  the  Executive Management teams of the activities and Houses. This document describes the methods used by the Group for its risk analysis work.\n\n## 1.3.2 A three-step risk management process involving:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  risks :  this  step  makes  it  possible  to identify  and  centralize  the  main  risks.  A  risk  is characterized by an event, one or more internal or external  sources,  and  one  or  more  consequences. Within the Group, the identification of risks is part of  an  ongoing  process  that  takes  the  Houses' perspective  into  account,  as  well  as  the  Group's broader  vision.  During  this  stage,  interviews  with the main stakeholders (the recommended and most widely used technique) are conducted to identify the risks liable to affect the Group's ability to achieve its objectives. Kering relies on risk registers of the prior year,  as  well  as  various  sources,  both  external  (e.g., surveys) and internal (e.g., reporting of information);\n- \u00b7 assessing  risks :  this  step  involves  evaluating  the main risks identified on the basis of three criteria: their  impact,  their  probability  of  occurrence  and their  level  of  control.  This  is  also  a  continuous effort, and assessments are conducted once a year during  work  sessions  with  key  managers  from  the Houses,  Kering's  divisions  in  the  Americas  and Asia-Pacific,  and  the  Group.  The  risk  management policy describes in detail the criteria and procedures for these assessments;\n- \u00b7 prioritizing  risks :  during  this  last  step,  risks  are ranked by priority and the most appropriate action plan(s) for the Company is (are) identified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  risk  information  is  also  shared with each of the Houses during feedback meetings.\n\n2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.3.3 Oversight of the risk management system\n\nThe  risk  management  system  is  monitored  and reviewed  on  a  regular  basis  to  help  continuously improve  the  system.  The  objective  is  to  identify  and analyze  the  main  risks  and  to  learn  from  risks  that have materialized.\n\nThe Risk Committee meets in principle at least twice a year  to  review  the  risk  maps  drawn  up  by  the  Group Internal Audit  Department,  and  to  monitor  the progress of the specific action plans.\n\nThe Risk Committee met three times in 2020, and the Audit Committee and Board of Directors were apprised of its work at their meetings held in June and October 2020, respectively.\n\n## 1.4 Link between risk management and internal control\n\nThe risk management and internal control systems are complementary, and together help control the Group's activities:\n\n- \u00b7 the risk management system is designed to identify and analyze the main risks. Risks are dealt with and addressed  in  action  plans  that  can  be  adapted  to the organization, may include project management, and  may  also  involve  implementing  controls.  The controls to be implemented are part of the internal control system and may be reviewed based on the risk maps;\n\n- \u00b7 the internal control system uses the risk management system to identify the main risks to be controlled;\n- \u00b7 the  audit  plan  uses  the  risk  map  to  test  the assessment  of  the  level  of  control  of  the  risks identified.\n\nThe  link  between  and  the  combined  balance  of  the two  systems  depend  on  the  control  environment, which is their common base, particularly the risk and control culture of the company and the ethical values of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5 General principles of internal control\n\n## 1.5.1 Definition of internal control 1.5.2 Limits of internal control\n\nThe internal control procedures applicable within the Kering group rely on a set of means, policies, conduct, procedures and appropriate actions to ensure that the necessary measures are taken in order to control:\n\n- \u00b7 activities, operational effectiveness and the efficient use of resources;\n- \u00b7 operational,  labor-related,  environmental,  financial or  compliance  risks  that  could  have  a  significant impact on the Company's assets or the achievement of its objectives.\n\nInternal control is defined as a process conducted by Executive  Management,  under  the  supervision  of  the Board  of  Directors,  and  implemented  by  senior executives and all employees. Regardless of its quality and  its  degree  of  application,  it  cannot  provide  an absolute guarantee of the achievement of goals falling within the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations in force;\n- \u00b7 application of guidelines and directions set by Executive Management;\n- \u00b7 smooth operation of internal processes, particularly those contributing to the safeguarding of assets;\n- \u00b7 reliability of financial and accounting information.\n\n## 1.6 Components of internal control\n\nThe quality of the internal control system is based on the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 the  control  environment  based  on  rules  of  conduct and integrity supported by Management and communicated to all employees;\n- \u00b7 an organization that clearly defines responsibilities and has adequate resources and skills;\n- \u00b7 a system to identify, analyze and manage the main risks;\n- \u00b7 ongoing  oversight  of  the  internal  control  system and regular review of the functioning of the system.\n\n## 1.6.1 Internal control environment\n\nThe  Group's  internal  control  system  is  based  on  a decentralized organization that clearly defines responsibilities through the Group Charter. It includes principles and values governing the conduct and ethics\n\nof all its employees, presented in the Code of Ethics. It also includes an Internal Control Charter. Moreover, it relies on human resources management that ensures the  competency,  ethical  conduct  and  involvement  of its employees.\n\n## The Group Charter\n\nThe Kering  group  adopted  a  Charter  several  years  ago, which was updated in 2012 and provides the framework for  the  decentralization  of  the  organization  and  the responsibility  of  senior  executives.  The  Charter  defines the guiding principles governing the relations between Kering  and  its  activities.  It  also  defines,  within  each functional  area:  (i)  the  matters  that  fall  within  the delegated responsibility of the activities; (ii) those that must  be  communicated  to  Kering  within  appropriate time  frames;  and  (iii)  those  requiring  Kering's  prior authorization.\n\nThe probability of meeting these objectives is subject to  the  limits  inherent  in  any  internal  control  system, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 human  errors  or  malfunctions  occurring  when decisions are made or applied;\n- \u00b7 deliberate  collusion  among  multiple  individuals, enabling them to elude the control system;\n- \u00b7 situations in which implementing or maintaining a control would be more expensive than the risk that it is intended to remedy.\n\nFurthermore,  in  pursuing  the  objectives  indicated above, it is understood that companies are faced with events and uncertainties beyond their control (unexpected  changes  in  the  markets,  competitive environment  or  geopolitical  situation,  or  error  in forecasting or assessing the effects of such changes on the organization, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is now available to all Group employees in 14 languages.\n\nThe  latest  update  focused  chiefly  on  strengthening commitments  regarding  personnel  and  the  behavior expected  of  everyone,  and  on  Group  measures  and policies  brought  in  following  the  introduction  of  new legislation  and  regulations,  such  as  France's  Sapin  II law. The update was also an opportunity to strengthen the  Suppliers'  Charter  included  in  the  Code  of  Ethics, with regard to human rights in particular. In addition, the Code of Ethics now includes a commitment from the  members of  the  Executive  Committee,  as  well  as the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  is presented  to  and  reviewed  by  the  Kering  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  clearly  sets  out  the  ethical principles  that  should  be  applied  everywhere  and  by everyone,  as  well  as  the  Group's  values,  what  it believes in, and what it does not tolerate. It presents the Group's ethics organization (regional Ethics Committees,  the  Group  Ethics  Committee,  the  ethics hotline  and  the  steps  to  take  in  cases  of  suspected non-compliance  with  Kering's  ethics  commitments) and  contains  the  Group's  commitments  and  rules  of conduct towards its main stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 employees;\n- \u00b7 clients and consumers;\n- \u00b7 shareholders and financial markets;\n- \u00b7 business partners and competitors;\n- \u00b7 the environment;\n- \u00b7 civil society.\n\nAs  part  of  its  strengthened  commitment  to  the promotion of and respect for ethics within the Group, an annual online training program in ethics and Code compliance  was  rolled  out  for  all  Kering  employees worldwide  in  2014.  It  is  based  on  case  studies  that show ethics in the light of daily professional life and is updated annually.\n\nThe Ethics Committees are composed of representatives of  the  Group's  Houses  and  Kering  staff.  This  entire structure  is  managed  by  Kering's  Chief  Sustainability Officer and Head of International Affairs.\n\nThe Ethics Committees have three main functions:\n\n- \u00b7 supervising  the  circulation  and  application  of  the Code of Ethics and the principles that it defends;\n- \u00b7 responding  to  any  issues  raised  by  a  Group employee, be it a simple request for clarification or a question relating to the interpretation of the Code and  its  application,  or  a  claim  submitted  to  the\n\nCommittee due to alleged non-compliance with one of  the  Group's  ethical  principles,  a  procedure  now open to third parties in certain circumstances;\n\n- \u00b7 generating  initiatives  for  developing  the  Group's sustainability and ethics policy and activities.\n\nThe changes made to the Code and the organization of ethics  within  the  Group  are  examined  in  detail  in section 2 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business' in Chapter 3 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## The Internal Control Charter\n\nThe Kering group adopted an Internal Control Charter in  2010.  In  order  to  adapt  the  Charter  to  changes within  the  Group  since  its  initial  publication,  a  new edition  was  published  in  2015.  The  Charter  defines internal control  and  sets  out  its  objectives  as presented  in  the  AMF's  reference  framework.  It  also specifies  the  limits  of  internal  control,  which  cannot under any circumstances provide an absolute guarantee  that  the  Company's  objectives  will  be achieved.  The  Charter  specifies  that  the  holding company  serves  to  unite  the  various  entities.  It  also sets  out  the  responsibilities  of  each  of  the  activities and  Houses  in  implementing  an  internal  control system that is adapted to their operations.\n\nThe Charter defines the role of each person involved in the internal control system and the bodies responsible for oversight and assessment.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Charter  specifies  the  existing  tools for  assessing  internal  control  and  risks,  namely  selfassessment of internal control and mapping of major risks, and sets out the basic principles for creating new procedures.\n\n## Human resources policy\n\nQuality of human  resources and cohesion of management are key success factors for the Group.\n\nKering  makes  sure  that  the  various  activities  apply human  resources  policies  that  are  adapted  to  their context  and  challenges,  while  meeting  the  highest local  standards.  The  principle  of  autonomy  and empowerment of the activities is also applied, but the Group  guarantees  the  consistency  of  the  policies implemented  and  their  alignment  with  Kering's centrally defined values and actions.\n\nWith  regard  to  labor  policy,  the  activities  apply  high standards  of  dialogue  and  employee  involvement  in the Company, while the Group engages in dialogue at the  level  of  the  Group's  employee  representative bodies,  the  Group  Works  Council  and  the  European Works Council.",

The Group develops cross-functional training programs  and  conducts annual reviews of its managerial resources. Kering thus ensures that there is a good match both now and in the future between the managerial resources and the challenges  facing  the  activities.  Furthermore,  the Group  maintains  an  active  market  monitoring  policy for all key positions for which the internal succession plan does not appear sufficiently strong.\n\n## 1.6.2 Organization and resources\n\nThe  organization  of  internal  control  depends  on persons  involved  at  every  level  of  the  chain  of responsibility,  from  Executive  Management  to  all employees,  as  well  as  the  bodies  responsible  for oversight and assessment: the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, the Internal Audit and Risk Management Department, and the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe  Kering  group  Executive  Committee,  which  is  an Executive Management body, comprises 12 members, as  described  in  section  2.5  of  Chapter  4  of  this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Executive Committee meets regularly in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 draw  up  and  coordinate  the  Group's  operating strategy;\n- \u00b7 define the priorities through objectives assigned to the activities and the main functional projects;\n- \u00b7 develop synergies between the Houses;\n- \u00b7 propose acquisitions and disposals to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  policies  and projects  defined  within  the  framework  of  the Group's commitments to sustainability.\n\nKering group strategies and goals are discussed each year  via  the  medium-term  plans  and  the  budgets  of the business units of each of its activities.\n\n## Executive Management teams\n\nThe  Executive  Management  teams  define,  coordinate and oversee the Group's internal control system.\n\nThey  are  also  in  charge  of  initiating  the  necessary corrective measures. The Executive Management teams'  involvement  is  of  key  importance  to  the internal  control  system,  given  the  Kering  group's organization.\n\n## Management and employees\n\nManagement  is  the  key  operational  player  of  internal control; it relies on internal control to perform its duties and  reach  its  objectives.  In  this  respect,  management implements  the  internal  control  operations  related  to its  area  of  responsibility  and  ensures  that  the  internal control system is adapted to its activities.\n\nEmployees  need  the  knowledge  and  information necessary to set up, operate and oversee the internal control system, with regard to the assigned objectives. In their day-to-day activities, they follow the principles and rules of control and can suggest ways to improve and detect malfunctions.\n\nThe bodies responsible for oversight and assessment are:\n\n## The Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors contributes to the overall control environment  through  the  skills  of  its  members.  The Board  is  regularly  informed  about  the  methodologies used for internal control and the management of major risks, which it presents in its Board report.\n\nThe duties of the Board of Directors are presented in section 2.2.1 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nUnder the responsibility  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  to which it regularly reports on these matters, the Kering Audit  Committee  comprises  six  members,  four  of whom are independent. It is in charge of monitoring:\n\n- \u00b7 the procedures for preparing financial information;\n- \u00b7 the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk management systems;\n- \u00b7 the statutory audits of annual financial statements and,  if  need  be,  consolidated  financial  statements performed by the Statutory Auditors;\n- \u00b7 the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Kering Audit Committee also carries out the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 verifies  that  the  Group  has  an  Internal  Audit Department  that  is  structured  and  adapted  to  the tasks of identifying, detecting and preventing risks, anomalies  or  irregularities  in  the  management  of the Group's affairs;\n- \u00b7 assesses the relevance and quality of the methods and procedures used;\n- \u00b7 reviews the Internal Audit reports and the recommendations issued;\n- \u00b7 approves the annual Internal Audit plan;\n- \u00b7 reviews the work conducted by the Risk Committee and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\nKering's Audit Committee meets at least four times a year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Chief Audit Executive reports the main results  of  his  assessments  to  Executive  Management and the Audit Committee.\n\nAt  the  level  of  Kering,  the  Internal  Audit  Department reports  to  Executive  Management.  It  coordinates, harmonizes and optimizes working methods and tools, as  well  as  providing  services  (regulatory  intelligence, expertise, resources, etc.) and  conducting  audit assignments within the scope of the annual audit plan.\n\nThe Group Internal Audit Department centrally administers  and  analyzes  internal  control  and  risk management  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and regulations applicable in this area, as described above.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  also  performs  active intelligence  monitoring  with  regard  to  best  internal control  practices.  It  checks  the  control  procedures implemented  by  other  Departments  and  conducts operational  and  financial  audits  within  its  remit.  In 2020,  in  light  of  the  global  pandemic,  the  Internal Audit Department conducted twenty audit assignments, excluding audits in stores.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department draws up the audit plan based,  in  particular,  on  the  Group's  process  guidelines and on the major risks identified for the Houses. It takes account  of  special  requests  from  senior  management and other operational departments. These projects are discussed  with  the  main  persons  in  charge.  The  Audit Committee reviews and approves the final audit plan.\n\nThe  main  issues  identified  by  the  Internal  Audit Department  are  reported  to  the  Audit  Committee.  In this  way,  the  Audit  Committee  is  informed  of  the issues  identified  and  the  action  plans  set  up  by  the entities concerned.\n\nApart from these assignments, all of the Internal Audit resources  in  the  Kering  group  are  dedicated  to promoting  internal  control  on  all  business  processes and activities, be they operational or financial, related to stores, warehouses or headquarters, distribution or manufacturing activities.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  of the Kering group consisted of 20 employees, virtually stable since 2017. Their rules of conduct are described in  their  Audit  Charter.  A  new  version  of  the  Audit Charter was published in 2018. The Charter stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 at the  end  of  each  audit,  the  findings  and recommendations  are  presented  to  the  managers of the area or areas concerned;\n- \u00b7 any agreements or disagreements made known by the audited  parties concerning  the  proposed recommendations are included  in  the  final  report, which  specifies  any  action  plan,  as  well  as responsibilities and the deadlines for implementation;\n- \u00b7 the  operational  staff  members  concerned  are responsible for implementing recommendations;\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Audit  Department  is  in  charge  of verifying their implementation.\n\nInternal Audit activities are performed in coordination with the work of the Audit Committee and the results of the work performed by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  updates  the  Audit Committee  on  progress  made  on  the  audit  plan  and the follow-up of the action plans at least once a year.\n\nIn 2013, Kering's Internal Audit Department published the  following  referential  frameworks  that  establish  a common  methodology:  the  audit  manual  and  the audit  approach.  In  2020,  the  approach  to  auditing stores was updated.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nThe  Statutory  Auditors  review  the  internal  control systems  in  order  to  certify  the  financial  statements. They do so by identifying the strengths and weaknesses  of  those  systems,  assessing  the  risk  of material misstatement, and, where applicable, making recommendations.  Under  no  circumstances  do  the Statutory  Auditors  take  the  place  of  the  Company  in implementing the internal control system.\n\nThe  role  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  is  to  certify  the completeness,  accuracy  and  fair  presentation  of  the parent company and consolidated financial statements on  an  annual  basis  and  issue  a  review  report  on  the Group's interim consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  audit  engagements  are  allocated  between  the joint Statutory Auditors: Deloitte and KPMG.",

        "page_content": "The  main  matters  covered  by  the  Statutory  Auditors are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 identification of the risk areas and performance of tests by sampling  in order to validate the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of the financial statements with regard to their individual or consolidated materiality threshold;\n- \u00b7 validation  of  the  main  accounting  treatments  and options  throughout  the  year,  in  coordination  with the management of the activities and Kering;\n- \u00b7 application of the accounting standards defined by Kering for its activities;\n- \u00b7 preparation of an audit report for each House, in order to certify Kering's consolidated financial statements,  including  any  comments  on  internal control;\n- \u00b7 presentation  of  a  general  overview  of  the  Kering group presented to Kering's Management and to the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 preparation  of  the  Statutory  Auditors'  reports  for Kering's  shareholders.  These  reports  are  presented in sections  4  and  6  of  Chapter  5  'Financial information' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 1.6.3 Risk management\n\nThe  Group's  risk  map  is  defined  based  on  various sources (see diagram below). The risk factors identified are  subject  to  the  mitigation  measures  described  in section 2 of this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6.4 Oversight of the system\n\nThe  ongoing  oversight  of  the  internal  control  system and regular review of its functioning are carried out on three levels: the work performed by Internal Audit, the remarks  made  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  and  the annual  self-assessments.  With  regard  to  the  annual self-assessments  carried  out  within  the  activities  for each  process  identified,  the  managers  in  charge  are asked  to  assess  the  level  of  internal  control  through key  controls  for  their  operations,  in  order  to  identify any weaknesses and implement corrective measures.\n\nSelf-assessment  is  not  simply  a  reporting  tool intended  for  the  Internal  Audit  Department  or  the Audit  Committee;  it  is  also  a  system  that  allows  the Executive  Management  teams  of  the  activities  to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the strength of the internal control system. Self-assessment makes it possible  to  strengthen  the  level  of  internal  control through operational action plans.\n\nThe approach used to analyze internal control is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 a  self-assessment,  using  questionnaires,  conducted with  the  key  operational  staff  members  in  each  of the activities following the breakdown of operations into key processes. In 2015, all of the questionnaires were reviewed in the light of participants' responses during the previous annual assessment and comments from those conducting the assessments. Key controls, as well as fraud risk controls, were also identified  and  added  to  these  questionnaires  in order  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  action plans. The self-assessment campaign now covers all of Kering's operations. The overhaul of the self-assessment  questionnaires  was  continued  in 2019  in  order  to  make  them  more  effective  and better  adapted  to  business  operations.  A  plan  to review  the  entire  content  of  the  self-assessment questionnaires is currently being prepared;\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  make  it  possible  to  harmonize  the level  of  internal  control  applied  throughout  the Group  and  for  all  activities  to  benefit  from  best practices, in particular newly acquired entities. They allow  action  plans  to  be  launched  based  on  the results of these self-assessments;\n- \u00b7 the  finance,  accounting  and  management  process questionnaire takes into account the AMF's reference framework and, in particular, its  application  guide. It includes  some  60  questions  on  the  Group's mandatory  key  controls.  It  is  circulated  among  the largest  subsidiaries  in  the  Group's  activities.  There was  no  change  in  the  scope  of  processes  covered in 2020.\n\nSince 2013, the Internal Audit Department has extended its  self-assessment  procedures  to  stores  throughout the  Group's  Houses.  These  self-assessments  give  the\n\nsales network managers an idea of the effectiveness of their  internal  control  and  a  teaching  aid  to  help  store managers  meet  their  internal  control  obligations.  The self-assessment  questionnaire  for  the  Group's  stores was extensively revised in the first half of 2020 in order to (i) take into account changes in all store activities, (ii) clarify and simplify the questions and make them more relevant, and (iii) simplify the correspondence with the control  points  verified  during  in-store  audits  for comparison purposes. In addition, to facilitate the use of the results, the frequency  of  self-assessment campaigns  in  stores  was  reduced  from  half-yearly  to yearly.  This  approach  was  presented  and  approved  by the Kering Audit Committee.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2020,  the  Group  Finance  Department implemented  a  new  tool  within  the  financial  Shared Services Centers. It enables continuous monitoring of the  transactional  activities  managed  by  the  Group.  It will  be  rolled  out  more  widely  across  all  financial processes through 2021.\n\n## 1.7 Description of internal control procedures relating to the preparation of financial and accounting information\n\nFinancial  and  accounting  information  is  prepared  by the Group Finance Department. At the level of Kering, this  department  supervises  the  Financial  Control Department (which includes the accounting, consolidation  and  management  control  teams),  the Financial Communications Department, the Financing, Treasury  and  Insurance  Department  and  the  Tax Department.\n\n## 1.7.1 Financial Control Department\n\nThe production and analysis of financial information is based  on  a  set  of  financial  management  procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 medium-term plans, which measure the impact of strategic decisions on the Group's key financial and management balances.  They  are  also  used  for  the annual assessment by the Group of the value in use of assets for the various cash-generating units;\n- \u00b7 budgets, which are drawn up in two phases on the basis of discussions between the operating departments and the members of the Group's Executive Management.  The  first  phase  takes  place  in  the fourth quarter of the fiscal year when a preliminary budget  sets  out  the  main  financial  balances  and operating  action  plans.  The  second  stage,  which\n\nfinalizes the budget, takes place in the first quarter of  the  following  year  and  takes  into  account  any significant  events  that  may  have  occurred  in  the meantime;\n\n- \u00b7 monthly  reporting  that  monitors  the  performance of  the  Group's  activities  throughout  the  fiscal  year via specific indicators  whose  consistency  and reliability  are  reviewed  by  the  Financial  Control Department.  This  department  also  oversees  the consistency of the accounting treatment applied by the  activities  with  Group  rules  and  carries  out,  in association  with  their  financial  controllers,  an analytical  review  by  comparison  with  the  budget and the previous year;\n- \u00b7 monthly meetings of Kering's Executive Management  and  the  senior  executives  of  the Group's activities  to  assess  business  trends  on  the basis of financial and operational data provided by meeting participants;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  regular  monitoring  of  the  activities'  offbalance  sheet  commitments.  This  control  is  carried out, in particular, as part of the statutory consolidation process  insofar  as  the  activities  are  required  to provide  an  exhaustive  list  of  their  commercial  or financial  commitments  and  to  monitor  them  from year to year.",

        "page_content": "The statutory consolidation of the financial statements is  carried out at the end of June and December using the  Group  consolidation  tool.  It  enables  financial information to be transferred from the activities in real time after full validation of the consolidation reporting packages by the activities' Statutory Auditors and by the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officers of the Houses, who commit themselves via a signed  representation  letter,  thus  strengthening  the quality of the financial information transferred.\n\nConsolidation  levels  within  the  activities  guarantee  a first level of control and consistency.\n\nKering's Financial Control Department coordinates the process  and  is  in  charge  of  producing  the  Group's consolidated  financial  statements.  For  this  purpose, the  Department  sends  instructions  to  the  activities specifying the reports to be sent, the assumptions to be  applied  and  the  specific  points  to  be  taken  into account.\n\n## 1.7.2 Financial Communications Department\n\nThe Financial Communications Department's role is to provide  information  on  an  ongoing  or  periodic  basis that  conveys  a  consistent  and  clear  message,  and  to comply  with  the  principle  of  equality  between shareholders in relation to disclosures.\n\nFinancial  communications  are  prepared  for  a  diverse target  audience  composed  mainly  of  institutional investors, individuals and employees. Executive Management,  the  Finance  Department  and  the Financial Communications Department are the contacts for  analysts  and  institutional  investors.  The  Human Resources  Department  manages  the  information provided to employees  alongside the Financial Communications Department.\n\nFinancial  information  is  provided  through  various channels (periodic publications, press releases) and via all  means of communication, including press, internet, direct telephone contact and individual meetings.\n\n## 1.7.3 Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department\n\nThe  Financing,  Treasury  and  Insurance  Department manages liquidity, counterparty, foreign exchange and interest  rate  financial  risks.  It  also  coordinates  the Group's  cash  management.  It  manages  the  Group's banking  policy,  establishes  guidelines  regarding  the\n\nallocation  of  activity  by  bank,  and  coordinates  Group calls for tender.  It  ensures  consistency  between published financial information and policies governing interest  rate,  foreign  exchange  and  liquidity  risk management. Almost all of the financing is set up by Kering or Kering Finance. Exceptions are analyzed on a case-by-case basis according to specific opportunities or constraints and require Kering's agreement.\n\nThe  Insurance  Department,  an  integral  part  of  the Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department, establishes  and  manages  the  Group's  policy  on insurance. It is responsible for identifying, quantifying and  handling  risks  (prevention,  self-insurance  or transfer to insurers or reinsurers).\n\n## 1.7.4 Other Departments\n\nInternal control is also strengthened by the centralization of certain functions within Kering:\n\n## Legal Department\n\nApart from its specific function at Company level, the Legal  Department  assists  the  entire  Group  with important  legal  matters  and  coordinates  analyses  or studies  common  to  the  activities  or  of  significant interest for the Group. It also formulates Group policy and  oversees  its  application.  It  provides  the  Houses with  a  methodology  for  identifying  standard  risks enabling them to anticipate such risks and inform the Legal Department.\n\n## Tax Department\n\nThe Tax Department coordinates the Group's tax policy and  advises  and  assists  the  activities  on  all  issues related to tax law, as well as on the implementation of tax consolidation in France.\n\n## Communications Department\n\nThe  Communications  Department  is  involved  in  the Group's  development  by  enhancing  its  image  and reputation both internally and externally.\n\n## Information Systems Department\n\nThe Information Systems Department is responsible for providing optimal operational performance, controlling IT risk and improving the Group's information systems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The table below shows the Group's  14  main  risk  factors  (presenting  the  highest levels of criticality [levels 1 and 2]):\n\n## Risk\n\n| Human rights and fundamental freedoms            |\n|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer experience                              |\n| Production management                            |\n| Real estate management                           |\n| COVID-19                                         |\n| Brand strategies                                 |\n| Distribution network                             |\n| Employment standards                             |\n| Kering's luxury paradigm and business model      |\n| Macro-economy and geopolitics                    |\n| Product quality and safety, consumer health      |\n| Climate change, other natural  or man-made risks |\n| Raw materials scarity, quality and biodiversity  |\n| Talent management                                |\n\nAll of the risks presented below represent the specific risk  factors  to  which  the  Kering  group  is  exposed. These  risks  are  considered  material  for  the  Group within  the  meaning  of  Article  16  of  the  Prospectus Regulation,  despite  the  risk  management  policies adopted to mitigate the probability of their occurrence or their impact.\n\nTo  assess  the  overall  materiality  of  its  risk  factors, Kering draws up a risk matrix summarizing the criticality of each one based on a graphical representation of its probability  of  occurrence  and  its  average  potential impact.",

Furthermore,  Kering  seeks  to  obtain  sustainability certification (e.g., BREEAM or LEED) for the majority of its properties.\n\nTo ensure that new partners comply with the applicable laws and regulations,  the  Compliance  Department  carries  out  compliance audits. A regulatory intelligence system is also being introduced by the Construction and Project Management Department.\n\nThe Group has set up a network of real estate experts, present in key  countries,  so  that  it  can  leverage  the  expertise  of  employees who know the market's specific characteristics and local laws and regulations, and also have the necessary negotiating skills.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover,  as  shown  by  the  performance  of  the Group's  brands  by  region,  they  affect  the  regions  in  which  the Group operates unevenly.\n\nPast years have shown that, apart from major systemic or health crises,  macro-economic  and  geopolitical  instability  can  partly explain trends by region, but without affecting the Group's overall performance.\n\nThe diversity  of  the  brands'  geographic  footprints  helps  limit  the Group's  exposure  to  uncertainties  or  even  a  deterioration  in  the economic  conditions  or  security  profile  of  a  given  country.  The Group's distribution network remains balanced across the regions: sales  are  made  through  a  network  of  1,433  directly  operated stores,  including  770  stores  in  mature  markets  and  663  in emerging countries. Direct sales (78%) are supplemented by sales to  third  party  distributors,  and  the  Group's  broad  spectrum  of products makes it less dependent on any single category.\n\nBoth the Group's market positioning and strategy (see section 5 of Chapter 1 'Presentation of the Group and key highlights' for more details)  help  limit  the  impacts  of  macro-economic  cycles  and uncertainty on its activities.\n\nAs explained in the overview of the personal luxury goods market and the eyewear market (see section 2.3 'Our markets' of Chapter 2 'Group  activities'),  besides  cyclical  factors  or  the  COVID-19  crisis, which  could  end  in  the  short  or  medium  term  thanks  to vaccination programs now underway, the Group is also exposed to structural medium-term growth patterns related to the increase in the world's population and changes in the population mix. Over the next few decades, the number of people belonging to the 'global middle class' is set to almost double, with Asia accounting for the bulk of this growth.\n\nLastly, the Group has demonstrated in the past its ability to adapt its  organization,  operating  methods  and  strategic  priorities  in response  to  changes  in  the  macro-economic  and  technological environment. Its level of profitability and cash generation allows it to  invest  in  a  long-term  perspective  and  to  weather  the  sector's recessionary  phases,  even  though  the  downward  adjustment  of cost  bases  remains  a  long  and  complex  process  in  an  industry where the proportion of fixed operating expenses is high.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A profitability study is carried out for each new store before any expenditure is committed and again within two or three years of opening.\n\nThe  Houses  track  their  sales  volumes  closely  and  regularly  to anticipate major fluctuations that could require increased staffing levels in the stores or an extension of the retail space.\n\nContracts  with  department  stores  are  reviewed  with  the  Group's Legal  department  to  ensure  that  the  distribution  network  is optimal  and  efficient.  Kering  closely  monitors  changes  in  the position of department stores, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe  Group  prevents  sales  of  its  products  by  parallel  distribution networks  by  working  to  increase  the  traceability  of  its  goods, prohibiting  direct  sales  to  these  networks  (grey  market)  and implementing  specific  measures  to  tighten  control  over  its distribution channels.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group actions\n\nThe  creative  leadership  of  each  House  and  the  success  of  its collections  and  resulting  commercial  appeal  are  managed  by Creative  Departments  and  perpetuated  by  remaining  true  to  the identity and fundamental values of the brand.\n\nStrong  interaction  between  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Creative Director of each House preserves its value and respect for its  identity  over  time.  The  accounting  impacts  of  impairment losses  are  described  in  Note  15  to  the  consolidated  financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe  Houses  invest  continuously  in  communication,  research  and development,  and  developing  their  store  network  to  achieve  the right  positioning.  They  communicate  about  their  values,  inspire and  fascinate  their  customers  and  protect  their  margins  in  the long-term  (see  also  section  2.2  'Operating  investments'  of Chapter 5).\n\nFurthermore,  in  relation  to  the  Group's  sustainability  strategy, several  Houses  have  launched  social  programs  (World  Food Programme,  donation  of  profits  from  capsule  collections  to charities working  to  protect  endangered  species,  etc.)  and encourage their employees to take part in sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These documents are part of the contractual framework.\n\nA  Human Rights  policy  has  also  been  drafted  at  Group  level  and covers both Kering's operations and its supply chains.\n\nThe  whistleblowing  system  is  open  to  everyone  working  for  the Group: employees and interns of Kering and its Houses, as well as external and temporary personnel working for external partners or service providers under contract with the Group. It can be used to report any suspected violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms  within  the  Group  and  its  supply  chains.

In 2020, Kering also  carried  out  an  internal  risk  assessment  to  identify  and evaluate  risks  related  to  human  rights  in  connection  with  the sourcing  of  certain  key  raw  materials.  This  analysis  factored  in aspects regarding the countries from which suppliers operate.\n\nLastly, work began in 2020 to roll out a collaborative portal with a view  to  optimizing  communication  between  Kering  and  its suppliers.  Its  aim  is  to  provide  suppliers  with  ready  access  to training and key Kering documents - including on human rights but  also  to  afford  greater  transparency  on  supply  chains (reporting).\n\nIn addition, the Group has adopted a stringent control strategy in the area of human rights, which includes but is not limited to the social  audits  conducted  each  year  across  thousands  of  Group suppliers and service providers.\n\nThe  policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes obtained  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to human rights and fundamental freedoms are presented in detail in section 2.6 'Protection of human  rights' of Chapter 3 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Entitled  'Climate  Change:  Implications and Strategies for the Luxury Fashion Sector', it analyzes current and future climate risks for cotton, cashmere, vicu\u00f1a wool, silk and cow, calf, sheep and lambskin leather.\n\nKering  has  finalized  its  climate  strategy,  which  sets  out  in  detail the  commitments,  objectives  and  actions  implemented  by  the Group to make its supply chains more resilient, starting with the introduction of the Environmental Profit and Loss (EP&L) account. The  EP&L  allows  Kering  to  measure  its  environmental  impacts, including its carbon footprint, throughout the value chain and to monetize them. Beyond the risk management dimension, the EP&L is  also  used  as  a  management  tool  to  orient  the  Group  towards sustainable  sourcing  solutions  and  to  assess  the  raw  materials used in product design.\n\nThe Group has set very ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint by 2025 and has had its own Science Based Target in this respect since 2017. Kering was the first luxury group to be verified and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets, which were revised in 2020 to align them  with  the  1.5\u00b0C  scenario,  in  keeping  with  the commitments made as part of the Fashion Pact in 2019.\n\nAlso a member of the TCFD since 2017, Kering follows the work and recommendations  of  the  task  force,  and  in  2020  included  a cross-reference table with the TCFD recommendations in its NFIS for  the  first  time.  The  Group  is  also  working  in  2021  to  define climate scenarios and to assess their financial impact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In  addition  to  its  efforts  on  reducing  carbon  emissions,  the  Group has been offsetting all residual emissions in Scopes 1 and 2 since 2012.  In  2019,  it  went  a  step  further  by  offsetting  all  residual emissions  in  Scope  3  (including  supply  chain  emissions)  through carbon  credits  with  certified  REDD+  projects.  In  light  of  the  global pandemic situation in 2020, the Group had to scale down its efforts, nevertheless offsetting 100% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a large part of its Scope 3 emissions. The policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes obtained and the associated performance indicators relating to climate change and the Group's climate strategy are presented in detail in sections 3.2 'Environmental footprint of Kering's operations' and 4.4 'Preserving natural  capital'  of  Chapter  3  'Sustainability'  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn addition, the Group's Security Department has drawn up a crisis management policy in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 provide  a  shared  framework  for  all  Group  entities  and  raise awareness among its management teams of the importance of having a pre-established crisis management procedure;\n- \u00b7 ensure a rapid, coordinated response to any major events that could impact the Group.\n\nEvery year, the Security Department organizes crisis drills based on probable, realistic scenarios in order to train designated crisis unit members.\n\nIt  also  provides  support  and  advice  to  Group  employees  during business travel.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Potential  loss  of  know-how  among  the Group's teams or among the craftspeople and  manufacturers  within  the  supply chain  or  the  communities  from  which the Group sources key and/or specific raw materials.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Departure of senior executives: inability to  find,  in  a  timely  manner,  a  suitable successor for an Executive Management position (Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Group Managing Director, Executive Committee member), as the result of departure or incapacity.\n- \u00b7 Unexpected  departure  of  a  Creative Director, leading to a period of uncertainty that could have a significant impact  on  the  brand  (particularly  in terms  of  image  and  reputation,  asset writedowns,  etc.).  However,  any  luxury goods  company  may  have  to  face  and manage this risk at some time.\n- \u00b7 Dilution of technical craftsmanship in transformation, cutting and assembly. Extinction of traditional crafts.\n- \u00b7 Talent retention: loss of key employees to competitors.\n- \u00b7 The  luxury  industry  is  supported  by numerous  manufacturing  communities worldwide.  They  are  subject  to  the  risk of  social,  economic  and  operational tensions, such as community problems, disruptions to production and a shrinking  talent  pool.

In  2019,  weekly  job postings  were  introduced  to  share  opportunities  and  encourage internal mobility within the Group.\n\nFurthermore, a global employee opinion survey was conducted in January 2019 among all Group employees to measure engagement and identify action plans on subjects identified as priorities.\n\nA Chief Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Officer was appointed in 2019. Bringing  talent  management  and  diversity  and  inclusion  issues within the remit of the same Department gives a new dimension to talent development by forming more diverse teams in the image of our  customers.  It  also  makes  a  positive  contribution  to  the attraction, recruitment,  development  and  retention  of  Group employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  fulfill these  high  expectations,  Kering  and  its  Houses  offer  goods  and collections  that  are  iconic,  exclusive  and  innovative,  and  whose design  and  creation  require  strategic  know-how  and  technical craftsmanship  in  transformation,  cutting  and  assembly.  To maintain  the  know-how  of  its  Luxury  businesses  over  the  long term,  Kering  runs  personnel  training  and  skills  preservation initiatives,  and  internalizes  a  number  of  functions  that  were previously subcontracted.\n\nWith Kering Learning, the Group now has a digital training platform for  all  employees,  providing  a  shared  foundation  for  all  Houses. Training  is  accessible  in  multi-channel  formats,  thereby  making content more accessible to employees.\n\nA  talent  review  is  also  carried  out  each  year  by  the  Executive Committee  -  the  starting  point  for  the  succession  plan  for  key positions within the Group, as set out in section 2.2.6 of Chapter 4.\n\nParticular  attention  is  paid  to  the  Houses'  creative  and  design teams in order to maintain their identity over the long term and nurture  the  Group's  vision  of  'embracing  creativity  for  a  modern, bold  vision  of  Luxury'.  There  is  a  close  relationship  between  a luxury brand and its Creative Director, whose attitude has to reflect the  values  of  the  brand  and  respect  the  Group's  own  values.  The departure  of  a  Creative  Director  leads  to  a  period  of  uncertainty that could have a significant impact on the brand (particularly in terms of image and reputation, asset write-downs, etc.). However, any luxury goods company may have to face and manage this risk at some time. Kering's brand portfolio nevertheless helps limit the impact of this risk at Group level.\n\nThe  policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes obtained  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to talent  management  are  presented  in  detail  in  sections  3.1 'Supporting  our  employees'  and  5.2  'Community  impact  and preservation  of  know-how'  of  Chapter  3  'Sustainability'  of  this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464 and described in section 3.1 'Supporting our employees'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  works  with  suppliers  and  subcontractors  across  the  supply chain to secure long-term access to these raw materials.\n\nThe Group has forged special partnerships with key suppliers and pursues a policy of actively seeking new partners. It also develops synergies within the production chain by means of acquisitions or strategic business partnerships in the subcontracting market.\n\nThe  Group  also  ensures  that  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors comply  with  its  standards  in  terms  of  ethics  and  responsible business  conduct  and  in  particular  with  its  Group  Suppliers' Charter, which is included in the Kering Code of Ethics. The Group ensures  that  its  suppliers  abide  by  the  applicable  laws  and regulations and that its supplies meet international standards.\n\nIn addition, the Group has defined standards for the supply of all its  key  raw  materials,  published  in  January  2018  and  updated  in 2019 and 2020. The standards focus on five areas: social impact, environmental  impact,  traceability,  use  of  chemicals  and  animal welfare. They serve as a guide for assessing the compliance of raw materials  suppliers  and  present  two  levels  of  expectations: minimum requirements and best practices to be achieved by 2025 at the latest, in line with the Group's sustainability strategy and its 2025 targets.\n\nTo align its practices with its commitments  and  drive industry-wide progress toward treatment of animals that is safer, more just and more humane, Kering believes that it has a duty to apply the highest standards in the area of animal welfare. In the sustainability  strategy  adopted  by  the  Group,  the  welfare  of animals, and particularly of livestock, is associated with environmental  stewardship,  safer  working  conditions  and,  more generally, a higher level of supplier performance.\n\nIn  this  vein,  in  2019  the  Group  published  specific  standards  on animal welfare to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible throughout the Group's supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It sets out the Group's responsibilities and expectations as regards the health and safety of its employees and suppliers. It also defines the Group's  standards  and  the  methodology  to  be  used  for  reporting, audits  and  the  assessment  of  accidents  and  incidents.  Lastly,  it explains  prevention  methods  and  the  arrangements  for  training Group employees.\n\nThe Group's Code of Ethics states that Kering commits to providing a work place that complies with human rights, labor legislation and environmental,  health  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  in  all countries where it operates. The Suppliers' Charter, which forms an integral  part  of  the  Code  of  Ethics,  lists  the  commitments expected of our suppliers and business partners, and in particular prohibits all types of work that, due to their nature or conditions, are  likely  to  endanger  health,  safety,  security  or  morality  (clean, safe  work  environment,  access  to  drinking  water  and  restroom facilities,  etc.).  Kering  has  a  whistleblowing  system  open  to  all employees and contractual providers for reporting concerns about practices contrary to the Group's ethical values.\n\nEach year, the Group performs audits of its suppliers and their own subcontractors. These audits cover health and safety to make sure that  the  applicable  regulations  and  the  Group's  requirements  are observed.  Audits  are  performed  on  suppliers  already  working  for the Group and on potential suppliers ahead of entering a business relationship. The outcome of the audits is used as a basis to draw up a list of approved Group suppliers.\n\nIn keeping with its commitments as regards the health and safety of  its  employees  and  stakeholders,  the  Group  established  a Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL) in 2014. Its aim is to discontinue the use of dangerous chemicals in the manufacturing  process,  first  to  ensure  that  workers  within  the Group's operations and in the supply chains of the Houses are not exposed  to  hazardous  substances,  and  second  to  reduce  toxic discharges into water.\n\nSince 2018, the Group and its Houses have applied the Charter on the  working  relations  with  fashion  models  and  their  well-being. This Charter applies in all countries where the Group operates and aims  to  promote  high  standards  of  integrity,  responsibility  and respect towards its models. It includes several major commitments regarding  the  health  and  age  of  models  employed  by  the  Group. For example, Kering has undertaken not to work with models aged under 18 for its adult fashion shows and photo shoots.\n\nThe  policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes obtained  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to employment  standards  are  presented  in  detail  in  sections  3.1 'Supporting  our  employees'  and  4.3  'Working  conditions  in  our supply  chains'  of  Chapter  3  'Sustainability'  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464 and described in sections 3.1 'Supporting our employees' and 4.2.5.3 'Supporting our suppliers during the health crisis' of Chapter 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To this end, each of Kering's Houses has a crisis management policy and unit that liaises with headquarters.\n\nThe  Group  also  monitors  adherence  by  personnel  to  the  Kering group Charter, which defines the framework for the decentralization  of  the  organization,  and  to  the  Code  of  Ethics, which  is  available  in  14  languages  and  was  last  circulated  to  all employees  in  2019  after  being  updated  in  2018.  A  Group  Ethics Committee has been established and is supported by two regional counterparts,  the  Asia-Pacific  (APAC)  Ethics  Committee  and  the Americas  Ethics  Committee.  Together,  they  ensure  compliance with the Code of Ethics and respond to all inquiries, from simple ethics-related questions to the management of complaints about potential  non-compliance  with  the  Code.  The  Compliance  team also  assists  and  guides  employees  to  ensure  compliance  with prevailing legal requirements, including those relating to corruption and competition law. A global hotline is also available to all Group employees and those working for partner companies with which the Group has a contractual relationship.\n\nEach year, a mandatory Ethics & Compliance e-learning program is provided  for  all  Group  employees  around  the  world  to  remind them  about  the  fundamentals  of  ethics  and  their  obligations  in this  regard.  It  presents  real-world  examples  of  ethical  dilemmas, enabling  employees  to  test  their  ability  to  question,  discern  and judge  different  situations.  It  also  provides  an  opportunity  to remind employees about the Group's whistleblowing system.\n\nAt  the  same time, the Group ensures that its suppliers adhere to the Group Suppliers' Charter, which they are required to promote within  their  production  units  and  with  respect  to  their  own subcontractors.  Compliance  is  further  measured  by  means  of social  audits  at  production  sites.  The  Charter  is  included  in  the Code  of  Ethics  and  was  therefore  also  updated  and  circulated among suppliers again in 2019. A further step was taken in 2020 with the development and roll-out of a communication campaign specifically  dedicated  to  the  direct  suppliers  of  the  Group,  its Houses and their various employees. Available in 15 languages, it was designed to ensure that suppliers' employees are aware of the Group's key commitments and ethical principles, enshrined in the Kering  Code  of  Ethics,  as  well  as  of  the  existence  of  the  Kering whistleblowing system, which is at their disposal, as well as why, when and how to use it.\n\nAll  of  the  Group's  Houses  implement  appropriate  methods  and steps to ensure their activities comply with the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards: SA8000 and RJC certification, social  audits  and  supplier  training  programs  are  examples  of  the actions  and  programs  that  the  Houses  have  put  in  place  in  their day-to-day operations.\n\nThe  policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes obtained  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to ethics  and  global  governance  are  presented  in  detail  in  section  2 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business' of Chapter 3 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n- 484",

According to the Group entities' experts and advisors, no  litigation  currently  in  progress  concerning  Group  companies presents  a  risk  for  the  normal  operations  of  the  Group  or  for  its future development. Provisions have been set aside in the Group's 2020  consolidated  financial  statements  to  cover  all  of  the above-mentioned legal risks, including the impact of commitments  given  on  the  disposal  of  controlling  interests (see  Note  27).  None  of  these  risks  have  been  qualified  as  arising outside the scope of normal business for Group companies.\n\nThe Group considers that the effective methods and procedures for identifying  and  managing  its  industrial  and  environmental  risks within  each  of  the  entities  concerned,  which  rely  chiefly  on  the advice  of  duly  authorized  external  organizations  and  advisors, meet,  in  terms  of  relevance  and  proportion,  customary  technical and  professional  standards  under  the  prevailing  regulatory framework. An active prevention and safety policy are an integral part of these methods and procedures.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has granted various vendor warranties in connection  with  disposals  of  controlling  interests  in  subsidiaries made over the last ten years (see Note 33 to the 2020 consolidated financial statements).\n\nAs  regards  the  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  the  Group's activities  (excluding  possible  international  sanctions  that  may  be imposed  against  certain  countries  but  have  no  impact  on  the Group's  activities),  Kering's  businesses  are  subject  to  the  same constraints  and  obligations  as  those  directly  applicable  to  its competitors on its different markets. None of the businesses are subject  to  specific  rules  or  exemptions  in  any  of  the  relevant territories.\n\nThe  Company  is  not  aware  of  any  foreseeable  regulatory  or legislative changes in contradiction with the foregoing.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, during the last 12 months or more, there have been no governmental, legal, or arbitration proceedings (including any pending or threatened proceedings of which the issuer is aware) that have had in the recent past, or are likely to have in the future, a significant impact on the financial position or earnings of the issuer or the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This situation does not preclude any of the trademarks belonging to the Group  being  licensed  to  third  parties  for  the  sale  of  goods  or services under its trademark enhancement policy, as has been the case in fragrances and cosmetics. In all cases, any such licensing agreements  have  been  entered  into  under  fair  commercial  and financial  terms  and  conditions  and  have  no  impact  on  the ownership of the trademarks and signs belonging to the Group.\n\nFurther information on contractual obligations and other commitments  is  provided in Notes 23 and 33 to the 2020 consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  Group  has  strengthened  its  teams,  particularly  in  the  Legal Department  and  the  Shared  Services  Centers,  to  ensure  that contracts  have  been  properly  set  up  with  the  Group's  suppliers.

As  such, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  is  personally  involved  in  the  development  and implementation of the anti-corruption program within Kering and its Houses, both internally and externally. He is supported by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus in his capacity  as  Group  Managing  Director  and  by  the  Board  of  Directors, particularly  within  the  Audit  Committee and the Remuneration Committee, and is  relayed  by  the  House  CEOs,  who  are  also  personally  involved  in  the development  and  implementation  of  the  compliance  program.  Their collective commitment forms the 'Tone at the top' approach of Kering and its Houses. Locally, the structure of the compliance function described below allows  for  a  'Tone  from  the  middle'  approach  implemented  personally  at Region  and  House  levels  by  the  Compliance  Officers,  who  are  mostly  local managers selected in large part so that they can use their position within the Group to relay management's commitment at all levels of the organization.\n\nIn 2015, the Group set up a dedicated function responsible for developing and  supervising  the  implementation  of  a  compliance  program  meeting the  requirements  of  France's  Sapin  II  law,  among  other  aspects.  It  is headed by the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Audit Committee. To ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of  the  compliance  program,  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  is supported by (i) a team of five compliance law experts working in Paris, Hong  Kong,  Shanghai  and  Tokyo,  (ii)  a  network  of  Brand  Compliance Officers appointed by the House CEOs, and (iii) a network of Regional and Local  Compliance  Officers.  In  some  Houses,  there  are  compliance managers in addition to the Brand and Local Compliance Officers.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  compliance  program  in  place  within  Kering  and  its Houses  meets  the  requirements  of  international  standards,  and  more particularly the eight pillars required under Article 17 of the Sapin II law. The Group Chief Compliance Officer attends at least one meeting of the Audit Committee each year to report to its members on the status of the compliance  program  and  its  implementation.  The  Audit  Committee ensures  that  compliance  risks  are  sufficiently  mitigated  and  that  the Compliance Officers have the appropriate resources. The Committee also discusses  the  annual  objectives  to  be  assigned  by  the  Remuneration Committee  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing  Director  in  terms  of  compliance.  The  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  also  meet  regularly with the Group Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n## Risk map:\n\nAn initial assessment of corruption risks was used to draw up a risk map in 2016-2017, which was updated in 2018. In 2019, the Group performed an in-depth assessment of corruption risks in its operations and in the operations of each of its Houses. This assessment was run over a period of  nine  months by an independent specialist law firm working with the Group Chief Compliance Officer and her teams, and involved more than 242  Group  employees  across  all  regions,  functions  and  management levels.  To  ensure  that  the  risk  assessment  was  comprehensive,  each potential  corruption  scenario  relevant  to  the  Group  was  identified  and assessed  after  analyzing  first,  second  and  third  levels  of  control.  They included non-compliant hiring, cash, gifts, hospitality and entertainment, sponsorship  and  donations,  relations  with  third  parties  (including  real estate transactions), discounts, CRM program, inventory, and mergers and acquisitions.  The  resulting  corruption  risks  with  these  scenarios  were rated and ranked in a preliminary risk map.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Code of Ethics, the anti-corruption policy and the internal control procedures and dedicated compliance procedures of the Group and the Houses were revised or are currently undergoing revision following the last update of the corruption risk map in 2019. Guidelines are provided to help Group employees apply them in the situations identified as being the most at risk.\n\nDue diligence procedures for all direct and indirect suppliers, acquisition targets, joint venture and consortium partners, as well as beneficiaries of sponsorships  and  donations,  have  also  been  tightened  so  as  to  better prevent the risks of corruption, fraud, money laundering and violation of economic sanctions. These procedures round out the Hercules project.\n\nIn  addition,  employees  identified  as  being  most  at  risk  are  receiving customized  training  to  improve  first-level  control  over  the  new procedures. This training comes in addition to the Ethics and Compliance e-learning program that is mandatory for all Group employees.\n\n- \u00b7 Detection:\n\nA  procedure  is  in  place  for  reporting  concerns,  and  as  such  to  detect potential corruption risks. The management of this system is described in greater  detail  in  Chapter  3,  section  2,  'Ethics,  the  cornerstone  of  our business'.\n\nSecond-level compliance audits to ensure the proper implementation of the compliance program and detect corruption risks are carried out on and off site  by  the  Group  Compliance  Department,  with  the  support  of  an international  law  firm  to  reinforce  the  independence  and  expertise  of  the analysis  in  the  most  at-risk  jurisdictions  identified  in  the  risk  map.  A  first on-site compliance review was conducted in China in 2019, and a second in the Middle East in 2020. Each resulted in the development of a local action plan to remedy the shortcomings identified. The results are also taken into account  in  the  rating  of  the  implementation  of  anti-corruption  controls assessed in the regularly updated risk map.\n\nInternal  Audit  also  regularly  performs  third-level  audits  to  determine whether Group procedures, including compliance procedures, are applied.\n\n- \u00b7 Remediation:\n\nCorruption risk map updates, compliance reviews and internal audits are conducted to enhance the identification of the shortcomings that Kering and  its  Houses  are  remedying,  with  the  aim  of  continuously  improving the  compliance  program.  For  example,  the  corruption  risk  identified  as the most material for the Group when the risk map was updated in 2019 relates to relationships with third parties, particularly business partners or  in  the  context  of  real  estate  transactions.  Accordingly,  at  the  end  of 2019, the Group adopted a revised due diligence procedure to strengthen controls  over  distributors,  lessors  and  service  providers  involved  in  the creation and renovation of stores.\n\nLastly,  the  whistleblowing  system  set  up  by  the  Group  also  helps  the Group identify and take action to deal with any misconduct.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  is  also  committed  to  ensuring  that  all  Group entities pay all of the taxes due in each of the countries where they operate.\n\nTo that end, the Kering group can rely on a competent team of tax specialists in each of its regions as well as at its headquarters, all highly skilled and benefiting from ongoing training.\n\nTo  understand  the  various  tax-related  issues  that  may  arise,  the Kering group Tax Department is tasked notably with:\n\n- \u00b7 consolidating tax information from all Group companies;\n- \u00b7 understanding and monitoring tax issues that arise at national or international level and coordinating responses in compliance with the applicable laws and standards;\n- \u00b7 ensuring  that  intra-group  transactions  are  documented  as required;\n- \u00b7 providing  technical  support  on  tax-related  matters  during  the preparation of consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  Tax  Department  has  therefore  implemented  a  number  of verification and control tools to help identify and resolve any tax issues that may arise within the Group and to ensure compliance with the applicable national tax laws and international standards. These tools include: regular analyses of comparable information to ensure  that  intra-group  transactions  are  carried  out  on  an  arm's length basis; annual reviews of Group entities; and close, detailed monitoring of any tax audits to which Group entities are subject.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Tax  Department  actively  ensures  that  all  Group entities apply and uphold the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 allocate  the  human  and  financial  resources  necessary  to conduct their business;\n- \u00b7 only have a presence in countries where they actually conduct business;\n- \u00b7 comply  with  the  applicable  national  laws  and  international standards  on  transfer  pricing.

These  changes  can  have  an  impact  on Kering's  results  and  equity  expressed  in euros,  particularly  on  translation  of  noneurozone subsidiaries' financial statements. This makes  it  difficult to compare performances from one year to the next.\n\nIn  addition,  the  majority  of  the  Group's sales are carried out in currencies other than its functional currency, primarily in US  dollars  and  in  Asian  currencies  such as  the  Japanese  yen  and  the  Chinese yuan.  Purchases  and  other  expenses related to production are primarily denominated in euros.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\nBased on market data as of December 31, 2020,  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange hedging  instruments  in  the  event  of  a sudden 10% increase in the euro exchange rate against the principal currencies to which the Group is exposed (USD, JPY and CNY) would have a positive impact  of  \u20ac178  million  at  December  31, 2020  on  the  revaluation  reserve  for financial instruments recognized in equity.\n\n- 492\n\nDepartment, is responsible for this organization and has the necessary expertise, resources (particularly technical) and information systems. It executes transactions in various financial markets with optimum efficiency and security via Kering Finance SNC, which is dedicated  to  cash  management  and  financing.  The Financing  and  Treasury  Department  also  coordinates cash management for the subsidiaries and sets out the Group's banking policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group actions\n\nThe Group has adopted a hedging strategy to minimize the impact of currency  fluctuations  on  its  results.  It  accordingly  uses derivatives either to hedge foreign currency trade receivables and payables,  or  to  hedge  highly  probable  forecast  exposures  and/or firm commitments.\n\nHedging periods are adapted to each House's business cycle and only marginally exceed one year at each reporting date.\n\nThe  Group  also  hedges  foreign  exchange  risk  on  financial  assets and liabilities issued in foreign currencies by using currency swaps for  refinancing  purposes  or  by  investing  cash  in  euros  or  local currency.\n\nNote 24.2 to the annual consolidated financial statements sets out the nature of the hedging instruments held by the Group and its exposure to foreign exchange risk.\n\nKering Finance SNC processes, controls and provides administrative support for foreign exchange transactions on behalf of  Group  companies.  Front-,  middle-,  back-office  and  accounting tasks are separated for security reasons, as well as to ensure that derivatives  contracted  internally  are  unwound  on  the  market. Kering Finance  SNC  uses  market-standard  techniques  and information systems to price currency instruments.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The dual-tranche  bond  issue  carried  out  in  2020  -  comprising  a \u20ac600 million tranche redeemable in 2023 and a second tranche of the  same  amount  redeemable  in  2028  -  is  an  example  of  this approach.\n\nThe Group's active risk management policy also seeks to diversify sources of funding and limit reliance on individual lenders.\n\nThe Group had confirmed lines of credit totaling \u20ac4,365.2 million as  of  December  31,  2020  compared  to  \u20ac3,035  million  as  of December  31,  2019  (see  Note  23.6  to  the  annual  consolidated financial statements).\n\nIn  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group  had  issued \u20ac552.2  million  of  securities  under  its  NEU  CP  program  filed  with the Banque de France.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Group had cash and cash equivalents totaling \u20ac3,451.8 million.\n\nInformation relating  to  liquidity  risk  is  presented  in  Note  24.7  to the annual consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe actions taken to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented on page 464.\n\n## 2.6 Insurance and risk treatment\n\nThe  Kering  risk  management  policy  is  based  on  the ongoing  identification  and  evaluation  of  risks,  risk prevention,  protection  of  people  and  property,  and safety and business continuity plans.\n\nThe Group's risk management policy also includes the transfer of risks to insurance companies.\n\n## Insurance against risks\n\nThe  Group's  policy  of  transferring  significant  risks  to insurance companies is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 achieving the best economic balance between risk coverage, premiums and self-insurance; and\n- \u00b7 the insurance available, insurance market constraints and local regulations.\n\nCoverage  is  based  on  the  'all  risks  except  those specifically excluded' approach, determined by assessing the financial consequences for the Company of a possible claim, especially in the areas of:\n\n- \u00b7 third party liability: bodily harm or property damage to  third  parties  caused  by  products,  fittings  and equipment;\n- \u00b7 fire, explosions, water damage, etc.;\n- \u00b7 operating losses following direct damage.\n\nInsurance coverage is purchased based on an assessment  by  site  and  company  of  the  level  of coverage  necessary  to  face  reasonably  estimated potential occurrences of diverse risks (liability, damage and third-party  retailer  counterparty).  This  assessment takes account of the analyses of the insurers underwriting the Group's risks.",

This is one of the reasons why the Group is able to place its risks with insurers prepared to deal with the unforeseeable and uncertain consequences of accidents.\n\nInsurance coverage concerns all Group companies.\n\nThe levels of coverage in place for the main potential risks facing the Group as a whole as of January 1, 2020, were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 damage, fire,  explosions  or  water  damage  and  the ensuing operating losses: \u20ac300 million increased to \u20ac500 million for the Group's major sites;\n- \u00b7 third party liability: \u20ac145 million;\n- \u00b7 damage to or loss of goods in transit: \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 fraud  and  acts  of  malice  to  goods  and  valuables: \u20ac20 million.\n\nThe total risk financing cost for Kering includes three main  items  (in  addition  to  'physical'  protection  and prevention expenditure) and breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 cost of deductibles and non-insured losses retained or self-insured by the subsidiaries in 2020: \u20ac23 million;\n- \u00b7 claims  covered  by  the  Group  itself  through  its reinsurance  company  in  2020:  \u20ac12  million  (total estimated at year-end 2020).\n\nTaking out self-insurance through the Group's reinsurance  subsidiary  reduces  insurance  costs  and enhances performance because (i) frequently occurring  risks  are  pooled  within  the  Group  and insured  for  an  amount  that  is  fixed  per  claim  and (ii) exceptionally frequent claims made in a given year are covered by reinsurance.\n\nSince  July  1,  2020,  the  Group's  reinsurance  company has  covered  damage  and  operating  losses  of  up  to \u20ac3  million  per  claim  (for  the  period  from  July  1  to June 30):\n\n- \u00b7 insurance premiums and management fees including  engineering  visits  and  Brokers  fees,  etc. (final 2020 expenses): \u20ac17.8 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3 COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION\n\nAs a Luxury group, Kering collects customer data that could  potentially  have  a  higher  market  value  than similar  data  in  other  industries.  Aware  of  the  risk  of data misuse and the development of legislation in this regard,  Kering  is  working  on  developing  a  single compliance  program  to  ensure  that  all  of  its  Houses\n\ntreat  these  issues  in  a  structured  manner.  This  will help to strengthen its sales and IT strategy. Nevertheless, technological progress and the international scale of the Group make it impossible to eliminate  all  potential  risks.  To  mitigate  these  risks, the following measures have been implemented.\n\n## 3.1 Implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures\n\n## 3.1.1 Data protection governance\n\nIn  general  terms,  the  Legal  Department,  through  the Group Privacy Officer, remains responsible for ensuring compliance  with  data  protection  legislation  and  in particular  European  Regulation  No.  2016/679,  the General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR).  The  Legal Department  works  on  a  cross-cutting  basis  with  all other  stakeholders  involved  in  managing  personal data.\n\nKering's  Group  Privacy  Officer  is  responsible  for (i) ensuring  the  Group's  compliance  with  its  data protection obligations, and (ii) implementing a crosscutting  approach  that  includes  all  of  the  teams potentially  involved  in  data  protection,  in  particular the  Human  Resources,  Safety  and  Security  (physical and IT), Marketing and Digital, and Legal Departments. The Group Privacy Officer has direct access to the Legal departments  of  all  the  Houses  and  the  Group's Executive Management.  He  deals  with  all  data governance issues with the help of a Privacy Network, which enables the Group to take both a global and a local  approach  through  its  Houses  in  the  countries where  it  operates.  This  harmonized  governance structure  enables  the  Group  to  factor  in  various structural changes such as growth in e-commerce and distance selling, as well as the legal context relating to data protection.\n\nIn  accordance with the GDPR, Kering and each of the Houses  have  internal  or  external  Data  Protection Officers working within the Privacy Network.\n\n- 496\n\n## 3.1.2 Personal data processing and risk management accountability\n\nFollowing  the  introduction  of  various  personal  data protection  laws  and  regulations,  the  Kering  group continuously  endeavors  to  improve  its  knowledge  of tools used  and  types  of  data  processing.  This knowledge is used to implement robust organizational measures at project and IT team levels.\n\nIn  its  IT  aspect,  and  under  the  supervision  of  the  IT architecture teams, Group applications are mapped on a  cyclical  basis.  This  approach  is  backed  up  in  its 'purpose' aspect by mapping personal data processing. As the basis for compliance and implementation of the record of processing activities for personal data, this dual mapping process and the method  used  are  intended  to  enable  Kering  and  its Houses  to  perfect  and  systematically  maintain  their knowledge of the 'means and purposes' applied in the context  of  the  personal  data  processing  performed. This organization applies to two aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 for new projects, all activities that could potentially lead  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  are monitored and checked through a Gate process;\n- \u00b7 for  processing  currently  underway,  two  law  firms have  been  commissioned  to  compile  a  House-byHouse map of all data processing performed within the Group in order to determine the cardinal rules of personal data processing.",

        "page_content": "These  processes  aim  to  strengthen  the  analysis  and consideration of risks, particularly in terms of personal data  security  and  processing.  It  follows  that  the  data protection  impact  assessment  (DPIA)  is  an  important tool  in  implementing  the  accountability  principle. A  DPIA  is  therefore  performed  before  any  project  is started  to  analyze  the  type  of  risk  related  to  the project  or  activity  involving  personal  data  and  to recommend measures to mitigate or prevent the risk.\n\nThis  process  is  also  used  to  take  personal  data protection  into  account  as  of  the  design  stage  of  an application  or  processing.  It  is  accompanied  by recommendations for minimizing the amount of data collected  in  light  of  the  related  purpose,  defining appropriate retention periods, presenting information notices or obtaining consent where required, deploying data security and confidentiality measures, and  identifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the parties involved in data processing. In this early-stage approach,  the  rights  of  data  subjects  and  the organizational  and  technical  measures  taken  by  the Group  must  be  taken  into  consideration  from  the outset.\n\nThus,  as  required  by  the  GDPR,  knowledge  of  the methods  used  by  the  IT  department  contributes  to determining the purposes of processing.\n\nThis  determination  is  performed  by  the  Privacy Network through a shared methodology to which the Houses adhere voluntarily. This approach provides the basis  for  drawing  up  the  records  of  processing activities  required  by  Article  30  of  the  GDPR.  The Group's records evolve constantly in line with changes in the Group. To that end, a licensed software solution purchased from a leading GDPR compliance solutions provider  has  now  been  integrated  and  adapted  to enable updating to be carried out in real time. Thanks to this software, the Group is able to track changes in data processing, taking into account new issues arising from  the  growing  digitalization  and  international development of its business.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  is  drawing  up  a  data protection impact policy according to the various lists of processing types for which an impact assessment is required.\n\n## 3.1.3 Implementation of internal and external processes to ensure the Group's compliance\n\nIn  light  of  the  global  deployment  of  our  Houses  and the  increasingly  widespread  use  of  digital  marketing tools,  the  Group  has  taken  steps  to  reinforce  the contractual and organizational framework concerning data protection.\n\n## Subcontractors\n\nThe  Group  may  only  use  subcontractors  that  provide sufficient  guarantees  as  to  their  implementation  of appropriate  technical  and  organizational  measures. Subcontractors  must  (i)  ensure  that  processing  and processing  methods  meet  GDPR  requirements,  and (ii)  guarantee  the  protection  of  the  data  subject's rights. These requirements apply to all the subcontractors  working  for  the  Group  or  the  Houses, and  the  purchasing,  operational  and  legal  teams  all work closely together as part of this approach.\n\n## Awareness and information reporting\n\nThe  Group  makes  a  special  effort  to  raise  awareness and organize the reporting of information through an employee  training  and  communication  plan.  An awareness  and  information  reporting  organization plan  is  being  deployed  under  the  supervision  of  the Group Privacy Officer. This process aims to strengthen the  privacy  culture  in  the  organization  and  develop reflexes  to  ensure  the  best  possible  response  to  the needs of our customers and our Houses. Communication  material  on  the  subject  of  privacy (events, monitoring, cultural works) is also being made available.\n\nIn  this  regard,  a  global  e-learning  program  for  all Group employees combining privacy and cybersecurity needs, and covering all data protection requirements, will  be  rolled  out.  Launched  as  part  of  an  e-learning management platform adding to the 'Tone at the Top' approach,  it  will  deliver  a  global  message  to  all employees.  To  strengthen  this  aspect,  the  Group Privacy  Officer  and  the  Chief  IT  Security  Officer  work together to monitor legal and technical developments and  to  relay  information  to  employees  and  other parties involved in data protection in the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  is  working  to  introduce  procedures  that  will ensure  a  unique  and  consistent  approach  to  data protection  and  incident  response.  These  procedures enable  responses  to  be  structured  based  on  the confidentiality  level  of  the  data  involved  and  the number of people potentially impacted.\n\n## Procedures for managing data subject requests to exercise their rights\n\nSimilarly, the  Group  has  internal  processes  and dedicated teams to deal with complaints and requests from  data  subjects  wishing  to  exercise  their  rights (right  of  access,  rectification  and  opposition,  right  to data  portability,  withdrawal  of  consent,  etc.).  These\n\n## 3.2 Typology of data subjects\n\nThe  measures  described  above  enable  the  Group  to take a dynamic approach to personal data processing issues. Through this approach, the Group can identify the different populations with which it interacts on a day-to-day  basis,  such  as  its  customers,  employees and third parties.\n\n## 3.2.1 Customer data protection governance\n\nAs a Luxury group, Kering collects customer data that could  potentially  have  a  higher  market  value  than similar  data  in  other  industries.  Consequently,  the Group is working in a number of ways on the purposes and  methods  of  processing  the  personal  data  of  its Houses' customers. This work takes into consideration the  legitimate  expectations  expressed  as  regards  fair processing  of  personal  data,  but  also  the  growing demand  from  customers  for  the  personalization  of their exchanges with our Houses.\n\nThe  Group  makes  direct  requests  for  data  to  its customers during the various cycles of their interaction with  the  Houses.  The  Group's  omni-channel  approach\n\n- 498\n\nprocesses  set  out  the  parties  involved  and  the methods of exercising those rights, as well as updating the  procedures  to  follow  in  the  event  of  new legislative  or  regulatory  requirements. They are made available  for  implementation  by  the  Houses  and  are being  harmonized  in  order  to  comply  with  the applicable laws and regulations in all countries where the  Houses  operate.  For  example,  an  online  form  is available  within  Houses  wishing  to  coordinate  their efforts  in  managing  requests.  The  proliferation  of applicable laws and the expectations of data subjects require  the  implementation  of  response  procedures and standards.\n\nAccordingly, in addition to dedicated email addresses, global  forms  translated  into  multiple  languages  are available  to  help  data  subjects  exercise  their  rights. The procedures will be updated regularly to anticipate and  facilitate  the  exercise  and  management  of  data subject requests.\n\nallows store and internet customers to (i) enter the data they  wish  to  communicate  to  the  Group  themselves, (ii)  indicate  whether  or  not  they  wish  to  benefit  from special  offers  and  (iii)  receive  the  brand's  newsletter. The Group and its Houses are very sensitive to the fact that  information  and,  as  applicable,  consent  collected from customers must be concise, transparent, understandable,  and  expressed  in  clear  and  simple terms.  Continuous  improvement  work  has  led  to  the implementation of new interfaces and the gradual shift to  a  new  and  more  accessible  privacy  policy  that  will enable the Group to respond diligently to the obligation of transparency incumbent on each House.\n\nThe new approach, based on the concept of 'tailored privacy'  is  currently  being  ushered  in.  It  provides  an overall definition of data processing activities, but also serves  to  strengthen  the  specific  characteristics  of each  of  the  Group's  Houses.  The  approach  is  geared towards gaining a more detailed understanding of the rules  applicable  to  each  of  the  business  activities  of the Group's various Houses, while allowing for a single message and collection of information that meets the expectations of their customers.",

The working relationship between employees and their employer is based on a balance between the legitimate interests of the employer and the  reasonable  expectations  of  employees  about  the protection of their  privacy.

This  program  specifies  a  maximum purchase  price  of  \u20ac580  per  share  and  states  that  the number of shares purchased may not exceed 10% of the share capital.\n\nThe  authorization  given  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to trade  in  Company  shares  for  a  period  of  18  months was  renewed  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of June  16,  2020  under  the  16 th resolution  (maximum purchase price of \u20ac600 per share).\n\nThe  objectives  that  could  be  pursued  are  defined  in the corresponding resolution and include, in particular, the cancellation by the Company of its own shares,  the  allotment  of  shares  to  the  Company's employees  or  corporate  officers  within  the  scope  of free  share  or  stock  purchase  option  plans,  ensuring liquidity  and  maintaining  the  Company's  share  price under  a  liquidity  agreement  or  retaining  the  shares\n\nand, where applicable, selling, transferring or exchanging them in external growth transactions.\n\n## Liquidity agreement\n\nSince May 26, 2004, Kering has maintained agreements with a financial broker in order to improve the  liquidity  of  the  Group's  shares  and  ensure  share price  stability.

Its  actions  are  targeted  and customized  to  offer  different  audiences  -  private individual shareholders and the financial community messages  suited  to  their  respective  expectations while complying with the principle of equal access to information.\n\n## Towards individual shareholders\n\nPrivate individual shareholders have access to various media and tools to keep themselves informed on the Group and events affecting its shares. These include the twice-yearly Letter to Shareholders, the Shareholders' Guide (in French only),  the  shareholders'  hotline  (+33  1  45  64  65  64) and email address (actionnaire@kering.com), financial notices  in  the  press  and  online,  the  Group's  website, and the annual report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A number of initiatives are designed to keep the financial community informed about its businesses, strategy and outlook.  Kering  has  expanded  its  communication  by organizing conference  calls  upon  the  release  of quarterly revenue, half-year and annual results, as well as  participating  in  industry  conferences  held  by  major banks.  All  of  the  presentation  material  is  available  on the  Group's  website.  Kering  also  meets  with  investors during  roadshows  held  in  the  major  financial  centers around  the  world  (in  2020,  Kering  replaced  in-person roadshows with investors by virtual events).\n\nIn addition, at the initiative of its Board of Directors, the Company  continued to strengthen dialogue with investors,  particularly  on  environmental,  social  and governance (ESG) issues. With this in mind, in November 2020 the Lead Independent Director, with the participation of the Board secretary, the Chief Sustainability  Officer,  the  Financial  Communications Department  as  well  as  the  Chief  Financial  Officer, organized a roadshow  dedicated to ESG matters, virtually meeting  with  a  number  of  investors  (representing around 32% of the free float).\n\nThe presentation used at the roadshow is available on the Company's website.\n\nThe  Group  meets  with  individual  investors  and analysts upon  request  and  maintains  proactive relationships in terms of reporting to the AMF.\n\n## Procedures for communicating regulatory information\n\nPursuant to obligations -applicable since January 20, 2007 - to disclose regulatory information resulting from the implementation of the Transparency Directive in the AMF's General Regulations, Kering's Financial Communications Department oversees the proper and full disclosure of regulatory  information.  This  information  is  filed  with the AMF at the time of its disclosure and stored on the Kering website.\n\nFull and  effective  communication  is  carried  out electronically  in  compliance  with  the  criteria  defined by  the  AMF's  General  Regulations,  which  require communication  to  a  wide  audience  within  the European  Union  and  under  conditions  guaranteeing the  security  of  the  communication  and  information. Accordingly, Kering's Financial Communications Department  has  chosen  to  work  with  a  professional communications agency satisfying the communication criteria set by EU Regulation No. 596/2014 on market abuse  and  the  AMF's  General  Regulations.  The communications  agency  is  included  on  the  list published  by  the  AMF,  thus  benefiting  from  a presumption of full and effective communication.\n\n## 2021 shareholders' agenda\n\n| April 20, 2021 (after market close)   | First-quarter 2021 revenue   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| April 22, 2021                        | Annual General Meeting       |\n| July 2021 (1)                         | First-half 2021 results      |\n| October 2021 (1)                      | Third-quarter 2021 revenue   |\n\n- (1) The specific date will be posted on Kering.com.",

The  term  was  extended  to May  26,  2066  at  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting held  on  May  26,  1967,  except  in  the  case  of  an  early dissolution  or  of  an  extension  approved  at  the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\n## Corporate purpose\n\nThe Company's corporate purpose is:\n\n- \u00b7 the purchase, retail sale or wholesale, either directly or indirectly, by all means and using all existing or future techniques, of all goods, products, commodities or services;\n- \u00b7 the creation, acquisition, leasing, operating or sale, either  directly  or  indirectly,  of  all  establishments, stores  or  warehouses,  by  all  means  and  using  all existing  or  future  techniques,  for  the  retail  sale  or wholesale  of  all  goods,  products,  commodities  or services;\n- \u00b7 the  direct  or  indirect  manufacture  of  all  goods, products  or  commodities  that  are  useful  for corporate operations;\n- \u00b7 the direct or indirect supply of all services;\n- \u00b7 the  purchase,  operation  and  sale  of  all  buildings that are useful for corporate operations;\n- \u00b7 the creation of all commercial, non-trading, industrial and  financial  concerns,  whether  in  moveable  or  real property,  service  or  other  businesses,  the  acquisition of  participating  interests  by  all  means,  subscription, acquisition, contribution, merger or otherwise in, to or  of  such  concerns  and  businesses  and  the management of its participating interests;\n\n- \u00b7 and, in general, all commercial, non-trading, industrial and financial operations, whether in moveable or real property,  service  or  other  businesses  that  can  be directly  or  indirectly  connected  to  the  purposes specified  above  or  to  all  similar,  complementary  or related  purposes  or  purposes  that  are  liable  to  favor the creation or development thereof.\n\n(Article 5 of the Articles of Association)\n\n## Trade and Companies Registry\n\n552 075 020 RCS Paris APE code: 7010Z\n\n## Consultation of legal documents\n\nThe Articles of Association, minutes of Annual General Meetings  and  other  corporate  documents  may  be consulted at the registered office under the applicable legal conditions.\n\n## Fiscal year\n\nThe  Company's  fiscal  year  begins  on  January  1  and ends on December 31 of the same year.\n\n## Appropriation of earnings\n\nFrom the profit for the fiscal year, less deferred losses where applicable, a minimum withdrawal of one-twentieth  is  made  and  paid  into  a  reserve  fund known as the 'legal reserve'. Said withdrawal ceases to be mandatory once said reserve reaches one-tenth of the share capital.\n\nFrom the distributable profit, which is made up of the profit  for  the  fiscal  year  less  the  deferred  losses  and the  withdrawal  referred  to  above,  as  well  as  the amounts  to  be  paid  into  the  reserves  in  accordance with the law, plus deferred profits, the Annual General Meeting,  pursuant  to  a  proposal  by  the  Board  of Directors, may  withdraw  all  amounts  it  deems appropriate,  either  to  be  deferred  to  the  subsequent fiscal  year,  or  to  be  entered  into  one  or  more extraordinary,  general  or  special  reserve  funds,  the allocation  and  use  of  which  is  determined  by  the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe balance, if any, is allocated among the shareholders.",

The  Annual  General  Meeting  may also  decide,  for  all  or  part  of  the  dividend,  interim dividends, reserves, or premiums distributed, or for any capital  reduction,  that  the  distribution  of  dividends, reserves  or  premiums  or  the  capital  reduction  will  be made in kind in the form of corporate assets, including securities.\n\n## (Article 21 of the Articles of Association)\n\nDividends not claimed after five years are paid to the French State.\n\nDividends  paid  over  the  last  three  fiscal  years  are presented in the Management Report.\n\n## Administrative and management bodies\n\nInformation regarding administrative and management bodies is presented in Chapter 4, 'Report on corporate governance'.\n\n## Annual General Meetings - Double voting rights\n\nAnnual General Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors  and  deliberate  on  their  agenda  under  the conditions provided for by law and the regulations.\n\nMeetings  are  held  at  the  registered  office  or  in  any other place specified in the convening notice.\n\nAll shareholders may attend meetings, either in person or via  a  proxy,  under  the  conditions  laid  down  by  law, subject to providing proof of their identity and of the title to their securities, by the recognition of said securities in the  accounts  in  their  name  within  the  regulatory timeframes, either in the accounts of registered securities  held  by  the  Company,  or  in  the  accounts  of bearer  securities  held  by  an  accredited  intermediary. Proof  of  the  capacity  of  a  shareholder  can  be  provided electronically, under the conditions set by the regulations in force. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors, shareholders may participate in meetings via video-conference or via telecommunications means that make it  possible  to  identify  them  under  the  conditions laid  down  by  the  regulations  in  force.  All  shareholders may vote by correspondence using a form filled out and sent to the Company under the conditions laid down by the regulations in force, including electronically, pursuant to  a  decision  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  This  form  must reach  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  regulatory conditions in order to be taken into account. The Board of Directors may reduce said timeframe for the benefit of all  shareholders.  The  owners  of  securities  who  are  not\n\nresident  on  French  territory  may  be  represented  by  an intermediary  who  is  registered  in  accordance  with  the conditions laid down by the regulations in force.\n\nMeetings are chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in his/her absence, by the member of the Board who is specifically appointed for this purpose by the  Board.  Failing  this,  the  meeting  elects  its  own chair.\n\nMeeting minutes are prepared and copies thereof are certified and issued in accordance with the law.\n\nIn  all  Annual  General  Meetings,  a  voting  right  that  is double that conferred on the other shares is granted to all shares that are fully paid up and for which proof is provided that they have been held in registered form for  at  least  two  years  in  the  name  of  the  same shareholder. This double voting right, which existed in the  Articles  of  Association  of  Pinault  SA  prior  to  its merger with Printemps SA, was restated at the time of their 1992 merger.\n\nThis double voting right may be withdrawn outright at any  time  pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the  Extraordinary General  Meeting  and  after  ratification  by  a  special meeting of the beneficiary shareholders.\n\n## (Article 19 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe  double  voting  right  existed  in  Pinault  SA  and Printemps SA prior to their 1992  merger.  The Company's Articles of Association do not provide that, in the event of a free allocation of registered shares to a  shareholder  in  respect  of  old  shares  for  which he/she/it had a double voting right, the new shares are also entitled to a double voting right.\n\nPursuant  to  the  relevant  legislation,  double  voting rights are canceled for any share converted to a bearer share or in the event of a transfer of ownership except in the  case  of  a  transfer  following  inheritance, liquidation  of  joint  property  between  spouses,  or donation  between  living  family  members  (spouse  or relative) with legal inheritance rights.\n\nVoting  rights  are  not  limited  under  the  Articles  of Association.\n\n## Provisions of the Articles of Association relating to shareholder notifications\n\nThe shares shall be in registered or bearer form at the shareholder's  discretion.  The  shares  shall  be  entered into an account  under  the  conditions  and  in accordance  with  the  terms  provided  for  by  the regulations in force.\n\nThe  Company  is  authorized  to  use  the  provisions  of the law and regulations regarding the identification of the  holders  of  securities  that  grant  immediate  or deferred  access  to  voting  rights  at  its  own  Annual General Meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  same  notification  obligation  shall apply under the same conditions when a shareholder's total  shares  and/or  voting  rights  reach  or  fall  below any of the aforementioned thresholds.\n\nIf the  notification  is  not  submitted,  the  shares exceeding  the  threshold  for  which  the  notification should  have  been  made  may  be  deprived  of  voting rights  at  the  request  of  one  or  more  shareholders holding a combined or individual total of at least 5% of the  Company's  share  capital  and/or  voting  rights, under the conditions set forth in the sixth paragraph of  Article  L.  233-7  of  the  French  Commercial  Code.  If the notification is subsequently made, the corresponding voting rights may not be exercised until the  period  of  time  defined  by  law  or  the  prevailing regulations has expired.\n\n(Article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThere are no shares not representing capital.\n\nThe  steps  required  to  amend  shareholder  rights  are those provided for by law.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe  Company  is  authorized  to  use  the  provisions  of the law and regulations regarding the identification of the  holders  of  securities  that  grant  immediate  or deferred  access  to  voting  rights  at  its  own  Annual General Meetings.\n\n## (Article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\nIn addition to the voting right that is granted to each share  by  the  law  and  by  the  specific  provisions  of Article  19  below,  each  share  grants  the  right  to  a percentage, which is proportional to the number and par  value  of  the  existing  shares,  of  the  corporate assets,  the  profit  after  deduction  of  the  deductions provided for by law and the Articles of Association, or of the liquidating dividend.\n\nEach  time  it  is  necessary  to  possess  more  than  one share in order to exercise a right, it is the responsibility of  the  owners  who  do  not  possess  such  number  to make  arrangements  to  regroup  the  required  number of shares.\n\n## (Article 8 of the Articles of Association)\n\nIn  the  event  of  liquidation  of  the  Company,  the remaining shareholders' equity after repayment of the par  value  of  the  shares  will  be  allocated  among  the shareholders in the same proportions as their holdings in the capital.\n\n## (Article 23 of the Articles of Association)\n\nAny changes in the share capital or the rights attached to shares are governed by the legal requirements and the specific provisions of the Articles of Association as set out below.\n\nUnder Article  15  of  the  Articles  of  Association,  in  the Company's  internal  organization,  decisions  by  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing Director  relating  to  the  issue  of  securities,  regardless of their nature, require the prior approval by the Board of Directors when such issues are likely to change the share capital, except in the event of a decision by the Annual General Meeting.",
