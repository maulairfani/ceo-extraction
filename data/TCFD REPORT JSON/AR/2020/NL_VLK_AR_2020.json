These themes comprise environmental, social and labour issues, as well as anticorruption, bribery and human rights. For each of these themes, companies are obliged to report on the relevant policies, results, risks (including management of these risks) and non-financial key performance indicators. The regulation also requires companies to describe their business models in their annual reports. We provide all of the information required in the relevant parts of this annual report.

        "page_content": "## 2020: A YEAR IN REVIEW\n\nNaturally, one of the biggest challenges in 2020 has been responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions relating to it.\n\nEveryday life changed for our clients, our employees and all our stakeholders. The financial markets showed a sharp initial decline - followed by a swift recovery in the second half of the year - which impacted the value of our clients' investment portfolios. Dealing with the pandemic meant changing the way we serve our clients, adjustments in our way of working for our employees, and postponing dividends to our shareholders. Our focus was on maintaining regular contact with our clients, offering them advice on how to respond to the impact of the virus on the financial markets, and looking after our employees through difficult circumstances.\n\n## Growing our business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assets under management (AuM)\n\n- -In Kempen Asset Management, we saw a net inflow of \u20ac5.4 billion in AuM. This was due to net inflow of \u20ac6.0 billion in fiduciary management. Our investment strategies had a net outflow of \u20ac0.6 billion.\n- -Over the course of the reporting year, we saw net inflow of \u20ac1.4 billion in Private Banking, with contributions from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. Our unique advisory proposition in Private Banking - as well as our sustainable discretionary management proposition, expert bankers and distinctive offering to entrepreneurs - are what differentiate us from our competitors. Market performance led to asset growth of \u20ac0.3 billion.\n\n## Corporate Finance and Equity Capital Markets\n\n- -Kempen Merchant Banking enjoyed a strong flow of Corporate Finance/Equity Capital Markets deals, with 41 transactions executed in 11 countries across all our sectors - real estate, life sciences & healthcare, financial institutions & fintech, infrastructure and maritime & offshore - as well as in our local alpha coverage.\n\n## Communicating remotely\n\n- -Communication between our clients and their bankers is crucial for building and maintaining relationships. Given the restrictions due to Covid-19, we experienced firsthand the importance of Van Lanschot Private Banking's omni-channel service model for our communications with clients. As well as making extensive use of our chat and video functions (also used at Kempen Asset Management and Kempen Merchant Banking), we have successfully worked with various other aspects of the digital and data-driven world, such as sending out information about market movements via our messaging centre.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Launching new solutions and enhancing existing propositions\n\n- -The new Sustainable Global High Dividend Fund launched by Kempen Asset Management represents an\n\n## Loans\n\n- -In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we decided to grant moratoria and coronavirus-specific loans to clients. Only a limited number of clients decided to make use of them. The majority of these loans and moratoria were granted as new current account loans, with some as short-term loans or by raising existing limits.\n\n- -Our Private Banking mortgage loan portfolio increased by \u20ac147 million over 2020, due to a growing demand for mortgage loans from our clients.\n- -Overall, there has been a very limited addition of \u20ac1.9 million to loan loss provisions, thanks to our limited credit exposure. This is down to our focused wealth management proposition: providing mortgages to our Private Banking clients, as well as having low exposure to corporate lending and to industries impacted by Covid-19 in general.\n\n## 2020 for our clients\n\n.",

        "page_content": "important addition to the range of dividend products we offer. This sustainable dividend solution was created in collaboration with our clients, who are looking for direct income in a more sustainable manner.\n\n- -In previous years, we further enhanced our distribution capabilities abroad, using placing agents. In 2020, Kempen Asset Management saw this result in a number of new clients for our real estate proposition in Germany. We also expanded to Scandinavia and added alternative strategies to our offering.\n- -To improve the service for our fiduciary management clients, a new Switzerland-based team was hired to further enhance and expand our manager monitoring services and digital client communications. In addition, the team is supporting Van Lanschot Kempen's existing Swiss offices in their activities for our Private Banking clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adjusting our offering in changing markets\n\n- -As a consequence of persistently low interest rates, we introduced a negative interest rate of -0.5% on higher amounts of savings. At the same time, we understand the need for our clients to hold cash. Starting in January 2021, we therefore introduced the so-called wealth management arrangement through which we offer our clients the possibility to keep a certain percentage of their assets invested with us in cash, without paying the negative interest rate.\n- -We focus on products that are relevant for our clients and create added value. To enhance the solutions we can provide, we further honed our product offering. This meant discontinuing our active government bond funds, products under the Evi brand in Belgium, and Evi savings-only in the Netherlands. We will continue with Evi investment accounts (and their linked savings accounts) in the Netherlands.\n- -Our structured products activities resulted in significant losses. This was mainly due to exceptional volatility and illiquidity in certain segments of the financial markets, as well as hedging activities during the rest of the year to limit the risks to the portfolio. We will continue to offer structured products to our Private Banking clients as an alternative investment solution to help diversify their investment portfolios, while hedging risks to a significant extent for the existing portfolio. Newly issued notes will be hedged one-on-one.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Holding online events\n\n- -In June, we held our first major webinar for Van Lanschot Private Banking clients. Our CFO and Head of Economics informed clients about expected recovery scenarios for the financial markets. The event was attended in real time by around 800 participants, with hundreds more watching the recording afterwards.\n- -During 2020, we held dozens of online meetings with over 6,000 participants in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Switzerland.\n- -Kempen Merchant Banking organised the first all-digital European property seminar in June, during which faceto-face meetings were exchanged for more than 1,400 conference calls over two days. These calls allowed 165 investors to interact with management teams of 45 listed European real estate companies.\n- -In November, the first online stakeholder dialogue took place, during which the importance of climate change was discussed with our stakeholders.\n- -Van Lanschot Private Banking offered its clients an online climate event in October, during which they were informed about the current state of our climate and the various ways they can positively contribute.\n\n## Joining forces\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen acquired Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, a Dutch wealth manager with \u20ac2.0 billion in client assets. Hof Hoorneman Bankiers provides private banking, online wealth management and settlementonly services. The acquisition strengthens our position in the Dutch market while offering potential for crossselling opportunities and economies of scale. All approvals from regulators were obtained in December 2020, and closing happened in January 2021. Migration is expected to take place over the course of 2021. We consolidated Hof Hoorneman Bankiers' figures in our balance sheet and in our client asset figures as per 31 December 2020.\n- -In January, we announced a collaboration between a.s.r. bank and Evi. This collaboration gave clients with an investment account at a.s.r. bank the opportunity to switch to Evi at no cost. Around 7,000 clients and \u20ac157 million were transferred to Evi.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "## 2020 for our shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -We took the advice of the European Central Bank (ECB) and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) not to pay out the 2019 dividend to our shareholders in 2020. However, the annual general meeting of shareholders approved the 2019 dividend; this amount of \u20ac59.4 million has been reserved for our shareholders on our balance sheet and is not included in our capital ratios.\n- -The 2020 net result amounted to \u20ac49.8 million, of which the second half-year contribution was \u20ac40.4 million. We propose a 2020 dividend of \u20ac0.70 per share, which will be paid out in two parts following the recommendation from the ECB and DNB.\n- -To explain the impact of the pandemic on Van Lanschot Kempen, we published a more comprehensive quarterly update with additional financial information in Q1 2020. We also asked our external auditors to provide a review opinion with respect to the half-year figures, a statement we received on 25 August 2020.\n\n## 2020 for our organisation\n\n## Acting as one and increasing efficiency\n\n- -Clients and employees in our Belgian Private Banking business were successfully migrated to the group IT infrastructure. With our Belgian offices now also running on systems with broader functionalities, these clients gained access to our omni-channel service model, enhancing their experience. The Belgian IT infrastructure has been successfully phased out.\n- -To enhance efficiency and accelerate cooperation within Van Lanschot Kempen, the legal entity Kempen & Co merged into Van Lanschot NV. This entity was renamed to Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV. For more information, see page 90.\n- -Throughout the reporting year, we spent time defining the next steps in our strategy. At the beginning of 2021, we adjusted our organisational structure by shifting from a business line-driven organisation to a functionbased structure. This aims to increase synergies and improve collaboration.\n- -In the second half of 2020, part of the team managing the credit strategy decided to leave Van Lanschot Kempen. Their responsibilities were appropriated by other teams in our business. As a result, we were able to maintain our service to clients.\n\n## Enhancing and monitoring our sustainability\n\n- -At Van Lanschot Private Banking, assets under management invested in sustainable and impact investment wealth management solutions increased to \u20ac3.1 billion (2019: \u20ac2.0 billion). By 2023, we'll actively offer our Private Banking clients sustainable investment solutions as the default option.\n- -In 2020, we started quantifying our non-financial impact. For our investment strategies, we use data from an external data provider to determine our positive and negative contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals. For more details, see the \"Natural capital\" and \"Social capital\" sections on pages 33 and 38 respectively.\n- -Through our new, strengthened climate change policy in 2020, Kempen Asset Management committed to become a net-zero investor by 2050. To reach this, we set short-term targets for 2025 and mid-term targets for 2030, all in line with the Paris Agreement, the Dutch Klimaatakkoord and Europe's ambition to become a netzero economy by 2050. As Kempen Asset Management is the asset manager for Private Banking's discretionary management propositions, this also applies to these portfolios.\n- -To encourage sustainability, we engage investee companies one-on-one and through multi-investor collaboration. One key area is to help the oil and gas industry transition to a low-carbon economy. The Climate Action 100+ investor initiative has seen us engage in ongoing dialogue with Shell, Equinor and BP. The first half of 2020 saw these major energy players step up their climate ambitions. We welcome these developments and will continue to engage with them to encourage a further shift towards more sustainable operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dealing with Covid-19 from an organisational perspective\n\n- -In February 2020, anticipating the impact of the virus, we started preparations for working from home and introducing the concept of working in clusters.\n\n.",

Our Executive Board frequently appears in videos on our intranet, from professionally recorded videos to informal vlogs, to speak directly to employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Being recognised through awards and rankings\n\n- -Kempen Asset Management won the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Global Stewardship Disclosure Award in the Asset Managers <US $60 billion AuM category. This award is in recognition of innovation and excellence in Kempen's stewardship initiatives, such as engagement policies and disclosures in its Annual Stewardship and Responsible Investment Report.\n- -Kempen Asset Management won three awards at the annual Morningstar Awards ceremony: Best Fund House Overall, Best Fund House: Fixed Income, and in the Dutch Equities category for the Kempen Orange Fund. Kempen Asset Management also won nine Lipper Awards, including Best Fund House Overall (small).\n- -In 2020, Kempen Merchant Banking provided the best equities advice according to annual analyst research by Willem and Dirk Gerritsen (Utrecht University). Their findings put us at the top of the league based on our advice, commanding 56% returns on a portfolio with a long position in equities rated Buy, and a short position in those rated Hold or Sell .\n- -Evi was recognised as 'Best Choice' according to IEX Gouden Stier.\n\n.",

Our history is deeply intertwined with the history of the Low Countries and the people who represent them. Founded originally in Antwerp in the 17th century, Van Lanschot Kempen has brought several entities together over time; the common thread that links us all is trade.\n\nOur purpose is the preservation and creation of wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve.\n\nAs a company, we believe that the generation of wealth and its redistribution through taxation - are critical to the process of creating and maintaining stable, successful societies. Given that social cohesion necessitates such wealth creation, we believe that wealth management cannot be the preserve of a few but is a necessity for all. We create wealth, economic growth, jobs and tax income via our services to entrepreneurs, as well as contributing to the realisation of societal goals via the preservation and creation of wealth for asset owners, including private individuals and pension funds.\n\nWe believe that wealth is not just about financial assets; essential as these may be, wealth is about all the things that we value in life. In a broader sense, wealth represents the collective wisdom of a society and the cultural norms and values that sustain it. Although our primary objective is to help our clients with the financial aspects of wealth, we endeavour to serve their broader objectives as well.\n\nWe serve clients across the social spectrum and in several segments - private, wholesale & institutional and corporate - as a trusted partner and to assist them in preserving and creating wealth sustainably. Investing for the long term is no longer just about looking for the greatest returns by a future date; it's about ensuring the liveability of the planet for the generations to come. We believe that in serving the long-term interests of our clients, we can contribute to a sustainable world and societal stability.\n\n## Our values\n\nValues are essential to any successful enterprise. We are no exception. These values drive our decision-making process and our Code of Conduct. In turn, they define who we are and what we stand for. As a company, we believe in the following core values:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Entrepreneurial spirit\n\n- -We look for opportunities, even when there appear to be none\n- -We accept failure as part of the process and are not defeated by it\n- -We believe in and pursue our goals\n- -We are able to connect the dots and make things work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Specialisation\n\n- -We accept that one cannot be good at everything\n- -We believe in expertise\n- -Specialisation helps us to make choices and to focus\n- -We appreciate each other's specialist knowledge and employ this optimally\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Craftsmanship\n\n- -We believe in the pursuit of excellence\n- -We strive to be true professionals - knowing our craft inside out\n- -We have the tenacity and relentlessness to get things right\n- -We do not accept second best as the outcome in our search for excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dedication\n\n- -We believe in the conscious act of committing one's emotional, intellectual and physical capabilities to one's objectives\n- -We believe genuine dedication enables us to create value for the long term\n- -We are intrinsically motivated to work hard in providing our services in order to exceed clients' expectations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discretion\n\n- -We understand that notions of privacy are changing in this era of social media and digital transformation\n- -We do our utmost to protect and secure our clients' sensitive information in order to truly be their trusted partner\n- -We believe in the importance of privacy at an individual, institutional and societal level\n\nThese values define what we do, and help us to serve our clients best.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "## THE CHANGING WORLD AROUND US\n\nOur business is impacted by the world around us, and our strategy needs to reflect and respond to that. The economy, society and environment in which we operate as a wealth manager, the regulatory landscape, the demands of our clients and prospects, the technological advances of our competitors, and the state of the labour market as a whole - all of these external developments have an impact on our business. So we take these into account when executing our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economy, society and the environment\n\nThe reporting year 2020 started on a strong note economically: financial markets were still bullish, global economic growth was relatively strong, and unemployment was low. But in March, the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic turned the global economy on its head. Due to widespread lockdowns in the second quarter, we experienced the deepest recession since the Second World War. But as soon as restrictions were lifted, the recovery (at least in some sectors) was just as swift. Economists saw a 'K-shaped chart', meaning that certain sectors - such as online retail, healthcare and tech - had a sharp upturn, while other sectors - such as air travel and high-street retail - had an equally sharp downturn. And this was reflected in the stock markets, too.\n\nIn order to stimulate economic recovery, central banks maintained low interest rates and created bigger balance sheets, while governments stepped in and invested huge amounts of money. In Europe, companies were able to borrow large sums in order to keep employment at economically and socially acceptable levels. In the US, the strategy was different, with companies quickly laying off staff while the US government doubled unemployment benefits for the people impacted. With so much government and central bank stimulus, it's likely that the real effects of the recession won't be felt until 2021 and beyond.\n\nThis means that despite the huge dip in March and April, the investment market did not in fact depreciate between the start and end of 2020. The European Central Bank's temporary ban on dividend payments for banks, however, has had a material impact on their share prices - and by extension on shareholders. At the time of writing, the ban is expected to be lifted after September 2021. Because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, uncertainty surrounding economic projections has also increased - and it remains to be seen what the longer-term impact will be.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom a social perspective, the Covid-19 crisis led to huge upheaval in the way people live, work and maintain social contact. From a corporate point of view, it brought companies' social conditions for employees and suppliers into sharp relief. The virus laid bare whether companies really were taking care of the people in their supply chain, paying attention to health and safety, and upholding labour standards. It also highlighted the need for holistic thinking around the role businesses play for their employees, clients and suppliers, as well as across complex supply chains.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, the lockdown measures brought in to curb the pandemic led to reductions in carbon emissions. While things may still return to 'normal', the situation proved to many people that measures such as reducing travel and limiting factory production could have a meaningful positive impact on the climate. And governments' targets reflect this: there's been a further shift towards ambitious net-zero emissions targets by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory landscape\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on regulators' priorities was also felt. In 2020, the focus shifted to help banks ensure the continuity of their operations, including support to their clients. This entailed postponing the implementation of certain regulations, such as Basel IV, and reviewing recently implemented regulations to reduce the administrative burden. At the same time, we've seen further harmonisation of supervisory regulations in Europe, as well as more detailed descriptions of how to define and implement certain rules.\n\nDuring the reporting year, financial institutions continued to prepare for the large number of regulations that are scheduled to come into force going forward - albeit some later than originally planned. Financial institutions are still",

        "page_content": "working on the Basel IV package of reforms, which involves collecting a lot more data but whose impact on lending procedures and capital is relatively limited. The need to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR at the end of 2021 has meant assessing exposure to LIBOR-linked products and making robust plans. The fifth anti-money laundering (AML) directive introduces an ultimate beneficial owner register which is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. The sixth AML directive contains minimum rules on criminal liability for money laundering. Client due diligence and transaction monitoring remain important priorities for the industry as a whole.\n\nFrom a sustainability perspective, we've seen a clear external push from the regulators, especially in Europe. The EU has the ambition to make Europe a climate-neutral economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and has come up with plans that touch every sector including financial services. For example, the action plan on sustainable financial growth contains a set of new regulations. The EU has created a harmonised framework, which will come into force step by step and develop over time. The new framework introduces a classification system for sustainable activities and investments as well as new disclosure requirements for financial institutions to bring more clarity to end-investors and prevent 'greenwashing'. There is also a focus on mainstreaming management of sustainability risks and fostering transparency for listed companies and shareholder long-termism. The challenge for Van Lanschot Kempen (and for all financial institutions) is to efficiently implement these rules and to source meaningful environmental, social and governance (ESG) data.\n\nWith the EU and the UK finally reaching a deal in the dying days of 2020, a no-deal Brexit was averted. For the financial industry, however, the proposed EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not contain much detail so far. In this context, we are no longer expecting permanent equivalence decisions with respect to UK central clearing parties, or third-country exemption regimes being applied to UK-based counterparties, for example. Clarity on these matters will be most welcome. In the first few days of 2021, we saw some memoranda of understanding between supervisory authorities, which will form a basis for future cooperation between the UK and the EU with respect to supervision of financial markets and their participants. Uncertainty still remains as to whether, over time, future regulation in the UK may gradually diverge from EU regulatory standards and may as a result become an unsurpassable hurdle for the application of third-country recognition or equivalence regimes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evolving client needs\n\nOur client groups - and those we wish to attract - are broad-ranging. They include private clients, such as wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs, professionals and first-time investors; wholesale & institutional clients, such as pension funds and insurance companies; corporate clients in our focus sectors (real estate, life sciences & healthcare, financial institutions & fintech, infrastructure, maritime & offshore, and local alpha); and other types of clients, such as charities, foundations and associations. Each client group has different, evolving and increasing demands, but we also observe a few common wishes among all our client groups,\n\nsuch as omni-channel service, holistic advice, sustainable investments and advice on how to prepare for the future.\n\nIn terms of the way they do business with us, clients are looking for several differentiating factors. They want to be able to reach us wherever and whenever they like, via whichever channel they choose - and they expect personalised, tailor-made service. This means that while some clients might want to do everything online, others may prefer to discuss things over the phone - or a combination of both. They're looking for personal knowledge of their specific circumstances from their contact coupled with easy, omni-channel service. Of course, we've seen the demand for digital tools increasing for several years - but the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated this demand among all client groups.\n\nMost of our clients are also looking for holistic advice rather than individual products. They expect thorough knowledge of all the solutions on offer across all our business lines, so that we can proactively advise them on the best options. But of course the search for yield and returns is ongoing and requires product innovation as well. Clients are requesting access to asset classes that were previously the domain of only the most sophisticated of investors, such as private equity, land, infrastructure and private debt.\n\nSustainable investments are becoming the new normal among many of our client groups, both private and institutional. We're rapidly moving towards a world in which complying with the highest ESG standards is part of our licence to operate rather than a differentiating factor.\n\nAnd finally, our clients - like everyone in today's world - are seeking certainty. When the first wave of the pandemic hit, they wanted to discuss the possible scenarios and how to meet their investment goals. As the crisis continued, they wanted to know how to prepare for the future and adapt to the new reality. Adaptability to change is key if we are to remain a trusted adviser to our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Competitive market and technology\n\nClients' expectations are partially driven by what they have come to expect from other companies, both within and outside the financial services sector. These include the big tech firms, which provide excellent customer experience; universal banks, which meet high standards in terms of day-to-day banking functionality; and fintechs, which use algorithms in their processes as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable value-added services. These expectations lead to increasing demand for digitalisation of services.\n\nIn the technology domain, we've seen continued developments in 2020 - a couple of which are of particular relevance to our strategy. On the one hand, the rise in cloud-based services has precipitated a move from traditional 'on premises' applications to the cloud, or software as a service (SaaS). On the other, low-code applications and robotic process automation (RPA) systems are increasingly automating manual tasks, without deep coding knowledge being required.",

All companies in our sector rely on the knowledge, experience and professionalism of their employees - and there's significant crossover with other sectors in terms of the skills required. So attracting, retaining and developing the best people is crucial. At the same time, the labour market has increasingly high expectations when it comes to personal and professional development. Employees and potential candidates are demanding not just technical training but also creative work and ways to improve their well-being. We need to keep up with these demands to stay competitive as an employer.\n\nMeanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic forced organisations such as ours to operate completely differently: working from home became the new norm. People were forced to engage differently with their managers, employees and colleagues. And everyone needed to adapt to online technologies - fast. While a toll on people's emotional well-being was inevitable, there were some positive side effects: travel time was all but eliminated, which increased time-efficiency; the digital savviness of the workforce paid off; and (perhaps ironically) absence due to illness went down. On the flip side, the lack of personal interaction between colleagues began to have an impact on people's sense of belonging.\n\nThe digitalisation and remote working trends accelerated by the pandemic also play into the competition for talent. Physical location and travel are becoming less and less important, making it easier for talented professionals to switch roles and take advantage of opportunities that are not necessarily close to home.\n\nFinally, our stakeholders - including shareholders, clients and employees - continue to see diversity as an ongoing priority. This has been reflected in the upcoming regulations, which also place more emphasis on employing a diverse workforce in all sectors, including ours. We of course aim to comply with these regulations.\n\nFor more details on what Van Lanschot Kempen is doing to address these external developments, see 'Our strategy' on page 20 and 'Our value creation' on page 24.\n\n## KEY RISK THEMES FOR VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN\n\nIn addition to the trends and developments that impact our operating environment, as a wealth manager we face specific risks associated with our sector. In 2020, we identified the following key risk themes:\n\n- -Low interest rate environment\n- -Covid-19\n- -Change capacity\n- -Financial crime\n- -Cybercrime and IT security\n- -Climate change\n\nSee the 'Risk and capital management' section (page 56) for more details.",

An essential part of this approach is an active, continuous dialogue with our stakeholders.\n\nWe identify five main stakeholder groups: clients, shareholders, employees, government/regulators and other stakeholders, including all those who might be affected by the decisions and activities of Van Lanschot Kempen (e.g. society at large, suppliers and competitors). The interests and expectations of the different stakeholder groups vary, and may lead to potential conflicts of interest.

Our most recent survey was conducted in 2019. For 25 topics relevant to our business, stakeholders were asked to assess the extent to which each topic influences the decisions they make regarding Van Lanschot Kempen. These topics are divided into two main categories: financial and nonfinancial value creation. Non-financial value creation can be further sub-divided into human and intellectual, natural and social value creation.\n\nIn addition, our Executive Board and a panel of external sustainability experts determined the significance of the impact Van Lanschot Kempen has via each of the 25 topics. Impact refers to positive impact and prevention of negative impact, and may be economic, environmental or social in nature.\n\nThe table below and matrix overleaf show the eight most material topics (out of the 25 in total), based on those topics rated as 'significantly important' by our stakeholders, and on which Van Lanschot Kempen has 'significant impact'.

We believe that our knowledge and experience, our personal, client-focused approach and our unique combination of activities set us apart from our competitors in our selected market segments, while offering growth opportunities.\n\n## Our ambition\n\n- -A leading wealth manager in the Benelux region;\n\nSupported by our strong client relationships, we aim to be a leading player in our relevant markets and geographies. This means being:\n\n- -The number one online wealth management option for the mass affluent in selected markets;\n- -The leading fiduciary manager in the Netherlands, and a challenger in the UK fiduciary market;\n- -A prominent, active investment manager that delivers alpha in illiquid markets, as well as in income-generating and ESG strategies across Europe;\n- -The preferred trusted adviser in selected niches in merchant banking across Europe.\n\n## Changes to our organisational structure\n\nKey to our strategy is the development of a fully integrated wealth management model that enables us to serve the entire spectrum of client groups, ranging from private to wholesale & institutional and corporate clients, and the ability to adapt quickly to changing client needs and market circumstances.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we therefore changed our organisational structure by moving from a business linedriven organisation towards a function-based model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn doing so, we combined all our client-focused staff and activities in the Client Management & Origination domain, while the Investment Strategies & Solutions domain now covers all our in-house and externally selected investment solutions and services. We have put Digital, Advanced Analytics & Technology at the centre of our organisation, as these play an important and proactive role in the transformation of our company. All our operational departments have now been centralised in order to\n\nharmonise processes and systems in the service of enhancing client experience and efficiency. In line with our new organisational structure, starting in 2021 we will steer and report on our business according to client groups and no longer according to the business lines.\n\n## Our strategic pillars\n\nEconomic, social and environmental shifts, regulatory changes, evolving client needs, technological advances and the labour market all impact our operating environment. We need to respond to these changes in order to deliver on our strategic pillars.\n\nThe four strategic pillars, introduced at the beginning of 2019, have been complemented with a fifth pillar to underline our commitment to sustainability. All strategic pillars are interlinked and mutually reinforce each other.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accelerate growth organically and inorganically\n\nTo remain relevant for our clients and accelerate our organic growth, we believe that we have to truly understand our clients, anticipate their needs and help them to fulfil these needs in a sustainable manner. Instead of searching for a single product or a specific brand, which entails a productled approach, clients are looking for solutions that fulfil multiple needs.\n\nIn recent years, we've successfully expanded our activities through selective bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships and hiring teams. Our high post-acquisition client retention rates show that clients value our proposition. We aim to engage in further bolt-on acquisitions and larger acquisitions in order to accelerate our growth, increase our scale and benefit from revenue, cost and/or funding synergies. We focus on acquisition opportunities that support our positioning as a specialist player while keeping a balanced asset mix, and consider acquisitions in existing and contiguous markets.",

Technology and digitalisation allow us to improve our productivity and service, by speeding up processes, reducing operational errors and improving the availability, quality and interpretation of data. We expect to significantly invest in our capabilities in this area in the coming years.\n\nDigital interaction is crucial as it offers both clients and employees increased flexibility in terms of means of communication and the time needed to communicate. To grasp the full potential of patterns in internal and external data, tooling is being developed that helps end-users to interpret data and use it for data-driven decision-making in commercial, investment and operational processes.\n\n## Act as one to leverage our full potential\n\nIn order to unlock the full potential of our solutions-led organisation for our clients, we must be able to offer solutions that build on the knowledge and expertise of the entire group as well as our open architecture platform. We believe that by providing clients access to the full range of services and products across our business lines, we can meet client needs in a sustainable manner. We have adjusted our organisational structure to fully benefit from knowledge sharing, to make optimum use of resources across the organisation, and to reduce overlap.\n\n## Attract, develop and retain the workforce\n\nOur people's knowledge, experience and professionalism are key to the way we operate. Investing in our people enables them to embrace new technology and adopt a more datadriven way of working and decision-making. We facilitate and encourage development and training of our existing workforce. Together, we need to optimise the use of advanced analytics, to embrace new technology and to work in a more agile manner. We will also hire new people with the requisite skills and capabilities to help drive our development and the changes needed to stay ahead.\n\n## Achieve our sustainability ambitions\n\nBeing a sustainable wealth manager with a long-term focus means that we proactively strive to prevent negative consequences for all stakeholders in line with the UN Global Compact, while aiming to create positive long-term financial and non-financial value. We can achieve the most significant social and environmental impact via our client investments. Our ambition is therefore to move towards more sustainable investing, together with our clients. In the future, we intend to raise the bar even higher and make sustainable investing the new normal. To achieve this, we will increase employee awareness and expand our expertise in the area of sustainable investing.",

These are based on industry trends and developments, stakeholder expectations, client needs and strategic relevance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe KPIs are focused on value creation, both financial and non-financial. We explain both our KPIs and our results against them in the sections on our value creation per type of capital on pages 26-41.\n\nThe table below shows our targets and performance on these KPIs in 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Value creation themes   | Key performance indicators (KPIs)                                                                                                                                                                                   | Targets                                |     | Performance  in 2020    | Performance  in 2019   | Material  topics  covered   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Financial               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                        |     |                         |                        |                             |\n|                         | 1.

        "page_content": "## OUR VALUE CREATION\n\nWealth enables our clients to achieve their business, personal and social goals. Wealth generation is essential to create and maintain stability in our society. This requires a longterm focus in which economic, social, environmental and governance factors all need to be taken into account.\n\nWe are convinced that our purpose - to preserve and create wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve - can only be fulfilled in a sustainable world. We also believe that, via the generation of wealth and its redistribution through taxation, we can contribute to creating and maintaining a stable and successful society.\n\n## Our approach to fulfil our purpose\n\n- -Embed our core values - entrepreneurial spirit, specialisation, craftsmanship, dedication and discretion in everything we do.\n\nIn line with our purpose, we aim to create value. We therefore proactively strive to:\n\n- -Operate as a trusted adviser for our clients and cooperate with other stakeholders.\n- -Increase positive long-term financial and non-financial value by developing new solutions in close cooperation with our stakeholders.\n- -Prevent and mitigate negative impacts for all stakeholders, wherever we can - for example, via our responsible and sustainable investment policies, responsible lending policy and carbon reduction policy.\n- -Contribute to a stable society. We create wealth, economic growth, jobs and tax income via our services to entrepreneurs, while contributing to the realisation of societal goals via the preservation and creation of wealth for asset owners, including private individuals and pension funds.\n\n## Our value creation per type of capital\n\n- -Financial capital: Our clients entrust us with their investments, savings and deposits, while our capital providers invest in our shares and bonds.\n\nOur value creation model on the following page provides an overview of our impact and the value we create in the long term. As a wealth manager, Van Lanschot Kempen attracts four types of capital:\n\n- -Human and intellectual capita l : Our employees and external parties bring in their knowledge and experience.\n- -Manufactured capital : Our physical inputs, such as offices, energy, IT and transport.\n- -Social capital: The network we have as an organisation and the trust that other stakeholders place in us - our licence to operate.\n\nAs a company, we aim to deploy these types of capital in combination for overall value creation - meaning that we strive to add value via our business model, thereby increasing the total capital or value. Outputs can be both positive and negative.\n\n- -Financial capital: We invest client assets in companies and other organisations, assist entrepreneurs when\n\n- raising funds, provide investment returns to our own clients and investors, pay salaries to our employees and pay taxes to society. However, there's also the potential for negative outcomes - for example, if poor market performance hits the assets we manage for our clients.\n- -Natural capital: We contribute to natural capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to natural or environmental goals such as clean energy, climate change mitigation measures or sustainable agriculture. As a result of our investment of client assets and lending activities, however, there may be negative impacts on the environment under certain circumstances, such as waste production, pollution and carbon emissions.\n- -Human and intellectual capital: We contribute to human capital via the hiring, training and development of our employees, but on the flip side there may be workrelated illness and possible redundancies.\n- -Social capital: We preserve and create growth and job opportunities for society by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. We increase social capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to social goals like health, education or basic needs like food and clean water. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, in some cases there may be negative social impacts, such as on labour rights, human rights or other social issues in our supply chains.\n\n## Our contribution to the SDGs\n\n- -SDG 3 : Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\nA long-term focus on a sustainable society is what the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are all about. As a wealth manager with a focus on the long term, we support all these goals. Of the 17 SDGs, there are seven to which we contribute specifically via our core activities:\n\n- -SDG 6 : Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.\n- -SDG 8 : Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\n- -SDG 7 : Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\n- -SDG 12 : Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.\n- -SDG 17 : Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnerships for sustainable development.\n- -SDG 16 : Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.\n\nInformation about our contributions to the SDGs can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability.\n\nOver the next four sections, we define what each type of capital comprises, describe our approach to it, provide an indication of how we quantify our contribution, and offer concrete examples of how we create value. We're making progress in terms of quantifying our value creation, but we have only recently started and the process is still in its infancy. Challenges exist around data availability, data comparability, methodology and lack of standards.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL CAPITAL\n\nIn line with the International Integrated Reporting Framework, we define financial capital as the pool of funds available to an organisation for use in the production of goods or the provision of services. Funds can be obtained through financing, such as debt, equity or grants, or generated through operations or investments.\n\n## Our approach\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a financial services business and, as such, creating value via financial capital is our reason for being. Our profitability and cost effectiveness are important not only to our clients but also to our shareholders, employees, governments/regulators and other stakeholders, including society at large. For more details on our stakeholders' expectations, see page 18.\n\n## Wealth generation for our clients\n\nto make a positive contribution via our investment solutions. They expect risk-rewarding returns that enable the preservation and growth of their financial assets. Our wealth management solutions and investment strategies should also perform well compared with their benchmarks. To achieve this, we have set up professional investment processes that focus on long-term value creation for our investment strategies and the portfolios of our individual and institutional clients. Each of our investment strategies\n\nuses a process that is best suited to take advantage of the opportunities in its respective sector. We believe in the values of specialisation and craftsmanship, which is why our portfolio managers have the freedom to create and manage a strategy that is in line with their clients' needs and that delivers sustainable value to their clients. These portfolios bring together the collective expertise from teams that focus on fiduciary management, investment strategies, manager selection and portfolio management. Each team plays a pivotal role in the investment process, governance (including clear responsibilities) and optimum use of systems and tools, in order to achieve the most positive outcomes.\n\n## Profitability and cost effectiveness\n\nWe manage our profitability and cost effectiveness through continuous improvement of our processes, and through growth and innovation. Drawing on our multi-year forecast, we have set 2023 targets for our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio, our return on CET 1 capital and our efficiency ratio. We set annual targets for all Van Lanschot Kempen departments as part of our annual budget cycle. These budgets are devised bottom-up, with the input of the businesses challenged and, where necessary, made more concrete in sessions with the Executive Board. Target achievement is measured monthly and reported to the Executive Board using management reports - including KPI dashboards - and analyses of financial and non-financial data and trends.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of financial capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n| KPIs                                                                                              | Targets                       | Performance  2020   | Performance  2019   | Material  topics   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| 1.

In 2020, our CET 1 ratio increased to 24.3%, well above our target range. Our return on CET 1 declined to 4.4%, significantly below the target range, due to the loss on our structured products activities. Our efficiency ratio amounted to 85.7%, not meeting our target. More information on the developments underlying these ratios is provided on pages 49 and 53.\n\n## Return on assets under management\n\nOur wealth management solutions aim to deliver positive performance in the long term, with our investment strategies performing well against their benchmarks.\n\nIn 2020, the three-year average performances of Private Banking and Evi discretionary management mandates relative to their benchmarks stood at -1.8% and -2.2% respectively (2019: -0.4% and -0.9%). These figures are calculated by comparing the year-end absolute performance of the largest discretionary solutions over the last three years with their respective benchmarks. Although we did not meet our target to outperform the benchmarks, the absolute three-year average performance of these mandates amounted to 5.2% and 4.8% respectively, thereby positively contributing to our clients' wealth.\n\nFor more details on our financial results, see the 'Financial performance' section on page 43.\n\nOur clients trust us to manage their wealth effectively and",

On the left-hand side, the capital deployed by Van Lanschot Kempen in our business model is listed, divided into separate categories. On the right-hand side, the capital generated is listed, also divided into categories. The items listed in the tables are intended as examples, and should not be used to calculate our overall value creation. We have not included total inputs or total outputs in these tables for two reasons: firstly, the methodology is still too immature; secondly, inputs and outputs of a certain type of capital can also be deployed and transformed into another type of capital. For example, new assets under management (financial capital) can also lead to an increase in social capital if invested in the right solutions.\n\nAs this table shows, our financial capital inputs consist mainly of the savings, deposits and investments from our clients, as well as the funds provided by investors in our shares and bonds. Our financial capital outputs consist mainly of the funds we invest (on behalf of our clients) in companies and governments, the financial investment returns for our clients, and the financing we arrange for our clients. Our shareholders and investors receive dividends and returns as outputs. The outputs for our employees take the form of the salaries they receive. And for society at large, the main outputs relate to the taxes we pay.",

        "page_content": "## HUMAN AND INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL\n\nIn line with the International Integrated Reporting Framework, we define human capital as people's competencies, capabilities and experience; their motivation to innovate; their ability to understand, develop and implement our strategy; and their ability to lead, manage and collaborate. We define intellectual capital as organisational, knowledge-based intangibles, including specific expertise and intellectual property.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn a knowledge and service-based organisation such as ours, people make all the difference. Their professionalism, skills and engagement determine the quality of our service. Well-trained, knowledgeable people not only provide better service to our clients; they are also more engaged in what they do. And the rapid pace at which digitalisation and technology are developing makes the need for continuous learning even stronger.\n\n## Recruiting, retaining and developing talent\n\nOur strategy is to be an attractive and inclusive employer for all talent sources available in the labour market. We continuously strive to recruit a diverse range of talented professionals. Instead of looking for individuals on a caseby-case basis, our aim is to create a continuous flow of new talent. One of the reasons employees choose Van Lanschot Kempen over our competitors is the broader and deeper level of responsibility we are able to offer them. To retain our employees, we provide opportunities to grow, a diverse and inclusive culture, competitive and inclusive labour conditions and our Vitality Programme.\n\nThrough our online learning platform - accessible to all Van Lanschot Kempen employees - we provide an integrated educational programme that fits with our strategy. The platform helps employees and their managers to see what is expected of them, and what knowledge and skills they have yet to attain or develop. Development KPIs are included in the people analytics that managers receive on a quarterly basis.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of human and intellectual capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                                                                        | Targets                 | Performance  2020   | Performance  2019   |   Material  topics |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| 5.

In 2020, we identified four such topics - health and well-being, the new way of working (accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic), ethics and integrity, and performance management development. As a result of our focus on health and well-being, absenteeism went down from 3% in 2019 to 2.3% in 2020.\n\nAlthough our formal employee engagement survey only occurs every two years (last time in 2019), we conducted pulse surveys on these topics and developed action plans for each. The average participation rate across the pulse surveys was over 65%. Our Employer Net Promoter Score (eNPS) was 6, which is a positive result despite being slightly below our target of 10. The eNPS is a method used to measure employee satisfaction and loyalty to our organisation, based on the percentage of employees who are promoters of the organisation, minus the percentage of employees who are detractors.\n\nIn line with our strategic pillar to attract, develop and retain our workforce, we aim to further develop the skills of our staff. In 2020, 25% of all training was aimed at developing new skills, exactly meeting our target.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nAttracting and retaining a diverse workforce continues to be a focus area for Van Lanschot Kempen. We aim for a fully inclusive workforce, in terms of ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, gender and so on. We measure gender balance, and therefore aim for at least 30% female and 30% male in management positions reporting directly to the Executive Board, as well as in the next level of staff with management responsibilities. The gender balance in management positions did not change in 2020: 21% of employees in management positions are female, below our target range. We are taking steps to redress this, including - as of 1 January 2021 - supporting female colleagues to reach the top level in several departments under our adjusted organisational structure.\n\nAlso as of 1 January 2021, at the level reporting directly to the Executive Board, we saw 40% so-called \"next gen\" employees (under 45 years old) compared with 25% the",

        "page_content": "previous year. This gives us a strong signal to continue our inclusive labour market approach in 2021. An important initial step is our renewed employer brand narrative towards prospective candidates.\n\nDuring 2020, we encouraged leaders from across the business to follow training on unconscious bias, to raise awareness around inclusion and to activate more inclusive behaviour. We revised our vacancy texts to be 100% gender neutral - something for which we received recognition from the external market. We also implemented people analytics to analyse our recruitment funnels, the labour market, our actual inflow and promoters in more depth. Increased awareness and insight into data is a starting point for changing behaviour.\n\nWe strive for equal pay for our workforce, which means that pay is merit-based and related to job level; we therefore periodically investigate this for all categories of employees. If necessary, we make adjustments to equalise pay.\n\nIn 2020, we analysed the gender pay gap at different levels in the organisation. We observed pay gaps at senior management levels and in specific areas in the wider workforce; these may be due to differences in age, work experience and so on. In 2021, we will perform further analyses to determine whether there are any unexplained differences.\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of human and intellectual capital: inputs and outputs\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)         | From   | Amount  2020   | Amount  2019 Output (\u20ac million)   | For   |   Amount  2020 |   Amount  2019 |\n|---------------------------|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| Opportunity costs of work | E      | n/a            | n/a Social value of having work   | E     |           16.3 |           17.3 |\n|                           |        |                | Work-related illness              | E     |            1.5 |            1.5 |\n\nE: employees\n\nAs the table above shows, our human capital inputs consist of the opportunity costs of work by our employees, meaning the value of the hours our employees devote to Van Lanschot Kempen. We aim to add value to these human capital inputs through our business model - for example, by creating attractive jobs that result in additional social value for our employees. However, such outputs can also be negative - as in the case of work-related illnesses. Note that the table contains only three examples so far; we expect to add more data in the future, including figures on diversity,  the gender pay gap, work experience and training.\n\n## Opportunity costs of work\n\nBy using the so-called 'willingness to pay' method, economists have been able to establish the average monetary value that a Dutch employee assigns to one working hour, compared with one leisure hour. By multiplying the annual number of working hours spent by our employees by the average price of a leisure hour, it should be possible to estimate the total opportunity costs of our human capital input. As we are still exploring this methodology and its implications, there is no figure reported in the table above.\n\n## Social value of having work\n\nNumerous studies show that people with a job are more satisfied with their lives than people without one. Several of these studies also focus specifically on quantifying this social value, usually by means of a \"well-being valuation\". Through this econometric method, developed to measure the value of so-called non-market goods, we can determine the monetary value of increased life satisfaction as a result of a job. Based on the formula developed by Fujiwara (2019) 2 , the social value of all jobs at Van Lanschot Kempen in 2020 amounted to \u20ac16.3 million - accrued by employees - compared with \u20ac17.3 million in 2019.\n\n## Work-related illness\n\nOn the flip side, the negative impact of work-related illness on employees' quality of life is also reflected in our contribution to human capital and social value. To calculate this, we use the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) method developed by the World Health Organization. A DALY is an international measure of missed happiness in life due to illness. In short, every healthy year of life counts for 1 DALY, and the DALY is lowered for each year in which an employee is ill by using a weighting factor.\n\n| Key staff data                                                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employees (FTEs at year-end)                                                     | 1,564  | 1,560  |\n| Absenteeism (%)                                                                  | 2.3    | 3.0    |\n| Investment in training (\u20ac million)                                               | 2.0    | 2.8    |\n| Training hours (estimated total number of  hours, individually and collectively) | 84,000 | 80,026 |\n| Male/female ratio (%)                                                            | 67/33  | 65/35  |\n| Staff turnover (%)                                                               | 5      | 7      |\n\n| Staff per business at year-end   | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                  | Number | FTEs   | Number | FTEs   |\n| Private Banking                  | 660    | 603    | 698    | 655    |\n| Evi                              | 22     | 21     | 23     | 23     |\n| Asset Management                 | 270    | 260    | 274    | 264    |\n| Merchant Banking                 | 119    | 117    | 129    | 127    |\n| Other (support functions)        | 554    | 504    | 521    | 491    |\n| Hof Hoorneman Bankiers           | 65     | 59     | \\_      | \\_      |\n| Total                            | 1,690  | 1,564  | 1,645  | 1,560  |",

Based on this calculation, the total negative impact from arm, neck and shoulder complaints, back pain and burnout in 2020 amounted to \u20ac1.5 million, the same as in 2019.\n\n## Other achievements and developments\n\n## Organisational structure\n\nIn line with our strategic pillars - that guide the implementation of our strategy - our workforce and organisational structure need to evolve. We have engaged staff from all business lines and across multiple levels in the organisation to think through the strategic challenges, and involved them in the transformation of our workforce. With the shift from a business line-based structure to a functionbased structure, some roles will be required to shift, too. Our company strategy will also be translated into the required skills and competencies, with a well-structured learning management system in place to ensure that our people are able to deliver on it. This process started in mid-2020 and will be further worked out in 2021.\n\n## Inclusive employment practices\n\nIn early 2020, we completed the process of integrating our HR practices - including the provision of a defined benefit pension plan for all our employees. This plan gives us the opportunity to use some of our own Kempen funds and/or an additional Evi pension scheme to offer a solid pension provision to our people. As part of the same HR integration project, we now also have some more inclusive employment practices. For example, we financially support female colleagues who want to work full-time with daycare costs. We also give older employees the opportunity to work fewer hours as they get closer to retirement, without it negatively impacting their pension savings. Lastly, we give our employees the opportunity to take a sabbatical once every five years\n\n## Impact of Covid-19 on our employees\n\nNaturally, the pandemic - and the restrictions related to it had a significant impact on our employees. On the one hand, travel time was all but eliminated and people embraced the digital working environment. On the other, many parents understandably struggled to balance work with childcare, while the lack of personal interaction took a toll on people's well-being. To boost engagement, we organised many digital team events.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to work on engaging our employees on key topics, and increasing the diversity and inclusion of our workforce. We will also further refine and increase our reporting on our contribution to human capital value creation.",

        "page_content": "## NATURAL CAPITAL\n\nIn line with the International Integrated Reporting Framework, we define natural capital as all renewable and non-renewable environmental resources that support the prosperity of an organisation. Natural capital includes air, water, land, minerals, forests, biodiversity and ecosystem health.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe contribute to natural capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute specifically to natural or environmental goals such as clean energy, climate mitigation measures or sustainable agriculture. As a result of our investment of client assets and lending activities, however, there may be negative impacts on the environment under certain circumstances, such as waste production, pollution and carbon emissions.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nGiven the size of our assets under management, the biggest environmental impact we make - whether positive or negative - relates to how we invest our clients' assets. We therefore have an extensive responsible investment policy in place for all assets under management. This policy is developed and implemented internally, and is based on a long-term, focused investment philosophy coupled with an active ownership approach. We believe that an actively managed investment portfolio will create the most value in\n\nthe long term, in both financial and non-financial (environmental, social and governance - ESG) terms. We engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of ESG topics, including environmental issues, and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings (AGMs). If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum environmental standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria and a bestin-class approach.\n\nAs part of our responsible and sustainable investing, we also have a climate policy that was significantly strengthened in 2020. Kempen Asset Management has set strong targets for our investment funds, in line with the Paris Agreement on carbon emission reduction, to be met by 2025, 2030 and 2050 respectively. As Kempen Asset Management is the asset manager for Private Banking's discretionary management propositions, this also applies to these portfolios. In 2020, Kempen Asset Management also signed the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative: a group of 30 international asset managers who aim to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions in their portfolios by 2050.

At the beginning of 2020, we adjusted our KPI (15a) to an increase in the percentage of fund managers 2 that meet our sustainability criteria. In 2020, the percentage of fund managers that met our sustainability criteria was 76%. Given that our criteria are now more stringent, we are satisfied with this result by the end of the reporting year.\n\nIn 2020, we undertook 116 direct engagements for change and awareness (up from 84 in 2019), which means we reached our annual target of 80-100 cases. At least one milestone was reached for 61 engagements in 2020, meaning that at least one pre-defined goal of the engagement was realised. The large number of engagement cases for which at least one milestone was reached is due to increasing engagement efforts.\n\nIn addition to these direct engagements with companies, we also had 206 collaborative engagements with companies and 32 dialogues with external fund managers. In addition, we voted at 419 meetings, or 96% of all votable meetings (2019: 414 meetings, 92%).",

Due to the small size of our company relative to the magnitude of the assets we manage, our biggest emissions relate to our client investments. In 2020, the aggregate carbon footprint of our clients' managed assets was 4.9 million tonnes (2019: 4.7 million tonnes). Although the absolute carbon footprint increased, carbon intensity decreased, indicating that our investments have become less carbon intensive. This reflects the fact that our clients' assets are increasingly in ESG investments, which have lower carbon intensities. We see this development in both Private Banking and Asset Management.\n\nOur mortgage portfolio saw a reduction in carbon emissions of 5.8%, reflecting the fact that the Netherlands is moving towards making its homes more sustainable.\n\nHowever, the total carbon footprint of the assets on our balance sheet increased from 41,645 tonnes in 2019 to 47,879 tonnes in 2020. This was due to an increase in the indirect emissions of our investment portfolio, which was the consequence of changes in the portfolio.\n\nIn our own organisation, our absolute carbon emissions in 2020 totalled 1,965 tonnes, or 1.17 tonnes per FTE (2019: 4,220 tonnes, or 2.4 tonnes per FTE). The 51.1% fall in emissions per FTE is mainly the result of less business travel due to the one-off impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of these exceptional circumstances, we more than met our reduction target of 2.5% per FTE per year, but it is likely that emissions will increase again once the situation normalises. In 2020, we continued to offset all the carbon emissions from our own organisation, as we did in 2019.\n\n## Carbon footprint of our assets under management in 2020 3\n\n| CO 2 e assets under management   |   Total AuM (\u20ac billion) |   Absolute footprint (million tCO 2 e) |   Relative footprint (tCO 2 e/\u20ac m  invested) | Carbon intensity (tCO 2 e/\u20ac m sales)   | Coverage (CO 2 e based on %  AuM)   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Private Banking (incl.

For the latter and our clients' investments, we have made some initial value creation calculations. For our natural capital inputs, the situation is different: because the value of these inputs is insignificant and very hard to quantify or monetise, there are no data in the left-hand side of the table. Van Lanschot Kempen's primary inputs come from financial capital streams, and are transformed into natural capital outputs.\n\n## Our client investments and natural value creation\n\nIn 2020, we made an initial step in terms of quantifying the natural capital outcomes of our clients' assets. By using data from a new data vendor, we undertook a preliminary first assessment of the natural capital alignment of Kempen's sustainable equity funds. 6 These funds comprise the Kempen European Sustainable Value Creation Fund, Kempen Global Sustainable Value Creation Fund, Kempen Global Sustainable Equity Fund and Kempen Sustainable European Small-cap Fund, with a total value of \u20ac876 million. Our assessment focused on the goods and services provided by our investee companies that are associated with eight natural themes, such as clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and climate. As shown in the table above, the natural capital alignment of all Kempen's sustainable funds in aggregate (\u20ac876 million) is estimated at -\u20ac1.8 million. If the \u20ac876 million were to be invested in benchmark funds instead, the natural capital alignment would be estimated at -\u20ac101.1 million.\n\nOur calculations were based on company sales data per investee, indicating which portion of sales could be linked (positively or negatively) to a set of natural and social themes. Adding up the sales numbers for the natural themes resulted in the total contribution to natural capital. Although we recognise that this aggregation may result in a product or service of an investee being attributed to more than one (natural or social) theme, we do not expect this to materially influence the final outcome of our analysis. The main reason is that our aggregation is conducted both for positive and negative impacts, and consequently smooths out a potential double-counting calculation impact.\n\nAs shown by the graph on the following page, for every million euros invested in the Kempen sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2020, there was a positive alignment of \u20ac24,449 with sustainable energy and \u20ac24,478 with climate mitigation. The graph also shows negative alignments with some natural themes, especially sustainable energy, climate mitigation, marine ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems. Some but not all of the impacts compare favourably with the benchmarks for these sustainable Kempen funds, as shown by the horizontal lines in the graph. For more information about benchmarks, visit kempen.com/en/asset-management.\n\nAs also indicated in the graph, the calculated impact can be mapped to the SDGs as well. However, the process of mapping the natural capital alignment with the SDGs is still in its infancy.",

The fund's portfolio companies continue to find ways to positively contribute to the environment. In 2019, 38.7 million trees were planted and 2,349 hectares of natural areas were protected across fund partners, timber and farmland investments. On a pro-rata basis, that equates to a contribution of 150,000 trees planted and 33 hectares protected. Planting trees can enhance biodiversity while forests can store approximately one-third of annual carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels globally.\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe've made some progress on reporting in terms of natural capital in 2020, but there's still work to be done. We aim to expand our analysis to our credit investment funds as well. In general terms, we aim to steer these figures in the right direction in 2021 and beyond by setting targets and by further enhancing and implementing our responsible investment policies.",

        "page_content": "## SOCIAL CAPITAL\n\nIn line with the International Integrated Reporting Framework, we define social capital as the relationships within and between groups of stakeholders. In our case, social capital includes the social impact we make via our client assets.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe preserve and create wealth, growth and job opportunities for society by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. Our relationship with clients is one of our most important assets. We increase social capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute specifically to social goals, such as health and education, or basic needs, such as food and clean water. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, in some cases there may be negative impacts, such as on labour rights, human rights or other social issues in our supply chains.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nAs with natural capital, the biggest social impact we make relates to how we invest our assets under management. Our responsible investment policy therefore also covers social issues extensively. We engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of ESG topics, including social issues such as human rights and labour rights, and we exercise our voting rights at AGMs. If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum social standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we also offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria and a best-in-class approach.\n\nFor a full description of our ESG policy (including our voting policy and voting records), see kempen.com/en/assetmanagement/esg.\n\n## Ethics and integrity\n\nThe financial sector is built on trust, and a healthy culture and ethical behaviour are needed to sustain this trust with all our stakeholders.\n\nThe Banking Code, with which we comply, sets out principles for sound and controlled business operations, corporate governance, risk management policies, and audit and remuneration policies. Its scope includes the integrity of the organisation (for more information, see page 92). As stated in the Banking Code, the Statutory and Supervisory Boards are responsible for developing and maintaining standards of integrity and ethical behaviour.\n\nOur Code of Conduct, to which every employee must adhere, goes further than complying with relevant legislation. It includes guidelines on how employees should act with integrity and balance the interests of all stakeholders. Our Code also includes the Banker's Oath, which all our employees are required to sign. For more information, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance.\n\nThere are various internal mechanisms for employees who are seeking advice, or for reporting concerns about ethical issues, unethical or unlawful behaviour, and organisational integrity - for example, via their managers and the Compliance department. We have a whistleblower policy and a complaints procedure in place; we have also appointed an adviser who employees can speak to confidentially.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of social capital through a number of KPIs:\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                                                                                   | Targets                    | Performance  2020        | Performance  2019     | Material  topics   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| 9.

        "page_content": "## Client relations\n\nThe relationship with our clients is one of our most important assets. To measure their satisfaction and loyalty, we use the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which gives insight into client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6. The NPS that we measure is also known as Relationship NPS. We measure this three times a year for Private Banking, twice a year for Evi, and once every two years for Asset Management.\n\nIn 2020, our Private Banking clients 1 awarded us an NPS of 26, higher than our target of 10. This can be attributed to a significantly higher score in Q4 2020, during which the percentage of clients with whom there was no contact decreased. Satisfaction regarding our investment services also increased, which could relate to the rebound of financial markets in the last quarter.\n\nThe NPS for Evi decreased to 5 in 2020, lower than our target of 10. Compared with 2019, Evi clients indicated a lower level of satisfaction regarding their investment results. However, 85% indicated it was \"likely\" to \"very likely\" that they would remain a client.\n\nFor Asset Management, we measure NPS once every two years, as the relationships with - and solutions provided to - institutional clients do not change as quickly as can be the case with private clients. The last time we measured the NPS for Asset Management was in 2019, when our clients awarded us a score of 31, above our target of 20.\n\nIn addition to NPS, two new KPIs were added in 2020 to measure our progress in building long-term client relationships with our Merchant Banking clients. Among our Corporate Finance clients, this is measured via the percentage of successful transactions with repeat clients during a year. A client is defined as a repeat Corporate Finance client if they have made a successful transaction\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of social capital: inputs and outputs\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)                                | From   | Amount  2020   | Amount  2019 Output (\u20ac million)   | For Amount  2020   | Amount  2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| Social capital input has not yet been quantified |        |                | Client investments (AuM)          | S 31.9             | n/a            |\n| Social capital input has not yet been quantified |        |                | Mortgages                         | S n/a              | n/a            |\n| Social capital input has not yet been quantified |        |                | Other loans                       | S n/a              | n/a            |\n\nS: society\n\nAs the table shows, our main impact on social capital - both positive and negative - is via the products and solutions we provide. Although we acknowledge that we use social capital as inputs - such as our brand reputation and stakeholder recognition - we don't know yet how to quantify or monetise these, which is why there are no data in the left-hand side of the table.\n\n## Our client investments and social value creation\n\nAs with natural capital, we made an initial step in terms of quantifying the social capital outcomes of our clients' assets. In 2020, we undertook a preliminary first assessment of the social capital alignment of Kempen's sustainable equity funds with seven social themes. 3\n\nwith us in the past five years. The result on this KPI indicates whether existing clients are doing business with us again as well as our ability to acquire new clients. In 2020, 39% of transactions were with repeat clients, below our target range of 60-70%. This was due to the significant rise in the number of new clients for whom transactions were made. This increase was mainly caused by the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in a relatively large number of new life sciences clients within our ECM business.\n\nClient satisfaction among our Securities clients is measured in a similar way: the percentage of repeat Securities clients paying bundled commission for our research in the past 12 months, compared with the previous 12-month period. Given the importance of building long-term client relationships, the target has been set at 80%. At 95%, the 2020 result is significantly above our target.\n\nA crucial element in our relationship with clients is the extent to which their expectations are met by the quality and effectiveness of our solutions. The quality of our investment strategies is measured via the average Morningstar rating of these strategies in the institutional share class. At the end of 2020, the average rating was 3.6, meeting our target.\n\n## Ethical behaviour\n\nOur approach to ethical behaviour is described on the previous page. We monitor whether our employees positively evaluate our culture regarding ethical behaviour and integrity via employee surveys. Employees are asked to evaluate whether we operate with integrity in both our internal and external dealings, and if they feel they could report dishonest or unethical practices without fear of reprisal. The outcome is benchmarked against other financial services firms (by an external organisation) and was above the industry average at the end of 2020, in line with our target.\n\nIn 2020, there was one ethical incident reported, which has since been handled according to the relevant policies and procedures.",

In our assessment, we focused on the goods and services provided by our investee companies that are associated with the social themes, such as health and well-being, reduced inequality, and clean water and sanitation.\n\nAlignment of our assets under management in Kempen sustainable equity funds with social themes (in \u20ac1,000 per million euros invested)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on our assessment, the Kempen sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2020 (\u20ac876 million) made a net positive contribution of \u20ac31.9 million to the social themes. As shown by the graph, for every million euros invested in the Kempen sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2020, there was a positive alignment of \u20ac44,647 with health and \u20ac16,644 with basic needs such as no poverty, education, clean water and energy. There were also two negative impacts, on hunger and health respectively, but in both cases performance was better than the benchmark (as shown by the horizontal lines in the graph). If the \u20ac876 million were to be invested in the benchmarks of these sustainable equity funds instead, the social capital alignment would be estimated at \u20ac12.1 million. For more information about industry benchmarks, visit kempen.com/ en/asset-management.\n\n## Sustainable Value Creation Fund\n\nThe Sustainable Value Creation Fund actively selects investee companies that make a social contribution. The fund has several pharmaceutical companies in its portfolio, which align with the social theme of health and well-being in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic (as shown in the third bar of the graph above). However, we are aware that such pharmaceutical companies also have negative impacts.\n\nThe two cases below are examples of how the fund contributes to social capital.\n\nFirstly, Roche was in the spotlight in March 2020 due to its lysis buffer solution recipe in relation to Covid-19 test kits. Along with other investors, we asked Roche to share this medical information with the Dutch government and other suitable parties to ramp up testing capabilities for Covid-19. The specific recipe was subsequently released and made widely available.\n\nSecondly, Novo Nordisk has continued to contribute to the health of patients needing insulin, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has reduced the price of human insulin from US $4 to $3 per vial to ensure access for uninsured people globally. Because of this, millions of people from 76 countries received access to low-priced insulin in 2020. If patients take their medication correctly and adopt a healthy lifestyle, their life expectancy can reach the same level as people without such a diagnosis. Under this assumption, Novo Nordisk's products in the diabetes market save 360 million years of total life expectancy for its patients.",

        "page_content": "## Global Impact Pool\n\nThe Global Impact Pool (GIP) aims to reach underserved consumers around the world with essential healthcare and financial services. Its goal is to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Access to high-quality affordable healthcare services is a critical unmet need for consumers in East Africa and Southeast Asia. In addition, financial services are able to help marginalised consumers and local businesses access capital and afford the insurance or banking services they need. In 2020, the GIP reached \u20ac108 million (2019: \u20ac100 million).\n\n## Mortgages\n\nOn the Private Banking side, our mortgages also contribute to realising social impacts. Scientific research indicates that home ownership contributes to higher levels of well-being and better safety in neighbourhoods. We have not yet quantified such impacts from our mortgages in monetary terms.\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe've made progress on reporting in terms of social capital in 2020, but there's still work to be done. We aim to expand our analysis to our other equity funds and credit investment funds as well. In addition, we're continuing to make progress in quantifying the social capital impact of our mortgages and other loans. We aim to steer these figures in the right direction in 2021 and beyond by setting targets and by further enhancing and implementing our sustainable investment policies.\n\n## VAN LANSCHOT KEMPEN FOUNDATION\n\nWe aim to support community projects that help create a better world for future generations. The activities of the Foundation focus on four themes: financial education and talent development, health, art and culture, and social cohesion via sport. The aim is to make the largest possible positive impact on people who need our support. An important feature of our Foundation activities is that we always seek to combine a financial donation with the - pro bono - deployment of Van Lanschot Kempen staff. By doing so, we hope to make a positive impact on society as well as on our employees. Participation in Foundation activities connects our staff to new people and unfamiliar situations, resulting in new experiences and energy.\n\nBecause the Covid-19 pandemic made it difficult to set up physical (in-person) activities in which our staff could participate, the Foundation had to seek a new approach to reach its goals. In June, we therefore invited our employees and clients to join a Covid-19 fundraising project. Together with our partners - JINC, Fonds Gehandicaptensport, De Zonnebloem, Humanitas and LUMC - we selected five specific pandemic-related projects that were in need of additional funds. The Foundation decided to use a portion of its budget for these projects, and a large number of employees and clients responded and donated to these projects as well. Within three months, more than \u20ac66,000 was raised - a positive result in these difficult times. For further details on the Foundation and its annual report, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/vlkf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SPONSORSHIP\n\nArts sponsorship is an integral part of our market positioning as a wealth manager. The support we give to the arts, artists and museums helps to both preserve and expand our cultural heritage. Sports are also an important driver of well-being in society, and as such are a secondary focus of our support. Our main sponsorship activities in 2020 were as follows:\n\n- -The Van Lanschot Kempen Art Prize is presented to a midcareer contemporary artist whose work best conveys the spirit of the age to future generations.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen is the main sponsor of Het Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. This five-year partnership fits with our focus on preserving and creating wealth in the broadest sense of the word.\n- -In November 2020, Van Lanschot Kempen became a partner of the Topsport Community. This three-year partnership connects the worlds of top sport, business, science and culture, and focuses on sharing knowledge.\n- -Evi has sponsored the women's beach volleyball duo Madelein Meppelink and Sanne Keizer since 2017. Due to the postponement of the Olympic Games to 2021, we have decided to extend this sponsorship by one year until the end of 2021.\n- -Van Lanschot Private Banking became the main partner of the Van Gogh Museum in 2020. This three-year partnership is the result of successful collaboration between the museum and our company since 2015.\n- -Kempen is the principal sponsor of the Nereus student rowing club in Amsterdam; this sponsorship will end in March 2021.",

In March and April, the pandemic sparked a chain of events in the markets that led to increased volatility and illiquidity. The deteriorating economic outlook triggered an unprecedented monetary policy response from central banks and governments around the world. In the second half of 2020, the financial markets showed a swift recovery.\n\n## Results\n\nDespite these exceptional circumstances, in 2020 we saw commercial segments developing well, which resulted in a net profit of \u20ac49.8 million (underlying net result: \u20ac51.0 million). This allows us to propose a dividend of \u20ac0.70 per share. Payment of dividends will be made in two parts, as we are following the recommendation of the European\n\n- 1 Full-year 2020 and 2019 including retained earnings; half-year 2020 excluding retained earnings.\n- 2 Return on average Common Equity Tier 1 capital is calculated based on underlying net result.\n\nCentral Bank (ECB) and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) to limit the payment of dividends until 30 September 2021.\n\nThe 49% decline in net result compared with 2019 is due to several factors. Firstly, following the impact of the pandemic on financial markets, we suffered a significant loss on our structured products activities. Secondly, interest income declined as a result of the ongoing low interest rate environment. Thirdly, we did not account for exceptional items in 2020, whereas 2019 saw the sale of our stakes in AIO II and VLC & Partners, which were partly offset by an impairment of goodwill.\n\nFollowing the exceptional market circumstances relating to Covid-19 in the first half of 2020, which led to a net profit of \u20ac9.5 million, we saw all commercial segments develop well in the second half of the year, with a net profit of \u20ac40.4 million as a result.",

At the end of 2020, we included this acquisition in our balance sheet and client assets, because we gained decisive control from the date we obtained declarations of no objection by the regulators.\n\n| Financial results (\u20ac million)                               | 2020   |   2019 |       | H2 2020      | H1 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|\n| Commission                                                  | 296.4  |  290.4 | 2%    | 147.5        | 148.9     |\n| -  of which securities commissions                          | 247.4  |  241.8 | 2%    | 124.3        | 123.1     |\n| -  of which other commissions                               | 49.1   |   48.6 | 1%    | 23.2         | 25.8      |\n| Interest                                                    | 152.1  |  175.3 | -13%  | 75.1         | 77.0      |\n| Income from securities and associates                       | 17.7   |   50.5 | -65%  | 17.1         | 0.6       |\n| Result on financial transactions                            | -32.3  |   -7.4 |       | -7.0         | -25.3     |\n| Income from operating activities                            | 434.0  |  508.7 | -15%  | 232.7        | 201.3     |\n| Staff costs                                                 | 239.3  |  238.5 | 0%    | 121.7        | 117.6     |\n| Other administrative expenses                               | 115.3  |  127.9 | -10%  | 52.4         | 62.8      |\n| - of which regulatory levies and charges                    | 11.1   |   11.6 | -4%   | 3.2          | 7.9       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                               | 17.2   |   17.7 | -3%   | 10.2         | 7.1       |\n| Operating expenses                                          | 371.8  |  384.1 | -3%   | 184.3        | 187.5     |\n| Gross result                                                | 62.2   |  124.7 | -50%  | 48.5         | 13.7      |\n| Addition to loan loss provisions                            | 1.9    |  -12.1 |       | 0.6          | 1.3       |\n| Other impairments                                           | -      |   34.9 | -100% | -0.2         | 0.2       |\n| Impairments                                                 | 1.9    |   22.9 | -92%  | 0.4          | 1.5       |\n| Operating profit before tax of non-strategic investments    | 1.7    |   37.8 | -96%  | 0.9          | 0.7       |\n| Operating profit before special items and tax               | 62.0   |  139.6 | -56%  | 49.0         | 13.0      |\n| Strategic investment programme                              | -      |   11.1 | -100% | -            | -         |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions | 6.2    |    6.2 | 0%    | 3.1          | 3.1       |\n| Restructuring charges                                       | 1.6    |    2.8 | -43%  | 1.6          | -         |\n| Operating profit before tax                                 | 54.2   |  119.5 | -55%  | 44.3         | 9.9       |\n| Income tax                                                  | 4.4    |   21.1 | -79%  | 4.0          | 0.4       |\n| Net result                                                  | 49.8   |   98.4 | -49%  | 40.4         | 9.5       |\n| Underlying net result                                       | 51.0   |  108.8 | -53%  | 41.6         | 9.5       |\n| Underlying net result (\u20ac million)                           | 2020   | 2019   |       | H2 2020      | H1 2020   |\n| Net result                                                  | 49.8   |   98.4 | -49%  | 40.4         | 9.5       |\n| Strategic investment programme                              | -      |   11.1 | -100% | -            | -         |\n| Restructuring charges                                       | 1.6    |    2.8 | -43%  | 1.6          | -         |\n| Tax effects                                                 | -0.4   |   -3.5 | -89%  |              |           |\n| Underlying net result                                       | 51.0   |  108.8 | -53%  | -0.4    41.6 | -  9.5    |\n\nPrivate Banking, Asset Management and Merchant Banking made a positive contribution to the underlying net result. Evi is moving towards break-even point. The net result of the Other activities segment is negative, and includes the loss on our structured products activities (-\u20ac35.1 million). As of 2020, our structured products activities moved from Merchant Banking to our Treasury department in the Other activities segment, due to the shift in our organisational structure from a business line-driven organisation to a function-based structure. Comparative 2019 figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe underlying net result for 2020 is the net result adjusted for costs associated with restructuring charges and tax effects (\u20ac1.2 million net effect).\n\n## Underlying net result by segment ( \u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Securities commissions increased by 2% due to higher income from management fees, reflecting the growth in assets under management at Private Banking, Evi and Asset Management as a result of a higher average AuM volume in 2020 and the realised net inflows across all business units. The higher market volatility in 2020 led to higher transaction fees at Private Banking and lower realisation at Merchant Banking. Other commissions increased, mainly due to the result of Corporate Finance and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) deals at Merchant Banking.\n\nAnnualised recurring management fees (run rate) were at a similar level to year-end 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we saw the run rate decline by 13% because of the challenging market conditions, but the run rate recovered fully over the rest of the year.\n\n## Commission income by segment (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Transaction fees at Private Banking are \u20ac3.0 million higher compared with 2019, as market volatility led to a high number of trades. Private Banking's margins on assets under management are fairly stable.\n\nEvi's commission income went up by \u20ac0.3 million to \u20ac5.3 million due to growth in assets under management, mainly as a result of the partnership between Evi and a.s.r. bank.\n\n## Interest\n\n| Interest (\u20ac million)                             |   2020 |   2019 |       |   H2 2020 |   H1 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross interest margin                            |  169.9 |  186.9 | -9 %  |      84.1 |      85.8 |\n| Interest income and charges on hedge derivatives |   -5.4 |   -2.1 |       |      -3.5 |      -1.9 |\n| Interest equalisation                            |  -19.7 |  -16.9 | 16 %  |     -10.3 |      -9.4 |\n| Clean interest margin                            |  144.8 |  167.9 | -14 % |      70.3 |      74.6 |\n| Miscellaneous interest income and charges        |    4   |    4.9 | -19 % |       2.9 |       1.1 |\n| Loan commission                                  |    3.3 |    2.4 | 35 %  |       2   |       1.3 |\n| Interest                                         |  152.1 |  175.3 | -13 % |      75.1 |      77   |\n\nThe current interest rate climate continues to put pressure on our interest income. Our 2020 interest income of \u20ac152.1 million was 13% down on the \u20ac175.3 million realised in 2019. The continued run-off of Corporate Banking loans has also led to lower interest income. The Corporate Banking loan portfolio contracted by \u20ac123 million to \u20ac195 million.\n\nThe gross interest margin includes the one-off effect of a positive revaluation of interest claims to the tune of \u20ac1.0 million, to be received from DSB Bank. In 2019, the one-off effect of this interest claim was \u20ac3.9 million. 3\n\nThe impact of charging negative interest rates is a plus of \u20ac4.6 million. In the first quarter, we charged negative interest rates on volumes over \u20ac2.5 million. In the second and third quarters, we charged negative interest rates on volumes over \u20ac1.0 million; and in the fourth quarter, we lowered this threshold to over \u20ac0.5 million.\n\nIn comparison with year-end 2019, the interest margin 4 fell by 16 basis points to an average of 103 basis points. The 'clean interest margin' declined by 15 basis points compared with its level at the end of 2019, to 98 basis points at the end of 2020.\n\nThe balance of interest income and charges on hedge derivatives deteriorated from -\u20ac2.1 million in 2019 to -\u20ac5.4 million in 2020.\n\nMiscellaneous interest income and charges went down from \u20ac4.9 million to \u20ac4.0 million. This is the result of income from early redemption fees driven by many early prepayments, partly offset by a provision for the decision by the Dutch financial services complaints tribunal (Kifid). This decision - which related to a revised calculation of fees for early repayments and interest conversion - led to a provision of \u20ac5.1 million in compensation for mortgage clients.\n\nAsset Management's 2020 commissions increased by \u20ac3.6 million compared with 2019. This growth was driven by an increase in commissions from both investment strategies (mainly credit strategies and real assets strategies) and new fiduciary mandates. Average margins fell from 18 basis points in 2019 to 16 basis points in 2020, due to a change in the composition of assets under management, as inflow was mainly achieved in fiduciary management: \u20ac6.0 billion out of total inflow of \u20ac5.4 billion.\n\nMerchant Banking performed well in 2020, with commission income of \u20ac48.9 million at a level comparable with 2019. The result of Corporate Finance and ECM deals was \u20ac36.2 million, above 2019's result of \u20ac34.9 million. Transaction fees fell, due to a lower transaction volume partly due to market circumstances surrounding Covid-19. Under normal market circumstances, clients are willing to pay for access to liquidity. In the first half of 2020, due to the higher market volatility, the liquidity in the market was much higher than under usual market circumstances. Clients were able to use this higher liquidity to trade via low-touch trading and did not need to use our trading services, or trades were made at a lower price level.",

We also take positions in our own investment funds, for instance by providing seed capital or in order to align with our clients' interests.\n\nDividend income rose to \u20ac8.3 million, from \u20ac7.7 million in 2019. In general, we have stakes in sectors that were not heavily impacted by Covid-19.\n\nCapital gains were down by \u20ac23.4 million in 2020, reflecting their high level in 2019 as a result of the sale of our 49% stake in VLC & Partners (\u20ac17.1 million) and the sale of part of our stake in Marfo Food Group (\u20ac6.5 million).\n\nValuation gains and losses fell by \u20ac10.0 million to \u20ac8.8 million in 2020. This reflects a mix of positive results in our participation portfolio, mainly due to a liquidity event in one of our portfolios and the lower result of our coinvestments compared with last year.\n\nThe total result of our co-investments is -\u20ac0.9 million, consisting of -\u20ac1.2 million on our own funds and \u20ac0.3 million on hedges. The hedges are reported under Result on financial transactions. After a negative first half of 2020, we saw recovery in the results of our co-investments in the second half of the year.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\n| Result on financial transactions (\u20ac million)   |   2020 |   2019 |       |   H2 2020 |   H1 2020 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Result on securities trading                   |    2.1 |    3.5 | -39 % |       2.7 |      -0.5 |\n| Result on currency trading                     |    8.2 |    8.9 | -8 %  |       3.5 |       4.6 |\n| Result on investment portfolio                 |    0.4 |    0.6 | -41 % |       0.6 |      -0.2 |\n| Result on hedges                               |  -38.7 |  -13.2 |       |     -12.8 |     -25.9 |\n| Other income                                   |   -4.3 |   -7.3 | -41 % |      -1   |      -3.3 |\n| Result on financial transactions               |  -32.3 |   -7.4 |       |      -7   |     -25.3 |\n\nResult on financial transactions decreased by \u20ac24.9 million due to the loss on our structured products activities of \u20ac35.1 million. This loss was mainly due to the exceptional volatility and illiquidity of certain segments of the financial markets in 2020. Our structured products activities recorded losses of \u20ac27.3 million in the first half of the year, deepening to \u20ac35.1 million by year-end 2020. The loss in the second half of 2020 was incurred due to the further hedging of risks in the existing portfolio, which entailed higher costs. In response to the loss in the first quarter of the year, we are working with a tightened risk appetite. We hedge new positions one-to-one, and are gradually reducing existing positions. We expect these existing positions to be largely reduced over the next three years.\n\nDuring this time, we expect to incur costs to hedge these existing positions.\n\nThe \u20ac2.1 million recorded in Result on securities trading reflects a positive performance of the trading book. Trading activities are the result of client facilitation only, mainly providing liquidity to clients.\n\nResult on currency trading was relatively stable compared with 2019.\n\nResult on hedges fell in comparison with 2019, by \u20ac25.5 million, due to the loss in our structured products activities.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n| Operating expenses (\u20ac million)           |   2020 |   2019 | H2 2020   |   H2 2020 |   H1 2020 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Staff costs                              |  239.3 |  238.5 | 0%        |     121.7 |     117.6 |\n| Other administrative expenses            |  115.3 |  127.9 | -10%      |      52.4 |      62.8 |\n| - of which regulatory levies and charges |   11.1 |   11.6 | -4%       |       3.2 |       7.9 |\n| Depreciation and amortisation            |   17.2 |   17.7 | -3%       |      10.2 |       7.1 |\n| Operating expenses                       |  371.8 |  384.1 | -3%       |     184.3 |     187.5 |\n\nAs previously indicated, we expected operating expenses to rise slightly for 2020. However, they actually fell 3% to \u20ac371.8 million (2019: \u20ac384.1 million), reflecting a proactively implemented package of cost-saving\n\nmeasures - partly structural and partly one-off - at the end of the first quarter. With the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, operating costs will be at a higher level in 2021 than they were in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Staff costs\n\nAt \u20ac239.3 million, staff costs were at the same level as in 2019. Our previously announced expectation that they would increase was due to a new pension agreement as well as the harmonisation and modernisation of employment conditions. A combination of cost-saving measures and fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) staff (excluding employees from Hof Hoorneman Bankiers) means that the expected cost increase is being largely offset.\n\nAt year-end 2019, we employed 1,560 FTEs. As of 2020, an FTE equals 40 working hours for all employees, instead of 36 hours for some employees, as previously. This adjustment had an impact of around 40 FTEs, which led to an adjusted number of FTEs of around 1,520 as of 1 January 2020. Excluding employees of our non-strategic investments, at year-end 2020 we employed 1,564 FTEs. The increase is mainly explained by our acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, resulting in an additional 58.7 FTEs.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses amounted to \u20ac115.3 million in 2020, 10% below the figure for 2019 (\u20ac127.9 million).\n\n## Impairments\n\n| Impairments (\u20ac million)                               | 2020   | 2019   |       | H2 2020   | H1 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Private Banking                                       | 2.2    | -11.2  |       | 1.0       | 1.2       |\n| - Of  which Corporate Banking loans                   | 1.8    | -4.3   |       | 0.8       | 0.9       |\n| Other                                                 | -0.3   | -0.9   | -61%  | -0.4      | 0.0       |\n| Addition to loan loss provisions                      | 1.9    | -12.1  |       | 0.6       | 1.3       |\n| Impairment on goodwill and intangible assets          | -      | 34.9   |       | -         | -         |\n| Impairment on investments and participating interests | -      | -      |       | -0.2      | 0.2       |\n| Other impairments                                     | -      | 34.9   |       | -0.2      | 0.2       |\n| Impairments                                           | 1.9    | 22.9   | -92 % | 0.4       | 1.5       |\n\n## Addition to loan loss provisions\n\nIn 2020, we saw limited impact on our loan portfolio and impairments from Covid-19. We benefited from winding down our Corporate Banking loan book, which lowered the credit risk of our loan portfolio. As a result, only \u20ac1.9 million was added to our loan loss provisions in 2020. Private Banking loans accounted for \u20ac0.5 million.\n\nIFRS 9 models were deemed too optimistic for certain clients and industries, given the current circumstances due to Covid-19. The net \u20ac1.9 million addition to loan loss provisions therefore includes a management overlay of \u20ac4.9 million. This is the result of extensive client monitoring and sector analysis, leading to adjustments in the stage classification of some clients.\n\nIn 2020, the addition to loan loss provisions relative to average risk-weighted assets worked out at four basis points, (2019: release of 27 basis points).\n\n## Non-strategic investments\n\nWe currently have majority stakes in two non-strategic financial investments, Holonite (Holowell BV) and Allshare.\n\nOur aim is to divest our shareholdings in these nonstrategic investments over time. The operating profit (before tax) from our portfolio of equity holdings amounted to \u20ac1.7 million in 2020, down from \u20ac37.8 million in 2019 (which was an exceptionally good year because of the sale of AIO II). Excluding the book profit and operating result of AIO II, non-strategic investments in 2019 contributed to \u20ac1.7 million, the same level as 2020.\n\n## Special items\n\nWe recognised \u20ac1.6 million in special items in 2020 for restructuring charges relating to Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, based on management expectations. With the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, 58.7 FTEs have been added to our workforce. Employees will be offered the choice either to join Van Lanschot Kempen or to make use of a severance arrangement.\n\nCompared with \u20ac20.1 million in 2019, the decrease is due to finalising the strategic investment programme in 2019 and lower restructuring charges.\n\n| Special items (\u20ac million)                                   | 2020   |   2019 |       | H2 2020   | H1 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Strategic investment programme                              | -      |   11.1 | -100% | -         | -         |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions | 6.2    |    6.2 | -     | 3.1       | 3.1       |\n| Restructuring charges                                       | 1.6    |    2.8 | -43%  | 1.6       | -         |\n| Special items                                               | 7.8    |   20.1 | -61 % | 4.7       | 3.1       |\n\nThe decrease is related to lower marketing costs, as well as travel expenses due to Covid-19 and IT project costs. IT project expenses amounted to \u20ac15.3 million (2019: \u20ac19.7 million). Regulatory costs decreased by \u20ac0.5 million to \u20ac11.1 million in 2020. This item consists of supervisory costs, the deposit guarantee scheme, the single resolution fund and Belgian banking tax.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nDepreciation and amortisation fell to \u20ac17.2 million, mainly as a result of book profit realised on the sale of one of our former office buildings (\u20ac2.3 million).\n\n## Efficiency ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio - i.e. the ratio of operating expenses (excluding costs incurred for our strategic investment programme, amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions and restructuring charges) to income from operating activities - deteriorated to 85.7% in 2020 from 75.5% in 2019. This fall was mainly driven by the loss on our structured products activities.",

Our effective tax rate is lower than the general Dutch tax rate of 25% due to\n\nincome from our private equity portfolio being covered by equity exemption rules.

The coupon on this bond is 6.75%. These securities count as Tier 1 qualifying capital when determining capital adequacy. Profit attributable to noncontrolling interests of \u20ac0.1 million in 2020 decreased compared with 2019 due to discontinuing the management investment plan for selected staff at Kempen (Kempen MIP) as of 2020, as a result of the merger of Van Lanschot NV and Kempen & Co NV into Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV.\n\nWe will propose to pay a 2020 cash dividend to Van Lanschot Kempen shareholders of \u20ac0.70 per share, with a pay-out ratio of 65% based on the underlying net result attributable to shareholders (2019: \u20ac1.45, pay-out ratio of 57%). The pay-out ratio based on the net result attributable to shareholders amounts to 67% (2019: 64%). Payment of 2020 dividend will be made in two parts. The 2019 dividend pay-out was postponed at the request of DNB and ECB. It remains reserved on the balance sheet and is not included in our CET 1 capital. We aim to pay out the dividend when allowed by the authorities, which will not be before 30 September 2021.\n\n## Client assets\n\n| Client assets (\u20ac billion)            |   31/12/2020 |   31/12/2019 | 30/6/2020   |   30/6/2020 | 30/6/2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Client assets                        |        115   |        102   | 13 %        |       103.4 | 11 %        |\n| Assets under management              |         99   |         87.7 | 13 %        |        89.2 | 11 %        |\n| Savings and deposits                 |         10.1 |          9.5 | 6 %         |         9.8 | 3 %         |\n| Assets under monitoring and guidance |          3.2 |          3.1 | 2 %         |         3.2 | 1 %         |\n| Assets under administration          |          2.7 |          1.6 | 68 %        |         1.2 |             |\n| Client assets                        |        115   |        102   | 13 %        |       103.4 | 11 %        |\n| Private Banking                      |         38.6 |         34.2 | 13 %        |        33.1 | 17 %        |\n| Evi                                  |          1.6 |          1.5 | 2 %         |         1.6 | -3 %        |\n| Asset Management                     |         73.7 |         65.1 | 13 %        |        67.8 | 9 %         |\n| Other                                |          1.3 |          1.2 | 8 %         |         0.9 | 40 %        |\n\nTotal client assets had risen by 13% to \u20ac115.0 billion at year-end 2020, driven by growth in assets under management of \u20ac11.3 billion as a result of net inflow and positive market performance, at both Private Banking and Asset Management.",

The acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers led to an increase in client assets of \u20ac2.0 billion. Positive market performance reflects recovery of the markets from the dip as a result of Covid-19.\n\nAt the end of 2020, assets under discretionary management made up 55% of total assets under management, which is the same as 2019. Total discretionary assets under management stood at \u20ac15.5 billion (year-end 2019: \u20ac13.6 billion) and total nondiscretionary assets under management amounted to \u20ac12.5 billion (year-end 2019: \u20ac11.2 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evi van Lanschot\n\nAssets under management grew by \u20ac0.2 to \u20ac1.2 billion in 2020, mainly driven by former a.s.r. bank clients as a result of the partnership between Evi and a.s.r. bank. This led to inflow of \u20ac157 million in assets under management, \u20ac51 million in savings and approximately 7,000 new clients. Our focus is on mass-affluent clients, and we are leveraging our experience at Private Banking to further strengthen the proposition and increase efficiency.\n\nWe are actively discouraging savings at Evi, and saw a downward trend in 2020. Starting in 2021 in Belgium, Evi products are being fully integrated into Van Lanschot Belgium's proposition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kempen Asset Management\n\nAssets under management at Asset Management rose to \u20ac70.5 billion, with positive market performance of \u20ac3.1 billion. Fiduciary mandates showed a strong inflow of \u20ac6.0 billion, thanks to new mandates including some in the UK.\n\nInvestment strategies saw net outflows of \u20ac0.6 billion. A proportion of this was down to our credit strategies product - as some of the team left (which was handled well inhouse) - and clients made certain strategic investment choices. The High Dividend Equity Fund is likewise facing an outflow, with clients diverting their assets to growth stocks and sustainable strategies. In parallel, the year also saw robust inflow into the Sustainable Value Creation Funds and Global Small-cap Fund. For more information on the performance of our investment strategies, see page 55.\n\nTotal client assets at Asset Management stood at \u20ac73.7 billion at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: \u20ac65.1 billion).",

Private Banking mortgages increased to \u20ac6.0 billion (2019: \u20ac5.9 billion) and make up 71% of our loan portfolio (2019: 68%), primarily to high net-worth individuals.\n\nThe weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (based on foreclosure value) remained stable at 75%.\n\nOther Private Banking loans comprise loans to high networth individuals as well as business loans that fit into the Private Banking relationship model. These other loans fell to \u20ac1.8 billion (year-end 2019: \u20ac1.9 billion), due to a decrease in current accounts (of one large client in particular).\n\nIn the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we decided to grant moratoria and coronavirus-specific loans to clients. Only a limited number of clients decided to make use of these, with \u20ac5.3 million of new coronavirus-related exposure at yearend 2020, granted to 93 clients. The majority of these loans and moratoria were granted as new current account loans, with some as short-term loans or by raising existing limits.",

It is intended to supplement our investment portfolio and enable us to generate attractive returns on available liquidity. It accounts for 6% of our total loan portfolio, with a volume of \u20ac0.5 billion.\n\n## Provisions\n\nWe take provisions for the impaired loans in our loan book. Impaired loans totalled \u20ac186 million at the end of 2020, and decreased by 20% compared with 2019 (2019:\n\n\u20ac234 million). The Stage 3 provisions for these loans amounted to \u20ac52 million, working out at a coverage ratio of 28%. The total impaired ratio improved from 2.7% to 2.2% at the end of 2020, as impairments decreased faster than the total loan portfolio, and the total coverage ratio rose from 23% to 28%. The impaired ratio of Private Banking loans decreased from 1.7% to 1.6%, mainly due to a decline in impaired mortgage loans. This decrease is a combination of both write-offs and releases.\n\nThe coverage ratio for mortgages fell from 10% to 6%. The impaired ratio for Corporate Banking loans decreased to 29.4% (year-end 2019: 31.6%). The coverage ratio of Corporate Banking loans increased to 26% (year-end 2019: 13%).\n\n| Provision as at 31/12/2020 (\u20ac million)   | Loan portfolio   | Impaired loans   | Provision   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2020   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2020   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2019   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mortgages                                | 6,032            | 51               | 3           | 0.8%                          | 6%                            | 1.0%                          | 10%                           |\n| Other loans                              | 1,809            | 77               | 34          | 4.2%                          | 44%                           | 3.8%                          | 49%                           |\n| Private Banking loans                    | 7,841            | 128              | 37          | 1.6%                          | 29%                           | 1.7%                          | 31%                           |\n| Corporate Banking loans                  | 195              | 57               | 15          | 29.4%                         | 26%                           | 31.6%                         | 13%                           |\n| Mortgages distributed by third parties   | 476              | 1                | 0           | 0.2%                          | 2%                            | 0.1%                          | 2%                            |\n| Total                                    | 8,512            | 186              | 52          | 2.2%                          | 28%                           | 2.7%                          | 23%                           |\n| Provision                                | -64              |                  |             |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total                                    | 8,448            |                  | 52          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| ECL Stage 1 and 2 (IFRS 9)               |                  |                  | 12          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total ECL (IFRS 9)                       |                  |                  | 64          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n\n## Capital management\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the ECB and DNB, payment of dividends will be postponed.

        "page_content": "## RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic impacted us in many different ways. Most notably, the (partial) lockdown in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland resulted in most people in our organisation working from home.\n\nFinancial markets in March and April reacted in a very volatile way, followed by a surprisingly strong rebound.\n\nLastly, the real economy fell into a sharp recession, albeit the impact differed significantly between sectors, while governments cushioned the impact by intervening with major economic support  packages.\n\n## Low interest rate environment\n\nThe low interest rate environment has been amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic, while monetary authorities have reacted to economic uncertainty by further easing their already loose monetary policies. This has been mainly through asset purchase programmes, further expanding their balance sheets, and more forward guidance on policy rates to signal that interest rates will remain low for a long period. At certain times during 2020, the entire euro swap curve was below 0%. This development continues to have a negative influence on our net interest income.\n\n## Change capacity\n\nIn this rapidly changing world, organisations only survive if they have sufficient change capacity. However, changes in processes, targets and people in most cases lead to temporarily increased risks.\n\n## Cybercrime and IT security\n\nOur IT systems are the backbone of our organisation. Managing the security and availability of these systems is therefore crucially important to us.\n\n## Financial crime\n\nCompliance risk related to financial crime prevention remained a focal point for Van Lanschot Kempen in 2020 from both internal and external perspectives. Externally, 2020 has brought changes to our regulatory landscape once again, including the fifth and sixth anti-money laundering (AML) directives.\n\n## Actions\n\nEarly on, we activated our crisis management governance structure with a Crisis Management Team and a Crisis Support Team. Preparations for lockdown were made in an early phase, by testing IT capacity and security for a situation in which nearly all staff would need to work from home. Infrastructure for more complicated functions (i.e. dealing room staff) was prepared before the actual lockdown took place. Regular staff communication on various topics (i.e. increased cyber risk while working from home) as well as other actions meant that our business experienced no operational issues.\n\nExceptional volatility in the financial markets caused higher than expected losses for structured products activities, while market illiquidity made it impossible to execute our normal macro-hedging strategy. Hedging of a significant portion of the risks, new limits and stress tests, and a gradual winding down of remaining market risks in the portfolio have all led to a lower risk profile for the structured products activities.\n\nA complete risk assessment of credit risks in the portfolio has been carried out, with special attention paid to highly impacted sectors and borrowers who asked for a temporary adjustment of their interest and redemption schedules. The impact on the portfolio at the end of 2020 was limited.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe expanded the range of client deposits that are subject to negative interest rates. In April, we lowered the negative interest rate threshold to balances over \u20ac1 million, followed by a further decrease to balances over \u20ac500,000 in October. Starting in January 2021, we introduced the so-called wealth management arrangement through which we offer our clients with AuM at our bank the possibility to keep a certain amount of their assets invested with us in cash, without being charged a negative interest rate. We terminated the client deposit proposition of Evi in Belgium. These deposits will flow out in 2021.\n\n## Actions\n\n- -New methodologies were developed for project risk management;\n\nVarious improvements were made to mitigate the risks attached to major change processes:\n\n- -A risk framework for continuous change in Agile/DevOps was implemented;\n- -Value chain assessments were executed on all major value chains to improve the stability and control of these processes, making them more resilient to change.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2020, we continued improving the security and availability of our IT systems using a structured approach, managed by the Security 5.0 programme. Many changes, large and small, have been implemented to increase our resilience against unwanted downtime and/or security threats.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe have devoted, and continue to devote, substantial resources to strengthening our compliance framework, including anti-financial crime, and our Compliance department. The Executive Board established a group-wide project to enhance our anti-financial crime framework as well as our policies, procedures and controls. We are currently well positioned to implement the enhancements identified by the project. We have also strengthened the composition of the Compliance department in 2020 by hiring additional senior compliance experts, including a new head of antifinancial crime.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\n- 1. Physical risks: These refer to the financial impact of a changing climate, including more frequent extreme weather events and gradual changes in climate, as well as environmental degradation, such as air, water and land pollution.\n\nWe have identified two types of risk relating to climate change:\n\n- 2. Transition risks: These result from the process of adjustment towards a carbon-neutral economy. These adjustments are driven by changes in climate-related policies, new low-carbon technologies and/or shifting market sentiments.\n\nClimate change is an external risk and can be a driver of conventional risk types, in particular credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational and/or liability risk. The failure to appropriately address these risks may also directly impact our financial performance.\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Risk profile and risk appetite\n\nHistorically, we have sought to achieve a solid risk profile expressed in transparent risk levels coupled with a robust liquidity and capital position. The risks we face are outlined in the following sections. More detailed descriptions can be found in the financial statements, where these risks are also quantified, wherever possible, in terms of their impact on Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nWe evaluate our risk appetite annually, and this is then communicated in a risk appetite statement containing both qualitative and quantitative elements. Our risk appetite represents our willingness to accept the risk of particular losses, decreasing buffers and reputational risks, and as such sets our operating boundaries. We use the loss absorption capacity (maximum acceptable level of losses) for the calibration of these boundaries. The statement is prepared by the Executive Board and is subject to the Supervisory Board's approval.\n\nTargets and risk limits are more dynamic and may occasionally be reviewed, at least annually. That said, we do not change the key principles that underlie our risk appetite and that create the framework within which we operate:\n\n- -We only take risks that - directly or indirectly - serve our strategic objectives;\n- -We only take risks that we understand and can explain;\n- -The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our riskbearing capacity;\n- -We do not take any risks that could materially harm our reputation;\n- -When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account;\n- -Our risk appetite should be considered in all business decisions at every level of the organisation;\n- -We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches.\n\nA risk dashboard and progress report is discussed by the company's Risk Committee every quarter, as well as periodically by the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. Risk-taking is in the nature of banks; low risks are not a means to an end. For a number of reasons, it may be appropriate to accept a higher risk - either temporarily or for a prolonged period. We always consider both gross and net - i.e. after mitigating measures - risk positions, paying extra attention to high risks.\n\n## Actions\n\nGiven our business activities, the key metric used to measure and manage our (potential) climate-related risks is carbon emissions. Since 2016, we have been calculating and reporting on our balance sheet-related carbon emissions, mainly for mortgage loans, other loans and proprietary investments. For mortgages, we have set a carbon reduction target. From 2017 onwards, we have been calculating carbon emissions relating to our assets under management. And in 2020, we also set reduction targets for these emissions, including our asset management activities at Kempen Asset Management, in line with the Paris Agreement. See the section \"Climate change risk\" for further details.\n\nThe risk appetite and risk in 2020 for each individual risk type at year-end 2020 are shown in this simplified version of the risk dashboard below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk dashboard     | Low   | Medium   | High   |\n|--------------------|-------|----------|--------|\n| Strategic risk     |       | \u2610\ue113       |        |\n| Credit risk        | \u2610\ue113    |          |        |\n| Market risk        | \u2610     |          | \ue113      |\n| Liquidity risk     | \u2610\ue113    |          |        |\n| Interest rate risk | \u2610\ue113    |          |        |\n| Operational risk   | \ue113     | \u2610        |        |\n| Information risk   | \ue113     | \u2610        |        |\n\n\u2610\n\nRisk appetite\n\n\ue113\n\nRisk in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf we compare the risks in 2020 with our risk appetite, we remained well within our risk appetite for all risk categories, with the exception of market risk. We have a low appetite for market risk, but the extremely volatile conditions in 2020 and the illiquidity of hedging products related to our structured products activities resulted in temporary positions and losses well above our risk appetite. Several measures have been taken to bring the market risk profile in line with our risk appetite.\n\nWe operate our risk framework in accordance with the 'three lines of defence' model. The management teams at individual departments and units (the first line) are responsible for managing their specific risks. The Risk Management department and the Compliance department (the second line) support management by facilitating risk assessments, writing policies, providing relevant advice and assistance on applicable regulatory requirements and the design of controls and mitigating actions, providing reports, and challenging the first line on the management of their risks. The Internal Audit department (the third line) monitors whether the activities of the first and second line are effectively mitigating the risks identified. Lastly, we use insurance to cover certain remaining risks.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is defined as the risk to Van Lanschot Kempen's performance, resulting from failure to respond adequately to changes in external factors or from poor strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities, as well as public opinion. Keeping up with technological developments and fintech is also a key topic on our strategic agenda. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low interest rates puts pressure on our net interest income.",

        "page_content": "Other important elements are the capacity to meet all specific regulatory and client demands, the consequences of operating in specific niche markets, and the risks associated with a relatively small-scale organisation. We use a range of performance indicators - such as growth in assets under management, net result, efficiency ratio and FTE trends together with a qualitative assessment to monitor and control strategic risk. Due to the challenging environment both economically and in terms of technological developments, our strategic risk remains at a medium level. The technological improvements we have made for our clients and to our internal processes over recent years show that we are continuously aware of, and acting to solve, this challenge. Finally, through our acquisitions in recent years, we are actively addressing the risk of consolidation in the sector, and are improving our economies of scale.\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is still one of our most significant financial risk types, but the further run-down of our Corporate Banking loan book has resulted in a much lower risk profile. Covid-19 may increase the risks in the portfolio, but we started the crisis with a very solid portfolio that has been performing very well despite the increasing risk in our external environment. Our loan portfolio amounts to \u20ac8.5 billion and has manageable risks; 76% of the loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans. We aim to keep the size of the Private Banking residential mortgage portfolio at least constant (or with modest growth) by generating enough new business to offset repayments and prepayments. New mortgages are primarily provided to Private Banking clients who also hold assets under management with Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nCredit quality in general further improved in 2020, despite Covid-19 potentially affecting the significant financial buffers most of our clients have, because the majority of the loan book consists of mortgages. In 2020, loan losses continued to reach historically low levels. In order to monitor and measure credit risks for most of our loan portfolios, we use sophisticated risk models (internal ratings-based (IRB) approach). As observed in 2019, we are seeing positive rating migration in nearly all portfolios as an additional indicator of improved credit quality. Our loan portfolio and credit risks are concentrated in the Netherlands (95%); lending in Belgium and Switzerland is limited, and mainly involves Lombard loans with low risk profiles.\n\nLoan portfolio, excluding provision (100% = \u20ac8.5 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough our exposure to the Dutch housing market is fairly significant, the concentration risk on single line items in the overall loan portfolio is relatively limited. The ten largest loans to individual counterparties, other than financial institutions, totalled \u20ac180 million at year-end 2020, compared with \u20ac280 million at year-end 2019. 97.5% of all borrowers held loans of less than \u20ac10 million at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: 96%). Our policy is to keep credit-risk limits on a single debtor at an acceptable level in order to contain concentration risk and to mitigate its potential impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's results (see page 130 in the financial statements for more information).\n\n## Responsible policies\n\nWe have a responsible lending policy that takes environmental and social impact into consideration. The policy ensures periodic sustainability screening (due diligence), via a risk filter, of all existing and new corporate loans, and includes factors such as human rights, social and labour issues, environment, anti-corruption and bribery. The screening did not identify any new material sustainability issues in the portfolio during 2020. The number of potentially high-risk borrowers totalled nine by year-end 2020 (2019: 17). We continue to talk to these borrowers about specific sustainability risks and how they could be mitigated. For more information on this policy and its results, see our sustainability supplement and vanlanschotkempen.com/en/ sustainability/core-banking-activities.\n\nA decade ago, a separate policy was created to assess the sustainability of financial institutions with which Van Lanschot Kempen has a banking relationship (vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/core-bankingactivities). This policy aims to prevent the risk that client assets find their way - through interbank loans or investments, for example - to institutions with weak or nonexistent sustainability policies. Van Lanschot Kempen challenges financial institutions that have not developed sufficiently visible policies. In 2020, there was no need to challenge any financial institutions in our portfolio, as they all complied with our policy.\n\nAfter seven annual audits by Forum Ethibel (see forumethibel.org), we decided to end their yearly balance sheet-related sustainability audit in 2020 on the basis that it no longer delivered new insights or scope for further improvement. Their AuM-related audit continued, resulting in us receiving the Forum Ethibel sustainability certificate once again.\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nAt year-end, 76% of our loan portfolio consisted of mortgages. Our portfolio differs from that of other Dutch mortgage lenders in that the average loan (approximately \u20ac507,000) is higher. This makes the portfolio a little more sensitive to a fall in underlying house prices, although the majority of our exposure is in urban areas - generally a more liquid segment of the housing market. In 2020, house prices in the Netherlands again increased significantly across the country; the portfolio's weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, based on foreclosure value, therefore decreased to 74% at year-end, compared with 76% at year-end 2019. New issuances are in general issued for LTVs between 75% and 90%.",

        "page_content": "In 2015, we started to provide mortgages through a network of intermediaries, branded as Hypotrust and with Quion as our service provider for our white-label mortgages. Since then, we have built up a white-label portfolio with good risk characteristics and with very few loan losses. Our whitelabel mortgages are subject to strict acceptance criteria, and the size of this portfolio amounted to \u20ac476 million by yearend 2020 (year-end 2019: \u20ac553 million). This portfolio has decreased and now makes up 6% of the total loan portfolio.\n\nClients with potentially declining incomes (e.g. due to retirement), and who are exposed to the risk of interest-only mortgages that will mature in the next 10-15 years, are actively assisted by us to limit the risk of not being able to pay off their loans at maturity date. In general, their LTVs are below 100%, making the credit risk of the loans acceptable. However, if a decline in clients' income prevents the loan being rolled over at maturity, we enter into early discussions with them. In this way, we increase awareness among clients and try to avoid potentially difficult situations. In the first half of 2020, we started the \"interest-only mortgage project', the aim of which is to enable clients to make conscious choices about their interest-only mortgages. To this end, we provide insights into the status of their mortgage and its future affordability and flexibility. All clients with interest-only mortgages (including investment-based mortgages) are plotted on a matrix based on guidelines from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The matrix is based on the loan-to-value ratio in combination with the remaining financial term, term to retirement, or end of tax deductibility. The clients with the highest risk are the first to be approached personally.\n\n## Mortgage loans: new production by type (%)\n\n100\n\nMortgage loan-to-value (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMortgage loans: remaining gross business per year (\u20ac million) compared with house price trends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the same category are commercial activities that fit into Private Banking's relationship model, such as funding investments for family businesses, business professionals and executives, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. These kinds of loans are supplementary to our wealth management strategy and typically involve bringing in assets under management. Our aim is to keep the size of this portfolio stable. The average loan size is approximately \u20ac153,000.\n\nOther Private Banking loans: type of loan (100% = \u20ac1.8 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Banking loans\n\nSince 2019, the remaining part of our Corporate Banking loan portfolio has been integrated within Private Banking, because the size, complexity and risks of the portfolio no longer justified a separate department. The winding down of this portfolio continued in 2020, despite Covid-19. The total portfolio amounted to \u20ac195 million at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: \u20ac318 million). The remaining SME loan portfolio (\u20ac86 million) is well diversified, with no dominant sector and with very limited exposure to pandemic-affected sectors such as hospitality and leisure. The average loan size\n\namounted to \u20ac1.06 million at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: \u20ac1.07 million).\n\nOur legacy portfolio of Corporate Banking real estate loans further declined to \u20ac109 million in 2020. It is still well diversified, and consists of a balanced portfolio of the various property classes - offices, residential, retail and commercial real estate. The average loan size of our real estate loans amounted to \u20ac1.6 million at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: \u20ac1.8 million). Average LTV ratios improved to 59% (year-end 2019: 62%).\n\n## Real estate loans\n\nOur real estate loans, both those provided to Private Banking clients and the legacy portfolio of Corporate Banking, amount to \u20ac331 million (2019: \u20ac446 million). These loans are provided primarily on the basis of a total quality assessment of the borrowers. We also take into account the quality and sustainability of the property, and the diversification and stability of the rental flows. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is calculated so that we can determine the extent to which a client will be able to make interest and principal payments from the rental income generated by their commercial real estate. At year-end 2020, 86.3% of our real estate loans generated sufficient rental income to cover interest and principal payments, i.e. had a DSCR of over 1 (year-end 2019: 82.9%). Clients with a DSCR of less than 1 often have other income-generating assets they can use to service their loan obligations. Lastly, the LTV of real estate loans also improved as a result of increasing real estate prices, despite the economic situation caused by the exceptional circumstances related to Covid-19.\n\n## Impaired loans\n\nImpaired loans are loans for which a provision has been taken. The impact of Covid-19 on our portfolio was closely monitored throughout the year. At year-end, the impact on our portfolios was relatively limited. This is mostly due to the composition of the portfolio (mainly mortgages and limited corporate exposure), coupled with our core clients having significant financial buffers - meaning the majority will only be significantly impacted if the crisis is prolonged.",

The majority of these clients already started to repay their loans in 2020.\n\nImpaired loans accounted for 2.2% of the loan portfolio at the end of 2020 (year-end 2019: 2.7%). In 2020, a provision equal to 28% of impaired loans was taken (2019: 23%), resulting in specific provisions totalling \u20ac52 million. In 2020, we added \u20ac1.9 million to provisions (2019: a release of \u20ac12.1 million).\n\nDuring 2020, we saw some migration from IFRS 9 credit quality Stages 1 and 2 to Stage 3, but in general the impact was relatively limited. This impact was cushioned by government interventions to support companies affected by Covid-19, which are distorting the \"true\" risks in the portfolio. With extensive client monitoring and sector analyses resulting in management adjustments of the stage classification of some clients (amounting to \u20ac4.9 million in total) we compensated for this effect. See page 133 in the financial statements for more details.\n\nFor more information about credit risk, please refer to the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 2, 'Credit risk'.\n\n## Market risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is exposed to market risk through client-facilitating transactions. Our Treasury department performs structured product transactions for clients, while Kempen Merchant Banking performs equity transactions for clients and provides market liquidity, which may result in trading positions. The same applies at Van Lanschot Private Banking regarding transactions in interest-related and foreign currency products. Temporary positions may arise from our efforts to facilitate our clients' requests. We invest in our own funds to support Kempen Asset Management, in order to align our interests with those of our clients. The Risk Management department monitors market risks on a daily basis.\n\nAs a result of exceptional market volatility and illiquidity at the end of Q1 caused by the pandemic, losses on hedge activities related to structured products were significant. The embedded derivatives in the structured products sold to our clients are hedged by Van Lanschot Kempen. The derivatives sold are not hedged back-to-back, but are macro-hedged per risk driver. The total macro exposure per risk driver is calculated and hedged using relatively simple (mostly listed) options. All risk drivers have individual limits and are monitored daily by Risk Management. Macro-hedging assumes that if the underlying risk drivers (equity, interest rate and currency markets) change, the hedges can be adjusted in a timely manner to keep the portfolio balanced. The exceptional volatility in March led to unforeseen illiquidity in the financial markets. It was therefore not always possible for us to adjust the hedges fast enough. This led to a significant increase in hedging costs. In addition to exceptional volatility, the changes in dividend yield and lending spread were also very steep, further contributing to the losses. Adjustments have been made to limit the market risk exposure going forward. The portfolio will be gradually de-risked over the next three years, while new notes will be hedged back-to-back, thereby eliminating these risks.\n\nFor further information on market risk, see Section 3, 'Market risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nOur wealth management business model naturally comes with a large client deposits base. These entrusted funds grew from \u20ac9.5 billion to \u20ac10.1 billion in 2020, despite the fact that we charged negative interest rates. Covid-19 has had a net positive impact on client deposits, in line with our peers in the Netherlands. Our December 2020 loan-todeposit ratio amounts to 83%, which reflects the fact that our client deposit base exceeds our client loan book volume.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of this, our reliance on other funding sources is limited, and our liquidity risk profile is mostly driven by the potential occurrence of unanticipated deposit outflows. Although our deposit base has not resulted from a competitive pricing policy and has proven to be sticky over time, there is always a risk of unexpected outflows, particularly for balances not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). We take a cautious approach to liquidity risk, and aim to hold solid liquidity buffers that would allow us to absorb severe unexpected liquidity stress situations. Outcomes of liquidity stress tests, which cover acute and persistent liquidity stress, are discussed by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) on a monthly basis. Due to our strong liquidity buffer, stress test outcomes and other liquidity indicators such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) remained well within limits throughout the year. At year-end 2020, the LCR and NSFR stood at 177.4% and 161.8% respectively (2019: 156.9% and 154.4%).\n\nOur liquidity risk management practices are outlined in our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP), which is assessed by our supervisory authority De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) every year. DNB considers our liquidity and funding risk management to be adequate for a company of the size and complexity of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe main funding and liquidity planning objective remains to reduce the impact of excess liquidity on net interest income, while maintaining a solid liquidity cushion and sufficient funding diversification. Although our loan portfolio could be entirely funded by client deposits, we aim to keep sufficient diversification in our funding mix in terms of funding type and maturity by supplementing the savings and deposits base with secured debt instruments that are issued under the Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond (CPTCB) programme. Due to our structurally high liquidity buffer, we did not issue any new benchmark wholesale debt instruments in 2020.",

        "page_content": "As we saw a potential increase in liquidity risk due to the market turmoil at the outset of the pandemic, we participated in one of the tenders of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) III programme, for an amount of \u20ac400 million. The favourable conditions of the TLTRO offered us the opportunity to strengthen our liquidity cushion as a precaution for potential future negative developments, without affecting our net interest income.\n\nTotal outstanding volume under the CPTCB programme remained at \u20ac1.5 billion throughout 2020. We do not have any benchmark-size unsecured debt issuances placed with investors. Redemptions in 2021 are very limited, with no benchmark-size instruments maturing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nOur investment portfolio totalled \u20ac5.5 billion at year-end 2020, up from \u20ac4.4 billion at year-end 2019. It is maintained primarily for liquidity purposes, and consists mainly of liquid, low-risk instruments. The composition of the portfolio was relatively stable in 2020. There are strict limits on instrument types, counterparties, countries, ratings and credit spread risk. Despite lower yields and spreads, we maintained a liquid, low-risk investment portfolio in line with our investment policy. Even at the peak of Covid-19 market turmoil, the impact on the portfolio's value was mild.\n\nIn addition to day-to-day portfolio management, we review our investment portfolio annually to ensure it meets our environmental, social and governance criteria. We have not encountered any material sustainability issues in our investment portfolio to date.\n\n## Investment portfolio and liquidity by counterparty (100% = \u20ac5.5 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment portfolio and liquidity by credit rating (100% = \u20ac5.5 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on our liquidity risk profile, see Section 9, 'Liquidity risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIn 2020, interest rates remained very low and even declined marginally further. As a result of our increasing excess liquidity position and continued decline in net interest rate income, we expanded the range of client deposits on which we charge negative interest rates. In April, we lowered the negative interest rate threshold to balances over \u20ac1 million, followed by a further decrease to balances over \u20ac500,000 in October. Starting in January 2021, we introduced a wealth management arrangement whereby the application of negative interest rates is dependent on the volume of the client's assets under management.\n\nClient preference for long interest rate maturities for mortgages continued as a result of the flat and historically low yield curve, both for newly agreed mortgages and for interest rate resets. At year-end 2020, approximately 9% of the mortgage portfolio consisted of loans with remaining fixed-rate terms longer than ten years. In total, only 2.6% of the mortgage portfolio had floating rate terms at year-end 2020.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, clients held their balances in variable-rate accounts (current accounts, savings and securities accounts). Given that these products have similar features and offer equal interest rates in the current environment, we observe that clients are becoming more indifferent as to which product they keep their balances in. Appetite for term deposits remained negligible, due to the low interest rates on these products. As of December 2020, our term deposit base amounted to only \u20ac133 million.\n\nWe manage our exposure to changing market interest rates (interest rate risk in the banking book) using both a valuebased and an income-based approach. We address longterm interest rate risk mainly via the economic value approach, which examines how movements in interest rates impact the value of our assets and liabilities. Given the current asymmetrical character of our interest rate risk exposure (mostly driven by implicit or contractual rate floors in products), we have shifted our interest rate risk management focus to a more scenario-based approach. We apply scenarios to both delta net interest income scenarios and economic value changes, and have set risk appetite limits for these.",

All stress scenarios remained within this limit throughout the reporting year.\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, the combination of mortgages with long interest rate maturities, funded to a large extent by a variable-rate deposit base, poses a challenge: there is less room to adjust client loan rates if future funding costs rise. This risk is inherent to the banking business model and more prevalent in the current interest rate environment.\n\nFor more information on interest rate risk, see Section 8, 'Interest rate risk', in the risk management section of the financial statements.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nNon-financial risks comprise operational, information, compliance and climate change risks.\n\nWe have defined a non-financial risk appetite. On a quarterly basis, the current non-financial risk exposure related to the non-financial risk appetite is discussed with senior management in the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee. In 2020, we further strengthened our nonfinancial risk management by developing risk frameworks for change processes. We also used value-chain assessments to improve knowledge and documentation on processes and reassess the key controls per value chain. In addition, we harmonised the approach to non-financial risks that is taken by the Risk and Compliance departments, resulting in an improved and harmonised risk framework. The second line of defence continues to interact closely with the businesses, aiming to encourage an increasingly risk-based approach in managing non-financial risks. Influencing human behaviour and our risk culture is a structural way of further mitigating operational risk.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. To identify and manage non-financial risks, we have created a group-wide operational risk framework. Part of this framework is a set of key business controls on the part of our value chains where residual risks are deemed to be elevated. Controls are regularly tested, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of key controls in our processes and systems. Other instruments we use for measuring and monitoring non-financial risks include incident registration, root cause analyses, risk self-assessments on both department level and value-chain level, and key risk indicators.\n\n## Information risk\n\nPreventing cybercrime remains one of our key focus areas. We are aware of the risks concerning information security and cybercrime, and we have further invested in technological and process-related measures to mitigate them. In addition to awareness programmes and staff training, we continue to develop intelligent solutions and to work closely with industry partners. We use intelligent systems to analyse the transactions in our systems and search for fraudulent activities. As part of a multi-year programme, we are gradually stepping up security measures to keep pace with the increasing cyberthreats. Dedicated teams monitor security events, including threats posted on\n\nthe dark web. We have teams that simulate cyberattacks and conduct physical penetration testing for training purposes. To monitor the risks involved in cybercrime, we have developed an integrated risk dashboard. The metrics in the dashboard are overseen by the interdepartmental Information Security Board. Issues related to cybercrime are reported directly to the board.\n\nFor the continuation of operational processes during potential disruptions, threats and incidents, we have business continuity measures in place. These include a policy, a governance structure with a Business Continuity Committee and Crisis Management Team, and working instructions. Moreover, multiple tests are performed during the year to assess whether these measures work in practice.\n\nFor more information about operational risk, please refer to the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 4, 'Operational risk'.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen maintains an independent and effective Compliance department to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk. This means the risk of failure by Van Lanschot Kempen to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures and industry standards relevant for Van Lanschot Kempen and/or to undertake (or fail to undertake) those activities prohibited or mandated under applicable regulations. In addition, we have put in place policies, procedures, systems and controls necessary to manage compliance risk.\n\nThe Compliance department is headed up by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chairman of the Statutory Board. The Compliance department fulfils its responsibilities by providing advice and assistance to Van Lanschot Kempen committees and management teams, including the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, and by continuously monitoring adherence to regulations within the company's day-to-day operations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has devoted, and continues to devote, substantial resources to strengthening the compliance framework and Compliance department. The Executive Board has established a group-wide project to enhance the firm's anti-financial crime framework and its policies, procedures and controls. Van Lanschot Kempen is currently well positioned to implement the enhancements identified by this overarching project.\n\nThe Compliance department has continued to enhance the compliance framework through dedicated efforts to strengthen the firm's policies and procedures across business lines, as well as through the compliance risk management programme. We have also continued the development and rollout of the dedicated compliance training programme for employees. The Compliance department was strengthened in 2020 by hiring additional senior compliance experts, including a new head of antifinancial crime, and by establishing a compliance management team. Further optimising the compliance framework is part of Van Lanschot Kempen's strategic roadmap.",

        "page_content": "Lastly, in 2019 and 2020, specific parts of Kempen & Co (part of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management as of 1 January 2020) were the subject of an investigation by the AFM regarding compliance with the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act (Wwft). This investigation has been concluded by the AFM. No formal enforcement measures have been imposed.\n\nFor more information about compliance risk, please refer to the discussion of risk management in the financial statements, Section 12, 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Climate change risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's risk management and control system is specifically designed to manage internal and external risks. Climate change falls into the category of external risks. The balance sheet-related risks are reported to the Risk Committee every quarter. The Risk Committee comprises all Executive Board members and the Director of Risk Management. If climate change is deemed to be a material risk for Van Lanschot Kempen, it will be discussed in this committee. Mitigation of climate change risk will be further investigated in 2021 - for example, by setting up an ESG governance framework and determining concrete objectives.\n\nFor our assets under management, the ESG Council is the highest governance body regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. This Council is chaired by a member of the management team of Kempen Asset Management, and comprises various senior investment specialists from Asset Management, such as the Chief Investment Officer and the Director of Impact & Responsible Investment. In 2020, the ESG Council updated and strengthened the company's climate change policy.\n\nThe execution of the climate change policy, related to both our balance sheet and our assets under management, is the responsibility of the Sustainability Centre, together with the portfolio managers within Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nSince 2016, we have been calculating and reporting on our balance sheet-related carbon emissions, mainly for mortgage loans, other loans and proprietary investments. We periodically assess the risk of climate change on our lending activities, in terms of both physical risks and transition risks. At Van Lanschot Private Banking, the most important lending portfolio is our mortgage portfolio. While some climate change risks to this portfolio exist (e.g. financing homes below sea level), we assess that the chances of these risks materialising are considerably lower than other credit risk factors. As a result, no separate restrictions are used when granting new mortgages. We are working to improve the energy efficiency of the homes and other types of property we finance. For example, we offer the Van Lanschot Groenhypotheek (green mortgage), which provides financing at reduced interest rates to clients who are looking to make their homes more sustainable. We see limited climate change risk in our corporate lending business, mainly because of the regional and sectoral characteristics of this portfolio, as well as the winding down of our Corporate Banking activities.\n\nSo far, we have assessed the potential impact of a global temperature increase of 2\u00b0C or less on our balance sheet and performance to be small: we have no material climatesensitive assets on our balance sheet. We expect that rising sea levels will be countered by extra investments by the Dutch government in sea/river defence structures. Even if our operations were physically impacted due to flooding, we would be able to manage the situation as our data centres in Eindhoven and 's-Hertogenbosch (fallback) are well above sea level.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nIn our AuM activities, climate change risks are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected. As part of our responsible and sustainable investing, we also have a climate change policy that was significantly strengthened in 2020. Kempen Asset Management has now set strong targets in line with the Paris Agreement on carbon emission reduction for our investment funds, to be met by 2025, 2030 and 2050 respectively - enabling us to cope with the transition risks related to climate change. This also indicates resilience to physical climate change risks, as the companies in these investment funds will take climate change into account. As physical risks will likely materialise more in certain regions and sectors (with physical assets) than others, we have started to gather physical climate data down to asset level for our Kempen real estate portfolios from a specialised climate data provider. We will continue to include climate data in our investment process in 2021.\n\nSince 2017, we have been calculating and reporting on carbon emissions relating to our assets under management. In 2018, we also started to perform scenario analyses on our assets under management, using the 2DII tool (see 2degrees-investing.org). In 2019, we further improved our climate scenarios for one of our internal portfolios to assess its climate resilience compared with the benchmark. We then obtained climate change risk indicators (proxies) from our climate data provider for several internal funds and some large clients. In 2020, we further integrated climate change mitigation into our current asset allocation scenarios via GDP assumptions (i.e. scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C of global heating).\n\nFor further information, see our disclosure in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), at vanlanschotkempen.com/ results.\n\n## Regulatory impact\n\nThe increase and changes in regulations continued to pose a challenge for our organisation: Basel IV, targeted review of internal models (TRIM) and benchmark regulations, to mention just a few, all represent major changes for us going forward. In addition to new regulations, the number of data requests from regulators has also been increasing - in terms of both ad-hoc questionnaires and recurring reports. Anacredit (loan-level reporting on corporate loans), RRE (loan-level reporting on residential mortgage loans) and shorter timelines for DGS (deposit-holder information to be provided to DNB in case of bankruptcy) have all become operational.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, we continued with our Basel IV implementation, despite the postponement of the deadline. The impact of this revision to the regulatory framework on the business is still expected to be relatively limited. Our analysis includes changes to the approaches for credit risk and operational risk. Together with the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), these reforms will take effect as of 2023 with transitional arrangements. Implementing the new regulation will require substantial effort, as many definitions and reporting requirements have changed.\n\nIn October 2019, DNB announced its intention to introduce a minimum risk-weight floor for the residential mortgage loan portfolios of Dutch banks subject to the IRB approach in the autumn of 2020. This measure was postponed because of Covid-19, but was reintroduced by DNB in Q4 2020; the implementation deadline is still unknown. The measure means that Dutch banks will need to hold more capital against their mortgage portfolios. It aims to support the banks' ability to absorb the impact of a potential housing price correction. The impact on our risk-weighted assets (RWA) is estimated to be around 15% based on the current size of our portfolios and the current regulatory capital models, implying an impact on the CET 1 ratio of around 3 percentage points. DNB has indicated that the new measure will not be in addition to the Basel IV framework, which means that the impact will cease after the introduction of Basel IV.\n\n## Capital management\n\nAt the end of 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio stood at 24.3%. The 2019 dividend pay-out was postponed at the request of DNB and ECB. It remains reserved on the balance sheet and is not included in our CET 1 capital. We aim to pay out the dividend when allowed by the authorities, which will not be before September 2021. Since our CET 1 ratio remains well above our target range of 15-17%, we will continue to consider paying out excess equity capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and capital returns in the future, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we aim to engage in acquisitions, and intend to leave room for these in our capital position as well.\n\nOur total risk exposure amount (TREA) declined in 2020 by \u20ac10 million. At year-end 2020, our Tier 1 and total capital ratios stood at 25.4% (2019: 25.0%) and 27.4% (2019: 26.9%) respectively.\n\nFollowing the annual supervisory review evaluation process (SREP), DNB informed us about the capital requirements that we need to meet from January 2021 onwards. The minimum capital requirements comprise a CET 1 ratio of 7.8%, a Tier 1 ratio of 10.5%, and a total capital ratio of 13.9%. These requirements reflect the changes in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) V, allowing banks to use Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to satisfy parts of the Pillar 2 requirements (our total Pillar 2 requirement is 5.9%). This measure has already been brought forward by the ECB and DNB in response to Covid-19.\n\nIn addition to the 7.8% CET 1 SREP requirement, we are subject to overall capital requirements (OCR), which consist of combined buffer requirements and Pillar 2 guidance (P2G). Both elements must be met by CET 1 capital alone.\n\n| SREP and overall capital  requirements for 2021 (%)   | CET 1   | Tier 1   | Total  capital   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|\n| Pillar 1                                              | 4.5     | 6.0      | 8.0              |\n| Pillar 2                                              | 3.3     | 4.5      | 5.9              |\n| Total SREP capital requirement                        | 7.8     | 10.5     | 13.9             |\n| Capital conservation buffer                           | 2.5     | 2.5      | 2.5              |\n| Countercyclical capital buffer                        | 0.0     | 0.0      | 0.0              |\n| Overall capital requirement                           | 10.3    | 13.0     | 16.4             |\n| Pillar 2 guidance (not disclosed)                     |         |          |                  |\n| Capital ratios as per year-end  2020                  | 24.3    | 25.4     | 27.4             |\n\nThe capital conservation buffer is currently the main element of the combined buffer requirements. It stands at 2.5% and reached its fully phased-in level in January 2019. The countercyclical buffer for the Netherlands is currently set at 0%. In its overview of financial stability, DNB indicated that it will gradually raise the countercyclical buffer to a \"neutral\" level of 2%, but only when the situation around the Covid-19 crisis and its impact on banks has been normalised. The systemic risk buffer does not apply to us. We are expected to comply with P2G by holding CET 1 capital, but P2G does not have a binding status and does not automatically restrict dividend distributions in the event of a breach.\n\nWith a CET 1 ratio of 24.3% and a total capital ratio of 27.4% at year-end 2020, we met all capital requirements, including P2G. The leverage ratio decreased to 7.1% at yearend 2020 (year-end 2019: 7.3%), well above the minimum Basel requirement of 3%.\n\nBasel IV is an important dimension in our capital planning, as is DNB's intention to temporarily impose minimum floors for residential mortgage risk weights that are derived from internal ratings-based models. Taking Basel IV and the proposed risk weight floor into account, we expect our CET 1 ratio to remain above our target range of 15-17%.\n\n## Minimum required eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nAs part of the single resolution mechanism (SRM) regulation, the National Resolution Authority has imposed an indicative MREL target on us, which is not likely to become binding before 2024. The MREL target has a loss absorption and a recapitalisation component (both 50%). Given the decline in our SREP capital requirements, we are awaiting a new MREL target before we can assess any potential gaps. Furthermore, the possible eligibility of the structured notes that we have issued to institutional investors is still unclear. We will adjust our funding planning in the run-up to 2024 in order to fill the limited MREL gap that could arise after we receive the final targets.",

We held 289,849 treasury shares at year-end 2020. Van Lanschot Kempen is included in the Amsterdam Small Cap Index and, as of 30 November 2020, in the MSCI World Small Cap index.\n\n## Shareholders and depositary receipt holders\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's shareholder base remained roughly the same during 2020. Pursuant to Chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the disclosures below have been entered in the Register of Substantial Holdings as maintained by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The percentages reflect the number of shares or depositary receipts on the register on the disclosure dates and our current number of outstanding shares.\n\nDisclosure is required once a shareholder's interest reaches, exceeds or falls below a threshold value. The current interest of a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts may consequently differ from the interest reported on the disclosure date. On 31 December 2020, Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen held over 99.99% of Van Lanschot Kempen shares.

These discussions will continue in 2021.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nOur creditworthiness is periodically assessed by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Van Lanschot Kempen maintains its high creditworthiness by deploying its assets for the benefit of its clients and by taking on only such risks as can be understood and controlled. This ensures solid risk management processes as well as a strong capital and liquidity position. Our current credit ratings reflect our healthy capital and funding position along with our low risk profile. In 2020, both S&P and Fitch revised the outlook for Van Lanschot Kempen from stable to negative, due to the exceptional circumstances related to Covid-19. At the same time, they reaffirmed our strong long-term BBB+ rating.\n\n| Credit ratings 1                 | Standard & Poor's   | Fitch Ratings    |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Long-term credit rating          | BBB+                | BBB+             |\n| Long-term credit rating  outlook | Negative outlook    | Negative outlook |\n| Short-term credit rating         | A-2                 | F2               |\n| Date of latest report            | 26 September 2019   | 6 August 2020    |\n| Date of latest press release     | 24 April 2020       | 10 July 2020     |\n\n1\n\nFour sell-side analysts - from ABN AMRO, ING, Kepler Cheuvreux and UBS respectively - actively track Van Lanschot Kempen and regularly publish equity research reports.

The result actually available for distribution is the net result adjusted for minority interests, the share of AT1 capital securities holders, and the net effect of selected special items.\n\nIn 2020, we postponed the payment of the 2019 dividend, as per the recommendation of the European Central Bank (ECB) and supported by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) not to pay out dividends in 2020. At the annual general meeting on 28 May 2020, shareholders adopted a dividend proposal of \u20ac1.45 per share. As per year-end 2020, the total amount of \u20ac59.4 million is reserved for our shareholders on the balance sheet, and is therefore not included in our capital ratios.\n\nIn 2020, the underlying net result available for distribution to shareholders amounts to \u20ac44.2 million, working out at underlying earnings per share of \u20ac1.08. 2\n\nOur strong results and solid capital position enable us to propose a dividend distribution of \u20ac0.70 per share to our shareholders (2019: \u20ac1.45 per share).

The proportion of net result attributable to shareholders that will not be paid out i.e. \u20ac14.3 million - will be added to the reserves.\n\nOn 15 December 2020, the ECB recommended that banks refrain from dividend payments or limit these to below 15% of the accumulated 2019-20 profit, provided this is not higher than 20 basis points of the CET 1 ratio until September 2021.

In addition, we may consider other avenues, under the prevailing laws and regulations, to distribute excess capital to our shareholders, including share buybacks or capital returns. These are all subject to approval by our regulator.\n\nSince 2016, we have paid out a total of over \u20ac330 million excluding our 2019 and 2020 dividends - to our shareholders in the form of both dividends and capital returns.",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nThis report gives an overview of the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2020. A description of the composition and operation of the Supervisory Board is set out in the notes on corporate governance (see page 90).\n\nThe report includes the achievement of corporate targets, the relationship with stakeholders and the relevant aspects of sustainability. It covers the internal organisation as well as the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. It also covers the annual evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members.\n\n## Supervision\n\n## Achievement of corporate targets\n\nThe Supervisory Board can reflect on an extraordinary year, which was dominated by Covid-19. The pandemic had, and continues to have, an impact on the clients and employees of Van Lanschot Kempen and on the organisation itself.\n\nDespite the pandemic, Van Lanschot Kempen's employees maintained a high level of service towards their clients, which meant that clients retained their trust in the organisation. Employees demonstrated their adaptive power through the sheer pace at which they adjusted to the new working situation, with most people working from home.\n\nReflecting the focused wealth management strategy, the underlying business proved to be strong, with high net inflow in assets under management - within both Private Banking and Asset Management - and a high number of Corporate Finance transactions completed.\n\nThe implementation of cost-saving measures as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in lower cost levels compared to 2019. The 2020 net result was impacted by significant losses on structured products activities, due to exceptional volatility and illiquidity in certain segments of the financial markets.\n\nSustainability continues to be an important topic for Van Lanschot Kempen. Adding a fifth strategic pillar, \"achieve our sustainability ambitions\", and establishing a Sustainability Centre are examples of embedding sustainability throughout the organisation. Regulators are also considering sustainability as an important topic, resulting in the EU sustainability regulations that will come into effect in 2021.\n\nAs a financial services company, complying with laws and regulations continues to be a key priority for Van Lanschot Kempen. The efforts required to operate in compliance with regulatory requirements continue to grow, and are putting a strain on the resources of the company.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's capital position was further strengthened in 2020 and remains very strong. The company followed the recommendations of the European Central Bank (ECB) and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) not\n\nto pay out any dividend or return excess capital in 2020. The proposal to pay out a dividend for 2019 was adopted by the annual general meeting in May 2020 and the dividend has been reserved on the balance sheet for shareholders.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen took an important step in its growth strategy by taking over Hof Hoorneman Bankiers. Subject to regulatory approval, Van Lanschot Kempen will continue to optimise its capital position and allow scope for potential acquisitions.\n\n## Structure and functioning of internal risk management\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's principal risks, as well as the structure and functioning of its risk management and control systems, are discussed by the Risk Committee. In 2020, the committee's chairman regularly reported its conclusions and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite statement is subject to the Supervisory Board's annual approval. The statement for 2021 was approved at the Board's December meeting. The 2021-23 capital and funding plan was also discussed and approved at the December meeting.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nFinancial reporting is discussed regularly at the Audit and Compliance Committee's meetings, which are also attended by the external auditors. In 2020, the committee paid special attention to the 2020 interim financial statements. In light of the extraordinary circumstances in 2020, we asked our external auditors to issue a review report on our half-year figures - a statement that we received on 25 August 2020. After each meeting, the chairman of the committee reports on committee discussions to the full Supervisory Board. All members of the Supervisory Board attended the Audit and Compliance Committee's meeting in 2020 at which the 2019 annual figures were discussed. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements for 2019 on 19 February 2020.\n\nThe Supervisory Board decided to propose to the annual general meeting held on 28 May 2020 that it reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) as external auditors for the 2021 financial year. The annual general meeting has reappointed PwC as external auditors for the 2021 financial year. In January 2021, the Supervisory Board decided to propose the reappointment of PwC for the 2022 financial year to the annual general meeting to be held on 27 May 2021.\n\n## Legal and regulatory compliance\n\nThe Supervisory Board is regularly provided with information on developments regarding the compliance framework; further development of the compliance programme; and group-wide projects to strengthen policies and control arrangements, especially concerning anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing, sanctions and customer due diligence processes, and the supervision of the regulatory authorities regarding compliance with regulations. The Supervisory Board was informed periodically about the ongoing implementation of new legislation and regulations such as the Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II) and the Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) - requiring intermediaries and (in their absence) the relevant taxpayer(s) to disclose",

        "page_content": "any arrangements that may potentially lead to tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance.\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly discussed Van Lanschot Kempen's relationship with its shareholders. The most important topics discussed with shareholders were the general development of Van Lanschot Kempen, the progress made on executing the company's wealth management strategy, the strategy and targets for 2023, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, Van Lanschot Kempen's strong capital base and capital strategy, and the sustainability profile and ESG approach of the company.\n\nA delegation of the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board held engagement meetings with a broad group of Van Lanschot Kempen's shareholders and other stakeholders to discuss the consequences of SRD II on the company's remuneration policy for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards. The remuneration policies for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards were approved by the annual general meeting by 93.7% and 100% of the votes cast respectively. For further information, see page 80.\n\nKarin Bergstein was appointed to the Supervisory Board by the annual general meeting on 28 May 2020 following her nomination. The Supervisory Board adopted the recommendation of the Works Council, which had used its enhanced right of recommendation for the vacancy on the Supervisory Board. Karin Bergstein attended the Works Council's meeting in September to meet with its members.\n\nIn January 2020, the Works Councils of Van Lanschot and Kempen merged to form a new, integrated Van Lanschot Kempen Works Council. Jeanine Helthuis met with the new members of the Works Council. Frans Blom, Jeanine Helthuis and Karin Bergstein attended the Works Council's meeting with the Executive Board in December, at which the general course of business at Van Lanschot Kempen was discussed. In addition, Bernadette Langius discussed the internal pay ratio in 2020 with the Works Council. The Supervisory Board values its constructive relationship with the Works Council.\n\n## Relevant aspects of sustainability\n\nIn June, the Supervisory Board discussed the consequences of the new European sustainability regulations for Van Lanschot Kempen. Topics discussed included key developments in the regulations, taxonomy, disclosure requirements, \"know-your-customer\" (including clients' ESG preferences in services), governance (including product governance), risk management and capital requirements. These new sustainability regulations are likely to change the investment landscape. The increased transparency with regard to the sustainability of investment products could raise asset owners' awareness of the importance of sustainability in their investments.\n\nBy the end of 2020, sustainability was even further integrated into the organisation. The four existing strategic pillars were extended with a fifth pillar (\"achieve our sustainability ambitions\") and a group-wide Sustainability Centre was set up to further realise this ambition. In December, the Audit and Compliance Committee was informed about developments and progress made in implementing EU sustainability regulations. In addition, the Risk Committee was informed about progress made on applying the company's responsible lending policy.\n\nBased on the way sustainability is integrated into the organisation - e.g. in policies, products and reporting - the Supervisory Board concluded that Van Lanschot Kempen has taken significant steps in the area of sustainability over the years. Given the continuous developments in this field, as well as evolution towards a more purpose-driven and valuebased leadership within companies, sustainability remains a topic that requires ongoing attention from Van Lanschot Kempen going forward.\n\n## Internal organisation\n\n## Composition of the Statutory and Executive Boards\n\nThe composition of the Statutory Board has not changed since 2014. From 2015 onwards, the Statutory Board has, in principle, been taking its decisions at the Executive Board's meetings. However, the composition of the Executive Board did change in 2020. Leni Boeren, responsible for Asset Management, stepped down as a member of the Executive Board on 12 March 2020. We are grateful to Leni for her contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen. Leni Boeren was succeeded by Erik van Houwelingen, who was appointed as a member of the Executive Board on 16 November 2020. As of that date, he was also appointed chairman of the Management Board of Kempen Capital Management. On 14 September 2020, Leonne van der Sar stepped down as a member of the Executive Board to pursue other interests. We greatly appreciate her work for Kempen Merchant Banking and thank her for her dedication to Van Lanschot Kempen in recent years. The Executive Board currently consists of Karl Guha (chairman), Constant Korthout, Arjan Huisman, Richard Bruens and Erik van Houwelingen.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we changed our organisational structure by moving from a business line-driven organisation towards a function-based model. For further information, see the section \"Our strategy\" on page 20. The new organisational structure also led to an adjustment in the areas of responsibility for most members of the Executive Board. Richard Bruens became responsible for the newly formed Client Management & Origination domain, in which we have combined all our client-focused staff and activities across our client groups. Erik van Houwelingen now leads the newly set-up Investment Strategies & Solutions domain that covers all our in-house and externally selected investment solutions and services. Arjan Huisman is responsible for Digital, Advanced Analytics & Technology as well as for Operations, which have now been centralised to streamline processes and increase efficiency. Karl Guha's portfolio was extended with Business Innovation & Development and the Sustainability Centre, while no changes were made to the portfolio of Constant Korthout.\n\nIn January 2021, Karl Guha informed the Executive and Supervisory Boards that he has decided to step down as chairman of the Statutory and Executive Boards of Van Lanschot Kempen no later than the end of the year to make way for the new generation. We respect Karl's decision and are very grateful for his large contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen and to the transformation of the firm from a universal bank to a wealth management house. Karl's timely announcement gives us room to find a suitable successor.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nWilly Duron stepped down as chairman and member of the Supervisory Board after the annual general meeting on",

We are sincerely grateful for his many years of service to Van Lanschot Kempen and his valuable contribution to the Board. Following the resignation of Willy Duron, Frans Blom, a member of the Supervisory Board since 5 October 2018, succeeded him as chairman of the Supervisory Board. Karin Bergstein was appointed as a new member of the Supervisory Board at the annual general meeting on 28 May 2020.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held 14 meetings in 2020. The Executive Board attends the formal meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting information. Regular items on the agenda of these meetings included the company's strategy, developments within the various business lines, corporate governance, risk management, IT and operations, financial results, the annual budget and HR topics. The Supervisory Board was informed regularly about the impact of Covid-19 on Van Lanschot Kempen and its employees, as well as the measures that were implemented to guarantee the continuity of (operational) processes. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed the further simplification of the legal structure of Van Lanschot Kempen through a legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV and Van Lanschot Kempen NV, the postponement of the 2019 dividend payment and the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers. Two meetings of the Supervisory Board were fully dedicated to Van Lanschot Kempen's strategy and the new organisational structure. All members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards attended these meetings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also held 14 additional meetings with Supervisory Board members only. These meetings give the Supervisory Board the opportunity to reflect on agenda items and discuss possible items that require attention in advance of the regular meetings, as well as to discuss matters such as the composition of the Statutory and Supervisory Boards and\n\nthe evaluation of how both boards are functioning. The chairman of the Executive Board was invited to attend some of these meetings, depending on the topics being discussed.\n\nAt the meeting in February, the Supervisory Board discussed the performance of the members of the Executive Board in 2019.\n\nThe table below shows the composition of Supervisory Board committees, and the attendance rate of each member of the Supervisory Board at the Board and committee meetings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received the information needed to perform its tasks from the Executive Board and the external auditors. Employees from within the organisation regularly attended meetings to provide additional information on specific topics within their respective fields. The agendas for Supervisory Board meetings were drawn up by the Company Secretary, in consultation with the chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board held a meeting off-site, to discuss the outcome of the evaluation of the functioning of the Supervisory Board itself, as well as its committees, in more detail. The Supervisory Board decided to make some changes to the composition of its committees. For further information, see page 77.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Composition of Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members. Each committee advises the Supervisory Board and prepares decision-making by the Board in its designated area of interest. These committees meet separately throughout the year. The main considerations and conclusions of the committees are shared with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board remains fully responsible for all decisions.\n\n| Composition and  attendance rate   | Supervisory Board   | Audit and  Compliance  Committee   | Risk Committee   | Selection and  Appointment  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Willy Duron 1                      | 93.3% (Chair)       | 100%                               | 100%             | 100%  (Chair)                           | 100%                      |\n| Frans Blom                         | 100% (Chair) 2      | 100% 3                             | 100% 4           | 100%  (Chair)\u00b2                          | 100% 4                    |\n| Manfred Schepers                   | 92.8%               | 100%                               | 100% (Chair)     |                                         |                           |\n| Karin Bergstein                    | 100% 5              | 100% 3                             |                  |                                         | 100% 3                    |\n| Jeanine Helthuis                   | 100%                | 100%                               |                  | 100%                                    | 100%                      |\n| Bernadette Langius                 | 92.8%               |                                    | 100%             |                                         | 100% (Chair)              |\n| Maarten Muller                     | 100%                |                                    | 100% 3           | 100%                                    | 100% 4                    |\n| Lex van Overmeire                  | 100%                | 100% (Chair)                       | 100%             |                                         |                           |",

A delegation from the Statutory Board attended these meetings. The external auditors and the directors of the Internal Audit, Compliance, and Finance, Reporting & Control departments were also present at the meetings. The Audit and Compliance Committee also met with the internal and external auditors\n\nwithout the members of the Statutory Board being present to discuss the course of affairs during the financial year.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee carried out a detailed assessment of the annual figures, half-year figures, and information used for the trading updates.

During these discussions, the committee discussed the audit scope, materiality, key audit matters and (interim) findings as reported by the auditors. In addition, the committee monitored the actions taken in response to these findings. The Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Committee on monitoring the quarterly non-financial risk reports and on key audit matters such as reliability and continuity of the IT environment and the fair value measurement of specific financial instruments. The committee reviews the external auditors' independence, communication and fees every year. On 27 January 2021, the functioning of PwC in 2020 was evaluated. The outcome of the evaluation resulted in the proposal to reappoint PwC for the 2022 financial year; the committee reached the decision to do this independently.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee followed developments in the Compliance department and the work of the Internal Audit department throughout the year. Progress on key initiatives in both departments was discussed. The annual plan and quarterly reports from the Internal Audit and Compliance departments were discussed as part of the committee's evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of Van Lanschot Kempen's governance, policy framework, risk management and internal control systems. The committee discussed the positive assessment of the Internal Audit department by DNB, the annual evaluation of the Audit Charter, and the further development of the compliance risk management framework and initiatives to further mature compliance risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen. Close attention was paid to the anti-financial crime framework targeted at compliance with obligations under anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and other relevant legislation. The committee also received detailed information on projects dedicated to further developing the anti-financial crime framework.\n\nInternal Audit reports presented the results of reviews of the risk & control framework, the implementation and operation of IT systems, the performance of IT systems, the management of the loan portfolio, and the impact of the strategy on the organisation. The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed audit findings and coverage of the audit universe. The key areas discussed included the response to Covid-19, cybercrime, digitalisation, changes in the technological landscape, the consequences of using external parties and moving IT to cloud-based solutions, the project to migrate Van Lanschot Belgium's IT infrastructure to the Dutch IT infrastructure, the transformation to an agile way of working at Kempen Asset Management, the product approval and review process (PARP), EU sustainability regulations and the possible impact of Brexit. Other specific discussion topics included the status of the replacement of IBOR as interbank rate, \"Good practices on customer tax integrity risk management\" by DNB, new developments on horizontal monitoring by the tax authorities and goodwill impairment testing.\n\nQuarterly reporting from the Compliance department covered themes such as regulatory developments, compliance risk management and monitoring, and initiatives to further strengthen the internal control systems. Information was provided on the harmonisation of policies, procedures and control arrangements across Van Lanschot Kempen to ensure the prevention of money laundering and\n\nterrorist financing. Reports by the Privacy Officer on adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) were also discussed by the Audit and Compliance Committee. Reporting on the implementation of, and adherence to, all applicable rules and regulations was provided. In addition, reports from Compliance and Internal Audit provided information about contact and communication with regulators, and the supervisory actions and reports conducted by DNB and AFM.\n\nBased on the reports by both internal and external auditors, the Audit and Compliance Committee concludes that the internal control environment is adequate for external financial reporting purposes.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nWilly Duron resigned as a member of the Risk Committee on 28 May 2020. On 24 June, Frans Blom stepped down as a member of the Risk Committee and Maarten Muller was appointed as a new member of the committee. The Risk Committee met three times in 2020. Its meetings were also attended by the CFO/CRO, CEO, Director of Risk Management and Director of Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery. The committee paid detailed attention to the credit, operational, market and interest rate risks to which the organisation is exposed.\n\nThe quarterly risk appetite reports were discussed by the Risk Committee. In all meetings, specific attention was given to reviewing whether Van Lanschot Kempen's risk profile was within the limits set in Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite. The committee discussed credit risk, execution risk of specific change projects, data management risk, cybercrime and IT risk, business continuity risk and the impact of Covid-19 on the risk profile of the organisation during its meetings. Interest rate and market risk developments were discussed based on factors including duration analyses, the development of value at risk, and stress tests. Attention was paid to cybersecurity and the risk mitigation measures and procedures that are in place, as well as developments regarding structured products activities. Extra attention was paid to IT and internal control risks during periods that the majority of employees were working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions. Preventive measures were put in place, and no major incidents occurred. The results of these measures were discussed by the Risk Committee.\n\nAs a result of significant losses on structured products activities, discussions took place about short-term extra hedging strategies and (in the medium term) changes in the target operating model. The outcomes of both discussions have been shared in the Risk Committee. The committee was also informed about risk mitigation measures and developments in several strategic projects, such as the outsourcing of payment services to Fidor and the redevelopment of the internal ratings-based (IRB) model.\n\nAt the committee's December 2020 meeting, the capital and funding plan for 2021-23 and Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite statement for 2021 were discussed. Both documents were submitted to the Supervisory Board with a positive recommendation.

This entailed additional operational risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Through strong crisis management and IT efforts, the organisation  shifted successfully to working from home. Operational stability was  sound and, after a short delay, several change projects could be  realised. Although an increase in cyberthreats was observed, no major  incidents were reported. We conclude that non-financial risks are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Robustness of IT environment Van Lanschot Kempen is dependent on its IT environment for the  reliability and continuity of its operations and financial reporting. In  2020, we successfully migrated the IT systems of our operations in  Belgium to the infrastructure of the Van Lanschot Kempen organisation  as a whole, and thus mitigated IT risks in our second domestic market  significantly. | We were informed about the progress made on the major IT projects  within Van Lanschot Kempen and their implementation so far. Despite  the challenging circumstances in the first half of 2020, several high- impact and high-risk projects were successfully completed, which  reduced risks. The migration of the Belgian IT infrastructure to the  Dutch Private Banking IT infrastructure was one of the most important                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Selection and Appointment Committee\n\nWilly Duron resigned as a member of the Selection and Appointment Committee on 28 May 2020, and Frans Blom succeeded him as chairman of the committee. The Selection and Appointment Committee met 12 times in 2020 to discuss the recruitment and selection process and succession planning for new members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the composition of the Statutory Board. The composition of the Supervisory, Statutory and Executive Boards was also discussed during the closed sessions of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nWilly Duron stepped down as a member of the Remuneration Committee in May, while Frans Blom and Maarten Muller stepped down as members of the committee in June, in line with the Supervisory Board's decision to make\n\nsome changes to its committees. Karin Bergstein was appointed as a new member of the Remuneration Committee in June. The Remuneration Committee held four meetings in 2020. Representatives of the HR department also attended the meetings. The chairman of the Executive Board was invited to attend some of the Remuneration Committee meetings, depending on the topics being discussed. At its February meeting, the committee discussed the Executive Board's KPIs for 2020. The 2019 remuneration report and the new remuneration policy of the Statutory and Supervisory Board were discussed, as was the 2019 variable remuneration paid to staff of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe amount available for variable remuneration of Van Lanschot Kempen staff for 2020 was among the topics discussed at the December meeting.",

A delegation of the Remuneration Committee held engagement meetings with a broad group of Van Lanschot Kempen's stakeholders. During these meetings, we obtained a clear understanding of their views on the implementation of SRD II and on Van Lanschot Kempen's remuneration policies for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards. The remuneration policies were amended with an explanation of our approach to remuneration. The remuneration policies for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards were put to vote at the annual general meeting on 28 May 2020 and were approved by the annual general meeting by 93.7% and 100% of the votes cast respectively. Further details on the remuneration policy of the Statutory Board can be found in the remuneration report on page 84.\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee paid specific attention to the preparation of the remuneration report, which was drawn up in accordance with the new requirements based on the law under which SRD II must be implemented. The remuneration report was submitted to the annual general meeting in May 2020 for an advisory vote, and was approved by 93.7% of the votes cast.\n\n## Assuring supervision quality\n\n## Evaluation of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board performs an annual evaluation of the functioning of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members. The evaluation is carried out under the guidance of an external adviser once every three years including in 2020. In the intervening years, the evaluation process is carried out using a questionnaire completed by each Board member. The evaluation process was carried out in December 2020 and January 2021, and included interviews with all members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards, as well as a questionnaire. The evaluation includes the participation and contribution of each member of the Supervisory Board, the knowledge and experience of the Supervisory Board collectively, the interaction and dynamics within the Supervisory Board, the communication and provision of information, the decision-making process and quality of the information provided for Supervisory Board meetings, the independence of mind of the individual members, and the relationship with the Executive Board. The outcomes and recommendations from the evaluation were discussed by the Supervisory Board during a separate meeting in February 2021; recommendations will be implemented as a result.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the Board and its committees are functioning well, and that its composition is in line with the required profile in terms of suitability, expertise and diversity, and also complies with Principle 2.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Evaluation of the Statutory and Executive Boards\n\nIn February 2021, the Supervisory Board evaluated the functioning of the Statutory and Executive Boards as a whole and that of the individual members of both boards based on the key performance indicators (KPIs) for 2020. The Supervisory Board sets the KPIs for the Executive Board every year. The KPIs set for the Executive Board consist of\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's external financial and non-financial KPIs, with additional KPIs on financial and risk management. The financial KPIs include the return on CET 1, costs, operating profit before tax, risk appetite and efficiency ratio. The non-financial KPIs include reductions in carbon emissions, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and employer Net Promoter Score. For further information on performance against these KPIs, see page 22.\n\nThe assessment of the KPIs is included as the basis for the collective assessment of the Executive Board and the individual assessment of the members of the Executive Board for 2020. In addition, a delegation of the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2020 performance and lessons learned with the individual members of the Executive Board in January 2021. The outcomes from these meetings were discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board, who concluded that the members of the Executive Board both collectively and individually performed well in 2020. The conclusions and recommendations relevant to the Statutory and Executive Boards were shared with the members of these boards. The 2021 KPIs for the Executive Board are in line with Van Lanschot Kempen's financial and non-financial KPIs for 2021 (see pages 26-41).\n\nThe Executive Board evaluated its own functioning and effectiveness on a regular basis during its quarterly off-sites. Board members gave each other feedback on their strengths and points to consider, and reflected on these.\n\n## On-boarding programme\n\nAll new members of the Supervisory Board complete an extensive on-boarding programme when appointed. The programme is tailor-made for each newly appointed member of the Supervisory Board, as their knowledge and experience varies. The aim of the on-boarding programme is to ensure that new members have thorough knowledge of Van Lanschot Kempen and its business activities in order to fulfil their role within the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Education\n\n- -Shareholder activism;\n\nThe members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards took part in the continuing education programme. In 2020, three continuing education sessions were organised. Topics covered included:\n\n- -The Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act (Wwft);\n\nThese education sessions were positively rated by the members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards.\n\n- -Sustainability regulations and their impact on Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Independence\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board perform their duties independently and critically. The independence requirements described in best practice provisions 2.1.7 to 2.1.9 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code have been fulfilled. Currently, there are no dependent members on the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn the event of a potential conflict of interest relating to a particular topic, the Supervisory Board member concerned is not allowed to participate in discussions or decision-making on that topic. Best practice provisions 2.7.3 to 2.7.4 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code were observed as far as",

This report is guided by requirements originating from the updated EU Shareholder Rights Directive. Although there is still not full clarity around the specific legal requirements for the report, we have written this report in line with the spirit of the draft EU guidelines for disclosure.\n\nThis report includes both a summary of our Statutory Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies and our annual report on remuneration, which sets out how our policy was applied during 2020, and how it will be applied in 2021. On 28 May 2020, the AGM approved the remuneration policies for the Statutory Board with a majority of 93.7% of the votes cast and for the Supervisory Board with 100% of the votes cast.\n\nThe 2019 remuneration report was approved by the AGM (advisory vote) with a majority of 93.7% of the votes cast.

In fact, it has become a professional services company with a banking licence. This leads to specific challenges from a remuneration perspective, especially within the Dutch regulatory context.\n\nWe compete with large financial institutions in our niches. We strongly believe that our future success requires a robust Statutory Board with a proven track record in wealth management and related merchant banking activities, while experience in digitalisation and advanced analytics is also key. As a consequence, the remuneration of the Statutory Board members should be such that Van Lanschot Kempen is able to attract and retain the necessary talent, which includes future board members from highly specialist wealth management and technology firms. Moreover, the remuneration package of the Statutory Board must be structured to fit properly within the Dutch context.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration principles remained unchanged in 2020\n\nWe believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance to help achieve our long-term strategy. This is reflected in our Statutory Board remuneration policy. Since 2015, this consists of fixed remuneration only (no variable remuneration) and includes a large proportion in depositary receipts for shares (hereinafter: shares), with a five-year lock-up period, in combination with share ownership guidelines. 3 This creates a strong focus on long-term value creation.\n\nIn compliance with the law under which SRD II has been implemented in the Netherlands, certain textual additions have been made to the Statutory and Supervisory Board remuneration policy to explain our remuneration approach. These were approved at the 2020 AGM. The remuneration structure for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards remained unchanged in 2020.\n\n## Total remuneration in 2020\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Statutory Board periodically, taking into account internal and external perspectives. When adopting the Statutory Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company and remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce in our organisation. Moreover, the Remuneration Committee takes note of individual Statutory Board members' views regarding the amount and structure of their own remuneration.\n\nIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the members of the Statutory Board believed it was appropriate to collectively and individually set an example regarding the reduction of costs within the firm. They therefore decided to take a 10% pay cut on the cash component of their 2020 compensation on a voluntary basis, from 1 May until the end of 2020. This decision was highly appreciated by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn line with the Statutory Board remuneration policy approved by shareholders, the Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Statutory Board. The indexation started on 1 July 2020, in line with the wider workforce. The indexation amounted to 1.6% and was maximised by the derived Consumer Price Index (CPI) applicable over 2019.\n\nFor more information about the Statutory Board's remuneration package and pay ratios, see 'Remuneration of the Statutory Board in 2020' on page 84.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Statutory Board based on a set of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are strongly aligned with KPIs for the rest of the organisation, and reflect both the interests of our stakeholders and our ambitions as a wealth manager. In assessing the performance of the Statutory Board, great value is attached to their performance as a team. This is the starting point of the performance assessment, given the company's complementary business lines. If the performance of a Statutory Board member is consistently under par, the Supervisory Board may dismiss the responsible Board member (after consulting the general meeting).\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nan open dialogue on all aspects of remuneration. In preparation for the 2020 AGM, a delegation from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board consulted with a large cross-section of our shareholder base, proxy advisers, the Works Council, various client groups and Dutch political parties. During these meetings, an explanation was given about the revised Shareholder Rights Directive; the Statutory and Supervisory Board remuneration policy; the Supervisory Board's view on rewarding long-term sustainable performance; and the Dutch context, such as the Dutch law on remuneration of financial undertakings, and the Dutch Corporate Governance and Banking Codes.\n\nWe take our stakeholders' views very seriously, and welcome\n\nThe dialogue with our stakeholders was very constructive. Gaining their views on executive pay in general, and Van Lanschot Kempen's remuneration policy in particular, was very valuable.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received detailed feedback about each of the engagement meetings, and appreciates that it is important for stakeholders to have a clear understanding of the decisions made around remuneration. We would like to thank all the stakeholders for their valuable input. The feedback was very constructive, and the Supervisory Board will take it into account going forward. Van Lanschot Kempen will continue this broader scope of stakeholder engagement, and will aim to liaise with stakeholders on sensitive matters well before these items are put on the AGM agenda.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2021\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Statutory and Supervisory Boards will remain unchanged in 2021.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 24 February 2021\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nBernadette Langius , Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to remuneration: rewarding long-term sustainable performance\n\nOur purpose is the preservation and creation of wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the society we serve.\n\nAs a company, we believe that the generation of wealth - and its redistribution through taxation - are critical to the process of creating and maintaining stable, successful societies. Given that social cohesion necessitates such wealth creation, we believe that wealth management cannot be the preserve of a few but is a necessity for all. We create wealth, economic growth, jobs and tax income via our services to entrepreneurs, as well as contributing to the realisation of societal goals via the preservation and creation of wealth for asset owners, including private individuals and pension funds.\n\nWe believe that wealth is not just about financial assets; essential as these may be, wealth is about all the things that we value in life. In a broader sense, wealth represents the collective wisdom of a society and the cultural norms and values that sustain it. Although our primary objective is to help our clients with the financial aspects of wealth, we endeavour to serve their broader objectives as well.\n\nWe serve clients across the social spectrum and in several segments - private, wholesale & institutional and corporate as a trusted partner and to assist them in preserving and creating wealth sustainably. Investing for the long term is no longer just about looking for the greatest returns by a future date; it's about ensuring the liveability of the planet for the generations to come. We believe that serving the long-term interests of our clients helps create a platform for sustainable investing and societal stability.\n\nThis view is reflected in our approach to remuneration. The remuneration of the Statutory Board consists of fixed remuneration only, and includes a large proportion in Van Lanschot Kempen shares (with a five-year lock-up period), creating a strong focus on the long-term continuity of the company and subsequent strong client relations.\n\n## WE BELIEVE IN:\n\n## Focusing on the long term\n\nVariable remuneration is scrutinised in Dutch society, especially in the financial sector. The use of variable remuneration can lead to a focus on short-term performance. As we believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance, we ended all variable remuneration for the Statutory Board in 2015. Since then, we have only paid fixed remuneration to the Statutory Board.\n\n## Rewarding sustainable performance\n\nWe pay out a substantial proportion of the fixed remuneration in shares to ensure our Board members focus on long-term, sustainable performance. To maximise this effect, these shares are subject to a five-year lock-up period (during which the shares cannot be sold).\n\n## Creating a sense of ownership\n\nWe believe in aligning our interests with those of our shareholders through a high level of personal share ownership. Our share ownership guidelines stipulate that Statutory Board members must hold Van Lanschot Kempen shares with a value equal to or above the cash portion of two years of their gross salary (for as long as they remain in office). If the share price is not performing, the Board members must keep increasing their holdings.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Statutory Board based on a set of financial and nonfinancial KPIs. In assessing the performance of the Statutory Board, great value is attached to their performance as a team. The Supervisory Board evaluates both the performance of the Statutory Board as a whole and that of the individual Statutory Board members on an annual basis. Performance discussions are held with the individual members. The Statutory Board also annually evaluates its own functioning as a whole and that of its individual members. If an individual Statutory Board member underperforms, they are held accountable. If no improvement is realised, the Statutory Board member can be dismissed by the Supervisory Board at any time.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has developed a set of KPIs focusing on long-term value creation. These financial and non-financial KPIs reflect both the interests of stakeholders and our ambitions as a wealth manager. They are in line with the company's values and will be reassessed from time to time. The KPIs that are relevant from a strategy and stakeholder perspective are disclosed in the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 26-41. These KPIs are also applicable to the members of the Statutory Board. Van Lanschot Kempen aims for the KPIs and performance management applicable to the Statutory Board to be fully aligned with the rest of the organisation.",

The key features of our remuneration policy are as follows:\n\n|                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed salary - cash               | To reflect the scale and complexity of our  company, enabling us to attract and retain the  highest calibre talent needed to continue the  company's transformation and growth                                                                                                                                                                          | Fixed salary in cash, paid during the year in 12 instalments, taking into account the  following factors: - Level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities;  - Business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market  conditions; |\n|                                   | To reflect the scale and complexity of our  company, enabling us to attract and retain the  highest-calibre talent needed; to align rewards  with long-term sustainable performance; and to  align the interests of the Statutory Board with  Fixed salary in shares, paid in one instalment: - A lock-up period of five years applies to these shares. | Fixed salary - shares shareholders                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                   | To compensate for inflationary pressure on real  The remuneration of the Statutory Board can be increased annually at the discretion  of the Supervisory Board.

The indexation amounted to 1.6% and was maximised by the derived CPI applicable over 2019. The indexation was applied as of 1 July 2020 (in line with the wider workforce) and was granted fully in cash, in accordance with the Statutory Board remuneration policy. The remuneration paid to the Statutory Board in 2020 and 2019 is presented in the table on the following page.",

We have not made use of any discretion when applying the policy, except for using the indexation clause for the Statutory Board.\n\n## Compliance with our remuneration policy\n\n## Total remuneration management\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Statutory Board periodically, taking into account internal and external considerations.\n\n## Internal pay ratios, fairness and wider workforce considerations\n\nWhen adopting the Statutory Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company - attaching importance to the need for a sound pay ratio. The development of the pay ratio is discussed annually with the Works Council. Starting in 2020, we decided to use a more specific pay ratio calculation method, so that the data being compared is matched as closely as possible. Under this new method, the average labour cost only consists of salaries, social security premiums, variable remuneration and pension costs. Comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nA comparison of the remuneration package of the CEO and the average labour cost 7 of an employee within Van Lanschot Kempen results in a pay ratio of 11:1 (2019 ratio: 12:1). Trade unions apply the rule of thumb that the pay ratio should be a maximum of 20:1.\n\nAs part of the review of Statutory Board remuneration, we take into account the remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. This includes considering the structure of remuneration packages at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how these evolve across the different levels of the organisation. The fixed expense allowance for members of the Statutory Board was abolished from 2020, in line with the rest of our employees. Business expenses are reimbursed on a declaration basis.\n\nFor more detailed information on Statutory Board remuneration versus remuneration for the wider workforce (as well as company performance), see 'Supplementary\n\ndisclosure related to Statutory Board remuneration' on page 86.\n\n## External considerations\n\nWe periodically assess the remuneration levels of the Statutory Board versus external market levels. For this purpose, we use a well-balanced, focused group of companies, which reflects our talent market for Statutory Board positions. This serves as one of many checks in the determination of remuneration levels.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has transformed from a universal bank into a specialist, independent wealth manager. In fact, it has become a professional services company with a banking licence.\n\nWe are convinced that market capitalisation does not drive talent. Our talent market is much broader than that of our direct competitors. This is evidenced by our current Statutory Board members, who were consistently hired from topnotch larger firms. The relevant market includes both financial services companies and non-financial industry companies, both Dutch and international, and companies that are similar to and larger in size than Van Lanschot Kempen. The relative size of the company versus our competitors drives the need to attract better people than the competition. Prompted by our business strategy, we are willing to pay for the best people in the market. Typically, this talent comes from companies that are larger than ours.\n\nOur external reference market consists of the following types of companies:\n\n- -Dutch banks: Although not all of the banks are directly comparable in terms of activities and size, these companies are subject to the same regulatory framework and are part of the same public debate.\n\n- -Specialist wealth management companies: We are a (highly) specialist company, and need to be able to attract specialists to further grow the business. As there are no other standalone specialist wealth management companies of comparable size in the Netherlands, we look at companies active in Western Europe. We take into account standalone companies, broadly comparable in terms of number of employees and type of professional setting.",

        "page_content": "- -Other Dutch companies: Although other banks and specialist wealth management companies are important from a talent market perspective, our talent pool does not only consist of financial services companies. For example, in pursuing our wealth management strategy, professional qualifications are key - including the ability to adapt to technological changes. Because of this, our peer group also consists of other, non-financial Dutch companies. These companies are larger than ours, reflecting our experience that talent suitable for our Statutory Board is likely to be attracted (and lost) to larger companies.\n\nThe peer group is in line with requirements as laid down in the Dutch Banking Code. This code prescribes that the peer group should be composed of comparable positions both inside and outside the financial industry, including the relevant international context. If we change our remuneration policy in the future, we will also review our Statutory Board peer group. The composition of the peer group currently is set out in the table below.\n\n## Statutory Board peer group\n\n| Specialist wealth  management  companies   | Dutch banks   | Other Dutch companies   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| BIL                                        | ABN AMRO      | Aegon                   |\n| Degroof Petercam                           | ING Groep     | ASML                    |\n| Julius B\u00e4r                                 | NIBC Bank     | Boskalis Westminster    |\n| Quintet                                    | Rabobank      | DSM                     |\n| Lombard Odier                              |               | KPN                     |\n| Vontobel                                   |               | NN Group                |\n|                                            |               | Vopak                   |\n\nAs for the Statutory Board's overall total remuneration level, the objective is to remain competitive and to occupy a position below the median of the peer group. When establishing more specific positioning against market data, we take into account that some of the companies are substantially larger than ours. As a result, the current remuneration packages of our Statutory Board members occupy a position far below the median of the peer group.\n\nFollowing feedback from stakeholders, in 2019 we asked Willis Towers Watson (WTW) to update the market assessment for the Statutory Board. No changes were made in the companies selected, but we asked WTW to benchmark one level deeper in the organisation for the larger firms in the peer group (at similar job levels). This means that our CEO was compared with positions that report to the CEO (CEO-1 level); for the other Statutory Board positions, divisional heads were included that report to CEO-1 level (i.e. CEO-2). As these positions do not have formal board responsibilities, a standard board premium (in line with market practice) was applied to the base salary levels. Based on this updated analysis, we found that the CEO and CFO are still placed below median market levels (in the 40 th percentile for the CEO and 44 th percentile for the CFO), while the other Statutory Board members are placed at median market levels.\n\n## Statutory Board performance\n\nAs indicated in our approach to remuneration, the performance of the Statutory Board is assessed based on non-financial and financial KPIs. For 2020, the following KPIs (selected from a strategic and stakeholder perspective) were included in the KPIs of the Statutory Board. For a comprehensive overview of the Statutory Board KPIs, see the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 26-41.\n\n|               | KPIs                                                                   | Targets 2023      | Result 2020 8      | Supervisory Board  assessment 2020        |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Financial     | CET 1 ratio                                                            | 15-17%            | 24.3%              | Excellent                                 |\n| Financial     | Return on equity (CET 1)                                               | 10-12%            | 4.4%               | Below target                              |\n|               | Efficiency ratio                                                       | 70-72%            | 85.7%              | Below target                              |\n| Non-financial | Net Promoter Score (NPS) a.

Our remuneration policy for other employees is in line with our strategy and purpose, and contributes to long-term value creation.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nEmployees' fixed remuneration reflects their relevant work experience and organisational responsibilities. In 2019, we implemented a new job and career framework that consistently links the weight of each job to a pay line. The pay lines are based on external market data, and are differentiated to ensure we pay market-competitive salaries across the organisation. The new pay lines are fully transparent, promote better pay-for-performance focus, and have been set up with clear guidelines on pay-related decisions and governance.\n\n## Equal pay\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen operates a merit-based remuneration policy, seeking not to discriminate on the basis of gender, age, nationality, social status or cultural background. We periodically investigate this and, if necessary, we make adjustments to equalise pay.\n\nIn 2020, we analysed the gender pay gap at different levels in the organisation. We observed pay gaps at senior management levels and specific areas in the overall wider workforce. These gaps may be due to differences in age, work experience and so on. Further analyses will be made in 2021 to determine whether there are any unexplained differences.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nOur variable remuneration policies cover all employees (excluding the members of the Statutory Board). Each individual grant is subject to meeting the criteria as described in this section.\n\nOur variable remuneration policies comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The average variable remuneration of all Van Lanschot Kempen employees who work (largely) in the Netherlands does not exceed 20% of their fixed remuneration. However, for a small number of employees, we may grant variable remuneration of up to 100% of fixed\n\nremuneration. These deviations require separate approval from the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Variable remuneration funding\n\nThe Statutory and Executive Boards annually establish a variable remuneration pool, from which individual variable remuneration awards are made. The size of the pool (or the pool funding) depends on achievement of financial and nonfinancial KPIs. The size of the pool is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Once the size of the variable remuneration pool has been established, the Statutory and Executive Boards decide how the pool will be allocated.\n\n## Variable remuneration allocation\n\nThe individual allocation of variable remuneration is dependent on individual performance, market competitiveness and special factors.\n\nIndividual performance is measured by assessing the achievement of KPIs, as set at the beginning of the year. These indicators can be financial and non-financial, with some departments applying only non-financial criteria. For the departments that use both financial and non-financial indicators, at least 50% of the allocation of any variable remuneration is based on non-financial criteria, such as showing the desired professional behaviour, improving client satisfaction, developing new products or solutions for clients, and improving internal processes, policies or systems. The financial performance indicators include nothing that might encourage irresponsible risk-taking.\n\nVariable remuneration is only awarded if:\n\n- -It is justified by the performance of Van Lanschot Kempen, the relevant business line and the individual employee;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen meets the prevailing buffer requirements under the EU's Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and its implementing legislation;\n- -The employee has received a good performance assessment, has met compliance targets, has not been subject to disciplinary measures, and has not taken any risks that fall outside Van Lanschot Kempen's accepted risk appetite.\n- -The risks taken have been reassessed and no material risks have occurred that were not expected or factored in;\n\n## Variable remuneration pay-out\n\nVariable remuneration up to \u20ac50,000 gross is paid out in cash directly. Above this amount, 50% of any variable remuneration is paid out directly, whereas the other 50% is deferred for a period of three years. For new awards starting in 2021, this period will be four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned before).\n\nThe Statutory Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, hold or claw back all or part of the payout if pay-outs have taken place on the basis of incorrect information, or have been made in conflict with the variable remuneration policy and/or applicable legislation and regulations:",

        "page_content": "- -Deferred, conditional, variable remuneration previously awarded to an employee (or former employee), if payment of the variable remuneration would be considered unfair or unreasonable (hold back);\n- -Unconditional variable remuneration previously paid to an employee (or former employee). This might occur if, for instance, payment was based on incorrect information about performance or about the conditions on which the variable remuneration depended (claw back).\n\n## Remuneration in 2020\n\nVariable remuneration totalling \u20ac12.2 million was paid to employees (including identified staff) over 2020 (2019: \u20ac14.7 million). Two people received total annual remuneration of over \u20ac1 million in 2020.\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nOur 2011 long-term share plan (LTP) allows us to award variable remuneration in the form of Van Lanschot Kempen shares to certain key employees (including identified staff). In this case, 60% of each award is unconditional, whereas 40% of each award is deferred for a period of three years. For new awards starting in 2021, this period will be four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned before).\n\n## Pensions\n\nAs of 2020, all our employees participate in the new Van Lanschot Kempen defined contribution pension plan. Statutory Board members do not participate in this plan as they receive an individual pension contribution. We monitor external developments regarding alignment between executive pensions and broader employee pension arrangements, and the possible impact that these may have in the Netherlands.\n\n## Remuneration policy for identified staff\n\nIdentified staff are employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the business. For these employees, performance measurement is the same as for other employees, but additional rules for the pay-out of variable remuneration apply.\n\nAs a general rule, any pay-out to identified staff is made 50% in cash and 50% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares. As an exception 14 to this, the variable remuneration of identified staff working at Kempen Capital Management is paid 50% in cash and 50% in a flexible mix of Van Lanschot Kempen shares and investments in funds managed.\n\nA lock-up period of one year applies to the shares that have become unconditional. In all cases, 60% of the award is paid out unconditionally (both the cash part and the non-cash part), whereas 40% is conditionally deferred for a period of three years. For new awards starting in 2021, this period will be four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on a reassessment of the five conditions mentioned for any award of regular variable remuneration. If this re-assessment leads to an adjustment of the deferred remuneration, the hold and/ or claw-back system applies.\n\n## Remuneration policy governance\n\nThe Statutory Board sets the remuneration policy for employees, based on the advice of the Human Resource Management, Finance, Reporting & Control, Risk Management and Compliance departments. These, together with the Internal Audit department, have an important part to play in setting up, adjusting, implementing and reviewing our variable remuneration policy. They advise the Statutory and Supervisory Boards and report to them on their conclusions.\n\nThe Statutory Board is responsible for implementing the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board approves the variable remuneration policy, including its general principles, and oversees its implementation. Approval by the Supervisory Board is also required for the variable remuneration pools, any significant 15 individual variable remuneration, and for individual variable remuneration proposed for employees designated as identified staff. The Supervisory Board's Remuneration Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision-making on remuneration and advises it in this area. More information about the remuneration policy for identified staff can be found in our 2020 Pillar 3 disclosure on remuneration, available via our website.",

The Articles of Association and various other regulations and documents relating to corporate governance can be found at\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance and vanlanschotkempen.com/managementsupervision.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV is the holding company of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV (VLKWM). VLKWM holds all the shares in Kempen Capital Management NV.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a listed public limited company under Dutch law, governed by a two-tier board. The Statutory Board is responsible for managing the company, while the Supervisory Board oversees the policies pursued by the Statutory Board, and the general conduct of affairs at the company and its associated business. The Supervisory Board advises the Statutory Board on the performance of its duties.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a structuurvennootschap . Under Dutch corporate law this means that in addition to the tasks already mentioned, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing and dismissing the Statutory Board and for approving some of its decisions. Both the Statutory Board and the Supervisory Board report to Van Lanschot Kempen's general meeting.\n\nIn order to further simplify the group structure, we are exploring the possibilities of a legal merger between Van Lanschot Kempen and VLKWM. Such a legal merger will be subject to approval from the regulators and the general meetings of these companies.\n\n## Group structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Statutory Board\n\nThe Statutory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen is responsible for the continuity of the company. It focuses on long-term value creation for the company, and takes into account stakeholders' interests that are relevant in this context. The Statutory Board is responsible for the management of the company, and its duties include drawing up and achieving Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose, its strategy and related risk profile, its goals and the pattern of its results, while also attending to the environmental and social aspects of doing business that are relevant to the company.\n\nThe Statutory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen is also the Statutory Board of VLKWM. The Supervisory Board notifies the general meeting of any proposed appointment of a member of the Statutory Board. Appointment of a member of the Statutory Board is subject to the approval of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). A member is appointed by the Supervisory Board. The maximum term for appointment or reappointment is four years. The Supervisory Board may dismiss a member of the Statutory Board at any time, but only after consulting the general meeting.\n\nIn strategic decisions, the Statutory Board takes all material environmental and social factors into account. Periodically, it determines the financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) for Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has had an Executive Board since 2015. The Executive Board oversees the implementation of our company strategy and manages core activities. This ensures better alignment between core activities and a more effective decision-making process. During 2020, the composition of the Executive Board changed (see \"Composition and performance of the Statutory and Executive Boards\" for more details). The Executive Board currently comprises the members of the Statutory Board and the person responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions.\n\nIn principle, all members of the Executive Board attend Supervisory Board meetings. The Executive Board makes sure that all the information relevant to the Supervisory Board is provided. Van Lanschot Kempen's Statutory Board members have ultimate responsibility for the actions and decisions of the Executive Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nIn performing its duties, the Supervisory Board focuses on the interests of the company and its associated business. The Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen is also the Supervisory Board of VLKWM.\n\nThe members of Van Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board are appointed by the general meeting, in accordance with the provisions set out in Article 23 of Van Lanschot Kempen's Articles of Association. Appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board is subject to the approval of DNB. Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a term of four years and may be reappointed for one further fouryear period. A member of the Supervisory Board may subsequently be reappointed again for a period of two years, and this appointment may be extended by another two",

In the event of reappointment after eight years, the reasons for reappointment should be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board may only be dismissed by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal with due observance of Article 161(2) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In addition, the general meeting may pass a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board as a whole, in accordance with Article 161(a) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Such a resolution results in the immediate dismissal of all members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Diversity policy\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen has adopted a diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory and Executive Boards (the policy can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/management-supervision under 'Diversity Policy Supervisory Board and Executive Board'). In view of their joint functioning, the diversity policy for the Executive Board includes the Statutory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nWe are committed to supporting, valuing and leveraging inclusiveness and diversity, and aim for a diverse composition of the Supervisory and Executive Boards in the areas relevant to us, such as age, background, experience, gender and nationality. The importance of diversity should not mean setting aside a candidate's qualifications, the requirements for the position to be filled or the overriding principle that someone should be recommended, nominated and appointed for being 'the best person for the job'.\n\nWith regard to gender diversity, we strive for a reasonable spread across gender and aim for the composition of the Supervisory and Executive Boards to be such that at least 30% of their respective members are men and at least 30% women. We strive for a reasonable spread across ages and nationalities in the composition of the Supervisory and Executive Boards, but we do not believe that age or nationality are suitable criteria for setting specific diversity targets so we do not set specific objectives for these. With regard to background, experience and expertise, we aim - in keeping with the Supervisory Board's profile - to ensure that the combined background, experience and expertise of Supervisory Board members enable the Board as a collective to best carry out its range of responsibilities and duties towards Van Lanschot Kempen, taking into account the nature of our business and activities. The same applies to the Executive Board. Our diversity policy describes the relevant areas of background, experience and expertise of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board respectively.\n\nIn implementing our diversity policy, the individual profiles drawn up for vacancies in the Supervisory and Executive Boards take into account the policy's criteria and objectives. These profiles form the basis for the recruitment and selection of new members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards. These criteria and objectives are also taken into account when evaluating the performance of the Supervisory and Executive Boards. The results of our diversity policy are described in the section below on the boards' composition and performance.\n\nThe policy governing recruitment and selection of members of the Statutory and Supervisory Boards can be found at\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/management-supervision, under 'Policy Recruitment and Selection Van Lanschot Kempen'.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Statutory and Executive Boards\n\nThe Statutory Board must consist of at least three members, with the actual number set by the Supervisory Board. The composition of the Statutory Board did not change in 2020, and consisted of Karl Guha (Chairman), Constant Korthout, Arjan Huisman and Richard Bruens. The composition of the Executive Board did change in 2020, and comprises Karl Guha (Chairman), Constant Korthout, Arjan Huisman, Richard Bruens and Erik van Houwelingen. Erik van Houwelingen, responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions, was appointed as a member of the Executive Board as of 16 November 2020, replacing Leni Boeren who stepped down as a member of the Executive Board on 12 March 2020. Leonne van der Sar, responsible for Merchant Banking activities, stepped down as a member of the Executive Board on 14 September 2020. Richard Bruens has taken over responsibility for the Merchant Banking activities.\n\nThe Statutory and Executive Boards evaluate their functioning as a whole and that of individual Board members at least once a year. The Supervisory Board discusses, at least once a year, the performance of the Statutory Board and the Executive Board as a whole and members' performance individually. The Supervisory Board has concluded that the composition of the Statutory and Executive Boards meets the objectives of our diversity policy in most respects. The composition of the Executive Board is complementary and there is a sufficient degree of diversity with regard to age, expertise, experience and background. However, the target for at least 30% of the members of the Executive Board to be women is not currently met. With two women stepping down as members of the Executive Board in 2020 and a man appointed as a new member, the Executive Board currently has no female members. Gender diversity will continue to be an important element in the profile for future vacancies on the Executive Board. In addition, if a vacancy in senior management needs to be filled, specific attention is paid to female talent in order to make the pool of internal candidates more diverse in terms of gender. Although gender diversity is important in the recruitment and selection of candidates, the principle of selecting the most suitable candidate for the vacancy prevails. We are not yet able to indicate a time frame within which the target for gender diversity in the Executive Board will be met. The company continues to put measures in place to enhance diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has a minimum of three members and a maximum of nine. Currently, the Supervisory Board comprises Frans Blom (chairman), Manfred Schepers (vicechairman), Karin Bergstein, Jeanine Helthuis, Bernadette Langius, Maarten Muller and Lex van Overmeire. At the annual general meeting held on 28 May 2020, Willy Duron stepped down as a member of the Supervisory Board, while Karin Bergstein was appointed as a new member.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members to prepare the Board's decision-making:",

        "page_content": "the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Risk Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Selection and Appointment Committee. These committees advise the Supervisory Board on matters relating to their respective areas of interest. More information about the committees and their composition can be found on page 73 of the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile 1 for its size and composition, taking into account the nature and activities of the business associated with Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries, and the required expertise and background of the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance, that of its committees and that of individual Supervisory Board members, at least once a year without members of the Statutory Board being present. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance with independent support once every three years. More information about the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment of their performance in 2020 can be found on page 77 of the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nDiversity in general and gender diversity in particular are important factors in the recruitment and selection process for candidates for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board meets the objectives of our diversity policy, with its diverse composition in terms of age, experience, expertise, background and gender. This composition enables the Supervisory Board as a collective to carry out its responsibilities and duties effectively. The following areas of expertise are represented in the Supervisory Board: executive experience, strategy formulation and execution, banking and finance, clients and markets, audit, financial reporting, risk management, IT, digitalisation, transformation, sustainability (social and environmental), legal and compliance, and remuneration. The Supervisory Board currently has seven members, three of whom are female. This means that 42.9% of the positions on the Supervisory Board are held by women and the target for at least 30% of its members to be female has been exceeded.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016 2 (the Code) came into force starting in the 2017 financial year, and contains principles and best practice provisions that regulate relations between the management board, supervisory board and shareholders (including the general meeting). The Code aims to define responsibilities for long-term value creation, risk control, effective management and supervision, remuneration, and relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, we complied with the Code. We deviated from best practice clause 4.1.8 for the reason described below. This clause states that the management board and supervisory board members nominated for appointment should attend the general meeting at which votes will be cast on their nomination. Due to Covid-19 and the government-imposed measures to contain the spread of the virus, Van Lanschot Kempen's 2020 general meeting had only a minimum number of people physically present. Karin Bergstein nominated for appointment as a member of the Supervisory\n\nBoard - followed the meeting via webcast but was not physically present at the meeting at which the votes were cast on her nomination. To introduce herself to shareholders and depositary receipt holders, a brief message was presented during the meeting, which was also available via webcast. This deviation is temporary in nature. As soon as circumstances allow, we intend to comply with the provision again.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code 3 contains principles on sound and ethical business operations, governance, risk policy, audit and remuneration policy. The Banking Code applies to activities performed in, and aimed at, the Netherlands by banks with registered offices in the Netherlands and which hold a banking licence issued by DNB. It therefore applies to VLKWM, the subsidiary of Van Lanschot Kempen that holds a banking licence in the Netherlands. Where banks that are subject to the Banking Code form part of a group, parts of the Banking Code may be applied at the level of the entity which acts as the head of the group, rather than at the level of individual subsidiaries. Certain parts of the Banking Code are therefore applied at the level of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn 2020, VLKWM complied with the Banking Code. An explanation (in Dutch) of how VLKWM has applied the Banking Code during the reporting year is given on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance.\n\n## Capital structure and shares\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's authorised share capital consists of 150 million shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each, divided into 75 million Class A ordinary shares and 75 million Class C preference shares. Our outstanding capital consisted entirely of Class A ordinary shares; a total of 41,361,668 Class A ordinary shares had been issued at 31 December 2020. There were no outstanding Class C preference shares in 2020.\n\n## Depositary receipts for shares\n\nOver 99.99% of Class A ordinary shares in issue are held by Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting Administratiekantoor'), which has issued depositary receipts for these shares. The receipts have been listed on the official market of the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 1999. A depositary receipt can be converted into its underlying share without any restrictions, although administrative costs may be charged. Stichting Administratiekantoor fully complies with Principle 4.4 of the Code, which specifies that 'Depositary receipts for shares can be a means of preventing a majority (including a chance majority) of shareholders from controlling the decision-making process as a result of absenteeism at a general meeting. Depositary receipts for shares should not be issued as an anti-takeover protective measure.'\n\nStichting Administratiekantoor grants proxies so that holders of depositary receipts can always exercise their voting rights. In the case of shares for which Stichting Administratiekantoor has not granted proxies to the holders of depositary receipts and for which no voting instructions have been received, Stichting Administratiekantoor's Board decides how the votes are to be cast.

Its Board has three members and is independent of Van Lanschot Kempen. It appoints its own members, without requiring the approval of Van Lanschot Kempen. Before appointing a member, the Board allows the holders of depositary receipts for shares the opportunity to recommend candidates for appointment as members of the Board. A meeting of holders of depositary receipts takes place at least once every two years. At this meeting, the Board reports on its activities, vacancies in the Board, and candidates the Board intends to appoint as members of the Board. Once every two years, the Board requests the holders of depositary receipts at this meeting to confirm their confidence in the Board. At the meeting that was held on 16 November 2020, holders of depositary receipts confirmed this. The Board reports on its activities annually. This report can be found on page 221.\n\n## Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nA call option contract has been agreed between Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting preferente aandelen') and Van Lanschot Kempen, under which Stichting preferente aandelen was granted the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. A general meeting, at which a proposal to redeem the preference shares will be placed on the agenda, is to be convened within 12 months.\n\nThe following circumstances may lead to the issuance of Class C preference shares:\n\n- -Merger talks that do not lead to an agreement;\n- -A concentration of shares or depositary receipts for shares in Van Lanschot Kempen as a result of purchases on the stock market or the purchase of blocks of shares, other than as a pure investment;\n- -The announcement of a public bid, whether or not in combination with the above circumstances;\n- -A proposal by a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts for shares to place an item on the agenda that represents a potential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen's continuity, identity and/or independence.\n\n## Interests in Van Lanschot Kempen notifiable under Chapter 5.3 of the Financial Supervision Act\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of depositary receipts of Van Lanschot Kempen are required to provide information on their holdings once they cross threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. As of the publication date of this report, Van Lanschot Kempen is not aware of any shareholders or holders of depositary receipts with an interest of 3% or more in Van Lanschot Kempen other than Stichting Administratiekantoor, APG Asset Management NV, LDDM Holding BV, Romij BV, Janus Henderson Group plc, FMR LLC, NN Group NV, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., B.H.F. ten Doeschot, Investec Asset Management Limited, Invesco Limited, Crux Asset Management Limited and Wellington Management Group LLP. For more information on Van Lanschot Kempen's shareholders, see the Van Lanschot Kempen shares section\n\non page 67. Stichting preferente aandelen has reported a potential interest of 100% in Van Lanschot Kempen under the call option agreement between Stichting preferente aandelen and Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn 2020, no transactions took place between Van Lanschot Kempen and any natural person or legal entity holding at least 10% of the shares in Van Lanschot Kempen, and which would be material to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or the person/entity involved.\n\n## Rights of shareholders\n\nSince there are exclusively Class A ordinary shares in issue at present, this section only describes the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares and depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe portion of the profit remaining after addition to the reserves is at the disposal of the general meeting. In the event that a loss is incurred over a year, which cannot be covered by a reserve or by some other means, no profit distribution will occur in subsequent years until such time as this loss has been absorbed. A dividend on ordinary shares can only be paid out when the dividend proposal has been approved by the general meeting. Van Lanschot Kempen checks whether the proposed dividend satisfies the European Central Bank's recommendation on dividend payment policies. Further information on our dividend policy can be found on page 67.\n\n## Pre-emption rights\n\nWhen ordinary shares are issued, each existing holder of ordinary shares has a pre-emption right proportionate to the aggregate nominal amount of the existing holding of ordinary shares. Class A ordinary shares are issued to holders of Class A ordinary shares. The same applies to the grant of rights to acquire ordinary shares. Pre-emption rights can be limited or excluded by resolution of the Statutory Board, any such resolution being subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The relevant authority of the Statutory Board ends as soon as its authority to issue shares expires (see 'Share issues').\n\nShareholders do not have any pre-emption rights on shares issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution. Nor do shareholders have any pre-emption rights on shares or depositary receipts for those shares issued to employees of Van Lanschot Kempen or another group company.\n\n## Special rights of shareholders\n\nThere are no special statutory control rights attached to shares in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen signed a shareholder agreement with LDDM Holding BV in 2011. In it, LDDM Holding affirms that it will respect Van Lanschot Kempen's independence. LDDM Holding will not cooperate with the acquisition by a third party of a shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen exceeding 25% of the issued share capital without the approval of the Statutory and Supervisory Boards. In the event of any future share issues, Van Lanschot Kempen will give LDDM Holding the opportunity, subject to certain conditions, to keep its relative shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen at the same level. As long as LDDM Holding retains an interest of at least 7.5% in Van Lanschot Kempen, it has the right to recommend one person for appointment as a member of the",

Maarten Muller currently serves on the Supervisory Board on LDDM Holding's recommendation.\n\n## Restrictions on voting rights and deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has not imposed any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights. In principle, voting rights are exercised at the general meeting by the shareholder or the person authorised by the shareholder to that end. A shareholder is entitled to vote at the general meeting if the shares in question are registered in the shareholder's name on the registration date (see 'General meeting'). Holders of depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares who register on time to attend the general meeting are granted a proxy by Stichting Administratiekantoor. They can use this proxy at the general meeting to exercise the voting rights on the shares held by Stichting Administratiekantoor, and in exchange for which depositary receipts were issued. Proxies will be provided when the depositary receipt holders sign the attendance list prior to the start of the meeting. If the depositary receipt holder's right to attend the meeting is to be exercised by a representative authorised in writing, Stichting Administratiekantoor will grant a proxy to the representative. Shareholders and holders of depositary receipts for shares are also offered the opportunity to issue a voting instruction to an independent third party prior to the general meeting. The notice convening the relevant general meeting will state to whom this voting instruction should be sent and what the deadline is for submission.\n\n## Share issues\n\nThe extent of the Statutory Board's authority to decide on a share issue (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) is determined by a resolution of the general meeting. The duration and granting of this authority are also determined by resolution of the general meeting and may not exceed five years. The Statutory Board's authority to issue ordinary shares, including the granting of rights to acquire these shares, was extended at the annual general meeting held on 28 May 2020 for a period of 18 months from the date of that meeting. The authority to issue these shares is limited to 10% of the issued capital.\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nRepurchases of paid-up shares in the company or depositary receipts for such shares, other than for no consideration, may take place if the general meeting has authorised the Statutory Board to this effect. This authorisation applies for up to a maximum of 18 months. Repurchase occurs pursuant to a decision by the Statutory Board, subject to Supervisory Board and DNB approval.\n\nThe Statutory Board was authorised at the annual general meeting held on 28 May 2020 to repurchase paid-up ordinary shares in the company or depositary receipts for these shares, by buying such shares on the stock market or otherwise, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued capital at the date of authorisation, subject to Supervisory Board approval. This authority has been granted for a period of 18 months from the date of the meeting.\n\n## Transfer of shares and depositary receipts\n\nThe Articles of Association and the conditions of administration do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of Class A ordinary shares or depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nA resolution to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen may only be adopted based on a proposal by the Statutory Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. If a proposal to amend the Articles of Association is presented to the general meeting, a copy of the proposal will be made available to the shareholders and holders of depositary receipts prior to the meeting.\n\n## General meeting\n\nEach voting shareholder and depositary receipt holder is authorised, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing, to attend the general meeting, to address the meeting and to exercise their voting rights. A registration date applies to each general meeting, which is the 28 th day prior to that meeting. The registration date determines who qualifies as a voting shareholder or depositary receipt holder for the relevant general meeting. The notice convening the meeting states the registration date, the way in which shareholders and depositary receipt holders can register and how they can exercise their rights, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing.\n\nShareholders and depositary receipt holders or their representatives are only admitted to the meeting if they have informed Van Lanschot Kempen in writing of their intention to attend, and if this has been done in the manner described in the notice convening the meeting. Access to the meeting is only possible if the relevant shares or depositary receipts are registered in the name of the shareholder or the depositary receipt holder on the registration date. Representatives must also present a written proxy. A written proxy may be sent electronically. Each share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting.\n\nThe powers of the general meeting include the following:\n\n- -Appointing members of the Supervisory Board on the Supervisory Board's recommendation;\n- -Approving decisions of the Statutory Board to make important changes to the identity or nature of the company or the business;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Statutory Board;\n- -Passing a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board;\n- -Approving schemes in the form of shares and/or rights to acquire shares for the Statutory Board;\n- -Disposing of the profit remaining after dividend has been distributed to any outstanding Class C preference shares, and after the decision has been made to add all or part of the profit to the reserves;\n- -Adopting the financial statements;\n- -Discharging the Statutory Board;\n- -Granting the Statutory Board the authority to issue shares and to limit or exclude pre-emption rights on the issue of shares;\n- -Discharging the Supervisory Board;",

        "page_content": "- -Granting the Statutory Board the authority to repurchase the company's own shares;\n\nIn addition, the general meeting has an advisory vote with regard to the remuneration report.\n\n- -Resolving to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen, to dissolve Van Lanschot Kempen, or to effect a legal merger or demerger of Van Lanschot Kempen, following a proposal to that effect by the Statutory Board which has been approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Main features of Van Lanschot Kempen's management and control system\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. This includes the management of financial reporting risks, to ensure reliable financial reporting and financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and which comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen applies the 'three lines of defence' model for the management of risk. The first line of defence is the business, responsible for day-to-day risk management. The second line of defence is provided by departments such as Risk Management and Compliance, which oversee the first line. The Internal Audit department acts as the third line of defence, providing an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the internal management and control systems. The three lines of defence model provides the Statutory Board with a reasonable degree of certainty as to how the internal management and control system is functioning, including the efficacy of both the first and second lines.\n\nThe Internal Audit department is responsible for carrying out IT and operational audits. All of its reports are submitted to the Statutory Board. Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk Management ensure adequate follow-up and prioritisation. Supplementary control measures have been defined in the meantime, which should mitigate risk sufficiently.\n\nThe effectiveness of the framework is evaluated annually by Risk Management and Compliance, while the Internal Audit department also assesses its quality and effectiveness. The results of these evaluations feature in the respective quarterly reports of Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit.\n\nFor more detailed information on risk management within Van Lanschot Kempen, see page 56. The financial statements also include a more detailed explanation of risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen (see 'Risk management', beginning on page 122).\n\n## Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Statutory Board is responsible for the design and operation of an adequate system of internal control for Van Lanschot Kempen's financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting. The financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -Evaluation of the functioning of the internal management and control system by the Internal Audit department. The main findings are discussed with the Statutory Board, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -A risk & control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Statutory Board, and discussion of the annual report by the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -The Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles regarding financial accounting.\n\nIn-control statements are provided by the management of the relevant departments. These are based on the results of testing procedures for the risk & control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance evaluated the 2020 in-control statements.\n\nSetting out its main findings, the Internal Audit department's quarterly reports were discussed with the Executive Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Audit and Compliance Committee were subsequently shared with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed about the Statutory Board's internal control of the organisation, and how it safeguards the integrity of financial information. The subjects considered by the Supervisory Board when assessing the financial statements include the board report and the audit by the external auditors.\n\nThe key audit matters cited in the independent auditors' report were discussed with the Statutory Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee, and formed part of the organisation's management and control.\n\n## Statement by the Statutory Board\n\n- -The management report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n\nIn accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Statutory Board states that:\n\n- -The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- -The management report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectation of the company's continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report.\n- -Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a 'going concern' basis;\n\n## External auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as Van Lanschot Kempen's external auditors for the 2021 financial year at the annual general meeting on 28 May 2020. PwC's audit plan for 2020 and risk analysis were discussed in August 2020 at meetings of the Statutory Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee.",

Van Lanschot Kempen NV ('Van Lanschot Kempen') is the holding company of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV (formerly Van Lanschot NV until 31 December 2019) ('VLKWM'). The company ('Van Lanschot Kempen') has its registered office at Hooge Steenweg 29, 5211 JN 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Van Lanschot Kempen is a public limited company incorporated under Dutch law and registered under number 16014051 at the Chamber of Commerce. Depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the official market of the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2020 were prepared by the Statutory Board on 24 February 2021, were approved by the Supervisory Board, and will be submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for adoption on 27 May 2021.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Unless stated otherwise, assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost.\n\n## Continuity\n\nThe Statutory Board has examined the ability of Van Lanschot Kempen to continue its operations and concluded that we are able to do so for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Statutory Board is not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis.\n\n## Consideration of the impact of Covid-19\n\nIn 2020, the world was gripped by the outbreak of Covid-19. Covid-19 has, had and will certainly continue to have an impact on economic developments in the Netherlands and the other countries in which we are active. Covid-19 had a direct impact on our business in the first half of 2020 in the shape of value decreases in our investments in our own investment funds and a negative result on our portfolio of structured products. In addition, the market performance of our clients' portfolios affects the amount we receive in management and advisory fees. We have not experienced major disquiet among our clients, and instead saw a net inflow in the months following the start of the crisis as investors spotted a good entry point.\n\nAlthough our total result in 2020 was positive and our results in the quarters after the start of the crisis were not significantly different from last year's average quarterly result, we expect Covid-19 to impact our markets going forward. If the pandemic leads to lower markets, this could impact commission income for 2021.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen reports goodwill on its consolidated statement of financial position in the amount of \u20ac103.1 million. In mid-2020, we performed a goodwill impairment trigger analysis to determine whether the coronavirus crisis is an impairment trigger for one or more of our cash-generating units (CGUs). We concluded that a goodwill impairment test was necessary for the Merchant Banking CGU. The impairment test did not result in a goodwill impairment for Merchant Banking at half-year 2020. The annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020, did not result in a goodwill impairment for any of the CGUs. For more information, see Note 11, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nThe current economic crisis as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic may have an impact on our capital and liquidity positions. However, these positions have remained strong. Our CET 1 ratio is well above our internal requirement of 15-17% and also well above required regulatory capital levels. The CET 1 ratio has improved, coming in at 24.3% at year-end 2020, compared with 23.8% at year-end 2019. Our liquidity position has also improved over the last months. We saw a net increase in client deposit balances in 2020 and we participated in the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations III programme (TLTRO III). This resulted in a net increase in our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) from 157% at year-end 2019 to 177% at year-end 2020.\n\nIf our clients run into financial difficulties, this can lead to higher credit losses. In 2020, Covid-19's impact on our credit portfolio was relatively limited, also after application of a risk management overlay, which is reflected in the comparatively small increase in expected credit loss (ECL). The risk management overlay takes account of uncertainties at a few clients and in a few specific industries which are not (yet) reflected in the model parameters. For more information, see \"Risk management\", under 2.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss (including sensitivity analyses performed by us).\n\nAnother possible effect of the volatility in the securities markets is that the private equity funds in which we participate may become less valuable. Currently the value of these funds is not lower compared with year-end 2019.\n\nTo summarise, Van Lanschot Kempen is well able to cope with the Covid-19 crisis and the accompanying recession, thanks to its solid position. We can therefore affirm that the continuity of the company is in no way under pressure. Should the Covid-19 outbreak continue to cause disruption to economic activity globally through 2021 and beyond, there could be further adverse impacts on our income due to lower lending and transaction volumes and lower revenues related to steep equity market declines.",

        "page_content": "## Functional and reporting currency\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, the functional and reporting currency of Van Lanschot Kempen. Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are given in thousands of euros. The totals may not always match the sum of the individual values due to rounding.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 remain unchanged, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2020.\n\n## Changes in published IFRS standards and interpretations\n\nThe IFRS standards listed below became effective from 1 January 2020 and have been applied to our financial statements for 2020. Unless stated otherwise, application of these standards had no impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's equity or result. Application of the amended standards generally entails amendment or expansion of notes.\n\n## IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business\n\nThe amendments clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments. We have applied the amendments to the business combination of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers NV and concluded that the definition of a business is met. In the event of future transactions that are either business combinations or asset acquisitions, an impact assessment will be made.\n\n## IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe amendments provide temporary reliefs that enable hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate. The amendments do not materially impact group results.\n\n## IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nThe amendments are issued to align the definition of \"material\" across the standards and clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. No impact due to the amendments is expected at this stage.\n\n## Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - Amendment to IFRS 16\n\nThe amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19-related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that takes up this option accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19-related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. The amendment applies to\n\nannual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. Earlier application is permitted.\n\n## Published IFRS standards and interpretations not yet effective\n\nIn addition to the IFRS standards and interpretations referred to above, a number of IFRS standards and interpretations are new or have been amended, and apply to financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. We have not applied the following standards in the 2020 financial statements. Unless stated otherwise, standards will be applied as soon as they become effective and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Annual Improvements to 2016-18 Cycle\n\nChanges to standards concern:\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16\n\nThe amendments prohibit entities from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in which the entity first applies the amendment. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on group results.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWe have identified those accounting policies which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. In the process of applying these accounting policies, we use estimates, assumptions and judgements which can have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the most recent information available, and the actual amounts may differ in the future. The principal estimates and assumptions relate to impairments on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income, investments in associates using the equity method, property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, and assets acquired through foreclosures.",

        "page_content": "Such estimates and assumptions also relate to the determination of the fair value of financial instruments, deferred tax positions, employee benefits and provisions, and other provisions.\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\nWe have applied critical judgement to determine significant influence in companies in which we hold minority interests smaller than 20%. In our opinion, the influence on the financial and operating policy decisions that we have in some minority interests is more in line with the expected influence in an associate. Examples of this influence are veto rights in decisions on issuance of new shares and decisions on amendments of the articles of association. Therefore, we classify these minority interests as incorporated in the articles of association and apply equity accounting instead of IFRS 9 fair value accounting. For further information, see the disclosure on Investments in associates using the equity method.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe determination of the fair value of financial instruments, in so far as available and provided there is an active market, is based on stock market prices at the reporting date. For financial assets, the bid price is used; for financial liabilities, the selling price.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined on the basis of cash flow and of option and other valuation models. These models are based on the market circumstances prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates mainly relate to future cash flows and discount rates. For more details, see 'Risk management', under 14, Fair value.\n\n## Impairments of financial assets\n\nWe recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there has been no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime expected credit loss (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised. The impairments of financial assets are determined as a critical estimate. For more information on deterioration in credit risk, see 'Risk management', under 2.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss.\n\n## Impairments of goodwill\n\nTo measure the recoverable amounts, we calculate the value in use for each cash-generating unit (CGU). This calculation reflects an estimate of future cash flows, multiple scenario analyses and discount rates. Future cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and different types of investigation into possible trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on these estimates include market expectations, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in the client base, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. For more information on the discount rates used, see Note 11, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Other accounting estimates\n\n## Impairments of non-financial assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. This fair value less costs to sell is the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid on transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the valuation date. To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items which are not traded on an active market. Management consideration is also needed to determine the moment of the change of control and thus the moment of consolidation of an acquired entity.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions of provisions\n\nThe pension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations. These calculations make assumptions regarding elements such as the discount rate, future trends in salaries and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty. See Note 19, Provisions.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are determined on the basis of the most recent estimates of the expected costs. The timing of the cash outflow related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and time required to conclude these claims. In determining these provisions we take into consideration the opinion of legal experts. Other provisions include provisions made for various legal claims and consist mainly of the provision for interest payments in response to a ruling by the Dutch Financial Services Complaints Authority (Kifid). Judgements are used in determining this provision, as the costs depend on complex calculations, the assumptions made in making these calculations and the interpretation of relevant regulations.",

        "page_content": "## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen comprise the financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management and its subsidiaries. These have been prepared at 31 December 2020 using consistent accounting policies, and their financial year is concurrent with the calendar year.\n\nSubsidiaries (including the consolidated structured entities) are associates in which Van Lanschot Kempen exercises decisive control. Van Lanschot Kempen has decisive control over an entity when it has power over that entity and is exposed to or has rights to variable income from its involvement in the entity and is able to use its power over the entity to influence the entity's income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the entity. Factors taken into account include existing and potential voting rights. A right is a material right if its holder is able to exercise that right in practice.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has power over an entity if its existing and potential voting rights amount to more than 50%. If these rights amount to less than 50%, Van Lanschot Kempen determines whether it has power over the entity pursuant to contractual agreements. In making this assessment, a distinction is made between substantive and protective rights. Substantive rights are rights which enable the decisionmaking power of an enterprise to be influenced directly and which give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. Examples include the right to appoint and dismiss members of the board of management, and to set the level of their remuneration. Protective rights are rights which protect the interests of an entity in another entity, but which do not directly confer decision-making powers. Protective rights do not give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. When acquiring non-controlling interests, Van Lanschot Kempen in principle includes only protective rights in the contractual agreement. These are rights of approval which enable Van Lanschot Kempen to protect its minority position without acquiring decision-making power. Examples of protective rights are rights of approval in respect of the issue of shares and the effecting of significant acquisitions.\n\nIntra-group transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of incorporation or acquisition, being the date on which Van Lanschot Kempen acquires control, and are consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nWe consolidate interests in investment funds if we have power over the investment fund and are exposed to or have rights to variable income stemming from our involvement and are able to use our power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the investment fund. Van Lanschot Kempen takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.\n\nIn the case of subsidiaries not fully controlled by Van Lanschot Kempen, the non-controlling interest in equity is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position as a component of total equity. The profit or loss for the\n\nreporting period that can be attributed to the non-controlling interest is disclosed separately.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nAcquisitions are recognised using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets (inclusive of any intangible assets not previously disclosed in the statement of financial position), liabilities and obligations not disclosed in the statement of financial position.\n\nGoodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debts) and our interest in the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and obligations not disclosed in the statement of financial position at the acquisition date, is capitalised as an intangible asset. If this difference is negative (negative goodwill), it is taken directly to the statement of income.\n\nA non-controlling interest in the company acquired is recognised at the fair value prevailing on the acquisition date or at the proportionate share in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired.\n\nResults of companies acquired are disclosed in the statement of income from the date at which control is obtained.\n\nAdjustments to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date which are identified within 12 months of the acquisition may lead to adjustment of goodwill. Adjustments identified after expiry of one year are disclosed in the statement of income.\n\nOn disposal of group companies, the difference between the sale proceeds and the acquisition cost (including goodwill) is included in the statement of income together with any unrealised gain or loss.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised. For more information on its valuation, see Note 11, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Hof Hoorneman Bankiers\n\n- -Contractual agreements made in the 'Shared Purchase Agreement';\n\nOn 15 January 2021, we successfully completed the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers NV (\"Hof Hoorneman Bankiers\"). The takeover was announced on 18 August 2020. On 22 December 2020, we announced that our regulators had issued declarations of no objection for the takeover and proposed integration of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers into Van Lanschot Kempen. Factors that were taken into account and argue for control over Hof Hoorneman Bankiers as per 31 December 2020 include:\n\n- -Substantive rights to exercise control over important decisions related to the normal course of business and operations;\n- -The equity capital at closing being at the expense and risk of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n- -Declarations of no objection for the takeover and proposed integration of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers were received from our regulators; and",

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional currency\n\nItems in the statement of financial position pertaining to each group company are stated in the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. the functional currency).\n\n## Group companies\n\n- -Assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of group companies that use a functional currency other than the reporting currency are translated as follows:\n\n- -Income and expenses are translated using the rate prevailing on the transaction date, which is approximately equal to the average exchange rate;\n- -Remaining exchange-related gains or losses are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nUpon consolidation, exchange-related gains or losses arising from monetary items forming part of a net investment in foreign divisions are recognised in equity. Exchange-related gains or losses on borrowings and other items designated as hedging instruments for such investments are also recognised in equity.\n\n## Transactions and line items\n\nOn initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Translation differences arising on the settlement of such transactions or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except where they are recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges in foreign divisions.\n\nIn general, translation differences in the statement of income are included in the result on financial transactions. Translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are translated into the reporting currency at the same time as the determination of their fair value. By retranslation on reporting date, translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through equity are included in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the original transaction date.\n\n## Recognition of financial assets in the statement of financial position\n\nPurchases of financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss whose value is subject to change, or financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or other financial assets at amortised costs, which are settled according to standard market conventions, are recognised on the transaction date, i.e. the date on which we undertake to purchase or sell the asset concerned. Loans and advances are recognised on the settlement date, i.e. the date on which we receive or transfer the asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position\n\n- -Our rights to the cash flows from the asset expire;\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when:\n\n- -We have retained the right to receive the cash flows from an asset, but have an obligation to pay these in full to a third party under a special agreement;\n- -We have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but have transferred control over the asset.\n- -We have transferred our rights to the cash flows from the asset and have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards;\n\nIf we have transferred our rights to the cash flows from an asset, but have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset and have not transferred control, the asset is recognised as long as we have continuing involvement in the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised as soon as the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Repo transactions and reverse repo transactions\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. The related liability is included under the relevant line item (principally Due to banks).\n\nSecurities purchased subject to resale agreements (reverse repos) are recognised under the line item Due from banks or under Loans and advances to the public and private sectors. The difference between the sale price and the purchase price is recognised in the statement of income as interest during the term of the agreement.\n\n## Special purpose entities\n\nWe have placed parts of our loan portfolio in special purpose entities (SPEs). If we have effective control over an SPE, it is consolidated. We have control over an entity when we have power over that entity and are exposed to or have rights to variable income from our involvement in the entity and are able to use our power over the entity to influence the entity's income.\n\nThe accounting principles followed by Van Lanschot Kempen are applied when consolidating SPEs.",

After initial recognition, the derivative is subsequently remeasured at fair value and movements in value are taken to the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. Fair values are based on stock exchange prices, cash flow models, and option and other valuation models.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge our exposure to risks. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities which are hedged through fair value hedging and which would otherwise be recognised at cost is adjusted for movements in the fair value that can be attributed to the hedged risks. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives not relating to the hedged risks are taken directly to the statement of income. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting based on IAS 39, using the temporary reliefs provided by the applicable amendments.\n\nAt the inception of a hedge transaction, we formally designate and document the hedge relationship and the financial risk management objective when entering into the hedge transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to risks.\n\nSuch hedges are considered to be effective if we may expect, both upon inception and during the term of the hedge, that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, in so far as they relate to the hedged risk, and the actual outcome is within a range of 80-125%. The effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. We apply the EU carve-out on portfolio fair value hedges.\n\nHedges that qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability arising as a result of interest rate changes. Movements in the value of the hedging instrument are taken to the statement of income.\n\nAny change in the fair value of the hedged item is also recognised in the statement of income, in so far as the hedging instrument has been effective in the preceding period.\n\nA hedge relationship ends if the hedging instrument is sold, expires or is exercised, or if the hedging transaction no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, with the remaining value adjustment of the hedged item amortised through profit or loss until the end of its term.\n\nWe apply micro fair value hedge accounting and macro fair value hedge accounting.\n\n## Micro fair value hedges\n\nA fair value hedge is classified as a micro fair value hedge when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income and issued debt securities are hedged for interest rate risk in a micro fair value hedge.\n\n## Macro fair value hedges\n\nWe apply macro fair value hedges for fixed rate mortgages. A portfolio of mortgages is identified comprising homogeneous loans based on their contractual interest rates, maturity and other risk characteristics. Mortgages within the identified portfolio are allocated into repricing term buckets based on expected repricing dates rather than contractual repricing dates. The hedging instruments are designated appropriately to those repricing term buckets.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to fluctuations in the cash flow of an asset, liability or future transaction arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity until the hedged item affects the statement of income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or if it can no longer be designated as a hedge, accumulated gains and losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is taken to the statement of income. If the expected future transaction is no longer likely to take place, the accumulated result is transferred directly from equity to profit or loss.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nIf the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, the embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and treated as separate derivatives when:\n\n- -A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative; and\n- -The economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- -The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Day 1 profit\n\nDiscrepancies between the transaction price and the fair value may arise if valuation techniques are applied at the time of the transaction. Such a discrepancy is referred to as a Day 1 profit. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised directly in the statement of income if the valuation method is based on observable inputs in an active market. In the event of unobservable inputs, the gain or loss is amortised over the term of the transaction.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are netted and presented in the consolidated financial statements at the net amount when we have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. This mainly concerns netting of derivatives. See 2.7, Risk management.\n\n## Statement of financial position by IFRS accounting policy\n\nFor the layout of the statement of financial position by IFRS accounting policy, see 'Consolidated statement of financial position by category' in the supplementary notes.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks\n\nCash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks comprise, at nominal value, cash in hand and deposits with a term of less than three months, investments readily convertible into a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of value changes, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. The amount due from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) arising from the minimum reserve requirement is also included in this item.\n\n## Financial assets from trading activities\n\nFinancial assets from trading activities are transactions for our own account whereby the aim is to actively sell these instruments in the short term. Financial assets from trading activities consist of the trading portfolio of both equity instruments and debt instruments. The financial assets from trading activities are recognised at fair value with effect from the trade date and value adjustments are taken to the statement of income under the line item Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Due from banks\n\nAmounts due from banks are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are carried at fair value. The positive and negative values of derivatives are shown separately on the face of the statement of financial position on the assets side and the liabilities side, respectively. The values of derivatives with a positive and negative value, concluded with the same counterparty, are only netted if the cash flows are settled on a net basis and this is permitted under law. Movements in the value of derivatives are taken directly to the line item Result on financial transactions. If the hedge is completely effective, the net impact on the statement of income is nil. The difference, in so far as this remains within the ranges set, reflects ineffectiveness and is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Derivatives include:\n\n- -The fair value of derivatives held for trading Derivatives held for trading are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to actively sell them in the short term;\n- Economic hedges are derivatives used to manage risks\n- -Structured product derivatives Structured product derivatives are options we have acquired in order to hedge structured products sold to clients, without application of hedge accounting;\n- -Economic hedges without applying hedge accounting;\n- -Client option positions Offsetting market transactions are conducted for all option positions held by our clients on a one-on-one basis;\n- -Derivatives with application of hedge accounting These are derivatives used as hedging instruments in the application of hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Additionally, any instrument for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) must be measured at FVPL. No restrictions are set for sales within the fair value through profit or loss portfolio. These debt instruments are governed by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) and sales need to be approved by ALCO. Interest earned on these assets is recognised as interest income. All other realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring debt instruments at fair value are recognised under Result on financial transactions. All realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring equity instruments at fair value are recognised under Income from securities and associates.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect and sell business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at fair value, with fair value adjustments recognised in Other comprehensive income unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. The financial assets in the hold to collect and sell portfolio are governed by ALCO and sales need to be approved by ALCO. Sales as a result of managing everyday liquidity needs, maintaining a particular interest yield profile on the secondary market, or to match the duration and sales required by regulators, are consistent with the objective of the hold to collect and sell portfolio.\n\nUnder FVOCI, a financial asset is measured at its fair value and movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in Result on financial transactions. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Loans and advances to the public and private sectors\n\nLoans and advances to the public and private sectors are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and are subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at amortised cost unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Our ALCO sets restrictions for buying and selling in the hold to collect portfolio. Sales are permitted when these are due to an increase in credit risk, take place close to the maturity date, are insignificant in value (at both individual and aggregated levels) or are infrequent. Under this measurement category, the financial asset is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and subsequently recognised at amortised cost less the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and adjusted for any impairment allowance. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Investments in associates using the equity method\n\nThese investments have been designated by management as transactions held indefinitely, and as a result of the acquired control can be classified as investments in associates using the equity method. These are investments in entities where we have significant influence but not control. If there is a change in the equity of the associate, we recognise our share in this change and include it in the statement of changes in equity. This also applies to results of associates recognised in our statement of income.\n\nIn the first year of investment, investments classified as investments in associates using the equity method are recognised at cost, and where applicable are adjusted for any changes in the value of the associate's individual receivables and payables occurring after the acquisition, measured using the policies applied by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the investments in associates using the equity method is determined each quarter. The valuation methods applied are the capitalisation method (peer group analysis), the discounted cash flow method and the disclosed net asset value method. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nThe capitalisation method determines the value of a business by multiplying the operating profit (EBIT) and the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by a multiplier factor derived from similar listed companies (the peer group), if applicable also taking account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholding. EBIT and EBITDA are adjusted for one-off items where applicable.\n\nThe discounted cash flow method calculates the enterprise value by discounting the forecast operational cash flows at a discount rate for the planning period and a final value based on the extrapolation of the operating profit. The discount rate is determined on the basis of the discount rate of listed companies with a high degree of similarity and on the specific characteristics of the company. If applicable, the discounted cash flow method takes account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholdings.\n\nThe company's net debt is then deducted from the value resulting from the capitalisation method and/or discounted cash flow method and multiplied by the share in the capital structure in order to derive the shareholder value from the enterprise value.\n\nThe disclosed net asset value method determines the value of a company based on the statement of financial position.\n\nIf our share in the associate's losses is equal to or exceeds our interest in the associate, no further losses are recognised unless we have assumed obligations or made payments for these associates.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment comprise property, information technology, furniture and fixtures, and communication and safety equipment. Property and equipment are initially carried at cost and subsequently measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. The carrying value includes the costs for replacement of part of the existing property as soon as these costs are incurred, but excludes day-to-day servicing costs. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.\n\nLease contracts which we entered into as a lessee are classified as right-of-use assets. Right-of-use assets are presented as part of Property and equipment in the statement of financial position and are measured at cost, comprising the following:\n\n- -Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- -The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- -Any initial direct costs;\n\nDepreciation is applied using the same method as for wholly-owned tangible assets.\n\n- -Restoration costs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of individual property items is determined every year, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, and more often if market conditions so dictate. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs or the value in use. The fair value less costs is set by an independent surveyor. If the fair value less costs is below the carrying amount, the value in use is determined. This value is calculated using the value-in-use method. If the value in use is also below the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of the fair value less costs and the value in use.",

Our policy is focused on selling these assets in due course. Property not in own use is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. This property is considered to be impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities, and the purchase price paid (excluding acquisition costs). Goodwill paid is included in the financial statements at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill paid is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill relates. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nOwing to the absence of a market for separate CGUs, we are unable to calculate a reliable fair value less costs to sell for each CGU. The recoverable amount is therefore deemed to be equal to the value in use. The value in use is determined by discounting the future cash flows generated by a CGU to their net present value. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The impairment is first applied in full to the goodwill and then pro rata to the individual assets.\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as application software, client bases, contractual rights and the value of acquired funds and loans and advances, are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.\n\n|                                   | Estimated useful life of intangible assets (years)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Client bases                      | 5-20                                                 |\n| Third-party distribution channels | 12-20                                                |\n| Brand names                       | 20                                                   |\n| Application software              | 3-5                                                  |\n\n## Tax assets and liabilities\n\nTax assets and liabilities are stated at face value. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to the same tax authority, the same type of tax and the law permits offsetting of these assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on the face of the statement of financial position if the valuation of an asset or liability temporarily differs from the valuation for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates prevailing on the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same tax authority, concern the same type of tax, if it is permitted under law to offset these deferrals and if the deferrals are expected to be settled simultaneously. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are assessed at every reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets and liabilities to be used. This reduction will be reversed if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nChanges in the value of investments classified as available for sale and movements in the value of derivatives forming part of a cash flow hedge are recognised in equity net of deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities cease to be recognised when these movements in value are realised. Current tax is taken to the statement of income on realisation of the movement in value.\n\n## Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nThe line item Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale includes a group of assets whose carrying amounts will principally be recovered through a sale transaction. These assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of either the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation. The group of assets and liabilities concerned is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups. We plan to sell assets at a price which is reasonable considering their current fair value, as a result of which a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year.\n\n## Other assets\n\nAssets acquired through foreclosures are carried at the lower of cost or the recoverable amount. This recoverable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the relevant variable costs to sell. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor. Other assets are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities from trading activities\n\nis from the date on which the contract is concluded.\n\nFinancial liabilities from trading activities are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to repurchase these instruments in the short term. These instruments are stated at fair value, with movements in value recognised in the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. This line item comprises short positions on the trading portfolio in both equity instruments and debt instruments. Recognition",

        "page_content": "## Due to banks\n\nAmounts due to banks are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Public and private sector liabilities\n\nPublic and private sector liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\n- -Designation eliminates or significantly reduces inconsistencies in measurement and recognition which would otherwise arise as a result of liabilities being valued or income and expenses being recognised under different accounting policies; or\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise financial instruments which management believes should be recognised at fair value through profit or loss based on one of the following reasons:\n\n- -The contract in which the financial instrument is included contains one or more embedded derivatives and the entire contract is recognised at fair value through profit or loss. This is only permitted if the embedded derivative has significant influence on the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nThe valuation takes account of our own credit risk. This is based on the internal funding curve, which is determined by spreads on issued debt securities and estimates by investment banks of interest rates on new issued debt securities. Own credit risk is recognised in equity under the line item Own credit risk reserve. The remaining amount of change in the fair value is recognised in Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Issued debt securities\n\nIssued debt securities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, issued debt securities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Repurchase of our own debt securities is offset in the consolidated financial statements against the liability; the difference between the cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is included in the statement of financial position if we have an obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are discounted if the time value of money for the liability has a material effect.\n\n## Provisions for pensions\n\nWe operate defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Under defined contribution plans, contributions to pension providers are taken to the statement of income as staff costs. We have no further payment obligations with respect to defined contribution plans once the contributions have been paid.\n\nA defined benefit plan is a pension plan which defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on\n\nretirement. Factors such as age, years of service and salary are taken into account when determining the amounts to be paid. The provision for defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nDifferences between the expected and actual return on plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and changes in the effect of the asset ceiling are recognised directly in equity; net interest is recognised under Interest in the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions for long-service benefits\n\nEmployees receive a bonus to mark a long-service anniversary of 25 and 40 years. In addition, receptions or dinners with colleagues are organised for employees who have been in service for 25 and 40 years.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised only if the recognition criteria are met. We have a constructive obligation if we have a detailed formal restructuring plan identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, the principal locations affected, the number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the expenditure to be undertaken and a suitable timeframe. Employees are also notified of the main features of the plan.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nLease liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as part of Other liabilities. Interest payments and amortisation in the year are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and disclosed separately within the statement of profit or loss.\n\nLease liabilities consist of interest and lease payments and are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nSubordinated loans are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost. Purchases of our own subordinated loans are offset against the liability in the consolidated financial statements; the difference between cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Equity\n\nDirect costs of a new share issue are deducted from equity, taking account of taxes.\n\nIf we purchase treasury shares, the purchase price, including direct transaction costs after tax, is deducted from equity. Treasury shares that we purchase do not qualify for profit or dividend and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position\n\nThis includes obligations that represent a potential credit risk.

This item consists of unused overdraft facilities, sale and repurchase commitments, irrevocable payment commitments for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and all other obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could give rise to loans.\n\n## Statement of income\n\n## General\n\nRevenue is recognised when it is likely that the economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and the revenue can be measured reliably. Costs are allocated as far as possible to the period in which the services were rendered or to the relevant proceeds.\n\n## Net interest income\n\nThis item consists of income earned on lending and costs of borrowing, derivatives, related commission, and other income/expense similar to interest. The amortisation of remaining value adjustments on mortgage portfolios of fair value hedges which expired in the past is disclosed under Interest income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised in the statement of income on an accrual basis, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash flows over the life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, we take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example early repayment) but not future losses due to uncollectible amounts.\n\nNegative interest on derivatives whereby interest paid is recognised under Interest expense and interest received is recognised under Interest income. Negative interest on balances at central banks is recognised under Interest expense.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\nAll dividends received from investments in equity instruments are included under dividends and fees. Dividends are recognised directly in the statement of income when they are made payable.\n\nOur share in the results of equity-valued associates is recognised under Income from securities and associates using the equity method. Dividends received are deducted from the carrying amount of the equity-valued associate. Due to the fact that these investments in associates using the equity method are part of our investment strategy, we present its income as part of our operating activities.\n\n## Net commission income\n\nThis item comprises the income, other than income similar to interest, earned on wealth management services provided to third parties. Commission paid to third parties is accounted for as commission expense.\n\nWe receive commission for the wide range of services we provide to clients. This can be divided into commission on a transaction basis and periodic commission charged to the client during the year.\n\n## Commission on a transaction basis\n\nCommission income on a transaction basis is recognised in the periods in which we provide the services. Transaction commission for which we only provide a service on the transaction date (e.g. commission on buying and selling shares) is taken directly to the statement of income. Transaction commission for which we have to provide a service in the future (e.g. commission on structured products) forms part of the amortised cost and is recognised in the statement of income over the expected term of the instrument.\n\n## Periodic commission\n\nPeriodic commission (e.g. management fees) is recognised in the statement of income in the period in which the services are provided.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\nResult on securities trading includes realised and unrealised value differences on gains and losses on financial instruments relating to the securities trading portfolio. Exchange and price gains and losses on trading in other financial instruments are recognised under Result on foreign currency trading. Gains and losses due to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting are recognised under Unrealised gains/ losses on derivatives under hedge accounting. Result on economic hedges includes realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivatives that are not included in a hedge accounting model. Result on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss comprises unrealised value differences and interest expenses on financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income comprises non-banking income resulting from the consolidation of non-banking subsidiaries.\n\n## Staff costs\n\nStaff costs comprise wages and salaries, pension and early retirement costs, other social security costs and other staff costs such as remuneration in the form of share-based employee benefits.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nEmployees may be eligible to receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the equity instruments are granted. The fair value is determined based on the share price on the grant date, taking into account the discounted value of expected dividends over the vesting period. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, in the period in which the employee's performance criteria are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (the vesting date).\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses comprise IT expenses, costs of marketing and communication, accommodation expenses, office expenses and other administrative expenses.",

Tax effects of any losses incurred in certain jurisdictions are recognised as assets when it is probable that sufficient future profits will be available in the relevant jurisdiction against which these losses can be offset.\n\n## Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for possible dilution as a result of, for example, outstanding option rights.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. This statement of cash flows shows the source and application of cash items. Cash flows are divided into those from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise, at face value, all cash in hand, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant.\n\n## Segment information\n\nThe different operating segments form the basis for our primary segmentation. An operating segment is a business unit that can earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by its management or the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Additional information is reported geographically based on where the business activities are located. Intra-segment transactions are conducted on commercial terms and market conditions (at arm's length).",

Risk management supports the front office, clients and other stakeholders in ensuring that the risks incurred by Van Lanschot Kempen are controlled and comply with our risk appetite and legal requirements. This section describes our risk appetite, the organisational and governance arrangements that are in place regarding risk management, and the three lines of defence principle. After discussing these general arrangements, the section continues with credit risk, market risk, operational risk, settlement risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, securitisation risk, climate change risk, financial reporting risk and assets at fair value. An overview of compliance risk is also provided.\n\n## 1.1 Risk appetite\n\nSolid capital and liquidity ratios are essential prerequisites for a successful proposition to our clients and the financial stability of Van Lanschot Kempen in general. This is reflected in our risk appetite statement. We aim to have a simple and transparent balance sheet.\n\nWe have a robust risk appetite framework in place. Each year, the Statutory Board prepares the risk appetite statement, which translates our risk appetite into strategic limits. The risk appetite statement is then submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. Quarterly risk appetite reports serve as important discussion documents for the continuous review of our risk profile.\n\nThe risk appetite statement is based on the following guiding principles:\n\n- -We only take risks that - directly or indirectly - serve our strategic objectives;\n- -We only take risks that we understand and can explain;\n- -The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our riskbearing capacity;\n- -We do not take any risks that could seriously harm our reputation;\n- -When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account;\n- -Our risk appetite should be considered in all business decisions at every level of the organisation;\n- -We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches.\n\n## 1.2 Organisation of risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe purpose of our risk management framework is to identify and analyse risks at an early stage, as well as to mitigate and monitor those risks. Adequate internal control procedures and reporting systems, including the application of standards and limits, are key elements of the risk management framework.\n\nThe organisation of our risk management framework is based on the three lines of defence principle. Day-to-day responsibility for risk control lies with the front office and/or operational departments (the first line of defence) including internal control activities. Compliance, Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control form the second line of defence for financial and non-financial risks.\n\nThese departments are responsible for initiating risk policies and the supervision of risk controls within Van Lanschot Kempen. Internal Audit forms the third line of defence and is responsible for performing independent audits on the risk framework and activities of the first and second line. This setup creates a clear, balanced and appropriate division of tasks, powers and responsibilities, and ensures independent and effective operation of the risk management function.\n\nRisk Management stands at the core of capital management. We actively manage our capital base to cover risks inherent to our business and meet the capital adequacy requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). The adequacy of our capital is monitored by using the rules and ratios established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as transposed into EU law. This legal framework also forms the basis for supervision by DNB. Over the reporting period, we fully complied with all externally imposed capital requirements. Both external and internal capital adequacy targets are taken into account, and the central focus is on safeguarding our financial solidity and stability. Each year, a capital and funding plan is prepared for capital management purposes.",

It has set up two committees specifically for this purpose.\n\nThe Risk Committee focuses on all identified risks in the group's business activities, as well as the risk management framework. The Committee also prepares decision-making by the Supervisory Board on risk matters.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee is tasked with advising the Supervisory Board on financial reporting, internal and external audits, compliance and matters regarding duty of care.\n\n## 1.2.2 Risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe Statutory Board is responsible for developing and executing the strategy of the group. This includes the capital and funding plan, which is based on a number of risk, capital and compliance policies.\n\nThe primary objective of our capital management is to ensure that we comply with external and internal capital requirements in order to support our businesses and to create value for our stakeholders. We manage our capital structure by taking into account changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our activities. To maintain and/or manage our capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. These adjustments are under constant review by the Statutory Board. Finally, requests or demands by our supervisors DNB and/or ECB can also influence dividend policies.\n\nThe Statutory Board also bears responsibility for ensuring the proper operation of the processes that safeguard the group's liquidity and capital position. In addition, it is required to provide information to the Supervisory Board, which in turn assesses the risk appetite of the group. The decisions of the Statutory Board are taken during meetings of the Executive Board. To ensure the various risk types are managed properly, the Statutory Board has set up the following risk committees:\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee, which includes all members of the Statutory and Executive Boards, discusses overarching risk management themes. In this committee, the various risk types are brought together, discussed and monitored on an integrated level. The committee is involved in setting the annual risk appetite statement, and discusses the risk appetite report and emerging trends in the risk profile. Other areas covered include recovery and resolution planning.\n\n## Credit Risk Committee\n\nThe Credit Risk Committee sets and adjusts the group's overall credit risk policy and translates this into acceptance and portfolio management policies. In executing its tasks, the committee bears in mind our strategic objectives and the guiding principles contained in the risk appetite statement. Two members of the Executive Board serve on this committee (the CFRO and the member of the Executive Board responsible for Private Banking), along with representatives of Risk Management, Private Banking,  Credit Approval, and Credit Restructuring & Recovery. The committee meets on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Market Risk Committee\n\nThis committee focuses on all market risks within Van Lanschot Kempen and is chaired by the CFRO. Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates (excluding interest rate risk in the banking book), exchange rates and equity prices. It also considers variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility and correlations, which also influence the value of certain financial instruments. Market risks at  Merchant Banking occur due to the trading of securities (mainly equities, equity derivatives and management book investments). Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to a certain amount of market risk (mainly FX and structured products activities) through its treasury activities. This risk is limited, as the majority of transactions and positions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Van Lanschot Kempen is also exposed to market risk as a result of management book investments. The committee meets on a quarterly basis.",

        "page_content": "## Asset & Liability Committee\n\n- -Overseeing the asset-liability management (ALM) process;\n\nThe Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing risks that result from mismatches between assets and liabilities (interest rate and liquidity risks), as well as the capital position of the bank. ALCO's main tasks are:\n\n- -Monitoring and adjusting the funding profile;\n- -Monitoring the development of the balance sheet and balance-sheet projections.\n- -Setting policies on interest rate risk in the banking book 1 , liquidity and funding risk, funds transfer pricing and capitalisation; 1\n\nALCO meets once a month and is chaired by the CFRO. As well as the CFRO, ALCO's members comprise:\n\n- -The Statutory Board member responsible for Private Banking;\n- -The Chairman of the Statutory Board;\n- -Representatives of Treasury, Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, ALCO meets as an expanded group, which includes the COO and representatives of the commercial departments.\n\n## Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n\nThe Compliance & Operational Risk Committee is responsible for the implementation and execution of our compliance and operational risk management policies. The committee assesses compliance and operational risks, and ensures remedial actions are taken if required. The committee also challenges and approves the annual plans of the NonFinancial Risk Management and Compliance departments. It meets twice a quarter and is chaired by the CFRO. Among other things, the root causes of major operational risk incidents are also discussed in this committee.\n\nRisk Management takes the lead in the committees described above, with the exception of the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, where both Compliance and Risk Management are in charge. We also have a number of committees that form part of the first line of defence and that cover specific risk-related topics, such as the Credit Committee and the Product Board.\n\n## 1.2.3 Implementation and review of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nImplementation and monitoring of our risk and capital policies is carried out by Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control. In addition, Compliance carries out the implementation, monitoring and/or review of compliance policies.\n\nInternal Audit is also involved in reviewing the policies described above.\n\nRisk Management is responsible for:\n\n- -Business continuity management;\n- -Second-line monitoring and management of all risks relating to the statement of financial position at group level, including modelling, measuring, managing and reporting on our credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks;\n- -Information security;\n- -The risk appetite process;\n\n- -Preparing, developing and maintaining policy documents;\n- -Issuing daily market risk reports;\n- -Preparing ICAAP and ILAAP documentation as well as the recovery plan;\n- -Proactively and reactively providing advice on managing risks;\n- -Raising risk awareness among staff in order to improve their ability to strike a sound balance between risk and return.\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control is jointly responsible with Risk Management for the financial accounting and business control function. Through its various reports, Finance, Reporting & Control fulfils an important role in challenging the businesses and coordinating supervision of risk management.\n\nCompliance has both an advisory and a monitoring role with respect to compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for Van Lanschot Kempen. As compliance risks are part of the overall risk governance of Van Lanschot Kempen, Compliance as an independent function is involved in and supports the management of compliance risks by identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting on such risks.\n\nCompliance risks include risks such as personal data integrity, financial crime, business conduct and client protection risks.\n\nInternal Audit reviews the design and effectiveness of the risk organisation and the execution of our risk, capital management and compliance policies. The department reports to the Statutory Board. The applicable policies form the starting point for the independent review by Internal Audit. Processes, infrastructure, organisation and systems are audited based on these policies in order to determine whether the organisation adequately executes its risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\n## 1.2.4 Execution of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nThe commercial departments, i.e. the departments shown under 'Execution' in Table 1.2 (excluding Treasury and Credit Restructuring & Recovery), are responsible for preparing their business plans. On the basis of these plans, current and future risks are assessed, including expected capital and liquidity requirements. These assessments serve as input for ALCO.\n\n## 1.3 Capital requirements\n\n- -Pillar 1 stipulates capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk.\n\nThe standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and translated into law, apply to all Dutch banks. The Basel framework consists of three pillars:\n\n- -Pillar 2 requires banks to have internal processes for risk management and to calculate the capital requirements needed to address all risks that are not included in Pillar 1. The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is also part of Pillar 2.\n- -Pillar 3 sets out requirements for disclosure of information about the institution's risk profile to external stakeholders.\n\nOur website has Pillar 3 information (unaudited) and a detailed breakdown of our portfolio of loans to companies and institutions (unaudited), published once a year.",

        "page_content": "Our remuneration policy is explained in the remuneration section and in a Pillar 3 remuneration disclosure (unaudited), which can also be found on our website.\n\n## 1.4 Individual risks\n\n- -Credit risk (Section 2);\n\nThe following sections detail the individual risk types to which we are exposed. It therefore covers a combination of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements. The risk types covered are:\n\n- -Market risk (Section 3);\n- -Settlement risk (Section 5);\n- -Operational risk (Section 4);\n- -CVA risk (Section 6);\n- -Interest rate risk (Section 8);\n- -Strategic risk (Section 7);\n- -Liquidity risk (Section 9);\n- -Climate change risk (Section 11);\n- -Securitisation risk (Section 10);\n- -Compliance risk (Section 12);\n- -Financial reporting risk (Section 13).\n\n## 2. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty or client is no longer able to fulfil its obligations to the bank. Our credit risk policies focus on the counterparty risks associated with lending to private and corporate clients. Strict selection criteria for new clients and active credit management for existing clients are applied to safeguard the quality of the loan portfolio. The lending activities that we conduct are required to be in line with stated objectives, and individual assessments are used to ascertain this.\n\nAs well as from lending activities, credit risk also arises from:\n\n- -International payment transactions and cash management;\n- -Investment activities;\n- -Foreign exchange (FX) risk;\n- -Settlement risk.\n- -Hedging activities;\n\nOur investment activities relate to the management of our liquidity buffer and equity investments. For the liquidity buffer, a limit framework is in place to manage and monitor associated credit risks.\n\nCounterparty credit risk with respect to financial institutions arises from international payment transactions, cash management, FX and hedging activities. Some of these activities also involve settlement risk. For derivatives transactions, counterparty credit risk is mitigated by daily margining.\n\nWe apply a strict policy when determining and monitoring country and counterparty (financial institutions) limits. The country limits serve as a cross limit for financial institutions, meaning that the counterparty risks in respect of financial institutions in one country are limited by the relevant country limit, as the country limit is usually lower than the aggregate of the individual counterparty limits.\n\n## 2.1 Loans and advances\n\n## 2.1.1 Credit acceptance\n\nOur loan approval policy focuses on maintaining a highquality loan portfolio. The authority to approve loans and loan reviews is delegated to a limited number of departments, mainly our Credit Approval department.\n\nThe authority to approve large loans rests with the Credit Committee, which comprises representatives of the relevant divisions as well as members of the Statutory Board.\n\nThe mid- and back-office for nearly all residential mortgage loans is carried out by a third party. A service level agreement (SLA) has been signed to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk. The acceptance process is not outsourced, with the exception of our white label loans that fall within the acceptance framework.\n\nWe also offer residential mortgages via a third party under a white label. From a risk management perspective, the credit and outsourcing risks are of particular relevance. An SLA has been signed to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk. The acceptance and management of credit risks have been outsourced to a third party, within our strict guidelines, and these activities are monitored using detailed data from the mortgage portfolio, provided in accordance with prevailing legal requirements. This allows for the recognition of any arrears, for example. We also review random samples of mortgage loans.\n\nLimits on financial institutions and countries are determined using a number of hard criteria such as the external rating, BIS ratios, capital ratios, country of origin and gross domestic product (for countries). Limits can also be adjusted and withdrawn on a daily basis.\n\nNew loan requests are assessed to determine if they are in line with our strategy and we adopt a conservative approach to granting them.\n\nThe credit risk concentration mainly lies within our Private Banking segment in the Netherlands.\n\n## 2.1.2 Credit management - policy and processes\n\nA high-quality loan portfolio requires strict credit management. Credit management is carried out at both individual loan and portfolio level. At the individual loan level, explicit attention is devoted to the management of unauthorised overdrafts and accounts past due. Loans with an elevated risk profile are subjected to a risk check. In addition, a portion of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and as part of this review the credit risk of individual clients is scrutinised. The frequency of the reviews varies according to the individual borrower's risk profile, but they take place at least annually. In addition to the financial analysis, the review takes account of future developments in the client's situation (partly in the light of relevant macroeconomic trends). A deterioration in a client's risk profile may lead to closer supervision, an adjusted rating, corrective measures (such as requiring additional collateral or increasing the frequency of financial reporting), involvement of the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department or a combination of these measures. It may also lead to a stage transfer under IFRS 9 -see Section 2.8.\n\nAt portfolio level, credit risks are monitored on a monthly basis. A detailed credit risk report and any relevant developments or expected developments are discussed in the Credit Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. Any negative trend identified in the risk profile of a particular client segment, sector or loan type can lead to the adjustment of the relevant lending policy. Trends in sectors where there is a concentration risk are monitored particularly closely.",

        "page_content": "If the review, risk check, payment arrears or external signals point to an increased risk of discontinuity, the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department is involved in the credit management process. An estimate is made of the probability of continuity. Depending on the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, either monitoring or intensive supervision is applied. If there are objective indicators of impairment as referred to under the line item Impairments, the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department draws up an impairment proposal. The Impairment Committee determines the impairment for the whole credit portfolio on a quarterly basis.\n\nActive management of past due loans enables potential problem loans to be identified at an early stage. If an individual assessment identifies an increased risk, the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department will supervise the client. Increased credit risk occurs in situations including the following:\n\n- -If clients report difficulties in meeting future payments, e.g. because of a divorce, unemployment etc.;\n- -If clients fail to meet their payment obligations (for amounts > \u20ac100 and > 1% of the credit exposure for retail clients or > \u20ac500 and > 1% of the credit exposure for nonretail clients);\n- -In the event of a default (see Section 2.1.3.1);\n- -For business clients, in the event of a significant decrease in turnover, breach of one or more covenants, a debt service coverage ratio < 1, etc.\n\nThe primary goal of the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department is to migrate clients back to accounts with regular status (i.e. not under the supervision of Credit Restructuring & Recovery) by reducing their credit risk. The aim is to do this in accordance with the loan agreements made with these clients, but forbearance measures are applied if necessary. More information on forborne exposures can be found in Section 2.2.\n\n## 2.1.3 Credit risk measurement\n\nThe CRR distinguishes three approaches for determining the required capital for credit risk: the standardised approach (SA), the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach. We use SA and A-IRB for our loan portfolios.\n\nWe have developed internal models for measuring and monitoring credit risk for the majority of the loan portfolio. Some of these internal models are also used to determine the required capital that has to be set aside for absorbing unexpected credit losses. For this reason, the models, the use of these models and the model governance have to adhere to strict requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).\n\nThe standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various characteristics such as client type, loan type, collateral type, and external rating. Under A-IRB banks are allowed to use own estimates for PD, EAD and LGD. The PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one year, the EAD is defined as the bank's expected exposure at the time a client defaults, and the LGD is the expected loss percentage in the event that a client defaults. As a result, A-IRB is more risk-sensitive than SA.\n\nWe have approval from DNB to determine and report the required regulatory capital for our residential mortgage exposures portfolio using the A-IRB method. For these\n\nmodels, we have a model governance framework in place. As part of this, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated against independent models.\n\nThe PD model is mostly based on behavioural aspects of the client and the LGD models on the underlying collateral. For the capital calculations a so-called downturn LGD is applied, i.e. the expected loss at default during an economic downturn. Estimation of the EAD is based on the limit and credit utilisation.\n\nBesides the residential mortgage portfolio, we have three other retail portfolios:\n\n- -Other retail exposures up to \u20ac2 million;\n- -Qualifying revolving retail exposures up to \u20ac40,000;\n- -Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with total exposures up to \u20ac1 million.\n\nFor these three retail portfolios the SA method has been used for capital calculations since the end of 2020.\n\nThe non-retail portfolio comprises four sub-portfolios with the following exposures:\n\n- -Exposures to private customers exceeding \u20ac2 million (excluding residential mortgages);\n- -Exposures to corporate clients;\n- -Commercial real estate exposures;\n- -Exposures to holding companies that are clients with noncontrolling interests and shareholdings.\n\nFor all these non-retail portfolios the SA method has been used for capital calculations: for the first two sub-portfolios this has been done since the end of 2020; for the other two sub-portfolios this has been done since the first half of 2018. Prior to this the F-IRB method was used for these exposures.\n\n## IRB equity portfolio\n\nThe IRB equity portfolio includes our own positions in equities in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, noncontrolling interests and shareholdings which appear on Van Lanschot Kempen's company statement of financial position. We use the simple risk-weighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in shares. In this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial institutions that are not deducted from equity because they fall below the regulatory threshold. Positions taken in shares and subordinated loans of wholly owned subsidiaries are excluded from IRB. These are reported using the SA method.\n\n## Other loans and advances\n\nThe risk-weighted assets of the other portfolios, such as the debt securities in our investment portfolio managed by the Treasury department (i.e. excluding retail, non-retail and equity), are calculated on the basis of the standardised approach.\n\n## 2.1.3.1 Definition of default and credit-impaired assets\n\nIn November 2020, we introduced the new definition of default according to the EBA guidelines. Most notably, the materiality threshold was changed to a uniform European standard. The new definition of default had no material impact on ECL levels in 2020. A financial asset is creditimpaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred:",

All impaired assets are also classified as defaulted by Van Lanschot Kempen under CRR rules. Van Lanschot Kempen has implemented one definition that serves for all the different purposes.\n\n## 2.2 Forborne exposures\n\n- -Amendment of the original terms and conditions of the loan agreement with which the client is unable to comply due to financial difficulties, with a view to restoring the client's payment capacity;\n\nA loan is regarded as forborne if the borrower is unable to meet its contractual obligations towards the bank and the bank then decides to make a concession to the client by modifying the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The objective of this modification is to enable the borrower to meet the renewed obligations, and it would not have been offered if those circumstances had not arisen. Forbearance actions may include one or more of the following measures:\n\n- -Full or partial refinancing of a forborne exposure.\n\nThe purpose of the measures taken in forbearance situations is to maximise the chance of restoring the borrower's payment capacity and to minimise the risk of losses due to having to write off all or part of the loan. The measures must offer the client an appropriate and sustainable solution enabling them to comply with the original obligations arising from the credit agreement in due course.\n\nApplication of forbearance measures is exclusively reserved for the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department, which pursues a policy based on general principles that it translates to match the specific situation of the individual client. Given the nature of these loans, the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department carries out intensive credit management. Before any new arrangements are agreed, a detailed analysis is made of the client, their financial situation and the likelihood of income recovery. The outcome of this analysis may have consequences for the client's review frequency and the size of any loan loss provision to be made. If the client qualifies for appropriate forbearance measures, a proposal will be drawn up and submitted to the competent assessor(s) for approval. If a forbearance measure is granted, the borrower is classified as a non-performing credit.\n\nIn practice, forbearance measures do not always have the desired effect - i.e. the recovery of the client's payment capacity or an end to the process of declining payment capacity. This may, for example, be the result of a further deterioration in the client's financial circumstances or the failure of those circumstances to improve as expected. Such cases will be reanalysed and a strategy determined. However, the principle is explicitly maintained that the forbearance measure must be appropriate, sustainable and effective. Any new arrangements agreed with the borrower must also meet these strict criteria.\n\nA forbearance situation ends when the 'non-performing' status has no longer been applied to the loan for a probation period of two years. The non-performing status must last a minimum of one year starting from the last forbearance measure. The client must moreover have made significant and regular payments of interest and/or principal during at least half of the probation period. During the two-year probation period, no payments by the borrower may be in arrears for more than 30 days. If this condition is not met, the probation period will start again from the date the client is no longer in arrears for more than 30 days.\n\nThe recording and monitoring of loans which are subject to forbearance is carried out by the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department. Each quarter, and where appropriate more frequently for specific loans, an individual assessment is carried out of forborne exposures which are in default, in relation to any provision made. In addition to this quarterly assessment (as part of the provisioning process), these loans are subject to extensive credit risk management, the intensity and frequency of which will as far as possible match the specific circumstances of the loan.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 crisis, a limited number of clients asked for financial assistance. In the period March-September 2020, we assisted these clients with tailor-made solutions: temporary payment suspension for a maximum of six months or temporary liquidity support. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on reporting and disclosure of exposures subject to measures applied to the Covid-19 crisis , these amendments were not registered as forbearance measures and as a result they are not treated as non-performing exposures. If further assistance or amendment of the terms and conditions are necessary, these exposures will be classified as forborne and non-performing.\n\nTables 2.2.A through 2.2.E show the total volume of forborne exposures. We apply several types of forbearance measures (see Table 2.2.A). Following the decision to apply such a measure, a loan remains under the supervision of the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department until the forbearance situation has ended.",

Our loan book mainly consists of loans to Private Banking clients (primarily loans secured by residential real estate), as well as a number of commercial real estate loans and\n\nsecurities-backed loans. The remainder of the loan portfolio comprises consumer loans and private customised financing (other loans), which are solely intended for clients who have placed substantial funds with us.

Tables 2.4.A and 2.4.B have been drawn up on the basis of the definitions contained in the Basel regulations, with the exception of commercial real estate, which is based on the market value. The value under primary collateral is the lower of the subscription value or the value of the collateral. The total amount of unsecured loans is small. In general, collateral can be used for all current and future amounts owed by a debtor.\n\nThe average loan-to-value (LTV) of our mortgage loans, based on 100% foreclosure value, is 74% (2019: 76%).\n\n## 2.5 Concentration within the loan portfolio\n\nAbout 82% of our loan portfolio consists of loans to private clients.

We aim for a diversified loan portfolio, reflecting our risk appetite. We have set limits for concentrations in individual sectors.\n\n## 2.5.1 Individual loan concentrations\n\nThe ten largest loans to individual counterparties other than financial institutions totalled \u20ac180 million at year-end 2020, compared with a total loan portfolio of \u20ac8.5 billion (2019: \u20ac280 million; total loan portfolio \u20ac8.7 billion).\n\n## 2.5.2 Geographical concentrations\n\nIn line with our strategy, the majority of lending takes place in the Netherlands and Belgium. The geographical breakdown is based on client locations. A small portion of the Belgian market is served from the Dutch branch network.",

        "page_content": "## 2.8 Loss allowance for expected credit loss\n\nUnder the IFRS 9 standard, we recognise a loss allowance for ECL on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there is no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime ECL (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\n## Expected loss measurement\n\n- -12-month ECL for Stage 1;\n\nWe measure expected credit losses by using a sophisticated approach and an alternative approach. In both these approaches, ECL reflects an unbiased probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and verifiable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Both approaches calculate a 12-month and a lifetime ECL for the exposures of all three stages. After the risk stage determination in the stage calculation, the relevant ECL is assigned:\n\n- -Lifetime ECL for Stage 2 and Stage 3.\n\nThe key elements of the ECL calculation are the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), loss given default (LGD), and loss given non-cure (LGN). The loss given noncure is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default without cure occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.\n\nIn addition to these four key elements, we incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach. We identify macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL:\n\n- -An upside scenario;\n- -A base-case scenario;\n- -A downside scenario.\n\nThese scenarios are associated with different PDs, EADs and LGNs. In the process of building the PD, cure rate and LGN models for IFRS we included several macroeconomic risk drivers in the long list of risk drivers. Those determined as best-performing during modelling were selected to be part of the model. The macroeconomic scenarios are generated based on inputs from the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), DNB and Van Lanschot Kempen's economic experts. The reported ECL (12-month or lifetime, depending on the stage) is a weighted average of ECLs per macroeconomic scenario. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach.\n\n| Model          | Macroeconomic variables                                                                                                  |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD calibration | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Volume of exports (EXP)                                                                 |\n| Cure rate      | - Total investments (TI) - Private consumption (PC) - Residential real estate price (RREP) - Government consumption (GC) |\n| LGN            | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Residential real estate price (RREP)                                                    |\n\n## Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nTo determine the deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument since initial recognition, we compare the current risk of default at the reporting date with the risk of default on initial recognition.\n\nTo calculate the lifetime probability of default (LPD) at origination and the LPD at reporting date, we use four PD models: private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates, and commercial real estate. If the increase in LPD exceeds the designated threshold, the exposure is transferred to Stage 2 and the lifetime ECL is calculated.\n\nWe use the following thresholds for the different PD models:\n\n- - Private investments\n\n0.8\n\n- - Small and medium-sized enterprise\n\n0.9\n\n- - Corporates\n\n1.3\n\n- - Commercial real estate 0.9\n\nA backstop is applied and financial instruments that are materially overdrawn and more than 30 days past due are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, it is transferred to Stage 3.\n\n## Threshold\n\nAn exposure will be regarded as \"significantly deteriorated\" if the result of the following formula exceeds the limit:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial instruments following sophisticated approach\n\n- -Various models that provide the expected flow of exposures to the default state;\n\nFor the majority of financial instruments included in the line item Loans and advances to the public and private sectors, including mortgage loans, loans, current accounts, subordinated loans and financial guarantees and loan commitments, we apply a sophisticated approach to calculate ECL. This approach uses an umbrella model that combines the following sub-models:\n\n- -A PD calibration model giving the flow from performing to default;\n- -A migration model providing flows from performing rating classes to other performing rating classes;\n- -A full prepayment model and amortisation model giving the outflow from the portfolio of an entire exposure due to prepayment or contract expiration;\n- -A cure rate model giving the flow from default to performing classes and the non-cure state;\n- -An amortisation model showing the contractual payments during the lifetime of a product and the part of the exposure flowing out of the portfolio due to partial prepayments;\n- -Various product-level models that give the expected exposure at the moment a client goes into default;\n- -An EAD model giving the exposure as a function of the limit or outstanding amount just before default;\n- -A discount factor to discount the loss from the moment of default to the moment of reporting.\n- -A product-level model evaluating the part of EAD that may be lost - the loss given loss (LGL) model;\n\n## Financial instruments following the alternative approach\n\nWe apply an alternative approach for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, and loans and security-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG. The alternative approach comprises an investments model and a foreign loan model.\n\n## Investments model\n\nThe investments model is applied to calculate the ECL for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, and debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial instruments all have a low risk profile. All such exposures are assigned to Stage 1 as long as their external rating is investment grade. We use a simplified model to calculate 12-month ECL, using publicly available data for PD and LGD based on external ratings. If financial assets are downgraded below investment grade, these assets will be sold.\n\n## Foreign loans model\n\nFor the loans and securitised loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG, we have developed a foreign loans model. These two portfolios fall outside the scope of the IRB models and no requirements on historical data have been set. The foreign loan model calculates ECL as the sum of future exposure discounted at the effective interest rate at recognition for non-revolving products and the current effective interest rate for revolving products.\n\nThe loss allowance for ECL on financial instruments and the macroeconomic variables used are described in the following section.\n\n## Covid-19 impact\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and banking regulators have emphasised that entities should apply appropriate judgement when determining the effects of Covid-19 on ECL during this period of enhanced economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic. This is necessary while models based on historic data cannot make a correct estimate of the increase credit risk stemming from Covid-19. Consequently, Van Lanschot Kempen has performed an additional review on the loan portfolio. We monitored and examined client payment behaviour in the light of Covid-19, looking at whether we were able to derive additional signals from our list of arrears, monthly risk checks, a check on signals of declining savings or AuM, or, for commercial real estate, a combination of a low debt service coverage ratio and high LTV  to determine whether there had been a deterioration in credit quality. Based on this client-by-client analysis we have implemented a management overlay on those clients which have shown an increase in credit risk. This resulted in a PD increase by moving these clients one risk bucket higher and a stage transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2. In addition to the client-by-client analysis, we also analysed if certain economic sectors showed a significant increase in credit risk. We concluded that this applies to the following industries: hospitality, leisure and commercial real estate (excluding residential real estate). We increased the PD of these sectors by moving these exposures one risk bucket higher and also applied a stage transfer to Stage 2. The total management overlay applied for individual clients and the economic sectors resulted in an increase in the provision of \u20ac4.9 million.\n\nEven after incorporating this management overlay, the net impact on our credit portfolio was relatively limited. This is reflected in the comparatively small increase in expected credit loss (ECL).\n\n## Loss allowances\n\nThe table below shows the ECL loss allowances and the corresponding book values, categorised by balance sheet line item and ECL by stage, as at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2020.",

due to an increase in credit quality in the IFRS 9 models. These credit risk improvements are supported by low arrears in the loan portfolio and relatively positive macroeconomic expectations for 2021 and 2022 taking into account the effects of the lock-down, restrictions and the government support and relief measures. The macroeconomic figures published by CPB and DNB in December 2020 predict a recovery in 2021 and 2022\n\nfollowing the sharp recession in 2020. We assume that for some economic sectors the model outcome does not (yet) fully reflect the present credit risks, and we have applied a management overlay to exposures to adjust the credit risks in these sectors. As a result of the overlay, \u20ac362 million of exposures were transferred to Stage 2. Without this overlay, the nominal value of Stage 1 would have increased due to improvements in credit risk (mortgages transferring from Stages 2 and 3 to Stage 1).",

The nominal value of Stage 2 exposures would have been lower if no management overlay had been applied. The combined effect was a higher coverage ratio compared with 2019.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nThe baseline for Stage 3 provisions is determined by our Credit Risk, Restructuring & Recovery department, with limited IFRS 9 model adjustments.  In 2020, Stage 3 provisions decreased marginally due to the release of the provisions for two clients, write-offs and limited new defaults. These decreases were partly offset by an increased provision for two existing exposures.\n\nThe repayment of loans by a number of defaulted Corporate Banking clients had no impact on the level of provisions (no provisions were recognised at year-end 2019), but lowered impaired exposure and thus moved the coverage ratio from 23.3% to 27.9%.\n\nThe table below shows the total loss allowances recognised per IFRS 9 stage. The total change in Stage 3 amounted to a decrease of \u20ac2.5 million, of this amount \u20ac3.2 million is related to write-offs, \u20ac7.6 million is related to additions of loss allowances and \u20ac6.9 million to releases of loss allowances in Stage 3.\n\n| IFRS 9   | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   | Write-offs   | Change  provision   | Total change   |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Stage 1  | 3,926        | 4,305        | -            | -379                | -379           |\n| Stage 2  | 8,786        | 5,552        | -            | 3,234               | 3,234          |\n| Stage 3  | 52,151       | 54,629       | -3,220       | 742                 | -2,478         |\n| Total    | 64,863       | 64,486       | -3,220       | 3,597               | 377            |\n\nLoss allowances for ECL change over time for several reasons: the credit risk of financial instruments may significantly increase or decrease, financial instruments may become credit-impaired, or new financial assets may be originated.

of the ECL to macroeconomic variables. The main economic drivers of the ECL are gross\n\ndomestic product (GDP), volume of exports (EXP), total investments (TI), private consumption (PC), residential real estate price (RREP) and government consumption (GC). In the table below, ECLs are shown per stage and per scenario.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis as at 31 December 2020   | Stage 1   | Stage 2   | Stage 3   | Total   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| Original situation                            | 3,926     | 8,786     | 52,151    | 64,863  |          |\n| Base-case scenario                            | 3,657     | 8,788     | 51,810    | 64,255  | -608     |\n| Upside scenario                               | 2,983     | 6,900     | 50,647    | 60,530  | -4,333   |\n| Downside scenario                             | 5,376     | 10,669    | 53,472    | 69,517  | 4,654    |\n\n## Collateral credit-impaired financial instruments\n\nIn general, collateral can be used for all current and future amounts owed by a debtor. In addition to residential mortgage collateral and guarantees provided by governments and credit institutions, commercial real estate, financial collateral, receivables, stocks and inventories may serve as collateral. The majority of collateral is not directly linked to a\n\nspecific financing arrangement. For credit-impaired financial assets, the Credit Restructuring & Recovery department determines the liquidation or recovery value of the available collateral, based on the most recent valuation reports. The table below shows the collateral for financial assets considered credit-impaired.\n\n| Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2020   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2020   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2020   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2020   | Collateral for credit-impaired assets as at 31 December 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | Gross exposure                                                 | Impairment                                                     | Carrying amount                                                | Value of collateral                                            |\n| Loans and advances to public and private sectors               | 192,776                                                        | 51,904                                                         | 140,872                                                        | 268,669                                                        |\n| Financial guarantees and loan commitments                      | 3,315                                                          | 273                                                            | 3,042                                                          | 5,032                                                          |\n\nNo impairment is recognised for credit-impaired financial instruments if the collateral is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation.

        "page_content": "## 3. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates, exchange rates and share prices. Other variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility, long-term dividend expectations and correlations, can also influence the value of financial instruments. The market risk to which we are exposed can be divided into two components: the market risk to which Van Lanschot Treasury (part of the Other activities operating segment) is exposed in respect of its necessary market maintenance, its structured products activities and services to clients. Market risk stemming from trading activities in institutional securities is concentrated at the Merchant Banking operating segment.\n\n## 3.1 Trading activities in securities\n\nOur trading activities in securities, mainly comprising equities and equity derivatives, are concentrated at the Merchant Banking operating segment. A governance structure has been created to facilitate effective risk management. The risks are managed using value at risk (VaR) limits as well as gross and net limits. Daily stress tests provide information about changes in portfolio values in extreme market conditions and complement the VaR calculation. The VaR for the trading portfolios is computed daily, based on a one-day time horizon with a 97.5% confidence level on one year of historical data. The continued validity of the assumptions underlying the VaR computation is regularly tested using back-testing. Other risks relating to derivatives, which are mainly embedded in our structured notes, are expressed in 'the Greeks' (e.g. Delta,\n\nVega, Rho) and are separately monitored on a daily basis or more frequently if necessary. Separate limits are in place for all risk drivers. VaR and other relevant risk parameters are reported to senior management (including one Executive Board member) on a daily basis. The embedded derivatives sold to our clients are hedged by Van Lanschot Kempen. From the second quarter of 2020, sold derivatives have been hedged back-to-back, whereas previously they were macrohedged per risk driver. This means that the complex derivatives sold to clients are broken down into individual risk drivers (i.e. delta exposure on S&P500 or EurostoXX 50). The total macro exposure per risk driver is calculated and this is hedged by using relatively simple (mostly listed) options. All risk drivers have individual limits and are (intra) daily monitored by us, although some basis risks remain. Moreover, macro-hedging assumes that if the underlying risk drivers (equity, interest rate and currency markets) change, the hedges can be adjusted in a timely manner to keep the portfolio balanced. The exceptional volatility in March led to unforeseen illiquidity in the financial markets. It was thus not always possible for us to adjust the hedges in time and illiquidity in certain hedge instruments led to a significant increase in hedging costs. Besides the exceptional volatility, the changes in dividend yield and lending spread were also very steep. Lastly, market risks are also generated by investments in Kempen's management book (notional \u20ac115.9 million; 2019: \u20ac85.6 million). These investments provide seed capital for newly launched Kempen Capital Management funds and allow us to co-invest with our clients.\n\n| Table 3.1 Trading activities VaR   | 2020                | 2020          | 2019                | 2019          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                    | Derivatives-related | Share-related | Derivatives-related | Share-related |\n| At 31 December                     | 431                 | 156           | 219                 | 158           |\n| Highest VaR                        | 1,515               | 388           | 582                 | 475           |\n| Lowest VaR                         | 141                 | 84            | 19                  | 113           |\n| Average VaR                        | 434                 | 192           | 359                 | 238           |\n\n## 3.2 Van Lanschot Kempen market risk\n\nTo a limited degree, Van Lanschot Kempen is also exposed to market risks. These risks stem from its treasury activities (mainly foreign exchange exposure, comprising client transactions and own positions). The Treasury department is part of the Other activities operating segment. The majority of\n\ntransactions and positions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Exchange rate risk is managed within the required limits and an authorisation structure applies. Foreign exchange positions are shown in Table 3.2.B and include all cash, forward and option positions of the entities in scope of consolidation.\n\n| Table 3.2.A Exchange rate risk of treasury trading activities (total gross nominal foreign exchange position translated to x \u20ac1,000)   |   2020 | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At 31 December                                                                                                                         |    293 | 546    |\n| Highest position                                                                                                                       |    791 | 1,970  |\n| Lowest position                                                                                                                        |    -61 | 83     |\n| Average position                                                                                                                       |    242 | 462    |",

This amounts to 6% of the net open positions in each currency (2019: 8%).\n\nIn addition, some market risk exposure results from investments made in Van Lanschot's management book. The current exposure in this portfolio is \u20ac27.1 million (2019: \u20ac32.0 million). Credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) is the risk of volatility in earnings and/or equity, caused by spread movements in the swap curve, for banking book instruments that are classified at fair value.\n\nFor Van Lanschot Kempen, CSRBB is mainly concentrated in the investment and liquidity portfolios. CSRBB limits have been imposed on these portfolios, which are monitored by ALCO on a monthly basis.\n\n## 3.3 Market risk: interest rate and share-related instruments\n\nWe use the maturity method to calculate the capital adequacy requirement in respect of the general risk on debt instruments in the trading portfolio. Share-related instruments are share instruments included under Financial assets from trading activities (see Table 3.3).\n\n| Table 3.3 Market risk        | 31/12/2020     | 31/12/2020                    | 31/12/2019     | 31/12/2019                    |\n|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                              | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement |\n| Total                        | 241,258        | 19,301                        | 188,431        | 15,075                        |\n| Interest-related instruments | 110,333        | 8,827                         | 139,633        | 11,171                        |\n| Share-related instruments    | 130,462        | 10,437                        | 48,015         | 3,841                         |\n| Currency-related instruments | 463            | 37                            | 783            | 63                            |\n\n## Weighting and requirements\n\nWe use the standardised approach for all types of market risk. The market risk of interest rate derivatives is included under Interest rate-related instruments; the market risk of sharerelated derivatives is included under Share-related instruments; and the market risk of currency derivatives is included under Currency-related instruments.\n\n## 4. Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. Within Van Lanschot Kempen, operational losses are classified using operational loss event types as set out in the Basel framework. Managing operational risks is the responsibility of line management (the first line of defence); this also includes the responsibility for information security and business continuity.\n\nWe have created a range of instruments for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing operational risks to support the bank's management in their roles as risk owners.\n\n- -Operational risk appetite : This appetite defines the level of - quantitative and qualitative - operational risk we are willing to accept. Exceeding this appetite requires the\n\nattention of the Executive Board and will lead to additional mitigation measures as necessary.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk and control self-assessment is a tool that allows line managers to systematically identify and assess risks so that steps can be taken to manage any risks outside the risk appetite. Risk and control selfassessments are carried out, at tactical (department) level, on the most important value chains of the organisation and on our most important programmes and projects. These assessments are re-performed periodically in order to reassess and update the existing operational risk level.\n- -Risk identification and assessment via risk and control self-assessments and scenario analysis:\n- \u00b7 Scenario analyses are used to assess low frequency but high-impact risks. The results of these analyses are used to provide insight into the adequacy of the Pillar 1 capital requirement vis-\u00e0-vis the operational risk profile.\n- -Risk response : Management is responsible for deciding how to treat risk, and whether to mitigate, accept or transfer (insure) it:\n- \u00b7 Action tracking : Action tracking is used to track progress made in the delivery of actions to mitigate identified risks, arising from risk and control selfassessments, failing controls, analysis of incidents or",

Broadly speaking, these policies are a combination of fraud and professional liability insurance, directors' liability insurance and various other liability and accident insurance policies.\n- \u00b7 Control effectiveness monitoring : To ensure that the most important risks (key risks) are mitigated sufficiently, key controls have been defined; these are assessed on a regular basis to determine their effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 Risk acceptance : If a risk is assessed to be outside of the risk appetite and it is not possible or economically viable to lower the risk, the risk can be accepted at Executive Board level.\n- \u00b7 Incident management : Risks that materialise through an incident are registered in our database via the incident management process. For severe incidents, root cause analyses are carried out. The incidents database allows the systematic recording and analysis of losses resulting from operational risks. It contains information about losses incurred as a result of operational risks in prior years and forms the foundation of the operational risk management measurement system for Van Lanschot and Kempen. A total of 140 incidents entailing a loss of more than \u20ac1,000 were logged in the database in 2020 (2019: 112 incidents).\n\n## -Risk monitoring :\n\n- \u00b7 Risk measurement : This is based on key risk indicators (early warnings), which highlight trends and/or provide prospective information about operational risks.\n- \u00b7 Risk meetings : Periodic meetings with risk owners are held to monitor the development of the risk profile in relation to the risk appetite.\n\n## Information security\n\nInformation security contributes to the protection of client and corporate information. Both automated and manual information processing are carried out. Taking the right measures on the basis of targeted risk analyses of business and IT processes ensures that both our client data and corporate data are adequately protected.\n\n## Business continuity management\n\nBusiness continuity has increased in significance due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Within Van Lanschot Kempen this is managed using a two-tier model with a crisis management team (CMT) at senior level and a crisis support team which is responsible for the execution of CMT decisions. The goal is to ensure the health of our employees and provide our services at the same level as before the pandemic. As part of this, the vast majority of our people are working from home. To keep our service levels up to par, business-critical teams are still working on our premises. Business continuity analyses are carried out as part of our business continuity management process in order to gain insight into critical processes and the resources needed to ensure continuity of service and address potential threats. Embedding business continuity management in the organisation is essential to give the bank sufficient resilience against the impact of an incident or disaster. Business continuity thus has universal scope within the bank; it comprises policies, standards and procedures\n\naimed at safeguarding critical processes or enabling a restart within a specified timeframe in the event of a disaster. The objective is to keep any financial, reputational and/or other material damage to a minimum, both for us and for our clients. Procedures are tested on a regular basis, with tests of fallback procedures and crisis governance carried out every year.\n\n## 5. Settlement risk\n\nWe are required to hold capital for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline, if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss.\n\nAt year-end 2020, financial transactions totalling \u20ac25 million (2019: \u20ac10 million) had to be reported in the context of settlement risk.\n\n## 6. CVA risk\n\nUnder the CRR, account must also be taken of the riskweighted assets in relation to credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which must be adequate to cover the risk of a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the counterparty in an OTC derivatives transaction. This CVA capital adequacy requirement is additional to requirements applying to the riskweighted assets in relation to the 'regular' default risk. We use the SA method to calculate the capital requirement for CVA.\n\n## 7. Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk can be defined as the threat to our results or equity resulting from failure to respond (adequately) to changes in environmental factors, or from incorrect strategic decisions. Environmental factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities. Strategic risk is not inherently undesirable, since there can also be an upside to taking on these risks. We take a forward-looking approach to strategic risk, keep a close eye on external developments and set our strategic priorities accordingly. Our strategy puts a strong focus on advanced data analytics, among other areas. Existing risk management practices and measures are assessed regularly to ensure that possible new risks that may arise from changes in strategic direction or in the business environment are captured adequately.\n\n## 8. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the exposure to adverse market interest rate movements, arising from banking book activities. Adverse interest rate movements may impact a bank's current and/or future earnings, capital and market value. Responsibility for IRRBB management has been delegated by the Executive Board to ALCO. Interest rate risks in non-banking book items are managed as part of market risk.\n\nOur main source of interest rate risk is the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. In general, assets have longer interest rate maturities than liabilities, contractually as well as behaviourally. We model client behaviour with respect to the prepayment patterns of mortgages and loans and the interest rate risk profiles of savings and current accounts. Client behaviour risk is another important source of interest rate risk, as actually observed client behaviour may deviate from assumptions. Differences between assumed and actually observed client behaviour could have a material adverse impact on future results.",

        "page_content": "We pursue a prudent interest rate risk policy that aims to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could affect future net interest income, while balancing the costs of hedging activities on current earnings. We manage interest rate risk from both a long- and a short-term perspective. The short-term interest rate risk is addressed mainly from a net interest income perspective (delta net interest income, or \u0394NII). This involves an analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\nIn 2020, all \u0394NII scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2020, the most adverse scenario was a non-parallel scenario in which short-term market rates fall over the next twelve months, with us being unable to reduce savings rates sufficiently. The \u0394NII for this scenario was -6.5% at the end of 2020 (end of 2019: -7.6%). Table 8.A shows the interest rate risk metrics.\n\n| Table 8.A Interest rate risk metrics   | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Delta net interest income (\u0394NII)       | -6.5 %       | -7.6 %       |\n| Delta economic value of equity (\u0394EVE)  | -1.4 %       | -6.9 %       |\n\nWe address long-term interest rate risk by means of the economic value approach, which looks at how movements in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities. The rule-of-thumb metric for economic value analysis is duration of equity, which indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on economic value, assuming a linear relationship between these parameters.\n\nIn the current interest rate environment, however, the relationship between economic value and interest rate changes is less linear due to, among other factors, \"floors\" in interest rates on various balance sheet items. For this reason, we focus not only on duration and delta NII, but also on the 'true' economic value changes under various scenarios, in which all interest rate cash flows are re-plotted and revalued at shocked interest rate curves. In calculating economic values, we use coupon rates that are 'stripped' from margins. In 2020, all delta economic value of equity (\u0394EVE) scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2020, the most adverse scenario was an instant upwards shock of 200 basis points. The \u0394EVE for this scenario was -1.4% at the end of 2020 (end of 2019: -6.9%).\n\nWe aim to neutralise the impact of differences in accounting classifications on interest rate steering. Hence, we mostly hedge the interest rate risk in fair value items in the banking book on a back-to-back basis, by means of interest rate swaps. By doing so, we make sure that Result on financial transactions - to the extent that it arises from banking book items - is only impacted by market changes in credit spreads over the swap curve and that there is no net impact from changes in the swap curve itself. For this reason, the \u0394NII scenarios we use to assess our interest rate risk profile do not affect the Result on financial transactions. We use hedge accounting to offset changes in the market value of derivatives that are used for hedging portfolios classified at amortised cost.\n\n## 9. Liquidity risk\n\nThe main objective of our liquidity risk management is to ensure that we are able to maintain or generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations in full as they come due, on acceptable terms. One of the key elements of our approach towards liquidity risk management is to maintain stakeholder confidence in the bank's solidity at all times.\n\nThe main source of liquidity risk that we are exposed to relates to the share of client deposits in our funding base. Although client deposits have proven to be relatively priceinelastic and sticky over time, the withdrawable nature of such deposits poses potential outflow risks, especially for those deposits not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS).\n\nThe roll-over risk with respect to maturing capital market funding is less substantial for us. We use capital market funding as a diversifying funding source from retail deposits, but have a limited number of deals outstanding with no concentration in tenors.\n\nTo manage liquidity risks, we use a forward-looking liquidity risk framework that enables the comprehensive measurement, evaluation and calibration of indicators related to liquidity risk. The framework consists of the risk appetite statement, the liquidity buffer, monitoring and reporting, forecasting, funding planning and contingency planning.\n\nLimits for liquidity risk are revised on an annual basis as part of the risk appetite statement. Limits set include, but are not limited to, levels of the liquidity coverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio and stress test survival periods, which are reported on a monthly basis to ALCO. The liquidity buffer is the main defensive element against liquidity risk, and the quality and size of the buffer are monitored frequently, along with in- and outflows in the client deposit base. Finally, each year we outline our capital and funding planning for a threeyear horizon, both under regular circumstances in the capital and funding plan, and under potential future stress or emergency situations in the liquidity contingency plan, complemented by the recovery plan.\n\nPart of our liquidity and funding planning is scenario analysis, of which stress testing is a key element. By means of stress testing, we assess our resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events - Van Lanschot Kempen-specific events, system-wide events, and a combination of these two.",

This results in a gap between the \"Withdrawable on demand\" and \"More than five years\" columns. Potential liquidity risks are addressed by means of monthly stress tests - discussed monthly in ALCO - that test the bank's resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events, and taking behavioural aspects into account.\n\nFor each transaction we have guaranteed, the maximum guaranteed amount is included in the relevant term bucket under which the bank first has the right to terminate the transaction. For each obligation arising from an irrevocable commitment, the committed amount is classified in the relevant term bucket under which we first have the right to withdraw the commitment.",

Securitisation risk\n\nWe treat securitisation as an asset class in our investment portfolio. We are not party to any synthetic securitisations and have no trading position in securitisation transactions.\n\n## Funding\n\nWe do not structure securitisations for other entities and have no outstanding securitisations in which we act as a seller and/ or servicer. We use retained covered bonds, issued out of our Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Programme 2, as a contingent liquidity buffer.\n\n## Investments\n\nPart of our liquidity investment portfolio is invested in RMBS. We invest only in the most senior and AAA tranches of RMBS transactions. If they comply with the simple, transparent and standardised (STS) requirements, these securitisations qualify as high-quality liquid assets in an assessment of the liquidity coverage ratio. All tranches are ECB eligible, meaning that they have at least two ratings from an external credit assessment institution (ECAI).\n\nAs the investments are part of the liquidity buffer, they can be used as collateral, in repo transactions, or sold if necessary. The RMBS portfolio represents a small share of the total investment portfolio.\n\n## Risk exposures within the investment portfolio\n\nThe credit risks of the investments are not hedged. Our investment portfolio as a whole is monitored by the Treasury and Credit Risk Approval departments on a daily basis. The portfolio is monitored on nominal limits as well as on credit risk limits.\n\n## Management\n\nInterest rate risk is limited, as RMBS are typically floating-rate notes. Interest rate risk is monitored at balance sheet level and includes the investment portfolio. We used the SECERBA methodology to calculate the total risk exposure of RMBS investments.",

        "page_content": "## 11. Climate change risk\n\nClimate change risk reflects the (physical and/or transitional) impacts of a change in the climate on Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position and/or reputation. The risk of climate change on our activities is periodically assessed. The climate change risk to our private banking activities (the most important lending portfolio here being the mortgage portfolio) is assessed to be limited and no separate lending restrictions are made. In asset management, climate change risks are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected.\n\n## 12. Compliance risk\n\nAs a specialist wealth manager, it is Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose to preserve and create wealth, in a sustainable way, for our clients and the societies we serve. When operating in financial markets, it is crucially important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, shareholders, employees and competent authorities, but also that we follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our values and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures and industry standards relevant to Van Lanschot Kempen. This increases the long-term sustainability of our business activities and helps us to fulfil our purpose.\n\nWe maintain a permanent, independent and effective compliance function to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk, i.e. the risk of failure by Van Lanschot Kempen to comply with regulations as applicable to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or of undertaking or failing to undertake those activities prohibited or mandated under applicable regulations. Additionally, we have put in place policies and procedures and systems and controls necessary to manage compliance risk.\n\nThe Compliance department is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chairman of the Statutory Board. The Compliance department fulfils its responsibilities by providing advice and assistance to Van Lanschot Kempen committees and staff, and by continuously monitoring adherence to regulations within Van Lanschot Kempen's day-to-day operations.\n\nCompliance risk has remained a focal point for Van Lanschot Kempen in 2020, both from an internal and an external perspective. Externally, 2020 has again brought significant changes to our regulatory landscape. Examples are the ongoing Brexit and Libor cessation processes, the implementation and development of the 5th and 6th AntiMoney Laundering (AML) Directives and the EU's new sustainable action plan, implemented through regulatory provisions such as the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the revised Benchmarks Regulation (BMR).\n\nWe are proactively responding to these external regulatory developments through the constitution of dedicated implementation working groups participated in by the Compliance team at Van Lanschot Kempen, as well as through other control functions within the firm. Special efforts have been dedicated to the implementation of various sustainability-related regulatory developments, and we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors.\n\nIn addition to these external regulatory developments, we have devoted, and continue to devote, substantial resources to the strengthening of our compliance framework and our Compliance team. In this context, the Executive Board has established a group-wide project to enhance our antifinancial crime framework and its policies, procedures and controls. We are currently well positioned to implement the enhancements identified by this overarching project. Finally, in 2019 and 2020 specific parts of Kempen & Co (as of 1 January 2020 part of Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management) were the subject of an investigation by the AFM regarding compliance with the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act (Wwft). This investigation has been concluded by the AFM. No formal enforcement measures have been imposed.\n\nSeparately, the Compliance team has continued to enhance the compliance framework through dedicated efforts to strengthen our policies and procedures across business lines as well as the compliance risk management programme. We have also continued to develop and deliver a dedicated compliance training programme for staff. The Compliance team was also strengthened in 2020 by the hiring of additional senior compliance experts, including a new head of anti-financial crime, and the establishment of a compliance management team. Further optimising Compliance is integral to our strategic direction.\n\n## 13. Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Statutory Board is responsible for devising and implementing an adequate system of internal control for our financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nWe have the following tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -A risk and control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -The findings from the review of the operational effectiveness of the internal control system by Internal Audit, which are discussed with the Executive Board, the Statutory Board, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Statutory Board and discussion of this by the Audit and Compliance Committee and by the Supervisory Board.\n- -The Van Lanschot Kempen Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles we pursue with respect to financial accounting;\n\nThe management teams of the relevant divisions have provided the Statutory Board with in-control statements on the extent of internal control, based on the results of testing procedures for the risk and control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported.

Fair value\n\n## 14.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA portion of the financial instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Tables 14.1.A and 14.1.B provide a breakdown of these instruments into three levels. The fair value is based either on quoted prices in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, or inputs based on data not observable in the market.\n\nWe have developed a policy on the criteria for allocating financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value to each of the three levels. A review is carried out at the end of each reporting period to determine whether any changes have taken place in the hierarchy between the levels.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. Using estimates, we make assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\nThe estimated present value of future cash flows is used to determine the fair value of the other financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rate is the same as the market interest rate at the reporting date for a similar instrument subject to the same conditions, taking into account collateral furnished under credit support annexes (CSAs).\n\nThe fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to forward exchange rates at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates and judgements made are based on past experience as well as other factors, including expectations with respect to future events that could reasonably occur given current circumstances. Estimates and judgements are assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial instruments in this category are assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on the best estimate of management by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, seasonality and credit spreads. A valuation technique is used in which at least one input that has a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. A significant effect on the instrument's valuation is considered to be present when the unobservable input accounts for at least 10% of the total instrument's fair value and exceeds a threshold of \u20ac50,000. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.\n\n|                                                                   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                                                            |           |           |           |           |\n| Financial assets from trading activities (FVtPL)                  | 56,622    | 4,576     | 480       | 61,678    |\n| Derivatives (FVtPL)                                               | 45,381    | 326,756   | 4,565     | 376,702   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 201,308   | 68,580    | 21,099    | 290,987   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 2,576,063 | -         | -         | 2,576,063 |\n| Total assets                                                      | 2,879,374 | 399,912   | 26,144    | 3,305,430 |\n| Liabilities                                                       |           |           |           |           |\n| Financial liabilities from trading activities (FVtPL)             | 26        | -         | -         | 26        |\n| Derivatives (FVtPL)                                               | 44,083    | 442,860   | 1,859     | 488,802   |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss        | -         | 655,730   | 85,139    | 740,869   |\n| Total liabilities                                                 | 44,109    | 1,098,590 | 86,998    | 1,229,697 |",

This divides the variables used into observable and unobservable market inputs. If the unobservable input variables are significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. An unobservable input variable is significant if the change in the fair value due to the application of the variable is greater than the threshold values. Our policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2020, our valuation technique remained unchanged, with non-observable input variables being assessed on significance. As a result of this assessment, some financial instruments included in Derivatives (assets and liabilities) and in Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss have been transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 and vice versa. The Derivatives receivables and payables and Financial liabilities\n\nat fair value through profit or loss were transferred to Level 2 as a result of the input variables' correlation and seasonality; the shorter remaining term to maturity of these financial instruments meant that these input variables qualified as nonsignificant, justifying a transfer to Level 2. In the case of Derivatives (assets), this entailed a transfer of \u20ac0.8 million from Level 2 to Level 3 and a transfer of \u20ac0.8 million from Level 3 to Level 2. In the case of Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, it involved a transfer of \u20ac0.0 million from Level 2 to Level 3. The transfer of Derivatives (liabilities) includes a \u20ac0.3 million shift from Level 3 to Level 2.\n\n## Breakdown of movements in financial assets and liabilities classified under Level 3\n\n|                                                             | At 1 January   | To statement of income   | To equity 1   | Issues      | Settlements   | Transfers   | At 31  December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Assets                                                      | Assets         | Assets                   | Assets        | Assets      | Assets        | Assets      | Assets            |\n| Financial assets from trading activities (FVtPL)            | 463            | 40                       | -             | -           | -23           | -           | 480               |\n| Derivatives (FVtPL)                                         | 6,539          | 604                      | -             | 18          | -3,357        | 761         | 4,565             |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss       | 13,539         | 7,442                    | -             | 118         | -             | -           | 21,099            |\n| Total assets                                                | 20,541         | 8,086                    | -             | 136         | -3,380        | 761         | 26,144            |\n| Liabilities                                                 | Liabilities    | Liabilities              | Liabilities   | Liabilities | Liabilities   | Liabilities | Liabilities       |\n| Derivatives (FVtPL)                                         | 3,410          | -1,263                   | -             | -           | -319          | 31          | 1,859             |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss | 9,111          | -2,085                   | -             | 4,000       | -7,195        | 81,308      | 85,139            |\n| Total liabilities                                           | 12,521         | -3,348                   | -             | 4,000       | -7,514        | 81,339      | 86,998            |\n| Total assets less liabilities                               | 8,020          | 11,434                   | -             | -3,864      | 4,134         | -80,578     | -60,854           |",

If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in Table 14.2 are estimated on the basis of the present value or using other estimation or valuation methods.\n\nTable 14.2 shows the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments at amortised cost, with the exception of line items Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks, Other assets and Other liabilities. For these financial instruments the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\n|                                                       | 31/12/2020 31/12/2019 Carrying  amount Fair value   | 31/12/2020 31/12/2019 Carrying  amount Fair value   |                  |                                                                                                                                                             |                                                            |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|                                                       | Fair value                                          |                                                     | Carrying  amount | Valuation method                                                                                                                                            | Significant observable and  unobservable market inputs     |        |\n| Assets                                                | Assets                                              | Assets                                              | Assets           | Assets                                                                                                                                                      | Assets                                                     | Assets |\n| Due from banks                                        | 210,420    210,584                                  | 297,444                                             | 297,556          | 2 Discounted cash flows using  applicable money market  rates                                                                                               | Interest rate and discount  rate                           |        |\n| Loans and advances to the public  and private sectors | 8,652,262   8,448,326   8,855,716   8,597,894       |                                                     |                  | 3 Discounted cash flows using  current market fees for  comparable loans and taking  into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty                | Interest rate, discount rate  and counterparty credit risk |        |\n| Other financial assets at amortised  cost             | 457,808    448,518                                  | 442,305                                             | 425,606          | 1 Quoted prices in active  markets                                                                                                                          | -

The additions to Goodwill and Client bases are due to the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers in the Netherlands in 2020; see 'Business combinations in 2020'.\n\nWe have defined six CGUs, namely Private Banking, Evi, Asset Management, Merchant Banking, Other and Nonstrategic investments. These correspond to our operating segments (see section on segment information) except for the Other activities segment, which is split between Other and Non-strategic investments. For impairment testing, goodwill was allocated to Private Banking, Asset Management, Merchant Banking and Non-strategic investments. The goodwill in Non-strategic investments relates to our subsidiary Holowell. Goodwill from the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers (\u20ac7.8 million) was allocated to CGU Private Banking.\n\nAt half-year 2020, we performed a goodwill impairment trigger analysis to determine whether the Covid-19 crisis is an impairment trigger for one or more of our CGUs. We concluded that a goodwill impairment test for the CGU Merchant Banking was necessary. For the CGUs Asset Management, Private Banking and Non-strategic investments the analysis showed that no impairment test was needed. The impairment test performed did not result in a goodwill impairment for Merchant Banking at half-year 2020.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, the Structured Products team was transferred from Merchant Banking to our Treasury department (part of the Other activities segment) in anticipation of the most recent strategic update and given the risk profile and complexity of the structured products activities. This transfer, which is in line with our most recent strategic update, has implications for our reporting structure. The results of the structured products activities will no longer be reported as part of Merchant Banking (Securities) but as part of the Other activities segment. As Van Lanschot Kempen's CGU structure is based on its reporting structure, we analysed whether goodwill should be reallocated to the units affected. It was determined that no goodwill should be reallocated to CGU Other.\n\nThe impact of the current economic crisis as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of the CGUs with allocated goodwill has been limited during 2020. Private Banking's activities are performing in line with expectations. This segment's operating profit before tax decreased mainly as a result of lower interest income and an addition to loan loss provisions (compared with a release in 2019). The net inflow of assets under management was historically high. Asset Management's operating profit before tax increased compared with the previous year and higher client assets were driven by net inflows and positive market performance. Merchant Banking's performance was in line with expectations.\n\n| Allocation of goodwill to CGUs (based on segments)   | 2020    | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Total                                                | 103,057 | 95,247 |\n| Private Banking                                      | 9,505   | 1,695  |\n| Asset Management                                     | 49,292  | 49,292 |\n| Merchant Banking                                     | 41,293  | 41,293 |\n| Non-strategic investments                            | 2,967   | 2,967  |\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen performed its annual impairment test on the goodwill arising from acquisitions in earlier years. To determine whether an impairment is necessary, the recoverable amount of each CGU is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is calculated on the basis of value in use. This calculation uses cash flow projections for each CGU for a five-year period. These projections are based on the current year and on the financial estimates for the years 2021 until 2025 used by management in its strategic forecast as per end of 2020. For the period after the explicit projections per CGU, the growth rate is set at the long-term market growth rate of 1.0%. This growth rate applies to all CGUs, as in the long term all CGUs will be impacted by the same economic market developments. The rate is based on our own projections and on wealth management market projections by market experts.\n\nManagement has compared the main assumptions against market forecasts and expectations. Cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and potential future trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on the estimates include stock and bond market developments, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in the client base, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. Cash flows are discounted using a cost of equity for each CGU which reflects the risk-free interest rate, supplemented with a surcharge for the market risk exposure of the CGU.\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discount rate for the cash flows in the impairment test for Non-strategic investments .\n\n| CGU                       |   Discount rate before tax % |   Discount rate before tax % |   Discount rate after tax % |   Discount rate after tax % |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                           |                       2020   |                       2019   |                      2020   |                      2019   |\n| Private Banking           |                          8.5 |                          8.6 |                         6.4 |                         6.7 |\n| Asset Management          |                         10.8 |                          9.6 |                         8.1 |                         7.5 |\n| Merchant Banking          |                         12.3 |                         10.9 |                         9.2 |                         8.5 |\n| Non-strategic investments |                         13.4 |                         11.2 |                        10.1 |                         9.1 |\n\nThe impairment test performed in 2020 did not result in goodwill impairments. The model uses two baseline scenarios. For the CGUs with allocated goodwill, a sensitivity analysis was also carried out, focusing particular attention on changes in long-term growth, the discount rate and the longterm EBIT margin. This analysis is captured in the sensitivity table below and underlines our conclusion that no impairment is needed.\n\nIn addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. For the line item Client bases, movements in the number of clients are assessed. The useful life tests carried out in 2020 provided no indication of a need for further examination, nor of impairments.",

Tax losses incurred can be offset against taxable profits in future years. Based on the most recent forecast, it is likely that the existing tax losses can be offset well before expiry. The non-current portion of deferred tax assets that is expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months amounts to \u20ac7.9 million. See Note 34, Income tax, for more information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Tax losses to be offset Financial year |\n|------------------------------------------|\n|                                     2015 |\n|                                     2016 |\n|                                     2017 |\n|                                     2018 |\n|                                     2019 |\n|                                     2020 |\n\n| Amount   | Final year for offsetting   |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 5,925    | indefinitely                |\n| 4,360    | indefinitely                |\n| 736      | indefinitely                |\n| 1,457    | indefinitely                |\n| 613      | indefinitely                |\n| -        |                             |\n\nThe total amount of tax losses is recognised as a deferred tax asset based on the prevailing tax rate.

In 2020, a loss amount of \u20ac1.1 million was set off against the current year result.",

The programme is a voluntary initiative of the ECB aimed at providing long-term funding to banks on attractive terms, with the aim of easing the credit conditions of the private sector and boosting bank lending to business. In respons to COVID-19, in Decision (EU) 2020/614 of 30 April 2020 the ECB provided for an additional temporary reduction in interest rates applied to all TLTROs-III under certain conditions which resulted in the funding containing a below-market rate of interest component. The TLTRO III loans are accounted for as a financial liability under IFRS 9 (at amortised cost), and collateralised by eligible securities. This programme has a maturity of three years with an optional redemption each quarter from September 2021 onwards. The interest rate is fixed at the end of maturity or at early redemption. The\n\nbenefit of the below-market rate of interest is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 and is included in the calculated effective interest rate of the loan. This is recognised in the income statement under \"Interest income calculated using the effective interest method\" over the term of the TLTRO III loans. Based on the current information, we expect to meet the eligibility criteria and thus receive the forecasted belowmarket rate of interest.",

Specifically, there is a pension scheme and a discount scheme for mortgage interest rates, as well as a long-service benefits scheme.\n\nThe following defined benefit schemes were valued for the purpose of the 2020 financial statements:\n\n- -The long-service benefits depend on the number of years of service.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen employees were eligible for discounted mortgage interest rates. Entitlement to this discount continued beyond retirement from active service. This plan was closed to new entrants after 2015.\n- -The early retirement plan concerns a limited number of employees who were working at the Belgian branch. The outstanding amount is diminishing as this plan has been terminated.\n- -Until year-end 2019, Kempen operated an average salary scheme under which 1.875% of the pensionable salary - salary less state pension offset, with an annual ceiling of \u20ac41,232 - was accrued for each year of service and which was based on a retirement age of 68. The surviving dependants' pension was insured on a risk basis.\n- -Both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme are in place for employees working at the Belgian branch. The pensionable salary for the defined benefit scheme is taken as the average basic salary over the last five years of service. The pension capital is insured with UKZT (Uitgesteld Kapitaal Zonder Tegenverzekering). The accompanying term life assurance is funded from risk premiums. The defined contribution pension plans have been set up according to the Belgian method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the defined contribution pension plans are treated as a defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.\n- -The pension plans of F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) have been set up according to the Swiss method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOnly within a Kempen pension scheme, plan assets fund the obligations (i.e. the scheme is funded). The other schemes are unfunded; payments in any year are made directly by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe pension schemes have been placed with insurers and a pension institution, which are responsible for the pension administration, risk insurance and communication of legal documents to employees who are scheme members. Decisions on and changes to pension scheme content are taken by an internal pensions committee. Where applicable, in the Netherlands the Works Council is consulted for its opinion and/or consent.\n\nThe pension schemes of Kempen and Van Lanschot were adjusted and replaced from 1 January 2020 by a single new plan. The new scheme is an individual defined contribution scheme. The former Van Lanschot scheme is classified as a collective defined contribution scheme, and the change of scheme has no impact from an accounting perspective. With the former Kempen scheme classified as defined contribution with guaranteed indexation, the termination of this scheme does have an impact, as the future accrual of entitlements in this plan will cease. This impact of \u20ac1.2 million has been processed as a plan amendment and was directly charged to the profit and loss account in the 2019 figures. Because there is still an obligation to pay guarantee costs and to provide indexation on the accrued pension benefits, the remainder of the provision (\u20ac35.0 million) stays on the balance sheet. As it has no legally enforceable right to use the surplus in plan assets for settling the obligations for indexation and guarantee costs, Van Lanschot Kempen applies an asset ceiling to the relevant assets in the pension scheme.\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.",

At the general meeting to be held on 27 May 2021, shareholders will be invited to approve the distribution of the dividend. If the general meeting approves the dividend proposal, we will pay out \u20ac0.20 in June and the remainder - in line with ECB and DNB advice - after 30 September 2021. Van Lanschot Kempen has postponed payment of its 2019 dividend, based on the recommendation\n\nof the ECB and DNB. The Statutory and Supervisory Boards believe that the 2019 dividend (\u20ac1.45 per share) can be paid to our shareholders as soon as circumstances related to Covid-19 allow and on condition that we remain in compliance with our stated capital ratio targets, but also after 30 September 2021. The 2019 dividend to be paid amounts to \u20ac59.4 million and is included in Other reserves.\n\n| Changes in reserves in 2019                     | Revaluation reserve financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income   | Actuarial results on defined benefit schemes   | Currency translation reserve   | Cash flow hedge reserve   | Own credit risk reserve   | Retained earnings   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| At 1 January                                    | -3,064                                                                                   | -29,910                                        | 104                            | -13,509                   | -11,394                   | 809,008             | 751,233 |\n| Net changes in fair value                       | 5,010                                                                                    | -                                              | -                              | -1,711                    | -                         | -                   | 3,298   |\n| Realised gains/losses through profit or  loss   | -523                                                                                     | -                                              | -                              | -                         | -                         | -                   | -523    |\n| Net reversal of impairment (to profit or  loss) | 408                                                                                      | -                                              | -                              | -                         | -                         | -                   | 408     |\n| Value change own credit risk                    | -                                                                                        | -                                              | -                              | -                         | 4,575                     | -                   | 4,575   |\n| Profit appropriation                            | -                                                                                        | -                                              | -                              | -                         | -                         | 15,194              | 15,194  |\n| Share plans                                     | -                                                                                        | -                                              | -                              | -                         | -                         | -2,608              | -2,608  |\n| Actuarial results                               | -                                                                                        | -7,772                                         | -                              | -                         | -                         | -                   | -7,772  |\n| Other changes                                   | -                                                                                        | -                                              | 768                            | -                         | -                         | -1,724              | -955    |\n| At 31 December                                  | 1,831                                                                                    | -37,682                                        | 872                            | -15,221                   | -6,819                    | 819,870             | 762,852 |\n| Tax effects                                     | -1,151                                                                                   | 2,490                                          | -                              | 437                       | -1,180                    | -                   | 596     |",

This investigation has been concluded by the AFM. No formal enforcement measures have been imposed.\n\nIn 2015, Van Lanschot Kempen started an appeal against the Dutch tax authorities ( Belastingdienst ) regarding the applied pro-rata percentage which is used for the calculation of its VAT returns in the Netherlands. In March 2020, the Court in Den Bosch ruled in favour of Van Lanschot Kempen. This ruling results in Van Lanschot Kempen being able to claim VAT from the Dutch tax authorities for the previous years (2014-19), which had already been paid. In August 2020, the Dutch tax authorities appealed against the ruling at the Supreme Court. All relevant documentation has now been sent to the Supreme Court. The indicated time frame for the Supreme Court's ruling is June-September 2021. Van Lanschot Kempen considers this material claim a contingent asset.\n\nThe following movements are related to the gross carrying amount of the contingent liabilities and the irrevocable commitments.

The decrease was mainly caused by lower interest rates as well as the run-off of the Corporate Banking portfolio. While the mortgage volume increased, lower interest rates led to reduced interest income on mortgages. A provision for interest payments in response to a ruling by the Dutch Financial Services Complaints Authority (Kifid) cut\n\ninterest income by a total \u20ac5.1 million in 2020. An additional interest claim of \u20ac1.0 million to be received from DSB Bank NV was recognised (2019: \u20ac3.9 million). Interest income includes interest  from TLTRO III of \u20ac2.1 million.

This balance reflects the revaluation result caused by changes in capital market yields in the marked-to-market portfolio and a number of derivatives positions.\n\nExceptional volatility and illiquidity in certain segments of the financial markets have led to pre-tax losses of \u20ac35.1 million in our structured product portfolio.

We offer structured products to our\n\nclients at Private Banking as part of our overall wealth management proposition - as an alternative investment product to help diversify their investment portfolios, with risks and returns tailored to the requirements of the client. In essence, this involves using company-issued debt with embedded derivatives linked to equity indices. The extreme volatility and illiquidity of the markets in reaction to the Covid-19 crisis that began in March 2020 made it impossible to make timely adjustments to these hedges, causing losses to mount.\n\n| 29.

Pension costs for defined contribution schemes include \u20ac1.1 million for Statutory Board members (2019: \u20ac1.1 million).\n\nPension costs for defined benefit schemes fell due to a change in the pension schemes. The pension schemes of Kempen and Van Lanschot have been replaced by a new individual defined contribution scheme as of 1 January 2020. The former Van Lanschot scheme was classified as a collective defined contribution scheme, and the former Kempen scheme was classified as defined contribution with guaranteed indexation.\n\nThe average number of staff in 2020 was 1,750 (2019: 1,834), or 1,630 in full-time equivalents (2019: 1,698), as shown below:\n\n| Average FTEs   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Total          | 1,630  | 1,698  |\n| Netherlands    | 1,444  | 1,515  |\n| Belgium        | 132    | 134    |\n| Other          | 53     | 49     |\n\n| Conditional depositary receipts for shares granted to staff (excluding Statutory Board)   | 2020    | 2019     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| At 1 January                                                                              | 150,613 | 222,930  |\n| Granted                                                                                   | 46,696  | 60,039   |\n| Vested                                                                                    | -84,241 | -127,107 |\n| Forfeited rights                                                                          | -844    | -5,249   |\n| At 31 December                                                                            | 112,224 | 150,613  |\n\nConditional depositary receipts for shares are granted to staff both under the variable remuneration policy for identified staff and the long-term share plan (LTP).\n\nThe fair value is determined based on the volume-weighted day price for depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares on the second trading day after release of Van Lanschot Kempen's annual figures. The fair value is equal to the share price less discounted value of expected dividends during the vesting period. Depositary receipts granted in 2020 had a weighted-average fair value of \u20ac16.10 (2019: \u20ac16.78).\n\nIn 2020, 10,296 conditional depositary receipts for shares were granted under the LTP to a number of senior managers other than members of the Statutory Board (2019: 12,540). The depositary receipts for Class A Van Lanschot Kempen shares will be granted in 2021 on the second trading day after the release of Van Lanschot Kempen's annual figures for 2020.\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nThe long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration to certain key employees, including identified staff. It offers a special type of variable remuneration in which the total variable pay takes the form of depositary receipts for Class A Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For the LTP, 60% of the Van Lanschot Kempen shares are awarded immediately and unconditionally, while 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of three years for LTP plans before 2020. For LTP plans from 2020 onwards, 40% are rewarded conditionally over a period of four years.\n\nConditional depositary receipts for shares will vest if:\n\n- (ii) Risks have been reviewed and no material, unforeseen risks have occurred; and\n- (i) Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows this in the year of vesting;\n- (iii) The individual has not left the company in the three or four-year period.\n\nConditional variable remuneration can be revised down if so prompted by risks and performances identified later (malus).\n\nEmployees do not receive any dividends during the vesting period. If an employee ceases to be employed by Van Lanschot Kempen within this period, their rights will be forfeited, except in limited circumstances judged on an individual basis.\n\nA part (around 50%) of the conditionally awarded depositary receipts is used to pay income tax.",

The transaction was effected by the transfer of 100% of the shares of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers to Van Lanschot Kempen. This acquisition is in line with our strategy and enables us to expand our assets under management. The acquisition involved amongst others the private banking client relationships, including \u20ac2.0 billion in client assets, 58.7 FTEs and the products and services of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers, giving Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over these activities. On 15 January 2021, Van Lanschot Kempen announced the completion of this transaction and took control effective December 2020. We thus consolidated Hof Hoorneman Bankiers in our statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, as part of our Private Banking segment.\n\nThe table below sets out the allocation of the acquisition price to the fair value of the acquired assets (including any identifiable intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date. The identifiable intangible assets reflect the acquired client base. The goodwill is attributable to the workforce and the profitability of the acquired business. The goodwill is included in the Private Banking CGU.\n\n| Hof Hoorneman Bankiers (\u20ac million)                    |   Fair value of  acquisition | Carrying amount  of acquisition   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             |                        106.3 | 106.3                             |\n| Due from banks                                        |                          2.3 | 2.3                               |\n| Property and equipment                                |                          3.5 | 2.1                               |\n| Intangible assets                                     |                         12.5 | 0.2                               |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss |                         10   | 10.0                              |\n| Loans and advances to the public and private sectors  |                         22.5 | 22.5                              |\n| Other assets                                          |                          9.7 | 9.7                               |\n| Total identifiable assets                             |                        166.8 | 153.1                             |\n| Due to banks                                          |                          1.9 | 1.9                               |\n| Public and private sector liabilities                 |                        128.3 | 128.3                             |\n| Other liabilities                                     |                          8.4 | 7.2                               |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                              |                          3.1 |                                   |\n| Total identifiable liabilities                        |                        141.7 | 137.5                             |\n| Total net assets                                      |                         25.1 | 15.6                              |\n| Goodwill                                              |                          7.8 |                                   |\n| Consideration                                         |                         32.8 |                                   |\n\nThe consideration includes a contingent amount of \u20ac1.2 million related to the earn-out agreement and is recognised under Other liabilities.

In view of this merger, the Executive Board decided to wind up the Kempen Management Investment Plan (MIP) in 2020. The dissolution of Co\u00f6peratie MIP and Stichting MIP was completed in Q4 2020. The certificates which Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV (VLKWM) and the employees of Kempen & Co held in Stichting MIP were\n\nbought from them for the nominal value of \u20ac1,000. There were 3,801 certificates outstanding with employees and 11,199 with VLKWM. There was no impact on the profit and loss account, as no incremental fair value was granted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Kempen MIP                                               | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Number of depositary receipts issued to Kempen employees | -            | 3,801        |\n| Legally required contribution by Van Lanschot Kempen (\u20ac) | -            | 100          |\n| Financial information for Kempen MIP                     | 2020         | 2019         |\n| Total assets                                             | -            | 16,285       |\n| Total liabilities                                        | -            | -            |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders                      | -            | 12,163       |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests         | -            | 4,122        |\n| Total income from operating activities                   | -            | 1,285        |\n| Total expenses                                           | -            | -            |\n| Taxes                                                    | -            | -            |\n| Net income                                               | -            | 1,285        |\n| Of which attributable to shareholders                    | -            | 959          |\n| Of which attributable to non-controlling interests       | -            | 326          |",

\u20ac973,000 for Constant Korthout (2019: \u20ac994,000); \u20ac973,000 for Arjan Huisman (2019: \u20ac994,000); and \u20ac973,000 for Richard Bruens (2019: \u20ac994,000).\n\n- 1 Expenses (in \u20ac1,000) recognised under IFRS-EU accounting for Van Lanschot Kempen shares differ due to treatment under IFRS 2. For 2020, expenses under IFRS for Karl Guha amounted to \u20ac432 (2019: \u20ac429), for Constant Korthout to \u20ac348 (2019: \u20ac346), Arjan Huisman to \u20ac348 (2019: \u20ac346), and for Richard Bruens to \u20ac348 (2019: \u20ac346). A proportion of fixed salary is paid in the form of Van Lanschot Kempen shares. Karl Guha received 19,456 shares (2019: 18,953) and the other members of the Statutory Board each received 15,677 shares (2019: 15,273). The number of shares granted is based on the average share price for the first four trading days of 2020: \u20ac19.92 (2019: \u20ac20.45). IFRS takes the share price at grant date as the basis for recognition. This price also amounted to \u20ac19.92 (2019: \u20ac20.45).",

The Group is comprised of several components and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section 'The scope of our group audit'.\n\n## Overview and context of the 2020 audit\n\nThe reliability and continuity of information processing is significant to the Company's operational, regulatory and financial reporting processes. Also, IT change initiatives (such as the implementation of digital solutions, moving infrastructure and applications to the cloud and the realisation of a more integrated IT environment across the Group) bring inherent operational and reputation risks that could also have an indirect and direct impact on the business and financial reporting processes of the Group. Since these change initiatives affect systems, (outsourcing) processes and the effectiveness of controls, they could affect the financial statements and our audit. We have therefore identified the reliability and continuity of IT systems as a key audit matter.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the statutory board made important judgements, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain including the impact of COVID-19. In the section 'Summary of significant accounting policies', subsection 'Significant accounting judgements and estimates' of the financial statements, the Group describes the areas of judgement in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Of the judgements and estimates mentioned in this section we considered the impairments of financial assets and the determination of fair value of financial instruments as most significant for the financial year 2020 and therefore also identified these two areas 'impairment of loans and advances to the public and private sector', 'fair value measurement of level 2 and 3 financial instruments', as key audit matters to our audit.\n\nOther areas of focus in our audit were the impairment of goodwill, assessment of compliance with laws and regulations and the accounting for the acquisition of Hof Hoorneman Bankiers N.V. Though these are areas of focus in our audit, these were not the matters of most significance in",

We therefore also included experts and specialists in the areas of IT, accounting and valuation of financial instruments, hedge accounting, impairment of goodwill, purchase price allocation, employee benefits and pensions, real estate valuation and taxation in our team.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 audit approach\n\n- -the impact on our audit materiality, including the basis on which our materiality is determined, outlined in the section 'Materiality;\n\nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak, auditors are facing challenges in performing their audits. In response to that, we have switched into working remotely. Inquiries and meetings with management were done via video conferencing. Teams and team members were reminded of the importance of staying alert to the quality of evidence and to perform sufficient and appropriate tests over the audit evidence obtained to be satisfied that the Group's records are complete, accurate and authentic. The following highlights the areas of focus in our audit that were primarily impacted by COVID-19:\n\n- -the impact on our Group audit.

We also have paid specific attention to the reliability and continuity of IT systems as described in the section 'Key audit matters' below;\n- -the impact on the Company's capital and liquidity position.\n- -the Company's impairment allowances on loans and advances to customers, fair value of financial assets and liabilities and impairment assessment of goodwill. Uncertainty of the current environment and the continual changing nature of the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has added further complexity and challenges when auditing accounting estimates. Our procedures included assessment of these accounting implications and the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in accordance with the financial reporting framework applied by Van Lanschot Kempen.

        "page_content": "## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below.\n\nThese, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing\n\nand extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\n\n| Overall Group materiality         | \u20ac3.8 million (2019: \u20ac4.1 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basis for determining materiality | We used our professional judgement to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgement, we used 5% of the  weighted average of profit before tax from continuing operations, excluding the gain from the sale of one of the Group's  non-strategic operations. The current and previous two years have been weighted with current year receiving twice the  weight in the measurement of materiality as we consider the current year to be more relevant (2019: 5% of profit before  tax from continuing operations, excluding the gain from the sale of one of the Group's non-strategic operations).                                                                                                                       |\n| Rationale for benchmark applied   | Based on the current year financial performance, which is impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 virus outbreak, we  reconsidered the use of the 5% profit before tax benchmark.  To avoid significant fluctuations (positive and negative) in our materiality calculation due to one-off events (e.g. the loss  in the structured products portfolio resulting from the extreme volatility and illiquidity of the markets in reaction to the  COVID-19), we assessed relevant performance indicators (i.e. PBT, CET1, operational income) and we deemed that a  three-year weighted average of 5% profit before tax, is the most appropriate alternative benchmark to apply in  calculating our materiality level for our audit 2020. |\n| Component materiality             | To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate materiality that is less than our overall  group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u20ac1,3 million and \u20ac3,8 million.  To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate materiality that is less than our overall  group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u20ac1.3 million and \u20ac3.8 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative reasons. Examples of areas that we focussed on due to qualitative reasons are the accuracy of disclosures around e.g. the impacts of COVID-19, fair value disclosure, and the remuneration of the supervisory board and the statutory board.\n\nWe agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac190,000 (2019: \u20ac200,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## The scope of our group audit\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this Group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate.\n\nIn establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the Group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit primarily focused on the significant component Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management N.V., as this component is considered to be individually financially significant to the Group. This component was subject to the audit of the complete financial information (full scope audit). Additionally, we selected four other components (Van Lanschot Belgian Branch, Van Lanschot\n\nParticipaties B.V., Kempen Capital Management B.V. and the in 2020 newly acquired Hof Hoorneman Bankiers N.V.) for full scope audit procedures as well as two other components (Quion 17 B.V. and Kempen Finance B.V.) for the audit of specific account balances, to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nCompared to prior years F. van Lanschot (Schweiz) AG is, taken its non-significance to the Group, not considered in scope as a component in the group audit 2020 anymore. Our local PwC auditors still perform statutory and regulatory audit procedures in line with prior years and we performed desktop review procedures over the financials of this component in line with other non-significant components.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n| Income from operating activities   | 95.1 %   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|\n| Total assets                       | 97.2 %   |\n| Profit before tax                  | 97.7 %   |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 3.1% of total group assets, profit before tax or income from operating activities. For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components.\n\nFor the components Van Lanschot Belgian Branch, Hof Hoorneman Bankiers N.V. and Quion 17 B.V., we instructed component auditors that are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work. For the other components, the group audit team performed the work.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether we have",

These instructions included amongst others our risk analysis, materiality and scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. Using virtual conferencing meetings, we were in active dialogue throughout the year with all component audit teams in scope for group reporting including upon the conclusion of their work. During these calls, we discussed the instructions, the significant accounting and audit issues identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters, which could be of relevance for the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNormally, the group engagement team visits the component teams and local management and reviews a selection of working papers of component auditors on a rotational basis.\n\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak limited our ability to physically visit any of the components in scope of our group reporting this year, we conducted a series of video conference meetings with local management along with component teams in the Netherlands and Belgium. During these meetings, we discussed the strategy and financial performance of the local businesses, as well as the audit plan and execution, significant risks and other relevant audit topics.\n\nDue to COVID-19 we were also not able to physically review a selection of working papers of selected component auditors, we therefore remotely performed virtual file reviews of the component auditors of the Belgium branch and Quion B.V.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items such as derivative financial instruments, hedge accounting impairments of goodwill and the impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sector.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen N.V. has outsourced various parts of its services to third parties amongst which: payment services, mortgage administration services and parts of its IT software management. In our assessment related to these service providers, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls in place at Van Lanschot Kempen N.V. over the outsourced services. Furthermore, where available, we evaluated the ISAE 3402 type 2 assurance reports rendered by independent auditors and/or we performed additional substantive audit procedures ourselves. Based on the procedures performed, we conclude that in the context of our audit of the financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen N.V., we could rely on the ISAE 3402 type 2 assurance reports in combination with our substantive audit procedures performed.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence\n\non the Group's financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Our focus on the risk of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Fraud\n\n- -to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud;\n\nThe objectives of our audit in respect to fraud are:\n\n- -to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate audit responses; and\n- -to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.\n\nAs in all of our audits, in assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the statutory board that may represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate tested the operating effectiveness, of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks, performed data analysis of high-risk journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgements for bias by Van Lanschot Kempen, we incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit and we have also involved our forensics specialist in our fraud risk assessment.\n\nWe refer to the key audit matters 'Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors' and 'Fair value measurement of level 2 and 3 financial instruments' that are examples of our approach related to an area with higher risk due to accounting estimates where management makes significant judgements.\n\nThe primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud lies with the statutory board with the oversight of the supervisory board.\n\n## Laws and regulations\n\nThere is an industry risk that emerging compliance or litigation areas have not been identified and/or addressed by management for financial statement purposes. This includes the consideration whether there is a need for the recognition of a provision or a contingent liability disclosure on the future outcome of legal or regulatory processes.\n\nThe objectives of our audit, in respect to non-compliance with laws and regulations:\n\n- -to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error when considering the applicable legal and regulatory framework.\n- -to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements due to non-compliance with laws and regulations; and\n\nIn line with Standard 250 we made a distinction between those laws and regulations which:\n\n- -have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.",

The Company determines loan impairments in stage 1 (allowance equal to twelvemonth expected credit loss), and stage 2 (amount equal to the life-time expected credit loss) on a modelled basis. For stage 3 exposures, a loan-by-loan impairment is determined on which a model overlay is applied to account for macro-economic variables and forward-looking information.\n\n## Model methodology and inputs (stage 1 and 2)\n\nFor the modelled loan impairments, the Company utilises the point in time probability of default (PD), the loss-given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD) models for the majority of the loan portfolio. The critical data elements as input for these models are retrieved from the core banking source systems. Three global macro-economic scenarios are incorporated into these models and the probability of the scenarios is weighted in order to determine the expected credit losses. When specific macro-economic exposures are not sufficiently covered by the models or when data limitations or other inherent model limitations are identified, a top-level adjustment is made.\n\n## Stage 3 - specific impairment allowance\n\nFor each individually impaired loan, the Company determines an impairment allowance based on the most likely scenario taking into account timely identification of impairment triggers, expected future cash flows, discount rates and the value and recoverability of the corresponding collateral. This impairment allowance is the neutral scenario (baseline). A model overlay is applied to calculate for alternative scenarios and the impact of macro-economic variables and forward- looking information. The final ECL is a weighted average over scaled ECLs under the neutral and alternative scenarios.\n\n## Judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\n- -the identification of impaired loans including the assessment for which loans credit risk has significantly (de)/increased since inception (stage transfers);\n\nThe judgements and estimation uncertainty in the impairment allowance of loans and advances is primarily linked to the following aspects:\n\n- -the determination of the future cash flows based on the appropriate use of key parameters (such as forward-looking information) and the valuation of the recoverable collateral for the specific loan by loan (stage 3) impairment allowance. Furthermore, the probability weighting of each impairment scenario in this category is inherently subjective in nature;\n- -the uncertainties related to the incorporation of the implications of COVID-19 in the ECL models (macro-economic scenarios and predictions, model performance, etc.); and\n- -the assumptions regarding the PDs, LGDs, LGN's and EADs applied, including the assumptions applied in overlay models in the model-based impairment allowances (stages 1 and 2);\n- -any top side adjustments that management applies across the model-based impairment allowances (stages 1 and 2).\n\nGiven the above, we consider this area to be subject to a higher degree of estimation uncertainty, where the estimate is impacted by a higher level of complexity, subjectivity and other inherent risk factors (e.g. COVID-19). Therefore, we consider the impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors as a key audit matter in our audit.\n\n## Control design and operation effectiveness\n\n- -the loan origination process;\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls in the following areas:\n\n- -the internal credit risk management process to assess the loan quality classification to identify impaired loans;\n- -the review and approval process that management has in place for timely, accurate and complete determination of stage 3 specific impairment allowances; and\n- -the methodology and controls applied in measuring and determining significant increase in credit risk;\n- -the review and approval process that management has in place for the outputs of the impairment models, and the top-level adjustments that are applied to the model outputs.\n\nBased on the testing of controls, we determined that it was appropriate to place reliance on the above controls for the purpose of our audit.\n\n## Assessment of model-based impairments stages 1 and 2\n\nWith support of our internal valuation experts, we challenged management on the model-based impairments (stages 1 and 2) by inquiry and review of the applied model methodology, the (updated) model performance monitoring dashboard, the evaluation of the macro-economic scenarios and macroeconomic variables applied and the assessment of stage transfers as at 31 December 2020.\n\nTaken the complexity of the model, together with our internal valuation experts and IT specialists, we performed the following:\n\n- -determined that appropriate change control policy and procedures are in place;\n- -determined that the model was assessed fit-for purpose and periodic model monitoring is in place to ensure the models are still suitable for its intended use;\n- -determined that management uses appropriate skills and knowledge in using the model;\n- -tested operating effectiveness of relevant controls (e.g. controls around automated interfaces) that safeguard completeness and accuracy of significant assumptions and data throughout the estimation process;\n- -performed substantive procedures over maintenance of completeness and accuracy of data and significant assumptions through the estimation process;\n- -determined whether the significant assumptions (e.g. macro-economic scenarios, PDs, LGD's, LGN's and EAD's) used by management to develop the estimate are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework; and\n- -determined whether the data (e.g. contractual terms of financial assets, macro-economic predictions) are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework and are relevant and reliable in the circumstances.\n\nFinally, together with our internal valuation experts, we specifically addressed the implications of COVID-19 on the ECL models by performing the following:\n\n-\n\nwe verified whether changes were needed and whether appropriate\n\n- -we performed enquiries with the departments Group Risk Management, Special Recovery & Restructuring, and Finance, Reporting & Control;\n\nchanges were made to models, underlying assumptions and/or staging\n\n- -we reconciled the applied updated macro-economic predictions with the latest publications of the external parties (i.e. CPB and DNB);\n\npolicy following the implications of COVID-19;\n\n- -we assessed the sensitivity analysis performed by management related to, amongst others, the applied macro-economic forecasts; and\n- -we assessed management overlay amounting to \u20ac4.9 million by verifying management's assumptions and methodology in deriving this overlay.\n\nBased on the above, we assessed that the methodology and inputs for the stage 1 and 2 models to be in line with market and industry practice.\n\n## Assessment of specific impairment allowance stage 3\n\n- -the total loan portfolio to gather evidence as to the correct classification of exposures as being in stage 1, 2 or 3; and\n\nConsidering the inherent estimation risk of individually impaired loans, we performed risk-based sample testing for which we selected samples from:\n\n- -the stage 3 population to gather evidence as to the correct estimate for the impairment allowance was made by management\n\nIn the selection of our risk-based sample, we specifically considered the implications of COVID-19 for certain industries deemed to be at higher-risk (e.g. leisure, hospitality and commercial real estate).\n\nWe analysed the latest developments at the borrower as described below and considered whether the key judgements applied in the impairment allowance are acceptable for the balance as at 31 December 2020.",

Therefore, we consider the valuation of level 2 and 3 financial instruments as a key audit matter in our audit.\n\nThe following judgemental areas were tested for the risk-based sample: classification as a performing or non-performing loan based on the (non-)existence of triggering events;\n\nnature and accuracy of the assumptions and data related to expected future cash flows with reference to the current economic performance (including implications of COVID-19), the assumptions most commonly used in the industry, and a comparison with external evidence or historical trends (if applicable); and\n\nthe valuation of the corresponding collateral (e.g. using appraisal reports and/or other information) with support of our valuation experts, with reference to industry standards and the inspection of legal agreements and supporting documentation to confirm the existence and legal right to collateral.\n\nBased on the above, we assessed the methodology and inputs in determining the stage 3 impairment allowance to be in line with market and industry practice.\n\nFinally, we assessed the completeness, accuracy and adequacy of the disclosures relating to the provision for impairment losses, as disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements, to evaluate compliance with disclosure requirements included in EU-IFRS 9.\n\n## Control design and operating effectiveness\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the governance over the applied valuation models, the financial instrument deal capturing process, the source data management and the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on these controls for the purpose of our audit.\n\n## Assessment of the fair value valuation of financial instruments\n\nTaken the complexity of the fair value valuation for each type of level2 and 3 instruments, together with our internal valuation experts, we applied a combination of testing how management made the estimate and developed our own auditor's point estimate or range. Specifically, we performed the following:\n\nFor financial instruments tested by means of how management made the estimate, we:\n\n- -determined that the models were validated prior to usage and when there were changes to the model, periodic reviews are in place to ensure it is still suitable for its intended use.\n\nFor financial instruments for which we developed our own auditor's point estimate or range, we:\n\n- -developed for a sample of financial instruments our own auditor's point estimate or range.\n\nFor both testing strategies applied, we:\n\n- -determined that management uses appropriate skills and knowledge in using the model;\n- -determined that appropriate change control policy and procedures are in place;\n- -performed substantive procedures over maintenance of completeness and accuracy of data and significant assumptions through the estimation process;\n- -determined whether the significant assumptions (e.g. discount rate, projected future cash flows) used by management to develop the estimate are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework;\n- -tested operating effectiveness of relevant controls (e.g. controls around automated interfaces) that safeguard completeness and accuracy of significant assumptions and data throughout the estimation process;\n- -determined whether the data (e.g. risk-free rate, market data related to similar transactions and contractual terms and conditions of the instruments) are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework and are relevant and reliable in the circumstances; and\n- -reconciled the assumptions and data to available external resources.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the impact study performed over the \u20ac35.1 million (pre-tax) loss due to COVID-19 on the Structured Products desk incurred in 2020 and the measures taken to reduce future risk of re-occurrence.\n\nBased on the above addressed procedures, we found that management's outcome of the models and classification of the fair value of the level 2 and 3 financial instruments are reasonable.\n\nWe assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to the financial instruments measured at fair value and verified compliance with disclosure requirements from EU IFRS 7.",

In this way, the Group is accommodating the ongoing regulatory changes imposed to the banking industry. These projects result in changes in several of the Group's control activities related to financial reporting. This could increase the risk of material misstatement in financial reporting.\n\nWe consider the integration of the Belgian branch's IT environment into the environment managed in the Netherlands ('Project Minerva') one of the most significant IT projects that were completed during the year.\n\nDeficiencies in ITGCs as such could have a pervasive impact across the Group's internal control framework. Also, outsourcing activities within the Group and to third party service providers is considered an additional focus area to our audit as this brings extra complexity to the IT environment. Through the period of change, there is an increased risk that ITGCs are not operating as intended.\n\nAs a result of the above changes, in combination with the increased threat and probability of cyberattacks following COVID-19, we identified the reliability and continuity of information technology of the Group as a key audit matter.\n\nWe focused on the ITGCs to the extent relevant for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit, our efforts were focused on:\n\n- -governance over the strategic IT transformational projects including vendor risk and third-party assurance;\n- -entity-level controls over information technology in the IT organisation, including IT governance, IT risk management and cybersecurity management;\n- -for the procedures performed on the outsourced activities relevant to our audit scope, we refer to the section 'The scope of our group audit' above;\n- -management of changes to applications and IT infrastructure, including the change of the management process and the implementation of changes in the production systems;\n- -management of access to programmes and data, including user access to the network, access to and authorisations within applications, privileged access rights to applications, databases and operating systems;\n- -computer operations, including batch monitoring, back-up and recovery and incident management; and\n- -management of cybersecurity, through understanding of the Group's approach to enhancing and managing cybersecurity.\n\nThe integration of the Belgian branch's IT environment into the environment managed in the Netherlands was part of our audit procedures. We performed both controls testing and test of details to evaluate on the proper migration of data relevant to the audit of the financial statements and to address the risk that controls do not function properly as a result of the change.\n\nWe evaluated the Group's assessment and procedures related to the COVID-19 situation (for both internal and key outsourced systems). We have not identified significant impact on the IT environment or cyberattacks due to the COVID-19 situation during the year under audit.\n\nOur audit procedures indicate that we could place reliance on these controls for the purpose of our audit.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things, of the following:\n\n- -Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- -Concluding on the appropriateness of the statutory board's use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the statutory board.\n- -Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the\n\nsignificance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicated with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information' of this assurance report.\n\nWe have performed our review in accordance with Dutch\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of Van Lanschot Kempen in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO - Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other for the engagement relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA - 'Dutch Code of Ethics').\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS - Regulations for quality systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe sustainability information needs to be read and understood in conjunction with the reporting criteria. The statutory board of Van Lanschot Kempen is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the sustainability information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the internally applied reporting criteria, as disclosed in the section 'Reporting principles' of the 'our value creation story 2020' supplement. The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our review\n\nThe sustainability information includes prospective information such as expectations on ambitions, strategy, plans and estimates and risk assessments. Inherently, the actual results are likely to differ from these expectations. These differences may be material. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and the achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information.\n\nThe links to external sources or websites in the sustainability information are not part of the sustainability information reviewed by us. We do not provide assurance over information outside of the section mentioned in paragraph 'What we have reviewed'.\n\n## Responsibilities for the sustainability information and the review\n\nThe statutory board of Van Lanschot Kempen is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate sustainability information in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in section 'reporting criteria', including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The choices made by the statutory board regarding the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are summarized in the section 'Reporting principles' of the 'Sustainability Supplement 2020' supplement. The statutory board is responsible for determining that the applicable reporting criteria are acceptable in the circumstances.\n\nResponsibilities of the statutory board and the supervisory board\n\nThe statutory board is also responsible for such internal control as the statutory board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.",

Its policy is solely aimed at pursuing what is described in its objects clause as included in Article 2 of its Articles of Association ( statutaire doelomschrijving ). Its activities exclusively concern holding and managing shares in Van Lanschot Kempen; the Stichting does not engage in any commercial activities.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, at every Van Lanschot Kempen general meeting the Stichting grants a proxy to depositary receipt holders that either attend the meeting in person or are represented by a third party. In other words, depositary receipt holders can always vote at their own discretion for the number of shares for which they hold depositary receipts.\n\nIn 2020, the Stichting's activities consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Convening board meetings (at which the matters mentioned below were discussed);\n- \u00b7 Attending Van Lanschot Kempen's general meeting;\n- \u00b7 Granting proxies for Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings;\n- \u00b7 Exercising the voting rights on Van Lanschot Kempen shares held by the Stichting at Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings, to the extent that no proxies had been granted to depositary receipt holders; and\n- \u00b7 Holding a meeting of the holders of depositary receipts.\n\nThe Stichting will continue to pursue its policies and activities in 2021 in accordance with its objects clause and in keeping with past practice.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV. Costs incurred typically only consist of the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountants' fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2021 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2020.\n\nThe outbreak of the Covid-19 virus in 2020 has had significant consequences for the global economy. In view of the nature of the activities of the Stichting and especially the fact that it does not conduct any commercial activities, it has not been directly impacted by the consequences of the pandemic. The Board is not aware of any indication (and therefore has no expectation) that the pandemic will in any way impact on the funding provided to the Stichting by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Board meetings\n\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2019 financial statements;\n\nIn 2020, the Board held three board meetings, on 22 April 2020, 7 October 2020, and 16 November 2020. Topics covered in these meetings included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen, also in light of the consequences of the measures in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 the proposals related to the remuneration policy in respect of Van Lanschot Kempen's Statutory and Supervisory Boards as well as the remuneration report;\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 28 May 2020 ('the AGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2020 half-year results;\n- \u00b7 The manner in which the Stichting will perform its obligations under the Dutch implementation act in relation to the registration of the ultimate beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities; and\n- \u00b7 The preparations in relation to the meeting of holders of depositary receipts of 16 November 2020;\n- \u00b7 The re-appointment of Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen and Ms C.M.P. Mennen-Vermeule as members of the Board and the composition of the Board more generally.\n\n## Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings\n\nThe Board attended the AGM and the Stichting granted proxy votes to holders of depositary receipts for shares that attended the meeting in person or were represented by third parties. This enabled these depositary receipt holders to vote at their own discretion for the number of Class A ordinary shares corresponding to the depositary receipts of Class A ordinary shares held by them at record date. The Stichting voted, at its own discretion, on the Class A ordinary shares for which no proxy votes had been requested. Such shares represented 34.2% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the AGM.\n\nThe Board carefully considered each of the items put to the ballot. With regard to the proposals related to the remuneration policy in respect of Van Lanschot Kempen's Statutory and Supervisory Boards, as well as the remuneration report, the Board took into consideration the reactions of various stakeholders as well as discussions conducted with respect thereto between the members of the Board and the chairman of the Remuneration Committee of Van Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board. After due consideration the Board decided to vote in favour of all items put to the ballot, including the items relating to the remuneration policy and the remuneration report.\n\n## Meeting of depositary receipts holders and composition of the Board\n\nIn 2020, two vacancies arose due to the expiry of the current terms of Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen and Ms C.M.P. Mennen-Vermeule in accordance with the appointment schedule. Both Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen and Ms C.M.P. Mennen-Vermeule were available for reappointment.",

The Stichting pursues its purpose by acquiring Class C preference shares in the capital of Van Lanschot Kempen, and by exercising the rights attached to these shares.\n\nThe Stichting and Van Lanschot Kempen have signed a call option agreement granting the Stichting the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. When acquiring Class C preference shares, the Stichting is required to pay a minimum of 25% of the nominal amount. To ensure it will be able to pay when the time comes, the Stichting has a funding agreement with ING Bank in place. Van Lanschot Kempen aims to keep any period with outstanding Class C preference shares as brief as possible, and has committed itself to a maximum of one year as the term within which Van Lanschot Kempen will propose to the general meeting to redeem any Class C preference shares.\n\nThe Stichting's policy is exclusively aimed at pursuing the purpose as described above. It does not in any way engage in commercial activities, or any other type of activities as long as there are no circumstances that, pursuant to its objects clause, would give the Stichting cause to act and exercise its powers.\n\nIn 2020, the Stichting's activities consisted of convening a Board meeting as well as holding ad hoc consultations as and when required.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen Wealth Management NV. Costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of a commitment fee due to ING Bank in relation to the funding agreement, the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountancy fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2021 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2020.\n\nThe outbreak of the Covid-19 virus has had significant consequences for the global economy. In view of the nature of the activities of the Stichting and especially the fact that the Stichting does not conduct any commercial activities, the Stichting has not been directly impacted by the\n\nconsequences of the pandemic. The Board is not aware of any indication (and therefore has no expectation) that the pandemic will in any way impact on the funding provided to the Stichting by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2020, the Board convened for one meeting, on 15 June 2020. Topics discussed at that meeting included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen in light of the Covid-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 The loan facility of the Stichting with ING Bank; and\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's figures for 2019;\n- \u00b7 The minutes of the Board meeting of 25 June 2019.\n\n## Extension of loan facility\n\nThe term of the loan facility of the Stichting with ING Bank was due to expire on 31 December 2020. In cooperation with ING Bank the Stichting extended the term of the loan facility until 31 December 2023, under materially the same terms.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nThe Board appoints its own members.\n\nThe present members of the Board are:\n\nA.A.M. Deterink, Chairman\n\nP.J.J.M. Swinkels\n\nH.P.M. Kivits\n\nMr Deterink is a former partner of Deterink Advocaten en Notarissen.\n\nMr Swinkels is the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bavaria.\n\nMr Kivits is the former Chairman of Stage Entertainment.\n\nThe annual remuneration of the Chairman of the Board amounts to \u20ac10,000 (excluding VAT), and that of each other Board member to \u20ac7,500 (excluding VAT).\n\n## Expenses\n\nOther expenses incurred by the Stichting amounted to \u20ac125,312 in 2020.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Stichting is a legal entity independent of Van Lanschot Kempen, as referred to in Section 5:71 (1) sub-paragraph (c) of the Financial Supervision Act (Wft).\n\n## The Board\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 28 January 2021",

        "page_content": "## GLOSSARY\n\n## Advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB)\n\nThe most sophisticated credit risk measurement technique. Under A-IRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under A-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity (M).\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThe amount for which financial assets or liabilities are initially recognised less redemptions, plus or minus accumulated depreciation/amortisation using the effective interest rate method for the difference between the original amount and the amount at maturity date, less impairments or amounts not received.\n\n## Assets under administration (AuA)\n\nAssets which are entrusted by clients to Van Lanschot Kempen purely for custody or for which solely administrative services are performed. Clients take their own investment decisions, over which Van Lanschot Kempen has no influence.\n\n## Assets under discretionary management\n\nClient assets entrusted to Van Lanschot Kempen under a discretionary management agreement, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (Van Lanschot Kempen index guarantee contracts) or cash.\n\n## Assets under management (AuM)\n\nAssets deposited with Van Lanschot Kempen by clients, breaking down into assets under discretionary management and assets under non-discretionary management.\n\n## Assets under monitoring and guidance\n\nClient assets that are only subject to monitoring, plus minor advisory and related services. Clients make their own investment decisions and Van Lanschot Kempen has little or no influence on the management of these assets.\n\n## Assets under non-discretionary management\n\nClient assets held for clients by Van Lanschot Kempen, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (index guarantee contracts) or cash, with either a Van Lanschot Kempen investment adviser advising the client on investment policy or clients making their own investment decisions without Van Lanschot Kempen's input.\n\n## Basel III\n\nThe framework drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which introduces a stricter definition of capital and several new ratios and buffers with which banks must comply.\n\n## Basel IV\n\nThe reform of Basel III, commonly referred to as 'Basel IV', involves the final calibration and design of capital output floors, based on revised standardised approaches. It also includes reforms of the IRB approach and the standardised approach for credit and operational risk.\n\n## Capital conservation buffer\n\nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) requires Van Lanschot Kempen to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to 2.5 times total risk exposure as a capital conservation buffer. If an institution fails to maintain this capital conservation buffer, it will be restricted in making discretionary distributions.\n\n## Cash flow hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nInstruments to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in cash flows of assets, liabilities or future transactions, arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation.\n\n## Client option positions\n\nClients are unable to buy or sell share options directly on the stock exchange. Van Lanschot Kempen purchases or sells on behalf of these clients and covers this with offsetting transactions on the stock exchange. Such receivables and payables are recognised under Derivatives.\n\n## Combined buffer requirements\n\nFrom 2016, subject to transitional provisions, institutions have been required to maintain capital buffers in addition to the own funds requirements contained in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). For Van Lanschot Kempen, the combined buffer requirement consists of the capital conservation buffer extended by the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer. The G-SII buffer, O-SII buffer and systemic risk buffer are not applicable to Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital\n\nAlso referred to as core capital. CET 1 capital encompasses a bank's share capital, share premium and other reserves, adjusted for deductions as specified by regulators, such as goodwill, deferred tax assets and IRB shortfall.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio\n\nCET 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAll commitments arising from transactions for which the bank has given a guarantee to third parties.\n\n## Countercyclical capital buffer\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to the total risk exposure amount (calculated in accordance with the CRR) multiplied by the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates. The countercyclical buffer rates are set by the designated authority in each member state on a quarterly basis. The buffer is determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the jurisdictions of the relevant credit exposures.",

Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.",

        "page_content": "## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in active markets (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. On the basis of its estimates, Van Lanschot Kempen selects a number of methods and makes assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial assets in this category have been assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on management's best estimate by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market.\n\n## Leverage ratio (LR)\n\nThe leverage ratio represents the relationship between total assets plus contingent items and the Basel III Tier 1 capital. It is calculated in accordance with the Delegated Act.\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR represents the ratio between high-quality liquid assets and the balance of cash outflows and cash inflows in the next 30 days.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the bank has insufficient liquid assets available to meet current liabilities in the short term.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD) Basel\n\nAn estimate of the loss for Van Lanschot Kempen after liquidation of the received collateral.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD) IFRS 9\n\nThe loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is typically expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk that the value of a financial position changes due to movements in stock exchange prices, foreign exchange and/ or interest rates.\n\n## Morningstar\n\nMorningstar rates mutual funds and ETFs from 1 to 5 stars based on how well they have performed in comparison to similar funds and ETFs.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe relationship between available stable funding and the required amount of stable funding.\n\n## Non-performing loans (NPL)\n\nLoans are classed as non-performing if they meet one or more of the following criteria: 1) significant limit overrun for a period of more than 90 days; 2) a probability of default of 1; 3) a provision has been taken; 4) forborne exposures for which the two-year probation period has not started.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe risk of direct or indirect losses as a result of inadequate or defective internal processes and systems, inadequate or defective human acts, or external events.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe NPS provides information on client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in entities that are fully consolidated by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## OECD Guidelines\n\nThe OECD Guidelines describe what the Dutch government expects from multinational enterprises when it comes to corporate social responsibility. The Guidelines provide companies with guidance in the field of e.g. supply chain management, human rights, child labour, environment and corruption.\n\n## Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)\n\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in investment policies.\n\n## Probability of default (PD) Basel\n\nThe likelihood that a client will default within one year.\n\n## Probability of default (PD) IFRS 9\n\nThe probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time during the assessed period if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.\n\n## Proxy voting\n\nKempen regards it as its fiduciary responsibility to vote at shareholder meetings for its own (Kempen) funds and - at the request of clients - for discretionary mandates. Its proxy voting policy describes how it fulfils this responsibility. kempen.nl/proxyvoting\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\n\nSecurities backed by residential mortgages. A provider of residential mortgages (typically a bank) will sell these on to a separate entity, a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To finance the mortgages, the SPV will then issue securities called RMBS, which are secured by the mortgages.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nThe assets of a financial institution after being adjusted by a weighting factor, set by its regulators, that reflects the relative risk attached to the relevant assets. Risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the minimum amount of capital the institution needs to hold. CRR/CRD IV uses the term 'total risk exposure amount' instead of RWA, but for now we follow common usage.\n\n## SEC-ERBA\n\nSecuritisation: External-ratings-based approach.. Provided that securitisations meet operational requirements and have an external rating, the risk weight of a securitisation can be derived from, among other factors, the external rating, seniority and tranche maturity.",
