Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact and may contain the terms 'may', 'will', 'should', 'continue', 'aims', 'estimates', 'projects', 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'plans', 'seeks' or 'anticipates', or words of similar meaning. Such statements are based on Management's current views and assumptions and, by nature, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties; therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them. Actual financial condition, results of operations, performance or events may di/ffer materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors including, without limitation, general economic and political conditions and competitive situation; future financial market performance and conditions, including fluctuations in exchange and interest rates; frequency and severity of insured loss events, and increases in loss expenses; mortality and morbidity levels and trends; persistency levels; changes in laws, regulations and standards; the impact of acquisitions and disposal, including related integration issues, and reorganization measures; and general competitive factors, in each case on a local, regional, national and/or global basis. Many of these factors may be more likely to occur, or more pronounced, as a result of catastrophic events,  including weather-related\n\ncatastrophic events, pandemics or terrorist-related incidents. Please refer to Part/uni00A05  'Risk Factors and Risk Management' of this Annual Report for a description of certain important factors, risks and uncertainties that may a/ffect AXA's business and/or results of operations, particularly in respect of the COVID-19 crisis. AXA undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether to reflect new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition to the Consolidated Financial Statements, this Annual Report refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures, or alternative performance measures, used by Management in analyzing the Group's operating trends, financial performance and financial position and providing investors with additional information that Management believes to be useful and relevant regarding the Group's results. These non-GAAP financial measures generally have no standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similarly labelled measures used by other companies. As a result, none of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part/uni00A06  'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Group are defined in the Glossary set forth in Appendix/uni00A0V to this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

COVID-19 caused an unprecedented health, economic and social challenge. All of us were affected, changing the way we work and live, all too o/f\\_t en su/ffering or seeing loved ones su/ffer.\n\nIn this crisis, AXA played its role, taking care of all its stakeholders. We protected our employees from the virus, by providing them with the tools required to work from home in record time. We served our customers, who o/f\\_t en faced di/fficult situations, taking exceptional measures to help them through di/fficult health, financial and other circumstances. As a major health actor, AXA extended coverage and services to healthcare professionals in several countries and leveraged its own medical networks and teleconsulting services to contribute to the healthcare e/ffort. We further demonstrated our commitment to society by contributing to solidarity e/fforts and stepping up the funding we allocate to research on infectious diseases. We acted as a responsible corporate citizen by maintaining both employment and remuneration of our employees and declining any form of government assistance. Finally, we took care of our shareholders by paying a dividend, whilst heeding the calls for prudence from our regulators and supervisors.\n\nIn this demanding context, AXA once again demonstrated its resilience and continued its transformation and simplification journey. The sale of our activities in Central and E astern Europe was completed. AXA further announced the sale of its operations in the Gulf Region and in Greece, as well as the combination of its Property & Casualty operations in India, Bharti-AXA GI, with ICICI- Lombard .\n\nAXA's employees, agents and partners deserve my most heartfelt thanks for their engagement, their flexibility and their professionalism in 2020. With the active engagement of our CEO Thomas Buberl and Management Committee, they have delivered very strong results during one of the most challenging years on record.\n\nWhilst COVID-19 and extreme weather conditions have had a negative impact on our 2020 earnings, we finished 2020 with a very strong solvency position at 200%. A/f\\_ter taking into account the continued need for prudence given the on-going nature of the COVID-19 crisis and carefully considering the interests of all stakeholders including the ACPR's recent recommendations as well as a number of other factors\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsuch as the Company's current and projected solvency and cash positions over the next three years in various stress test scenarios and the potential impacts of COVID-19 on AXA's business going forward, the Board of Directors decided to propose a dividend of Euro/uni00A0 1.43 per share.\n\n2020 changed the world and many evolutions are here to stay. AXA's strategic choices appear more relevant than ever for the post-COVID world:\n\n- /uni25A0 health is back as a top focus for individuals and companies, as the yearly edition of our Future Risk Report demonstrated. As a global leader in health insurance, AXA is well positioned to address the ensuing needs;\n- /uni25A0 the digitalization of our economy has leapt forward, opening new avenues for our corporate insurance activities and our 'phygital' capabilities;\n- /uni25A0 the pandemic has also underlined how vulnerable our societies are to natural hazards, and thus brought renewed focus to climate change. AXA, with its acknowledged leadership position in the environmental space, as well as dedicated offers and rigorous investment practices, is best positioned to shape the debate in this crucial field;\n- /uni25A0 the pandemic's terrible economic consequences, which a/ffected the livelihoods of many, also created a moral obligation to help prevent people from falling back into poverty, especially in developing and less developed countries. AXA's Emerging Customers operations, which now insure more than 22/uni00A0million people across the world, give us a head start for tackling this challenge.\n\nI am thus confident that, with its new strategic plan 2020-2023, AXA is well positioned for the next steps of its journey, being true to its purpose: 'acting for human progress by protecting what matters'. On behalf of all Board members,/uni00A0I express our trust in Thomas Buberl and the Management Committee members to lead AXA through this challenging period and achieve the objectives of the 2020 -2023/uni00A0strategic  plan.\n\nDenis Duverne\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors",

The swift outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in uncertainty for all, hardship for many and grief for some. Individuals, organisations and communities were a/ffected to varying extents, but without exception.\n\nIn this profoundly unsettling crisis, the full consequences of which are yet to be fully grasped, AXA held firm to its purpose: 'acting for human progress by protecting what matters'. This renewed statement, unveiled mid-2020, at the heart of the crisis, enshrines the spirit that lies at the heart of what we do, and which makes me proud to lead AXA.\n\nWith the Management Committee and all the AXA teams, we steered the Group through the crisis with one core principle: living up to the immense responsibilities we have towards all our stakeholders - our customers, our employees, our shareholders, and society at large.\n\nOur immediate response was focused on ensuring the safety of our employees, making every e/ff ort to guarantee their wellbeing in a distressing environment, continuing to serve our customers, and contributing to solidarity e/ff orts across the world. Our unwavering commitment being a force for good was once more demonstrated in the impressive solidarity wave we saw across the Group to make sure that in the most critical of all times, we were present for our customers, whom/uni00A0I sincerely thank for their confidence.\n\nAt the same time, we took measures to ensure the solidity of AXA in the long run, because our capacity to protect people, communities and businesses fundamentally relies on our financial strength.\n\nIn 2020, the Group demonstrated its capacity to sustain extreme shocks while maintaining a solid performance: our gross revenues only decreased by 1% to \u20ac97/uni00A0billion. With underlying earnings standing at \u20ac4.3bn, a solvency ratio up 20/uni00A0points from 3Q20 to 200% despite low interest rates, and a debt gearing down 2/uni00A0points at 26.8%, AXA confirmed its resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's 2020 financial results are the result of AXA's successful transformation, which also translates into an improved customer satisfaction, with 94% of our entities achieving a Net Promoter Score at or above market average (up 19 points versus 2019 ). Our Group is now reshaped to a simpler and more focused organization, closer to its customers and with the right scale across our geographies and preferred segments, Health, Protection and P&C Commercial lines.\n\nBuilding on our vision, we presented a new strategic plan ' Driving Progress  2023 ' focusing on five main objectives: (i)/uni00A0expand Health and Protection including through services, across all geographies, (ii)/uni00A0simplify customer experience and accelerate e/fficiency, particularly in Europe and France, (iii)/uni00A0strengthen underwriting performance, notably at AXA XL, (iv)/uni00A0sustain the Group's climate leadership position in shaping the climate transition, and (v)/uni00A0g row cash flows across the Group through continued life in-force management and Group simplification, and disciplined capital management. With clear priorities set out, AXA is very well positioned to continue serving its clients and bring its contribution to building a better, greener and more inclusive world and to cater to the new insurance needs of customers and society.\n\nBefore concluding,/uni00A0I would like to commend the work accomplished by the AXA teams, agents, and partners who went above and beyond in a year like no other. In 2020, AXA rose to the historic challenge, illustrating how central to society insurance is. This was only possible thanks to the passion and professionalism of AXA employees./uni00A0I am incredibly honoured to lead a company filled with such committed people.\n\nWhile the initial phase of the crisis is now behind us, much adversity and a/ffliction remain, and with it, the temptation to perceive reality on the gloomier side. But 2020 revealed the extent of our individual and collective resources, and proved that there is always reason for optimism. More than ever,/uni00A0I am confident in AXA's bright future.\n\nThomas Buberl Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nI\n\nI",

In the course of designing the new plan, despite significant uncertainties weighing on when and how the once-in-a-century crisis will end, we have analyzed and taken into account a number of key trends catalyzed by the COVID-19 crisis and their long-term impacts:\n\n- /uni25A0 macroeconomic challenges : (i)/uni00A0 global recovery to preCOVID-19 growth levels may be delayed with varying impacts on geographies, resulting in widening gaps between faster (China, Asia, US) and slower recovering economies (Europe, Africa and Latin America), (ii)/uni00A0a low interest rate environment is likely to persist, (iii)/uni00A0geopolitical tensions may further slowdown globalization in the near future, and (iv)/uni00A0political and social risks will remain elevated in many jurisdictions, potentially further pressuring the insurance industry, by a/ffecting demand and the cost of doing business;\n- /uni25A0 insurance  industry's  transformation :  (i)/uni00A0 tightening legislation and regulation complexity will continue, (ii)/uni00A0the nature, frequency and volatility of risks are evolving as a result of climate change and natural catastrophes, the evolution of technology, and the global interconnection of businesses increasing supply chain risk, (iii)/uni00A0with demand potentially slowing, competitive pressure will increase from traditional and non-traditional players, notably in retail lines, (iv)/uni00A0cost pressures will further stimulate technical excellence and productivity gains, also leading operators to develop 'beyond insurance' services to improve margins and customer satisfaction, and (v)/uni00A0cutting-edge technology and operations will be critical to address these challenges;\n- /uni25A0 consumer behaviors : (i)/uni00A0 the growing awareness of health and protection needs is a real opportunity to scale 'beyond insurance' services, (ii)/uni00A0high volatility in business environments creates demand for more sophisticated and diverse technical risks in commercial lines, (iii)/uni00A0consumers increasingly value the experience in addition to the product as well as the ability to access any kind of service online, anytime, in a simple and instinctive manner, (iv)/uni00A0corporations' responses to environmental and societal challenges are seen as priorities by consumers and society at large.\n\nWith Ambition 2020 and its ' Payer-to-Partner ' vision , the Group significantly progressed in its transformation to prepare for the future by:\n\n- /uni25A0 cementing a customer-centric culture in all geographies (strong 2020 NPS performance with 94% of its lines of business at or above market average);\n- /uni25A0 shifting its business profile towards more technical risks and lowering exposure to financial risks (disposal of EQH, acquisition of the XL Group and transformation of the Swiss Group Life );\n- /uni25A0 accelerating in preferred segments, i.e . P&C commercial lines, health and protection;\n- /uni25A0 deploying its health strategy in China through its 100%-owned subsidiary (AXA Tianping);\n- /uni25A0 simplifying the Group (exiting a number of non-core markets);\n- /uni25A0 paving  the  way  for  'beyond  insurance'  services  ( e.g . telemedicine or vertical integration in health); and\n- /uni25A0 continuing to launch ambitious actions addressing main social and environmental challenges.\n- ' Driving Progress 2023 ' is a step further in the execution of our strategic vision, built on five pillars:\n- 1) Expand Health and Protection across all our geographies, notably through innovative services;\n- 2) Simplify customer experience and accelerate efficiency , particularly in Europe and France;\n- 3) Strengthen underwriting performance , notably at AXA XL;\n- 4) Sustain our climate leadership position , with further actions to shape the climate transition;\n- 5) Grow cash flows across the Group , with increased cash generation and continued life in-force optimization.\n\nWith its purpose 'Acting for human progress by protecting what matters' and strategic plan ' Driving Progress 2023 ', AXA aims at reinforcing its mission and social responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis its stakeholders ( e.g . clients, employees, investors) and society at large, while delivering ambitious financial targets in line with these values.\n\nI\n\nI",

Future dividends will depend on a variety of factors including AXA's earnings, consolidated financial condition, applicable capital and solvency requirements, prevailing financial market conditions and the general economic environment. Proposals for dividend payments are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAXA's current dividend policy is based on adjusted earnings per share net of its outstanding undated debt interest charges. From 2022 onwards, AXA targets to pay aggregate dividends in a general range of 55%-65% of underlying earnings per share (equivalent\n\nto the current general range of 50% to 60% of adjusted earnings per share). The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors in any particular year may vary considerably depending on a variety of factors (as noted above) which may have an impact on this target from one year to another. In assessing the dividend to be paid in any given year, Management tries to strike the appropriate balance between (i)/uni00A0prudent capital management, (ii)/uni00A0reinvestment of previous results to support business development and (iii)/uni00A0an attractive dividend for shareholders.\n\nA dividend of \u20ac1.43 per share for the 2020 fiscal year will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A029, 2021.\n\nThe following table sets forth information on the dividends declared and paid in respect of the last five fiscal years:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Distribution (in Euro/uni00A0million)   | Number of shares (on December/uni00A031)   | Net dividend  per/uni00A0share (in Euro)   |      | Dividend per share  eligible for a tax relief (in Euro)   | Gross dividend  per/uni00A0share (in Euro)   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|          2016 | 2,813                                   | 2,425,149,130                              | 1.16                                       | (b)  | 1.16  (b)                                                 | 1.16  (b)                                    |\n|          2017 | 3,056                                   | 2,425,235,751                              | 1.26  (c)                                  | 1.26 | (c)                                                       | 1.26  (c)                                    |\n|          2018 | 3,249                                   | 2,424,916,626                              | 1.34                                       | (d)  | 1.34  (d)                                                 | 1.34  (d)                                    |\n|          2019 | 1,765                                   | 2,417,695,123                              | 0.73                                       | (e)  | 0.73  (e)                                                 | 0.73  (e)                                    |\n|          2020 | 3,458  (a)                              | 2,418,389,408                              | 1.43  (f)                                  |      | 1.43  (f)                                                 | 1.43  (f)                                    |\n\nDividends not claimed within five years a/f\\_t er the payout date become the property of the French Public Treasury.\n\nFor further information on AXA's dividend, see Note/uni00A029.5  'Other items: Restriction on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part/uni00A06  'Consolidated Financial Statements' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -  Bylaws -  Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to the shares ' of this Annual Report.

The Group also undertook not to defer any social security or tax payments in France during the period.\n\nAXA is a Group that has its social responsibility at heart and believes that the financial e/ff orts of public authorities should be primarily directed towards the most vulnerable individuals and businesses.\n\n## /uni25A0 Exceptional measures for our most affected customers\n\nThese announcements came in addition to exceptional measures that had already been taken to provide flexibility to business customers, particularly SMEs.\n\nIn several countries, including France, the Group continued to insure businesses even in the event of late payment due to the pandemic, for the duration of the containment period, and ensured prompt payment to all suppliers to enable them to maintain the cash and liquidity needed to overcome the crisis.\n\n## /uni25A0 \u20ac54/uni00A0million for solidarity funds\n\nAXA France has also been the leading contributor, with \u20ac33/uni00A0million, to the solidarity e/ffort set up by the French government for small businesses and the self-employed and coordinated by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de l'Assurance (FFA), which amounted to \u20ac400/uni00A0million in total.\n\nThis is in addition to AXA partner association AGIPI's creation of the 'AGIPI COVID-19 Solidarity Fund', endowed with \u20ac21/uni00A0million to support clients experiencing economic di/fficulties.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Responding to the health emergency\n\nIn response to the health emergency, as a major international healthcare company, AXA is committed to directly helping its employees and clients, while supporting medical actions in the regions in which it operates. AXA extended coverage and services to healthcare professionals in several countries and leveraged its own medical networks and teleconsulting services to contribute to the healthcare e/ff ort. Finally, the Group took full action to support and compensate its customers a/ffected by the virus.\n\n## /uni25A0 2/uni00A0million masks distributed as part of an emergency plan to support healthcare professionals\n\nTo strengthen its support for healthcare professionals on the frontline against the virus, AXA announced that it would provide 2/uni00A0million masks to help healthcare workers. The first 350,000, sent out and distributed to French hospitals, were much-needed FFP2 masks. AXA France also set up psychological support resources for medical sta/ff .\n\nIn addition, support was also provided to the AP-HP ( Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris ), the public hospital system of the city of Paris and the Ile-de-France region. AXA donated 20,000 meals to the AP-HP care community for lunch or dinner at home.\n\nThese solidarity measures for health professionals come in addition to donations made to hospitals and intensive care units in several countries. AXA is also supporting intensive care units through a partnership with the 101 Fund, a network of 1,200/uni00A0intensive care centers in over 60/uni00A0countries that aims to share real-time information from each unit to accelerate the improvement of therapeutic protocols. This funding has also made it possible to set up accelerated training for caregivers in order to increase the sta/ffing capacity of these units.\n\n## /uni25A0 \u20ac5/uni00A0million to fund research on infectious diseases, including COVID-19\n\nFinally, AXA Research Fund, which has made a steadfast commitment over the years to support research on infectious diseases and pandemics (35/uni00A0projects from leading institutions worldwide for a total of \u20ac7.4/uni00A0million), decided to mobilize an additional \u20ac5/uni00A0million for the development of responses to infectious diseases and COVID-19, including the implementation of post-crisis solutions.\n\nAXA also supported the creation of the Institut Pasteur's COVID-19 Task Force and the OpenCOVID-19 initiative launched by Just One Giant Lab (JOGL), an open-source research platform aimed at providing low-cost emergency solutions to respond to the pandemic, with a particular focus on low-income countries.",

The renewal of Irene Dorner's mandate was approved by AXA's annual Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A030, 2020 (12 th /uni00A0resolution).\n\n## Decision of the Board of Directors in respect of/uni202FAXA's dividend proposal for 2019\n\nOn June/uni00A03, 2020, AXA announced that (i)/uni00A0 following communications from EIOPA and the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr \u00f4le Prudentiel e t de R\u00e9solution ('ACPR'), relating to the adoption of a prudent approach towards\n\nI\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\ndividend distributions during the COVID-19 pandemic, AXA's Board of Directors had decided to reduce its dividend proposal from \u20ac1.43 per share to \u20ac0.73 per share, a proposal that was approved by AXA's Shareholders' Meeting held on June/uni00A030, 2020, and the dividend was paid on July/uni00A09, 2020 (with an ex-dividend date of July/uni00A07, 2020), and (ii)/uni00A0 the Board was considering proposing an additional payment to shareholders in 4Q20, up to \u20ac0.70 per share, as an exceptional distribution of reserves, subject to favorable market and regulatory conditions at that time.\n\nDuring the meeting, AXA's Management also updated the Board on its best estimate of the impact on 2020 underlying earnings for the Group from claims related to COVID-19. These estimates added further precision to the indications already provided in the 1Q20 disclosure, notably:\n\n- /uni25A0 Property & Casualty: an overall claims cost of ca. \u20ac-1.2/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (1) post-tax and net of reinsurance. Consistent with indications given in the 1Q20 disclosure, Management expected the most material impacts from Business Interruption and Event Cancellation, and to a lesser extent from other lines ( e.g . D&O, Liability and Travel), partly o/ff set by reduced claims in some areas, notably from Motor;\n- /uni25A0 Life & Savings and Health: no material deviation had been observed in current claims experience;\n- /uni25A0 Solidarity measures: an overall impact of ca. \u20ac-0.3/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (1) post-tax. This includes extended health and disability coverage to vulnerable customers, most notably in France.\n\nThe estimates provided above were based on Management's assessment at that time and subject to change depending on the continued evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related impacts. For investment margin, unit-linked and asset management fees, no estimate was provided as the impact was dependant on the evolution of financial market conditions through the remainder of the year.\n\n## Board of Directors' decision on exceptional distribution of reserves in 4Q20\n\nFollowing a number of discussions with the French regulator ('ACPR') and, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, reinforced communication from various European regulators, including the ACPR on July/uni00A028, 2020, recommending insurers to refrain from dividend distributions until January/uni00A01, 2021, AXA's Board of Directors, at its meeting on August/uni00A05, 2020, decided it would not propose an exceptional distribution of reserves to shareholders in 4Q 2020/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nI\n\n2",

This document describes AXA's responsible investment and insurance initiatives in the fight against climate change and measures the Group's progress in implementing the objectives of the Paris Agreement by 2050.\n\nThis report follows the disclosure approach resulting from Article/uni00A0173 of French Law No./uni00A02015-992 of August/uni00A017, 2015, for Energy Transition for Green Growth/uni00A0 (2) , as well as the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) that AXA has supported since its creation. The report's main indicator, the 'warming potential', measures the impact of the Group's investments on global warming and its contribution to the fight against climate change.\n\nAt the end of 2019, AXA's 'warming potential' was 2.8\u00b0C, down compared to 2018 (3\u00b0C) and below the market average (3.6\u00b0C).

This global study measures and ranks changes in the perception of emerging risks by a panel of Risk Management experts and the general public. Over 20,000/uni00A0people were interviewed. Conducted in partnership with research institute IPSOS and geopolitical analysis consultancy Eurasia Group, this year's ranking of the 10 main emerging risks was marked by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nPreviously underestimated risks related to pandemics and infectious diseases rose from eighth in 2019 to top of the 2020 ranking. Climate change-related risk came in second, dropping from the top spot it had held for years. Climate change remained the number one risk in Europe but fell to third place in Asia and America. The drop was particularly marked in North America, where the share of experts who considered this risk major has fallen from 71% in 2019 to 46% in 2020.\n\nCybersecurity risk, ranked third, increased in prominence this year with the new and widespread adoption of technology and the explosion of cyberattacks during lockdown. In particular, the perception of cyber warfare risk had increased; it had been considered as the main security threat by 47% of experts compared to 37% last year. The risk of shutdown of essential services and critical infrastructure following a cyberattack had also increased (+7/uni00A0points to 51%).\n\nGeopolitical risks occupied the fourth place, with a significant increase in the risk of digital warfare between nations, which experts considered to be the top new security threat. Finally, the risk of social unrest placed fi/f\\_th.\n\n## AXA launched an innovative global program for the health and well-being of its employees\n\nOn November/uni00A018, 2020, AXA announced the launch of an innovative global program to improve the health and wellbeing of its 121,000/uni00A0employees. This initiative is a new step in the implementation of AXA's strategy to better align the benefits o/ffered to its employees across the globe.\n\nThis program, at no expenses for AXA employees, will be deployed from 2021 through two complementary pillars:\n\n- /uni25A0 to improve prevention and access to care, each employee will be able to benefit from a complete in-person or digital medical check-up depending on their age, receive an annual flu vaccination and participate in information and awareness days organized on AXA premises to better prevent health related risks;\n- /uni25A0 to better support employees who encounter di/fficulties in their professional or personal life, AXA is giving access to an employee assistance program which provides psychological support and guidance, accessible at all times.\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThis program complements existing initiatives in the area of health and access to care, including the deployment of telemedicine services in Group entities, which is intended to be strengthened in the coming years.\n\n## AXA revealed its 2023/uni00A0strategy\n\nOn December/uni00A01, 2020, AXA hosted a virtual Investor Day to present its strategic plan ' Driving Progress 2023 ' and its key financial targets for 2021-2023. The presentation included dedicated sections on France and Europe, AXA XL and Cash and Capital.\n\nFive strategic priorities were highlighted around (i)/uni00A0 growth in Health and Protection across all geographies, (ii)/uni00A0 simplification of customer experience and e/fficiency acceleration, (iii)/uni00A0 strengthening of the underwriting performance, (iv)/uni00A0 sustainability of AXA's climate leadership position, and (v)/uni00A0 growth in cash flows across the Group.\n\nFinancial targets, notably on Underlying Earnings Per Share, Return On Equity, cash flows, and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio were set in the context of this new strategic plan.\n\n## AXA deploys its smart working strategy/uni202Fworldwide\n\nOn January/uni00A019, 2021, AXA announced the extension of its smart working strategy to all of its entities worldwide. This strategy aims to implement a hybrid way of working, combining remote work and o/ffice presence by enabling employees on a voluntary basis to work remotely with two days as a general guide.\n\nThese principles will be deployed until 2023. They will be applied by the end of 2021 in the major entities employing over 70% of AXA employees. The program will include change management and training measures, adaptation of workspaces and provision of IT equipment. Particular attention will be paid to the autonomy and responsibility of teams, and to the cohesion and well-being of employees. Smart working will not preclude eligible employees to work full time in o/ffice if they want to or need to depending on the specificity of their job.\n\nThis decision is based on the successful implementation of remote working - with 38% of employees regularly working from home prior to the crisis, and 90% of them wishing to increase the practice of remote working in the future - as well as on the experience gained during the COVID-19 health crisis during which full remote working guaranteed operational continuity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

Worldwide, governments imposed confinements, quarantines, travel restrictions, social distancing measures and more generally the closure of activities deemed non-essential to try and alleviate/uni00A0the severe strain experienced by local, national and supra-national medical institutions. This led to massive disruptions/uni00A0to/uni00A0the global economic output, notably manufacturing, trade and supply chains, which resulted in both lower economic activity and lower estimates of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## I Financial Market Conditions\n\nUnprecedented restrictions and lockdowns resulted into a sharp economic contraction, initially in China that was first a/ffected by the pandemic and lockdown measures, with a marked GDP contraction in the first quarter, then in Europe and in the United States in the second quarter.\n\nCentral banks and governmental authorities acted promptly to mitigate both financial and economic e/ffects of the pandemic, notably by cutting interest rates, injecting large amounts of liquidity in the money markets, providing both traditional fiscal stimulus and income support to workers, as well as o/ffering loan guarantees and various measures to support companies. Besides, the virus faded in the Northern hemisphere during the summer, allowing to lighten mobility restrictions, leading to a strong GDP rebound in most geographies.\n\nHowever, a return of the virus in the winter saw restrictions reinstated, mainly in Europe, notably in the United Kingdom while China was successful in containing subsequent outbreaks, allowing its economy to rebound, aided by overseas demand for its exports. As a result, the Eurozone GDP fell by 7.5% in 2020, with France underperforming the broader Eurozone, as its GDP fell by 5.8% and 13.8% respectively in the first two quarters of 2020, then posting a firmer 18.2% rebound in the third quarter, leading to a contraction by 8.2% in 2020.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfuture economic growth. From May onwards, as the virus contagion started to show signs of abatement, governments started to ease the restrictions to alleviate the negative impacts on the economy.\n\nHowever, the pace of the contamination accelerated during the third quarter, with the number of daily new cases reaching very high levels, mostly in Europe and in the United States. This situation has proven to be/uni00A0long-lasting, leading governments to strengthen again the sanitary measures a/f\\_ter the relative easing during the summer. Although these measures were less stringent than in March, they weighed further on/uni00A0the economic environment. At the end of 2020, most of these restrictions were still in place and outlooks remain uncertain despite vaccines being rolled out to the population of many countries from the end of 2020.\n\nThe United Kingdom fared worse than Europe, both reflecting the structure of the economy and a spread of the virus that has le/f\\_t   the country with more deaths per capita than other European nations. A relatively longer lockdown in the second quarter led to a GDP contraction by 19.0%, with a total decrease of 9.9% in 2020. Even as the pandemic damaged the economy, the government pursued its Brexit objective and finally achieved a last-minute free trade agreement on December/uni00A024, which came into e/ffect on January/uni00A01, 2021.\n\nThe United States economy posted smaller losses, with a GDP decrease of 3.5% in 2020, reflecting both less stringent mobility restrictions as well as the provision of an unprecedented package of supporting measures, with the government providing financial help to individuals and companies in excess of $3 trillion.\n\nChina posted a positive growth of 2.3% this year thanks to the containment of the pandemic a/f\\_ter the first lockdown and a strong rebound fuelled by exports. Japan was also more successful in containing the virus than Western economies. While economic contraction was not as severe as across most of Europe, the GDP decreased by 4.8% in 2020, with the economy already contracting before the virus struck this year.",

Mid-March, all equity indexes experienced their worst fall since the 2008 crisis, with Eurostoxx 50 decreasing 34% versus December/uni00A031, 2019. To mitigate the e/ffects of the crisis, governments and central banks provided supportive measures towards both business and labour markets, cut rates and injected\n\nliquidities. Combined with the ease of the restrictions during the summer, risk assets quickly recovered with varying degrees depending on countries. By the end the year, the overall market recovery was also supported by the progress of the pharmaceutical industry in developing vaccines. The only exception was the United Kingdom FTSE 100, that closed the year down 14% versus the end of 2019, still impacted by uncertainties linked to Brexit, though an agreement was reached at the end of December.\n\n|                                      | Lowest point mid-March  vs. /uni202FDec ember/uni00A031,  2019   | December/uni00A031, 2020/ December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eurostoxx 50                         | -34%                                                             | -5%                                                  |\n| S&P/uni00A0500                       | -31%                                                             | 16%                                                  |\n| Dow Jones Industrial Average         | -35%                                                             | 7%                                                   |\n| FTSE 100                             | -34%                                                             | -14%                                                 |\n| Nikkei                               | -30%                                                             | 16%                                                  |\n| CSI/uni00A0300 (Shanghai & Shenzhen) | -14%                                                             | 27%                                                  |\n| MSCI World                           | -32%                                                             | 14%                                                  |\n| MSCI G7                              | -32%                                                             | 15%                                                  |\n| MSCI Emerging                        | -32%                                                             | 16%                                                  |\n\nHowever, high uncertainties remained at year end, with strong restrictions in most locations, that were reflected in the S&P/uni00A0500 implied volatility index (VIX) that increased from 14% on December/uni00A031, 2019, to 23% on December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## BOND MARKETS\n\nIn the early stage of the pandemic, sovereign spreads widened sharply but central banks quickly reacted to mitigate the e/ffects of the crisis and eased their monetary policies in an attempt to support the economy: the European Central Bank (ECB) expanded its quantitative easing programme, extended liquidity to banks and eased collateral conditions, while the Bank of England and\n\nthe US Federal reserve cut rates. Combined with the ease of restrictions in the summer, sovereign spreads tightened later in the year and government bond yields decreased sharply to set new record lows: US 10-year government yields fell by around 142/uni00A0bps to 0.50% in March and 0.51% in August but closed the year to 0.92%.\n\n|                       | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020/ December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 10-year German Bond   | -0.58%                     | -39/uni00A0bps                                       |\n| 10-year French Bond   | -0.34%                     | -47/uni00A0bps                                       |\n| 10-year UK Bond       | 0.20%                      | -63/uni00A0bps                                       |\n| 10-year Swiss Bond    | -0.49%                     | -1/uni00A0bps                                        |\n| 10-year US T Bond     | 0.92%                      | -100/uni00A0bps                                      |\n| 10-year Japanese Bond | 0.02%                      | +3/uni00A0bps                                        |\n| 10-year Italian Bond  | 0.52%                      | -91/uni00A0bps                                       |\n\nCorporate spreads also significantly widened in March a/f\\_ter the outbreak of the pandemic: in Europe, the iTraxx Main spreads increased by 94/uni00A0bps to 139/uni00A0bps compared to December/uni00A031, 2019, and the iTraxx Crossover increased by 500/uni00A0bps to 708/uni00A0bps while in the United States, the CDX Main spread Index increased by 107/uni00A0bps to 152/uni00A0bps.\n\nNevertheless, as a result of governments and central banks measures to support the economy, corporate spreads tightened later in the year. However, they remained higher than as at December/uni00A031, 2019, reflecting uncertainties about the economic outlook. In Europe, the iTraxx Main spreads increased by 4/uni00A0bps to 48/uni00A0bps compared to December/uni00A031, 2019, and the iTraxx Crossover increased by 35/uni00A0bps to 242/uni00A0bps while in the United States, the CDX Main spread Index increased by 5/uni00A0bps to 50/uni00A0bps.\n\nI\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nI",

The insurance Savings market has been strongly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, as French households invested in more liquid savings such as guaranteed banking products ( e.g . Livret/uni00A0A ) rather than insurance products. The prolonged low interest rate environment increases the challenge for Insurers; the average return on General Acccount contracts remained low (-0.5/uni00A0point from 2019 at approximately 1.00% expected for 2020), thus forcing the pension savings market to accelerate its transformation. As an illustration, through a generalization of the French equivalent of the European 'Institutions for Occupational Retirement' ( i.e . FRPS or fonds de retraite professionnelle suppl\u00e9mentaire ) across Life insurance players in 2020, it is expected that the favorable capital requirements associated with such regimes should benefit both the industry and the policyholders through higher returns.\n\nThe French Protection & Health insurance market faced uncertainties brought by the pandemic crisis, as well as an evolving regulatory environment. Both confinement and curfews enforced in the context of the COVID-19 crisis drove many patients to postpone or forego non-urgent care. In parallel, the French government\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\ntrade negotiations with the European Union before reaching a last minute settlement at the year-end.\n\nThe Swiss Franc kept strengthening against Euro as the inflationary pressure remained low, and the Swiss National Bank favoring foreign exchange market interventions to further rate cuts.\n\nThe Japanese Yen has been relatively stable against Euro, as a consequence of a steady monetary policy.\n\nimposed an exceptional tax on all Healthcare insurers in order to finance support measures introduced during the crisis. The crisis also accelerated the adoption of both digital and remote-access healthcare solutions, such as tele-medicine consultations. The French government also introduced a new regulation in 2020 ( 100% Sant\u00e9 ) that allows all French patients to benefit from both optical and dental care without co-payment, the additional costs related to these measures being financed by both the Social Security and supplementary regimes.\n\nThe French Property & Casualty insurance market has also been deeply impacted by the sanitary crisis. In terms of volumes, the year saw a reduction in new business and lapses for all insurance companies, as the crisis drove down the number of transactions ( e.g . new car, housing etc.) that usually generate a need for new insurance products. In terms of claims, the significant business interruption periods impacted turnover at restaurants, bars and hotels thus driving a higher number of claims made to all insurance companies. Separately, travel and mobility restrictions drove a much lower claims frequency in Motor. Finally, 2020 saw an unusually high number of natural events such as droughts and storms (including Ciara, Ines and Dennis in February as well as Alex in October) which caused massive floods and destructions.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "In Europe (excluding France), the COVID-19 crisis heavily impacted the insurance market: despite the decrease in Motor claims frequency, Property & Casualty markets su/ffered from material Business Interruption and Event Cancellation claims. Further to these claims, severe natural events such as Ciara, Dennis and Gloria storms hit respectively the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain in the beginning of the year. The COVID-19 context impacted the commercial performance, with a significant reduction of new business in Motor and in Commercial lines on products with premiums based on the policyholders' own level of activity, and shi/f\\_ted the focus of insurers to cost reduction and e/fficiency measures. In Life & Savings, the prolonged low interest rates, along with the economic crisis, drove down sales, with customers focusing more on traditional bank savings. Health market has been subject to governmental measures, prioritizing COVID-19 patients' healthcare, with extreme measures taken such as the requisition of private hospitals by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, while lockdowns and social distancing measures have led many people to postpone medical appointments. For all lines of business, lockdowns and restrictions accelerated the digitalization of underwriting and claims management processes and created new customer habits trends.\n\n- In Japan , the Life & Savings insurance market decreased by 9%, still negatively impacted by the tax rule revision announced in February/uni00A02019 on tax-e/fficient savings products, a/ffecting notably the SME market in all lines of business (including the Health market), but also by the pandemic crisis and the low interest rates environment. New business premiums decreased by 32% and were penalized by the lockdown measures implemented by the Japanese government between April/uni00A016 and May/uni00A025 forcing all insurers to stop face-to-face sales, which started again gradually from the third quarter. The Property & Casualty insurance market slightly decreased by 0.4% as the drop in Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance ('CALI') and Marine businesses was almost o/ff  set by the increase in Voluntary Motor business.\n\nIn Hong Kong , the COVID-19 crisis impacted the insurance market in each line of business to di/fferent extents. The Property & Casualty insurance market experienced some pressure on premium rates as well as on volumes, mainly in Travel insurance. However, it showed a certain stability in pricing conditions following the previous 12-month hardening of coverages and pricing conditions. The Life & Savings insurance market growth slowed down, with lower new business sales to Mainland Chinese Visitors following the border restrictions. The Health insurance market continued to grow, continuing to benefit from tax-deductible voluntary health insurance certified plans.\n\nThe United States Property sector was impacted by another exceptional year of significant natural catastrophe losses, including a particularly active hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, making 2020 the most active and fi/f\\_t h costliest year on record.\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.2/uni00A0MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe United States saw the development of 30 named storms, out of which 6 developed into major hurricanes, as well as an unusual level of convective windstorms, primarily in the US mid-west. Separately, the sector was significantly impacted by COVID-19 losses related to non-damage Business Interruption, almost entirely as a consequence of confinements, lockdowns and mobility restrictions enforced by public authorities in many states. This recent experience has accelerated carriers' ongoing e/ff orts to restore profitability, mostly through increased pricing and the tightening of terms and conditions, as well as more selectivity in deploying capacity.\n\nThe United States Casualty sector was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis mostly as a result of (i)/uni00A0 lower premiums resulting from a lower economic activity amongst clients, and (ii)/uni00A0 large losses for which the full extent of liability losses will be impacted by court decisions and rulings which are continuing to unfold. Separately, carriers continue to address the impact of social inflation through increased pricing and selective capacity deployment. In the Cyber market, the frequency of ransomware attacks continues to impact profitability and carriers have sought to address this through reducing available limits.\n\n## High Potentials\n\nIn Asia High Potentials , the insurance market remained challenged, notably the Life & Savings space which su/ffered from low new business in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. In China, the good monitoring of the pandemic helped the economy to recover a/f\\_ter the first half of the year, allowing Life & Savings premiums to be only slightly impacted. The Property & Casualty insurance market experienced a 4.4% growth thanks to a return to normality in the third quarter, recovering from a decrease in the first quarter following the lockdown. However, the Motor average premium decreased by 15%-20% during the last quarter following the price deregulation issued in September. The Health insurance market grew by 32.6% benefiting from the increasing awareness of Health insurance during the pandemic and thanks to the development of public-private partnerships for inclusive Health insurance encouraged by local authorities. In Thailand, the Life & Savings insurance market decreased by 3% from lower new business, while the Property & Casualty and Health insurance markets continued to grow. In Indonesia, the Life & Savings insurance market decreased by 11.9% driven by a 16.6% decline of the agency network. In the Philippines, the Life & Savings insurance market declined as a result of lockdown measures, which were among the longest across the region, putting economic activity to a halt.\n\nIn International markets , the Property & Casualty insurance market growth was negatively impacted by lockdown measures, notably resulting into lower car sales. The Health business experienced a strong growth in Mexico.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFollowing a sharp deterioration of financial markets during the first quarter of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic expanded from Asia to both Europe and North America, markets recovered throughout the remainder of the year, buoyed by both national and supranational supportive measures. Assets under management have broadly mirrored this evolution that saw negative market e/ffects in the first half of the year, primarily through lower equity markets and wider corporate spreads, while the second part of the year saw a recovery of equity markets combined with a normalization of the corporate spreads across the ratings spectrum. This recovery was supplemented by positive inflows throughout the year while market demand has been increasingly polarized between high volume/low margin liquid strategies ( e.g . money markets, 'buy & maintain' fixed income, passive investments\u2026) and flexible, high alpha as well as private asset strategies as a result of the search for higher returns in a durable low rate environment.\n\nBesides the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, structural trends as observed in past years persisted in 2020 with the continued pressure on management fee bps and a continued shi/f\\_t  to passive\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.2/uni00A0MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\ninvestments, despite the positive trends on both alternative and emerging markets, notably in China.\n\nThis challenging environment has created increased dispersion between individual players, leading to intensified market consolidation with a handful of deals announced or completed by top global asset managers looking to gain scale and expand their client reach in key regions and segments.\n\nFinally, ESG matters have been brought to the forefront of the industry by governments and investors, especially for 'Environmental' and 'Social' components, which represent key success factors for asset managers in a post COVID-19 world. Impact investments are expected to gain more traction, focusing on in-demand social sectors (including healthcare) and environmental concerns.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

Property & Casualty claims were partly o/ffset by estimated reinsurance recoveries and the decrease in frequency in Motor resulting from the lockdowns and the various restrictions enacted to reduce the pace of the spread of the virus.\n\nAXA's turnover was also strongly a/ffected by the crisis, primarily as a significant part of the premiums paid by its clients within the Property & Casualty Commercial lines are based on their own level of activity ( e.g . through projects, cargo load, flights number, turnover etc.) that was significantly reduced by the confinement measures. Additionally, the turnover was hit by opening restrictions a/ffecting AXA's distribution channels ( e.g . agents, bancassurance networks etc.) as well as by anxiety surrounding policyholders' saving and insurance choices as a result of uncertain future economic developments. In this context, the development of online distribution channels, processes and capabilities acted as a mitigant to the reduction of the activity.\n\nIn response, AXA implemented specific cost countermeasures, including travels and corporate events reductions, while maintaining its commitment to the modernization of IT systems and customer processes. These cost countermeasures fully mitigated the impact of the decrease in activity on the underlying earnings.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAdditionally, financial markets have experienced a significant drop in the first semester, then partly recovered in the second half of the year, as a potential normalization of the situation came in sight with the development of vaccines. The consequence for AXA was a decrease in the fair-value of assets, partly o/ffset through hedging strategies, as well as a decrease in the financial income due to lower dividends, distribution of funds and reinvestment yields.\n\nThe combination of the decrease in operating earnings, low interest rates, volatile equity markets and spread widening weighed on the Group's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio by 22/uni00A0points. However, the Group's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio remained resilient at 200%, confirming AXA's Management view that the COVID-19 crisis is an earnings event and not a capital event.\n\nIn this highly uncertain context, AXA continues to closely monitor the Group's exposures, including (i)/uni00A0 the operational impact on its business, (ii)/uni00A0 the consequence of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, (iii)/uni00A0 the impacts on insurance coverages, including ongoing litigation in some locations, (iv)/uni00A0 the reinsurance recoveries, and (v)/uni00A0 the change in asset prices and financial conditions.",

A reconciliation from Adjusted earnings, Underlying earnings and Combined Ratio to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total in the financial statements of the corresponding period is provided in the above tables. Adjusted Return on Equity and Underlying earnings per share are reconciled to the financial statements in the table set forth on page/uni00A054  of this Annual Report, and the calculation methodology of the Debt Gearing is set out on page/uni00A050  of this Annual Report. For further information on any of the above-mentioned APMs, see the Glossary on pages/uni00A0479  to/uni00A0483  of this Annual Report.\n\n## ADJUSTED EARNINGS\n\nAdjusted earnings represent the Net income (Group share) as disclosed in the above tables, before the impact of the following items net of policyholder participation, deferred acquisition costs, VBI, taxes and minority interests:\n\n- /uni25A0 integration and restructuring costs related to material newly acquired companies as well as restructuring and associated costs related to productivity improvement plans;\n- /uni25A0 goodwill, impairments and amortization of intangibles related to customers and distribution;\n- /uni25A0 exceptional operations (primarily change in scope and discontinued operations); and\n- /uni25A0 profit or loss on financial assets accounted for under fair value option (excluding assets backing liabilities for which the financial risk is borne by the policyholder), foreign exchange impacts on assets and liabilities, and derivatives related to invested assets and liabilities.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nUnderlying e arnings correspond to Adjusted Earnings without the following elements, net of policyholder participation, deferred acquisition costs, VBI, taxes and minority interests:\n\n- /uni25A0 realized gains and losses and change in impairment valuation allowance (on assets not designated under fair value option or trading assets); and\n- /uni25A0 cost at inception, intrinsic value and pay-o/ff  of derivatives used for the economic hedging of realized gains and impairments of equity securities (other than the funds backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders).\n\n## ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY\n\nThe Adjusted Return on Equity (' Adjusted RoE ') is calculated as Adjusted Earnings net of financial charges related to undated subordinated debt, preferred shares and mandatory exchangeable bonds up to the date of deconsolidation of Equitable Holdings,/uni00A0Inc. ('EQH') (recorded  through Shareholders' equity as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' and financial debt as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A017 'Financing debt' of this Annual Report divided by the weighted average Shareholders' equity. The weighted average Shareholders' equity:\n\n- /uni25A0 is based on opening Shareholders' equity adjusted for weighted average impacts of capital flows (including dividends);\n- /uni25A0 without reserves relating to the change in the fair value through Shareholders' equity as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.4 - 'Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity' of this Annual Report;\n- /uni25A0 without undated subordinated debt as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' of this Annual Report.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nUnderlying earnings per share corresponds to Group share Underlying Earnings net of financial charges related to undated subordinated debt, preferred shares and mandatory exchangeable bonds up to the date of deconsolidation of Equitable Holdings,/uni00A0Inc. (recorded through Shareholders' equity as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and m inority interests' and financial debt as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A017 'Financing debt' of this Annual Report), divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

On a constant exchange rate basis, underlying earnings decreased by \u20ac2,202/uni00A0million (-34%) driven by:\n\n- /uni25A0 the impact of the COVID-19 losses (\u20ac-1.5/uni00A0billion) mainly from Property & Casualty  claims in Business Interruption and Event Cancellation, and to a lesser extent from other lines such as Casualty, Professional Liability, Directors & O/fficers and Travel, as well as solidarity measures, partly compensated by the decrease in claims frequency during lockdowns, mainly in Motor;\n- /uni25A0 the non-repeat of the contribution of Equitable Holdings,/uni00A0Inc. in 2019 (\u20ac-0.4/uni00A0billion);\n- /uni25A0 the impact of Natural Catastrophe charges above the normalized level/uni00A0 (1) at AXA XL  (\u20ac-0.5/uni00A0billion), increasing by \u20ac0.2/uni00A0billion versus 2019;\n- /uni25A0 while 'normalized' underlying earnings amounted to \u20ac6.3/uni00A0billion.\n\nProperty & Casualty underlying earnings decreased by \u20ac1,716/uni00A0million (-51%) to \u20ac1,644/uni00A0million.\n\nExcluding COVID-19 impacts (\u20ac-1,547/uni00A0million) and Natural Catastrophe charges above the normalized level (1) (\u20ac502/uni00A0million)\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## DEBT GEARING\n\nDebt Gearing refers to the level of a company's debt related to its equity capital, usually expressed as a percentage. Debt Gearing is used by Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing the gross debt (financing debt as disclosed in Section /uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A017 'Financing debt' and undated subordinated debt as disclosed in Section 6.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' of this Annual Report) by total capital employed (shareholders' equity excluding undated subordinated debt and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives plus gross debt). Furthermore, following the deconsolidation of EQH, mandatory exchangeable bonds issued by AXA in May/uni00A02018 were excluded from Debt Gearing.\n\nat AXA XL , underlying earnings increased by \u20ac55/uni00A0million (+2%) mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0 a resilient business growth in Commercial lines , as well as (ii)/uni00A0 a strong costs discipline, partly o/ffset by (iii)/uni00A0 lower investment result as a consequence of lower dividends and funds distributions across entities.\n\nLife & Savings underlying earnings decreased by \u20ac532/uni00A0million (-19%) to \u20ac2,338/uni00A0million. Excluding the \u20ac362/uni00A0million contribution of Equitable Holdings,/uni00A0Inc.  in 2019, underlying earnings decreased by \u20ac169/uni00A0million (-7%) driven by (i)/uni00A0 a lower net technical margin (\u20ac-257/uni00A0million) mainly in France  as a consequence of the extension of disability coverage to vulnerable customers in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the decrease in annuities discount rate and unfavorable prior year reserve developments in Protection . This was partly o/ffset by (ii)/uni00A0 a favorable tax impact (\u20ac+119/uni00A0million) mainly due to the decrease in pre-tax underlying earnings, a decrease in the corporate tax rate in France  and Belgium  as well as a tax one-o/ff  in Germany , and (iii)/uni00A0 a resilient investment margin (\u20ac+10/uni00A0million) driven by continued discipline on crediting rates (\u20ac+189/uni00A0million), partly o/ffset by the decrease in investment income across entities (\u20ac-180/uni00A0million) resulting from lower equity and fund distributions combined with low reinvestment yields.",

On a constant exchange rate basis, net income decreased by \u20ac9/uni00A0million (-1%) as the increase in adjusted earnings and a positive change in the fair value of equity derivatives not eligible for hedge accounting were more than o/ffset by an unfavorable change in the fair value of alternative investments.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

The report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements covers only the information included in Note/uni00A04.\n\nLiquidity management is a core part of the Group's financial planning and includes the management of our debt and the maturities of our debt instruments and, more generally, the Group's capital allocation strategy. Liquidity resources result mainly from Insurance and Asset Management operations, as well as from capital raising activities and committed bank credit lines.\n\nOver the past several years, the Group has expanded its core operations ((re)insurance and Asset Management) through a combination of organic growth, direct investments and acquisitions. This expansion has been funded primarily through a combination of (i)/uni00A0dividends received from operating subsidiaries, (ii)/uni00A0proceeds from debt instruments issuance (mainly subordinated debt) and internal borrowings, (iii)/uni00A0the issuance of ordinary shares and (iv)/uni00A0proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses and assets.\n\nEach of the major operating subsidiaries of the Group is responsible for managing its own liquidity position, in coordination with the Company. The Company, as the holding company of the AXA Group, coordinates funding and liquidity management and, in this role, participates in financing the operations of certain of its subsidiaries. Certain of A XA's subsidiaries, including XL Group Limited, AXA Konzern/uni00A0AG, AXA UK/uni00A0Plc. and AXA Mediterranean Holding/uni00A0SA, are also holding companies and consequently, depend on dividends received from their own subsidiaries to meet their obligations. The Group's operating (re)insurance companies are required to meet multiple regulatory constraints, in particular, a minimum solvency ratio. The level of internal dividends paid by operating subsidiaries must therefore take into account these constraints. Cash positions also fluctuate as a result of cashsettled margin calls from counterparties related to collateral agreements on derivatives. While use of derivatives has been decreasing at Company level, the Company's statutory results may be significantly impacted by unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge, in particular, currency and interest rate risks.\n\nI\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash dividends received from its operating subsidiaries and other financing sources available to the Company will continue to cover its operating expenses (including interest payments on its outstanding debt and borrowings) and dividend payments in the long term. AXA expects that anticipated investments in subsidiaries and existing operations, future acquisitions and strategic investments and share repurchase transactions will be funded from available cash flow remaining a/f\\_t er payments of dividends and operating expenses, proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and businesses as well as future issuance of debt and/or equity instruments.\n\nAs a holding company, AXA is not subject to legal restrictions on dividend payments, provided that its accumulated profits are su/fficient to cover distributions. However, regulatory or governmental authorities may recommend or request holding companies of insurance groups such as AXA to limit their dividend payments and many subsidiaries, particularly insurance subsidiaries, are subject to local regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. For more information on these restrictions, see Section 6.6 /uni00A0- Note/uni00A029.4 'Other items: restrictions on dividend payments to shareholders'  and paragraphs 'The Group's or its (re)insurance subsidiaries' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition', 'As a holding company, we are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and dividend payments' and 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in/uni202Fthe/uni202Fvarious jurisdictions in which we/uni202Foperate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\nI",

These funds are mainly used to pay policyholder benefits, claims and claims expenses, policy surrenders and other operating expenses and to purchase financial assets and meet potential collateral exchange obligations in relation to derivatives. The liquidity of the Group's insurance operations is a/ffected by, among other things, the overall quality of the Group's investments and the Group's ability to liquidate its financial assets in a timely manner and to meet policyholder benefits and insurance claims as they fall due. The Group regularly reviews the quality of its assets to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios.\n\nInformation on projected payments and surrenders related to Life & Savings and Property & Casualty insurance contracts are disclosed in Section 6.6 - Note/uni00A014.10.1 'Payment and surrender projections'  of this Annual Report.\n\nInformation in this section should be read in conjunction with, in particular, sub-sections 'Market-related risks', 'Pricing and Underwriting-related risks' and 'Operational risks' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## PROPERTY & CASUALTY (INCLUDING REINSURANCE AND HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Property & Casualty subsidiaries can be a/ffected by actual claims experience. Property & Casualty Insurance's net cash flows are generally positive. They can be negative in the case of exceptional loss events, such as natural or man-made catastrophe events. A portion of these cash flows is invested in liquid, short-term bonds and other listed securities in order to manage the liquidity risk that may arise from such events.\n\n## LIFE & SAVINGS (INCLUDING HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Life & Savings subsidiaries can be a/ffected by a number of factors including fluctuations in the level of surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and guarantees to policyholders.\n\nThe investment strategy of AXA's Life & Savings subsidiaries is designed to match the investment returns and estimated maturities of their investments with expected cash flows on their insurance contracts. Entities regularly monitor the valuation and duration of their investments and the performance of their financial assets. Financial market performance may a/ffect the level of surrenders and withdrawals on life insurance policies, as well as immediate and projected long-term cash needs. Group operating entities seek to adjust their investment portfolios to reflect such considerations and react in a targeted manner.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT AND BANKING\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for AXA's Asset Management and Banking subsidiaries are operating cash flows, repurchase agreements, borrowings from credit institutions, banking clients, drawings on credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares (where applicable).\n\nThe financing needs of Asset Management subsidiaries arise principally from their activities, which require working capital, in particular to constitute seed money for new funds at AXA Investment Managers.\n\nI\n\nI",

At year-end 2020, AXA had:\n\n- /uni25A0 a large cash position across all business lines (information on cash flows from operations is provided in Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-  Note/uni00A012 'Cash and cash equivalents'  of this Annual Report). As of December/uni00A031, 2020, AXA's consolidated statement of financial position included cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac28.2/uni00A0billion, net of bank overdra/f\\_t s of \u20ac0.7/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 broad access to various markets via standardized debt programs: for example, at the end of 2020, this included a maximum capacity of \u20ac6.0/uni00A0billion of French commercial paper, $2.0/uni00A0billion of US commercial paper, \u20ac18.0/uni00A0billion under a Euro Medium Term Note ('EMTN') program (of which \u20ac14/uni00A0billion have already been issued) and \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion of French titres n\u00e9gociables \u00e0 moyen terme ;\n- /uni25A0 a debt profile characterized by debt that is mostly subordinated, with a long maturity profile. In 2020, AXA/uni00A0SA reimbursed \u20ac1.8 /uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (1) of debts and we stand at \u20ac17.3/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (2) at yearend 2020. This resulted in a decrease in debt gearing/uni00A0 (3) (26.8% at year-end 2020, versus 28.8% at year-end 2019). The interest coverage/uni00A0 (4) has decreased (10.0x at year-end 2020, versus 10.5x at year-end 2019) driven by one-o/ff  impacts on earnings due to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAXA has put in place a robust liquidity Risk Management framework which is reviewed on a regular basis through a quarterly monitoring of liquidity and solvency requirements in stressed environments both at local and Group level. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management'/uni00A0 (5) and Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity risk'/uni00A0 (6) of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.4/uni00A0LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAt year-end 2020, Group entities held, in the aggregate, more than \u20ac248 /uni00A0billion of government and related bonds of which \u20ac153/uni00A0billion issued by Eurozone countries, which enables them to address local liquidity needs through highly liquid assets. AXA/uni00A0SA also maintained broadly stable credit lines to \u20ac8.2/uni00A0billion at year-end 2020 (\u20ac8.5/uni00A0billion in 2019). AXA has its own liquidity requirements resulting mainly from solvency needs of entities under severe stress scenarios and collateralized derivatives held by AXA/uni00A0SA. The derivatives book is monitored and managed on a daily basis by the Treasury Department. For additional information on the currencies in which our cash and cash equivalents are held, please refer to paragraph 'Exchange Rate Risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries' in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report.

Those dividends were paid in cash.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0III 'AXA parent company financial statements' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Impact of regulatory requirements\n\nThe Group's operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including regulatory capital and solvency requirements. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -  Regulation and Supervision'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Group's operating (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to local regulatory capital requirements which are designed to protect policyholders and to monitor capital adequacy.\n\nIn the event that the Group or any of its (re)insurance subsidiaries fails to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements, insurance regulators would have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions. A failure of the Group and/or any of its (re) insurance subsidiaries to meet its regulatory capital requirements and/or a deterioration of its solvency position may also result in the need for significant amounts of new capital, which could adversely a/ffect the Group's liquidity position. For additional information, see paragraph 'The Group's or its (re)insurance subsidiaries' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (2) of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its Solvency Capital Requirement at all times during 2020 and monitors compliance with such requirement on a continuous basis.\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe AXA Group's capital management policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA aims at operating with a target Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of approximately 190%;\n- /uni25A0 AXA intends to pay dividends for an amount representing a payout ratio ranging from 55% to 65% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per share;\n- /uni25A0 finally, AXA is reinforcing its strict financial discipline on the use of cash. AXA intends to buy back shares to at least neutralize the dilution resulting from employee share o/fferings and the exercise of stock options. AXA may also use share buybacks to either return excess financial resources to its shareholders or to neutralize the dilutive impact of certain disposals on the Group's Underlying Earnings per share.\n\nIf AXA's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio were to deviate excessively from its target level of 190%, AXA may take measures to improve it, such as being more selective on growth initiatives increasing reinsurance or reducing its appetite for investment risk. In any case, AXA's policy is to maintain its Solvency/uni00A0II ratio above its risk appetite limit level of 140%.\n\nThe AXA Group has defined and implemented capital management standards in order to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries are well positioned from a competitive point of view and maintain an adequate solvency ratio in accordance with local regulation requirements. In addition, the Management has developed various contingency plans. These plans may involve use of reinsurance, sales of investment portfolios and/or other assets, measures to reduce capital strain of new business or other measures. There can be no assurance, however, that these plans will be e/ffective and achieve their objectives.\n\nI\n\nI",

The classification depends upon the extent to which the own fund item is immediately available to absorb losses including in case of a winding-up (permanent availability) and subordinated to all other obligations including towards policyholders and beneficiaries. Capital elements of the highest quality are classified in Tier/uni00A01. Eligibility limits apply to these components to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR').\n\nFor compliance with the SCR, the following quantitative limits apply: (a) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A01 items must be at least one half of the SCR; (b) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A03 items must be less than 15% of the SCR; (c) the sum of the eligible amounts of Tier/uni00A02 and Tier/uni00A03 items must not exceed 50% of the SCR.\n\nHybrid debt instruments eligible for Tier/uni00A01 must not exceed 20% of the total amount of Tier/uni00A01 capital.\n\n## DATED AND UNDATED SUBORDINATED DEBT DESCRIPTION\n\nDated and undated subordinated notes issued by the Company qualify as eligible own funds.\n\nSubordinated notes issued by the Company since January/uni00A018, 2015 have been structured to be eligible as own funds regulatory capital under Solvency/uni00A0II regulations. Subordinated notes issued prior January/uni00A017, 2015 mostly benefit from the transitional provisions set forth in Directive 2014/51/EU (Omnibus/uni00A0II) , which amended the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, as they were previously eligible under the Solvency/uni00A0I regime and were issued prior to the entry into force of Delegated Regulation EU 2015/35 of October/uni00A010, 2014.\n\nThe Company has issued dated subordinated notes ('TSR'), undated subordinated notes ('TSDI') and undated deeply subordinated notes ('TSS'), which include provisions designed to allow the Company to ensure the continuity of its activities in the event its financial position deteriorates.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nCertain TSR include clauses which permit or force the Company to defer interest payments. In addition, redemption at maturity is subject to (i)/uni00A0the prior approval by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the'ACPR'), (ii)/uni00A0the absence of any event (a) making the own funds of the Company and/or the Group insu/fficient to cover its regulatory capital requirements, or (b) pursuant to which the Company would have to take specified action in relation to payments under the notes due to its financial condition, or (c) having an adverse e/ffect on its insurance subsidiaries claim payments ability.\n\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of AXA's TSDI, the Company may, at its option, under certain circumstances and shall, in other circumstances, defer interest payment ( e.g . no dividend declared or paid in the preceding Annual Shareholders' Meeting or receipt by the Company or by certain of its principal insurance subsidiaries of a regulatory demand to restore their solvency position). Payment of deferred interest may become due in certain specified cases ( e.g . payment of a dividend, notification of the end of a regulatory demand to restore solvency, liquidation of the Company or redemption of the TSDI).\n\nIn particular, most of the Company's TSS include loss absorption mechanisms which provide that under certain circumstances where the Company does not meet its regulatory capital requirements, the principal amount of each of the relevant TSS will be written down. In such event, interest will become payable on the reduced principal amount only. The principal may be reinstated when the Company returns to financial health, as defined under the terms and conditions of the TSS.\n\nIn addition, for most of the Company's TSS, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's consolidated net earnings and shareholders' equity, the Company is required to defer payment of interest. In such events, the Company may choose to pay such deferred interest by way of alternative coupon settlement mechanisms within five years (such as, issuance of new shares or other securities including TSS or preference shares, sale of treasury shares, or an increase in the principal amount of the relevant notes, subject to applicable limits), failing which the interest is forfeited. However, the settlement of deferred interest becomes due, on a best e/fforts basis, in certain circumstances including redemption of the notes, liquidation of the Company, payment of a dividend or interest on any other TSS, any share buyback outside the Company's buy-back program, or any redemption or repurchase of other TSS.\n\nFinally, under its TSS, the Company has an option to cancel payments of interest upon the deterioration of its financial position, unless certain events have occurred in the preceding year ( e.g . a dividend payment or interest payment on any TSS, any share buy-back outside the Group share buy-back program or a repurchase or redemption of any TSS).",

In this context, AXA chose to adopt, in 2008, the Corporate Governance Code for French corporations (Code de gouvernement d'entreprises des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es) published by the Afep (Association fran\u00e7aise des entreprises priv\u00e9es) and the Medef (Mouvement des entreprises de France) (the 'Afep-Medef Code'). The Board of Directors believes that AXA's corporate governance practices are in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code (revised in January/uni00A02020/uni00A0and available on AXA's website/uni00A0www.axa.com ) and its accompanying guide and have followed the evolution of corporate governance practices in France and abroad, as well as the recommendations and standards of shareholders, regulators, the French High Committee for Corporate Governance (Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise), proxy advisors, rating agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF AXA'S GOVERNANCE\n\n## AXA's corporate governance framework\n\nSince April/uni00A02010, AXA has operated with a unitary Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board is assisted by three specialized Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board has adopted internal terms of reference (the 'Board's Terms of Reference') which detail in particular the role and\n\nI\n\nI\n\nresponsibilities of the Board and its Committees, as well as matters reserved for Board decisions. The Board's Terms of Reference include corporate governance requirements which, in certain instances, go beyond French regulatory requirements notably in relation to the role of the independent directors on the Board Committees.\n\n## Separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nFollowing Mr./uni00A0Henri de Castries' decision to step down from his positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer announced on March/uni00A021, 2016, the Board of Directors decided to separate the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer, appointing Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, former Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer and member of the Board, as non-executive Chairman and Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl as Chief Executive O/fficer on September/uni00A01, 2016.\n\nThis decision reflected the Board's conclusions that splitting the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer was consistent with the interest of the Company at that time. The Board concluded that the separation of roles would ensure that the Group benefits from the mix and complementarity of the respective experiences and skills of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl and Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne and would lead to a smooth transition.\n\nFollowing the decision to separate the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer, the Board of Directors also decided to maintain the position of Senior Independent Director for a variety of reasons including that Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne is not considered independent with regard to the Afep-Medef criteria due to his former role of Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer until August/uni00A031, 2016.",

AXA believes that in order for it to tackle the challenges ahead and create long-term value for the Group, its shareholders and all its stakeholders, AXA's Board of Directors should consist of high calibre men and women from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe Board of Directors also believes that such diversity is essential for the Board to function optimally, and that diversity is a source of creativity and boosts performance. It also broadens the analytical perspective of the issues discussed at Board meetings.\n\nConsequently, in view of the Group's global presence, the Board of Directors, assisted in this task by its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has set itself the target to have Board members with diverse nationalities and cultures to ensure a balanced and complementary Board composition, in terms of gender, expertise, experience and tenure of its members.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed for a fouryear term by the Shareholders' Meeting. On December/uni00A031, 2020, the Board of Directors comprised sixteen members/uni00A0- ten women and six men. An overview of the Board of Directors and the profile, experience and expertise of each director is provided on pages/uni00A0100 to/uni00A0111  of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\n3",

Candidates shortlisted by the Committee meet with its members, the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the other Board\n\nCommittees and the Chief Executive O/fficer. The Committee then submits its recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe implementation of the Board of Directors diversity policy is monitored and analysed each year as part of the Board's selfassessment process. In this respect, the Board notably assesses the selection process for directors and measures the progress made against the predefined diversity targets. The results of this self-assessment are also specifically discussed at a Board meeting once a year.\n\n## RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE PAST YEAR\n\nIn 2020, the Board took into account these diversity criteria, managing on the one hand, to maintain a gender balance and, on the other hand, to reinforce the diversity of profiles and expertise within the Board.\n\n## DIVERSITY POLICY TARGETS OF THE

In addition, the Board inter alia :\n\n- /uni25A0 chooses the appropriate corporate governance framework;\n- /uni25A0 appoints and dismisses the Chairman, any Vice-Chairman/ Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive O/fficer, any Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer, any dirigeant effectif (executive who e/ffectively runs the Company as required by Solvency/uni00A0II), and determines their respective compensation;\n- /uni25A0 convenes Shareholders' Meetings;\n- /uni25A0 proposes directors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and/or coopts directors to the Board;\n- /uni25A0 reviews and endorses (arr\u00eate) the Company's and the Group's half-year and annual financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 presents a report on corporate governance to the Shareholders' Meeting;\n- /uni25A0 fulfills all the Board obligations set out in Solvency/uni00A0II;\n- /uni25A0 adopts and oversees the general principles of the Group's Remuneration policy;\n- /uni25A0 reviews the strategies and the policies on the taking, management and monitoring of risks as well as the conclusions of the internal assessment of risks and solvency (ORSA/uni00A0- Own Risk and Solvency Assessment/uni00A0- report);\n- /uni25A0 proposes Statutory Auditors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and approves non-audit services.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer, who is also a Board member, is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company and to represent the Company in its relationships with third parties. However, the Board of Directors also reserves the approval of certain material transactions to itself in its Terms of Reference, including sales or acquisitions (over \u20ac500/uni00A0million), significant financing operations and any material transactions outside the strategy announced by the Company.\n\nTo ensure that the personal interests of the members of the Board of Directors and those of the Company are appropriately aligned, the Board's Terms of Reference provide that each member of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the directors representing the employees) must hold, within two years following his/her first appointment, a number of AXA shares with a value at least equal to the gross annual amount of his/her compensation (director's fees) earned in respect of the previous fiscal year/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn accordance with French law, the Chairman's role is to organize and oversee the work of the Board of Directors. In this context, he sets the agenda of the Board meetings, holds regular discussions with the Chief Executive O/fficer and the directors, requests any document or information necessary to help the Board of Directors for the preparation of its meetings, verifies the quality of the information provided and more generally, ensures that Board members are in a position to fulfill their role. Prior to each meeting, Board members receive documentation concerning matters to be reviewed, generally eight days in advance of Board meetings.\n\nThe Chairman convenes the members of the Board without directors who are members of the Executive Management being present, in particular to allow debates on the performance and compensation of the Executive Management and succession planning.\n\nFollowing its decision to appoint Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne as Chairman, the Board decided, in light of his experience and expertise and knowledge of the AXA Group, to extend the role of the Chairman as follows/uni00A0 (2) :\n\n- /uni25A0 promote the Company's values and culture in particular in relation to corporate responsibility and professional ethics;\n- /uni25A0 upon request by the Chief Executive O/fficer, represent the Company in its relations, nationally and internationally with public bodies, institutions, regulators, shareholders and the Company's main strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 consult with the Chief Executive O/fficer on major topics and events relating to the Company (including the Company's strategy, major acquisition or divestment projects, significant financial transactions, major community projects and the appointment of the most senior executives of the Group);\n- /uni25A0 upon invitation of the Chief Executive O/fficer, take part in internal meetings with Group executives and teams to provide his opinion on strategic issues or projects;\n- /uni25A0 assist and advise the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn this context, in 2020, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, notably:\n\n- /uni25A0 represented the Company at various national and international events attended by certain of the Group's main partners and strategic stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 had discussions with the main institutional shareholders of the Company, in particular prior to the Shareholders' Meeting; and\n\nI\n\nI",

Under French law, it is the Chief Executive O/fficer who is solely responsible for the Company's operational leadership and management.\n\nMr. Denis Duverne, Chairman of AXA's Board of Directors, shall retire, as planned, at the end of his current mandate in April 2022.

The Senior Independent Director also reviews, with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the agenda of Board meetings and the quality of information provided to the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Senior Independent Director may convene meetings of independent members of the Board, without the presence of the Chairman and Executive Management, in particular, to assess the performance of the Chairman, review his compensation and prepare his succession plan. He may also request the Chairman to convene the Board on a specific agenda.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director reports on his activities to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn 2020, the Senior Independent Director, also acting as Chairman of the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee:\n\n- /uni25A0 maintained regular dialogue with the Chairman of the Board and with the Executive Management ( i.e. the Chief Executive O/fficer and the Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer (Dir ecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Adjoint) );\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.1/uni00A0CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n- /uni25A0 was actively involved in the preparation of Board meetings, working closely with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management;\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the selection process of the future members of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- /uni25A0 worked closely with the Chairman of the Board on the organization of the annual self-assessment of the Board;\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the review of all communications made to shareholders in particular on corporate governance topics and Executive Management compensation.\n\nHe reported on his activities at the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A030, 2020.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors met fourteen times and held four executive sessions without the presence of Executive Management.\n\nIn 2020, the Board notably focused on the review of the Group's strategy, the management of the COVID-19/uni00A0sanitary crisis, the examination of the 2019/uni00A0financial statements and the 2020/uni00A0halfyear financial statements, the Group's dividend policy, the review of proposed significant acquisitions and disposals, the review of the Board Committee reports, the review of the ORSA report and AXA's Internal Model as well as other written policies required under Solvency/uni00A0II, the Group's Pre-emptive Recovery Plan, Internal Control and Risk Management, the approval of non-audit services, the self-assessment of the Board of Directors and the appointments, re-appointments and independence of its members, the review of the composition of the Board and its Committees and the succession plans for the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Management.\n\nIn March/uni00A02020, the Board of Directors held its annual strategy session with presentations by Group senior executives on a variety of key strategic topics related to the implementation of the Strategic Plan.\n\nIn 2020, a training session was also organized by the Chairman of the Board on the impact of the energy transition on financial markets and AXA's investment strategy, during which external speakers were invited.\n\nTraining sessions were also organized for new members of the Board of Directors to familiarize them with the Group's main activities and issues.

The conclusions of this self-assessment are discussed annually at the Board of Directors.\n\nSince 2013, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has periodically entrusted the annual assessment of the Board of Directors to an external consultant.\n\nIn 2018, the Board self-assessment was carried out by a consultant (SpencerStuart) who collected each of the individual director's inputs, views and suggestions on the Board work and its performance. Each director's view on other members' participation and contribution to the Board work was also collected.\n\nIn 2020/uni00A0as in 2019, the Board self-assessment was conducted internally and all directors (except the Chairman of the Board and new joiners) answered a self-assessment questionnaire and had a meeting with the Chairman of the Board in order to assess the e/ffectiveness of the Board and each Board member's contribution. The conclusions concerning the personal contribution of each director were then transmitted by the Chairman of the Board who provided individual feedback during dedicated one-on-one meetings with each Board member.\n\nEach director also had a meeting with the Chairman of the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee in order to collect his/ her assessment and suggestions on the personal contribution of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The conclusions of these interviews were then submitted by the Chairman of the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee reviewed in detail (i)/uni00A0the conclusions of the Board self-assessment, (ii)/uni00A0the principal areas identified for improvement and made recommendations to the Board of Directors which were examined and approved at the Board meeting of December/uni00A015, 2020.\n\nThe 2020/uni00A0Board self-assessment demonstrated that a majority of directors agreed that the functioning of the Board had remained unchanged at a high level or either improved due to the maturity of processes and the efficiency of the team formed by the Chairman and the Chief Executive O/fficer. It was also noted that the COVID-19/uni00A0sanitary crisis, which restricted physical meetings and informal discussions around Board sessions, had made the year quite unusual.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors identified the following areas of improvement:\n\n- /uni25A0 closely monitor the selection of future Board members with the objective of appointing (i)/uni00A0directors with predefined critical skills (industry knowledge, digital transformation/IT/technology, HR, customer/marketing skills) and (ii)/uni00A0an additional seasoned and active CEO;\n- /uni25A0 closely monitor the selection process for the future Chairman of the Board of Directors;\n- /uni25A0 carefully manage the succession process for the Chairperson of the Finance and Audit Committees;\n- /uni25A0 review and consider simplifying the framework of the CEO's (and Executive Management) compensation;\n- /uni25A0 regularly update the Board on the implementation of the main action points listed at the end of the annual strategic seminar;\n- /uni25A0 provide the Board with post-mortem analysis or follow-up reports on the most important decisions or projects discussed/ approved by the Board;\n- /uni25A0 establish a remote meeting culture until the end of the COVID-19/uni00A0sanitary crisis and maintain close and informal contacts between Board members by: (i)/uni00A0organizing at the beginning of each remote meeting a pre-session to allow directors to freely speak amongst each other on topics of their choice and (ii)/uni00A0encouraging one-to-one contacts with the Chairman, the CEO and between Board members between meetings;\n- /uni25A0 facilitate the onboarding of new directors (despite the di/fficult context due to the COVID-19/uni00A0sanitary crisis) through the organization of regular discussions between new directors and seasoned ones ( e.g . Chairs of the Committees);\n- /uni25A0 provide a continuous skills development program to Board members with the organization of one or two/uni00A0dedicated knowledge session(s) a year conveying external speaker(s) and keep involving the directors in the choice of the training sessions' topics;\n- /uni25A0 continue to provide and improve the frequency of information sent by the CEO on insurance sector-related news or reactions to public announcements made by the Company.",

In this context, its main objective is to encourage the achievement of ambitious objectives and the creation of long-term value by setting challenging performance criteria.\n\nAXA's executive compensation structure is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices in France and abroad, within the financial services sector (insurance companies, banks, asset managers,/uni00A0etc.) and of other international groups.\n\nAXA Group's overall policy on executive compensation focuses on the variable part of the compensation package, which is the compensation at risk for beneficiaries. The structure of AXA's executive compensation is composed of a variable portion which represents a significant part of the aggregate compensation. This is designed to align executive compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders while encouraging performance:\n\n- /uni25A0 both on an individual and collective level; and\n- /uni25A0 over the short, medium and long term.\n\n| Individual  Performance   | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   |              |                      |                           | Performance  Shares                      |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                           |                       |                          |                          |              |                      | Deferred Variable         |                                          |\n|                           |                       |                          |                          |              | Annual Variable      | Annual Variable           |                                          |\n|                           |                       |                          |                          | Fixed Salary | Fixed Salary         | Fixed Salary              |                                          |\n|                           |                       |                          |                          | Current      | Short term  (1 year) | Medium term (2 - 3 years) | Medium -  Long/uni00A0term (3 - 5 years) |\n\nI\n\nI",

Their independence is assessed annually by the Board in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Afep-Medef Code. The Senior Independent Director is the Chairman of the Committee and presents the compensation policy of the Company each year at the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Committee meets frequently with the Group Executives and the departments of the Company including Group Human Resources and Group Legal. The Committee is empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews and to use external consulting expertise to the extent deemed appropriate. Thus, during the last few/uni00A0years, the Committee worked several times with a compensation-consulting firm in order to benefit from an external technical expertise and an independent overview in order to compare AXA's variable compensation practices with general market practices.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II Group remuneration policy\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II regulations came into force on January/uni00A01, 2016, and include a number of specific compensation and governance requirements applicable to European insurers and reinsurers. In this context, AXA has undertaken a comprehensive review of its existing compensation policies and practices against the requirements of Solvency/uni00A0II and has adopted a Remuneration Policy applicable to all AXA employees as of January/uni00A01, 2016. This Remuneration Policy is designed to support the Group's longterm business strategy and to align the interests of its employees with those of other stakeholders by/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0establishing a clear link between performance and remuneration over the short, medium and long term, (ii)/uni00A0ensuring that the Group can o/ffer competitive compensation arrangements across the multiple markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii)/uni00A0ensuring compliance with Solvency/uni00A0II regulations and any other applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe AXA Group Remuneration Policy is designed to:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 drive superior performance;\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with business performance;\n- /uni25A0 ensure that employees are not incentivized to take inappropriate and/or excessive risks and that they operate within AXA's overall risk framework; and\n- /uni25A0 ensure compliance of the Group's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n- It follows four main guiding principles:\n- /uni25A0 competitiveness and market consistency of the remuneration practices;\n- /uni25A0 fairness based on individual and collective performance, in order to ensure remuneration is reflecting employee's individual quantitative and qualitative achievements and impact;\n- /uni25A0 internal equity based on remuneration policies and procedures designed to ensure that employees are paid equitably based on criteria such as role, skills, contribution or impact, and do not discriminate on the basis of gender or other irrelevant factors;\n- /uni25A0 achievement of the Group's overall financial and operational objectives over the short, medium and long term as well as execution against medium and long-term strategic objectives as a prerequisite to fund any mid-to-long term award.\n\nThe requirements set out in the Group Remuneration Policy may be supplemented in order to comply with local regulatory requirements or best practices. The Policy is reviewed and updated annually to mirror, as the case may be, changes in the internal organization and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to AXA's business and to reflect exchanges with the French insurance regulator ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR)).\n\n## Remuneration structure\n\nAXA applies a pay-for-performance approach which (i)/uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance by incorporating risk adjustment mechanisms in variable compensation schemes, and (ii)/uni00A0recognizes employees who bring the greatest value to the firm on the basis of financial results while demonstrating individual leadership and behaviours. The intent of this approach is to attract and retain the best skills and talents, to foster employee engagement and to strengthen AXA's leadership.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Fixed remuneration primarily reflects the relevant organizational responsibility, professional experience, technical and leadership skills required of the role, criticality or scarcity of skills, as well as the individual's capability to sustainably perform the duties of the role;\n- /uni25A0 a variable component which primarily reflects the business and individual performance, including performance in excess of that required to fulfil the role description. It comprises of an upfront cash element (annual cash bonus) and a deferred element recognizing the importance of aligning remuneration over longterm value creation. The deferred element is awarded through AXA performance shares. This variable component depends on the AXA Group's global performance, on the beneficiary's operating business performance, and on the achievement of the executive's individual objectives including demonstrated abilities for leadership. The variable portion is designed to represent a substantial component of the executive's global compensation and, where an executive attains or exceeds the set objectives, to position the compensation levels of AXA executives between the median and the third quartile (or, in certain cases, beyond the third quartile) of the market reference.\n\nThe target level of the executives' compensation and the structure of the elements which compose such compensation are based on a detailed analysis of market practices as well as potential applicable national and international regulations, and also take into consideration various other factors including the equity principles within the Group and the previous compensation level of the executive.\n\nEach year, AXA, with the assistance of specialized firms, conducts compensation reviews in order to ensure the competitiveness and consistency of executives' compensation and to measure the suitability of the global remuneration policies. In this context, three markets are used as a reference:\n\n- /uni25A0 a first market composed of 12/uni00A0companies in the French CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0index (companies selected to form the panel, which may vary from year-to-year, are comparable to AXA in terms of stock capitalization, revenues, sector, number of employees and/or geographic coverage);\n- /uni25A0 a second market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the main European markets (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland), and in the United States;\n- /uni25A0 a third market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in Asia.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Annual cash compensation\n\n## TOTAL TARGET COMPENSATION\n\n## Total target compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has decided to maintain unchanged in 2020/uni00A0the total annual cash compensation target of the Chief Executive O/fficer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, at \u20ac2,900,000.\n\nThis total target compensation is composed of a fixed annual compensation and a target annual variable compensation.\n\nThe fixed annual compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer amounts to \u20ac1,450,000/uni00A0and the variable component of his compensation is set at \u20ac1,450,000, i.e. 100% of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nThe total amount of compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer and the balance between its di/fferent components (fixed and variable) are mainly based on a study by an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) on compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0companies as well as the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks), and follows the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the G20, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board in terms of compensation.\n\n## Total compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon proposal of its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has decided to maintain unchanged in 2020/uni00A0the fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, at \u20ac1,200,000.\n\nThe Board of Directors upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee and pursuant to the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code considered that the compensation structure best suited for the Chairman of the Board of Directors was to limit his compensation to a sole fixed annual compensation.\n\nIn order to determine the Chairman of the Board of Directors' fixed annual compensation, the Board of Directions consulted an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) regarding compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0companies as well as the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks).\n\nThe Board of Directors also took into account the extensive duties that it entrusted Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne with as Chairman of the Board of Directors as described in Section/uni00A03.1/uni00A0of this Annual Report.\n\nFurthermore, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, who claimed his rights to pension as of September/uni00A01, 2016, has decided to waive payment, for his entire term of o/ffice as Chairman of the Board of Directors, of the annuities which he would have received as from September/uni00A01, 2016, under the complementary pension scheme for Group executive o/fficers in France, amounting to circa \u20ac750,000/uni00A0per year. Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne has decided not to receive payment of these annuities until termination of his term of o/ffice as Chairman of the Board without retroactive payment.",

The compensation that was not paid to Mr./uni00A0Duverne (and corresponding taxes) were donated by AXA to charity.\n\n## ANNUAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND/uni202FPERFORMANCE/uni202FCONDITIONS\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe variable annual compensation is entirely subject to performance conditions and no minimum payment is guaranteed.\n\nThe determination of the variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, was based in 2020/uni00A0on the following two metrics:\n\n- /uni25A0 Group performance for 70% (compared to 50% last year). This metric is measured based on (i)/uni00A0underlying earnings per share, (ii)/uni00A0return on equity (adjusted Return on Equity/uni00A0- RoE), (iii)/uni00A0gross revenues, both in Commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty and Health/uni00A0& Protection, (iv)/uni00A0Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index), and (v)/uni00A0non-commission expenses. The relative weight of each indicator is, respectively, 55%, 15%, 10%, 10% and 10%.\n\nThe selected indicators to measure the Group performance reflect objectives widely disclosed internally and externally with respect to growth, profitability, capital management, operational e/fficiency and proximity with clients. Thus, these indicators, directly linked to the strategic orientations of the Group, are both financial and operating criteria and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target.\n\nThe results of the calculation were significantly impacted by the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. Given the demanding nature of the objectives, the strict application of the formula determined by the Board of Directors at the beginning of 2020/uni00A0to assess the Group performance sets the global achievement rate of these objectives at 35%. A complete neutralization of the impact of the sanitary crisis (\u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion on the 2020/uni00A0underlining earnings) would set the global achievement rate of the Group performance at 68%.\n\nIn determining the appropriate level of the CEO's variable compensation for 2020, the Board took into account a number of factors in addition to this global achievement rates. These factors included:\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni202FSHARE/uni202FOWNERSHIP\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the dividend paid to the shareholders of the Company with respect to the 2019/uni00A0fiscal year (corresponding to 51% of the amount initially communicated to the market/uni00A0 (1) ), despite a challenging macro-economic environment,\n- \u00b7 the fact that the Company did not request or receive any State aid or other assistance in connection with this crisis (guaranteed loans, temporary unemployment, subsidies or other forms of government assistance\u2026) in any of the markets in which it operates,\n- \u00b7 the fact that the Group publicly committed to protect the employment and compensation of its employees during the crisis and o/ffered the ability to work remotely for several months to most of its employees,\n- \u00b7 the Group's substantial contributions to various crisis-related social/solidarity initiatives in numerous jurisdictions where it does business which totaled more than \u20ac400/uni00A0million (funding of medical research, contribution to solidarity funds for small businesses, independents, clients in di/fficult situations\u2026), as well as\n- \u00b7 the exceptional measures implemented to help AXA's most a/ffected customers/clients (freezing and reimbursing of premiums, maintaining guaranties despite payment di/fficulties\u2026).\n\nA/f\\_ter extensive discussion and upon recommendation of its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, the Board decided to adjust the mechanical achievement score by taking the average of the scores with neutralization of the impact of the sanitary crisis (68%) and without it (35%) to set the score of the Group performance, leading to a score of 51%/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nBoth the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee and the Board of Directors considered that this score of 51%/uni00A0 (3) (i)/uni00A0was more representative of the performance of the Group and its Management in 2020/uni00A0and (ii)/uni00A0would help align the Management's interests with those of the Company and its shareholders in accordance with the Group's compensation policy.\n\n- /uni25A0 Individual performance for 30% (compared to 50% last year), which is evaluated based on objectives specifically related to strategic initiatives set and reviewed each year.\n\nThe individual performance of the Chief Executive O/fficer is assessed on the basis of various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives set by the Board of Directors through a written target letter drawn up at the beginning of each calendar year, as well as on the basis of demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/fficer. This letter includes detailed objectives about the Group's progress in the elaboration  of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives designed to assess the level of achievement of global strategic initiatives and/or relating to certain geographic areas, and the evolution of certain investments contributing to the development of the Group's operations.\n\nI\n\nI",

Shortly a/f\\_t  er his appointment, Mr./uni00A0Gunter launched a fundamental redesign of AXA XL's Target Operating Model and a revamp of AXA XL's leadership team.\n\nIn addition to this restructuring, a full portfolio review exercise was undertaken and a number of key product, pricing and underwriting decisions were implemented with a view to reshaping the portfolio and increasing profitability. Finally, a number of actions were taken to drive deeper integration with the AXA Group and achieve greater e/fficiencies and synergies. The Group CEO and various other Group senior executives were actively involved in these initiatives throughout 2020.\n\nWhile AXA XL's 2020/uni00A0financial results were adversely impacted by the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis, the Board believes that the decisive moves made in 2020/uni00A0to replace the former AXA XL CEO, reconstitute the senior management team, fundamentally restructure the comp any and re-underwrite the portfolio, position the company well for the future.\n\n## \u00b7 Improve the stability and simplicity of the Group's balance sheet (achievement rate: 130%)\n\nThe simplification of the Group's geographical footprint was continued with the disposals of AXA Poland, AXA Czech Republic/uni00A0& Slovakia, AXA Gulf, AXA Greece and AXA Bank Belgium, all underway or successfully completed, generating cumulated cash proceeds of \u20ac1.0bn for the Group as at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nProduct simplification also progressed well.\n\nAt the same time, Management ensured that the Group's financial situation remained robust throughout the year. At year-end 2020, the Group's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio and cash position stood at 200% and \u20ac4.2/uni00A0billion respectively, demonstrating outstanding resilience.\n\nIn addition, the deleveraging objective has been met, with the Group's debt gearing ratio now at 26.8%, well within the 25-28% target range.\n\n## \u00b7 2021-2023/uni00A0strategic plan and efficiency (achievement rate: 125%)\n\nWith the Group's Ambition 2020/uni00A0plan reaching its term, Management developed the strategic plan 2021-2023/uni00A0that was presented to the market on December 1/uni00A0and well received.\n\nThe new plan leverages the achievements of Ambition 2020/uni00A0and was built in a bottom-up process involving the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPartners Group and Group Leadership Network ( GLN /uni00A0- AXA's 300/uni00A0Top Senior Executives). The plan focuses on five priorities: (i)/uni00A0Expand Health and Protection including through services, across all geographies, (ii)/uni00A0Simplify customer experience and accelerate e/fficiency, particularly in Europe and France, (iii)/uni00A0Strengthen underwriting performance, notably at AXA XL, (iv)/uni00A0Sustain the Group's climate leadership position in shaping the climate transition and (v)/uni00A0Grow cash flows across the Group through continued life in-force management and Group simplification, and disciplined capital management.\n\nAn appropriate governance set-up with clear tracking mechanisms is in place and will ensure Management's regular follow-up of the progress against these priorities.\n\n## \u00b7 Innovation (achievement rate: 120%)\n\nThe organization and mandate of the Group's innovation business unit, AXA Next, was redesigned and rolled-out in September/uni00A02020. The new organization is focused on a limited set of key topics, and far more delivery oriented.\n\nThe relevance of the Group's strategic focus on health since 2016/uni00A0was reinforced by the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. For instance, The Group's telemedicine o/ffer is now available to more than 7/uni00A0million beneficiaries in Europe and progress was made to launch new health partnerships with large players in di/fferent markets. The Group also started to roll out a Digital Health Platform, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for health services in Europe (Germany and Italy in the first stage) and increased its e/fforts around profitable care coordination models and vertical integration in International and New Markets, which serves 450,000/uni00A0clients through a network of 12/uni00A0medical centers.\n\n## \u00b7 HR (achievement rate: 130%)\n\nThe crisis put a significant strain on AXA's organization and considerable pressure on its people, making the 2020/uni00A0HR achievements all the more important. The employee Net Promoter Score increased during 2020, exceeding the +25/uni00A0target and reaching +35/uni00A0in December/uni00A02020/uni00A0(compared to +21/uni00A0in December/uni00A02019). In addition to a particular focus employee engagement and well-being in the context of the COVID-19, Management's involvement in a constructive and sustained dialogue with social organizations both in regular and exceptional European Works Councils was critical to the Company's ability to successfully navigate through the crisis.\n\nManagement's continued focus on gender diversity led to an increase of senior executive women with women now accounting for 34% of the GLN ( versus 32% in 2019), 30% of Chief Executive O/fficers member of the GLN ( versus 21% in 2019) and 27% of the Partners Group  ( versus 23% in 2019).\n\nKey 2020/uni00A0executive moves were also successfully executed, with Scott Gunter's arrival at AXA XL and Marco Morelli's arrival at AXA IM having been smooth and e/ffective.",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Sustainability (achievement rate: 130%)\n\nIn 2020, AXA's long tradition of corporate commitment was formalized through the update of its purpose, unveiled in June/uni00A02020: 'Act for human progress by protecting what matters', as well as in its embedding as one of the new strategic plan's five priorities.\n\nInternal governance changes reflected this growing importance of sustainability matters, with the creation of a Role in Society Steering Committee to accelerate the integration of ESG criteria across the business and continue the development of AXA's sustainability leadership, which was rewarded in 2020/uni00A0by improvement of AXA's ranking in the DJSI (improving its absolute score by +5/uni00A0points and reaching #2/uni00A0of the insurance sector). In order to further strengthen the Groups' commitment, the weight of sustainability KPIs in senior executives' compensation has been increased, reaching 30% of their Long-Term Incentives.\n\nExternally, AXA continued to a/ffirm its leadership position on Climate, be it by spearheading cross-industry action groups (WEF European Green Deal CEO Action Group ; PEIF's sustainable finance workstream), calling for the creation of UN-convened Net-Zero Underwriting Alliance, or taking further commitments (decrease the carbon footprint of the Group's General Account assets by an additional -20% by 2025) on top of existing ones ( e.g. Euro 24/uni00A0billion green investments by 2023).\n\nFinally, Inclusive protection e/fforts were continued, notably through the CEO Partnership for financial inclusion. At the end of 2020, AXA insured 22.3/uni00A0million 'emerging customers', compared to 18.6/uni00A0million in 2019. AXA also got involved in the COVAX scheme, providing insurance and risk consulting expertise for the distribution of the COVID-19/uni00A0vaccines in middle-to-low income countries.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors noted that 2020/uni00A0was an unprecedented year by many metrics. The COVID-19/uni00A0crisis and its far-reaching economic, social and political consequences created an exceptionally challenging context for businesses to navigate. Notwithstanding these extraordinary circumstances, AXA navigated through the crisis relatively well and comes out of it well positioned for the future in both comparative and absolute terms.\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni202FSHARE/uni202FOWNERSHIP\n\nThe Board also highlighted the reactivity of Management in ensuring operational continuity across the Group during the crisis with the implementation of a robust crisis governance designed to manage/coordinate the various aspects including (i)/uni00A0the safety of AXA's people, (ii)/uni00A0the implementation of remote working across the entire Group on a common platform which enabled business continuity and open lines of communication, (iii)/uni00A0proactive communication with the Group's employees throughout the crisis/uni00A0- both locally and globally/uni00A0- to ensure they were informed of significant developments in real time, (iv)/uni00A0implementation of consolidated, real time reporting on key financial metrics to ensure management had the necessary information to manage through the crisis, (v)/uni00A0engagement with a wide array external stakeholders across the various countries where the Group does business and (vi)/uni00A0overall stability of its activities. Supporting the employees' physical and mental health has also been a priority, be it by leveraging telemedicine and AXA Partners to provide support and advice or through dedicated mental health programs and trainings. These actions are reflected in the remarkable increase in the employee Net Promoter Score all along the year.\n\nDespite a most unpredictable and historically complex macrocontext, Management successfully delivered on the objectives it had been assigned by the Board of Directors pre-crisis.\n\nEach of these two metrics is evaluated separately so that overall variable payout reflects performance against two distinct components assessed independently. Each of these two metrics is in any case capped at a 150% achievement rate.\n\nThe determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer is based on the following additive formula: Variable compensation due = Target Variable compensation x (70% Group Performance + 30% Individual Performance).\n\nSince 2020/uni00A0performance year, the weight of the Group Performance within the variable compensation assessment has increased to 70% leading to a decrease of the Individual Performance weight to 30%. With this evolution, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, wished to strengthen the formulaic/quantitative component of the Chief Executive O/fficer's variable compensation, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors.\n\nI\n\n3",

With this evolution, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, wished to simplify the calibration of the Group's performance, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors.\n\nThe total e/ffective variable compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer may not exceed 150% of his variable target compensation, i.e. 150% of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nA deferral mechanism applies to 30% of his variable compensation over a two-year period.\n\nPursuant to Article/uni00A0L.22-10-34/uni00A0II of the French Commercial Code, the payment of the Chief Executive O/fficer's 2020/uni00A0variable compensation is withheld until the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2021.\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the other members of the Management Committee\n\nFor the other members of the Management Committee, their variable compensation is also determined on the basis of an individual predefined target which is entirely based on the following formulas.\n\nManagement Committee members' performance with operating business responsibilities is determined according to the following metrics: 50%* (50% Entity Score + 50% Group STIC Score) + 50% Individual Performance Score.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe variable compensation of the members of the Management Committee with Group responsibilities is determined according to the following metrics: (50%  Group STIC Score + 50% Individual Performance Score).\n\nGroup performance is measured by the (i)/uni00A0Underlying earnings per share, (ii)/uni00A0Return on Equity (adjusted Return on Equity/uni00A0- ROE), (iii) G ross revenues in both Commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty and Health/uni00A0& Protection, (iv)/uni00A0Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index), and (v)/uni00A0non-commission expenses. Individual performance is evaluated considering predetermined objectives specifically deriving from strategic initiatives.\n\nThe performance of operating businesses is determined in particular on the basis of the following performance indicators:\n\n- /uni25A0 Underlying earnings;\n- /uni25A0 Commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty Gross revenues;\n- /uni25A0 Health/uni00A0& Protection Gross revenues;\n- /uni25A0 Net Promoter Score;\n- /uni25A0 Non-commission expenses;\n- /uni25A0 Property/uni00A0& Casualty current year Combined ratio.\n\nFor 2020/uni00A0performance year, indicators that measure the Group performance have been defined at the beginning of the year with:\n\n- /uni25A0 a predefined target, aligned with the strategic plan (budget) , the completion of which will result in 100% achievement;",

The actual amount to be paid will vary depending on the AXA share price performance over the deferral period and will be subject to a minimum of 80% and a cap at 120% of the deferred amount; provided, however that no deferred variable compensation would be paid in the event (i)/uni00A0that the Group's underlying earnings are negative for the year ending immediately prior to the year of scheduled payout, or (ii)/uni00A0of resignation or dismissal, for gross or willful misconduct prior to the payout date.\n\nThe variable compensation deferral is subject to a malus mechanism which, while not required by applicable laws in France, is designed to further align AXA with international practices and regulations on executive compensation in the financial services industry.\n\nAt the end of February/uni00A02021,/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0the second tranche of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's deferred variable compensation for the 2018/uni00A0fiscal year, i.e. an amount of \u20ac230,122/uni00A0and (ii)/uni00A0the first tranche of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's deferred variable compensation for the 2019/uni00A0fiscal year i.e. an amount of \u20ac193,140/uni00A0were paid.\n\nThese amounts reflect the evolution of the AXA share price and were set at 89% of the deferred variable compensation granted in respect of the 2018/uni00A0fiscal year and at 80% in respect of the 2019/uni00A0fiscal year.\n\nAll the amounts presented in this Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0are gross amounts and before taxation.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI ) annual allotment\n\nEach year, LTIs (performance shares) are granted to Group executives.\n\nThese LTIs represent a significant part of their global variable compensation in order to associate the Group executives to the creation of long-term value.

This compensation consists of \u20ac375,000/uni00A0of fixed compensation and \u20ac305,117/uni00A0of variable compensation.\n\nMrs./uni00A0Angelien Kemna received in 2020/uni00A0directors' fees of \u20ac90,000/uni00A0in respect of her non-executive mandate in a Group subsidiary (AXA Investment Managers/uni00A0SA).\n\n## Performance shares and international performance shares\n\nPerformance shares are designed to recognize and motivate the Group's best talents and core skills by aligning the individuals' interests with the overall performance of the AXA Group, and the corresponding operational Entity/Business Unit as well as with the stock performance of the AXA share over the medium-long term. Performance shares generally result in low shareholder dilution due to the possibility to deliver existing shares, this choice being the one made up to this date.\n\nPerformance shares are usually granted to beneficiaries residing in France while international performance shares are generally granted to beneficiaries residing outside of France.\n\n## GRANT PROCEDURE\n\nWithin the multi-annual cap authorized by the shareholders, the Board of Directors approves all performance share programs prior to their implementation.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors, acting upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, approves a global performance share pool to be granted.\n\nThe recommendations for grants of performance shares are made by the management of each operating business and by the Group's functional department heads. These recommendations are reviewed by the Executive Management to ensure a global coherence and respect of the Group's internal equity principles. Individual grants of performance shares are then decided by the Board of Directors, provided that individual grants to the Chief Executive O/fficer and other members of the Management Committee are preceded by a proposal of the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, which takes into consideration their aggregate compensation elements as well as the market studies carried out by the Group together with an independent compensation-consulting firm. Furthermore, the grant to AXA executive o/fficers shall depend on the level of achievement of the strategic objectives previously defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company, in line with market best practices, applies a regular and consistent formula to determine the number of shares to be granted each year to the beneficiaries.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the total number of performance shares granted to the Company's executive o/fficers each year may not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of performance shares granted during the same year, to avoid an excessive concentration of performance shares granted to the executive o/fficers.\n\nFinally, in 2019, AXA decided to simplify the structure of the senior executives' total variable compensation by implementing, in March (starting from 2020), a single pay award with (i)/uni00A0variable cash compensation and (ii)/uni00A0grant of performance shares. Thus, since 2020, the annual grant of performance shares has been made in March.\n\n## RULES REGARDING PERFORMANCE SHARES AND PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nEach beneficiary receives an initial preliminary allocation of performance shares which is then used as a reference to calculate the number of shares that will be definitely granted at the end of a 3-year performance period.\n\nDuring the performance period, all performance shares initially granted are integrally subject to performance conditions regardless of the beneficiary's status. These criteria measure both the financial and operational performance of the AXA Group as well as the beneficiary's operating business performance, according to pre-determined targets.\n\nThe achievement rate of the performance conditions ('performance rate') is used to determine the number of shares, which will be definitively acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period, under the condition that the beneficiary is still employed by the AXA Group. The number of performance shares definitively granted shall therefore be equal to the number of performance shares initially granted multiplied by the performance rate, which may vary between 0% and 130%.",

        "page_content": "Thus, during the last few/uni00A0years, the performance criteria have been linked to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0the underlying earnings and the adjusted earnings to measure the operating businesses' performance, and (ii)/uni00A0the adjusted earnings per share to measure the AXA Group performance.\n\nThe AXA Group performance weighted for 40% performance of the total performance while the operating business weighted for 50%. For beneficiaries in Group functions (including AXA executive o/fficers) as well as Heads of Control Functions, the considered operating business is the AXA Group.\n\nIn 2016, two relative performance criteria were introduced in the calculation of the global performance:\n\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to Corporate Responsibility/uni00A0- CR (based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index/uni00A0- DJSI) weighting for 10% of the global performance rate. Accordingly, the average of the scores achieved by AXA according to the DJSI during the performance period was compared to the average of the scores achieved by the other companies included in the DJSI over the same period. Consequently, under this indicator:\n- \u00b7 no share should be granted if AXA's score were lower than the 75 th /uni00A0percentile/uni00A0 (1) ,\n- \u00b7 80% of the shares should be granted if AXA's score were equal to the 75 th /uni00A0percentile,\n- \u00b7 100% of the shares should be granted if AXA's score were equal to the 85 th /uni00A0percentile, and\n- \u00b7 a maximum of 130% of the shares should be granted if AXA's score were equal or greater than the 95 th /uni00A0percentile;\n\nBetween these minimal and maximal performance levels, the number of shares definitely granted was calculated on a linear basis depending on the performance achieved;\n\n- /uni25A0 one financial criterion of relative performance meant to compare the growth of the total return of the AXA share (Total Shareholder Return/uni00A0- TSR) with the growth of the TSR of the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP/uni00A0 (2) ) in order to adjust upwards or downwards within the limit of 5/uni00A0points the global performance rate. Thus, AXA's outperformance (150% or more) compared to the SXIP index should trigger a maximum increase of the global performance rate of 5/uni00A0points (subject however to the upper limit of 130% of the global performance rate) and AXA's under-performance (75% or less) compared to the SXIP index shall trigger a maximum decrease of 5/uni00A0points of the global performance rate. Between these minimal and maximal performance levels, the number of shares definitely granted should be calculated on a linear basis depending on the performance achieved.\n\nThe global performance rate was therefore calculated as follows: [10% CR (DJSI) + 40% Group performance (Adjusted earnings per share) + 50% operating business performance [average (Adjusted earnings + Underlying earnings)]] +/-5/uni00A0points of relative performance (TSR) within the upper limit of 130%.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni202FSHARE/uni202FOWNERSHIP\n\nSince the 2017/uni00A0grant, the performance target setting was aligned with the financial targets of the strategic plan over the performance period ( i.e. 3/uni00A0years).\n\nIn the event of 100% achievement of the strategic plan targets ('target'), the number of shares definitively granted at the end of the acquisition period would be equal to the number of performance shares initially granted.\n\nAccordingly, for all beneficiaries except AXA's executive o/fficers and members of the Management Committee, should the performance be:\n\n- /uni25A0 lower than  80% of the performance required to reach the target, no share would be delivered to the beneficiary at the end of the acquisition period; consequently the beneficiaries were not guaranteed a minimal grant/gain;\n- /uni25A0 equal to 80% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 80% of the number initially granted;\n- /uni25A0 equal to 100% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 100% of the number initially granted;\n- /uni25A0 equal to or higher than 130% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 130% of the number initially granted.\n\nFor the executive o/fficers and members of the Management Committee, should the performance be:\n\n- /uni25A0 lower than the average cumulated results achieved over the 3/uni00A0 years immediately prior to the grant date, no share would be delivered to the beneficiary at the end of the acquisition period; consequently, in the absence of growth, no share would be granted, and no potential underperformance would be rewarded;\n- /uni25A0 equal to 100% of the average cumulated results achieved over the 3/uni00A0years immediately prior to the grant date, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 50% of the number initially granted (40% for the 2020/uni00A0grant);\n- /uni25A0 equal to 100% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 100% of the number initially granted;\n- /uni25A0 equal to or higher than 130% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 130% of the number initially granted.\n\nBetween the different levels of performance listed above, the number of shares definitively granted to beneficiaries was calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance of the various indicators used.\n\nFurthermore, should no dividend be proposed by the Board of Directors to the shareholders of the Company during any fiscal year of the performance period, the number of shares definitively granted would be automatically divided by two.\n\nI\n\nI",

In the exceptional circumstances of the sanitary crisis, the Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee carefully reviewed this situation including (i)/uni00A0the multi-year nature of the impact (which would significantly impact achievement levels in 2021, 2022/uni00A0and 2023), (ii)/uni00A0the magnitude of the impact (which at the Management Committee level is estimated to result in achievement levels of 55%-65% for 2021/uni00A0and 30%-45% for 2022/uni00A0and 2023, depending on the role of executive in question), and (iii)/uni00A0the scope of the impact (which would significantly impact not only senior management but also more than 7,000/uni00A0beneficiaries across the Group). A/f\\_ter considering these factors as well as others, including the retention aspects, the Committee recommended to the Board (i)/uni00A0no adjustment to the 2018/uni00A0plan (vesting in 2021) and (ii)/uni00A0an adjustment to the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans (vesting, respectively, in 2022/uni00A0and 2023) designed to preserve some retention value in these plans, as described below.\n\nThe Board of Directors wished to adopt the best practices of transparency in this area and, in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, decided to disclose the adjustments decided.\n\nFor the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans, the floor criteria of the Group performance (adjusted earnings per share), accounting for 40% of the performance conditions, is (i)/uni00A0 '100% of the cumulative average of adjusted earnings per share for the 3/uni00A0years preceding the grant date' for members of the Management Committee, and (ii)/uni00A0 '80% of the level of performance required to achieve the target rate' for the other beneficiaries. The proposed adjustment would replace this floor criteria in the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans with the following floor criteria applicable to all beneficiaries: '70% of the level of performance required to achieve the target rate'. The target rate set by the Board of Directors is directly aligned with the financial objectives of the Group's 2023/uni00A0strategic plan over the performance period.\n\nAll other conditions of the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans remain unchanged.\n\nThe e/ffect of this adjustment, which is subject to shareholder approval for the Group CEO, will be to preserve some retention value in the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans. At the Management Committee level, this adjustment would enable executives to vest up to a maximum of 80% of their initial awards (with a cap at that level) if the Group performs well (at or above plan) over the performance period.\n\nThis approach, also adopted for the performance shares plan granted in 2021, will notably allow to (i)/uni00A0no longer compare the performance period with the three years preceding the grant (reference period), thus avoiding, for future plans, any windfall e/ffect that would have been linked to the presence of the year 2020/uni00A0in the reference period, and (ii)/uni00A0align the performance conditions of the plans with the objectives of the Group's 2023/uni00A0strategic plan, while maintaining very demanding performance conditions and targets. For the criterion of adjusted earnings per share: (i)/uni00A0only the achievement of the target performance (corresponding to a 5% compound annual growth rate) will result in a 100% grant percentage, (ii)/uni00A0a performance equal to 70% of the target\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni202FSHARE/uni202FOWNERSHIP\n\n(corresponding to a 3.5% compound annual growth rate) will result in grant percentages of 50% and 40% respectively for the 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0plans for the members of the Management Committee (including the Chief Executive O/fficer) and 8 0% for all other beneficiaries, and (iii)/uni00A0a performance below 70% of the target will not result in a grant.\n\nFor performance shares granted in 2021, the Board of Directors has reviewed, upon recommendation from its Remuneration and Governance Committee, the nature and the weight of performance conditions as well as the level of corresponding targets, (i)/uni00A0an alignment with the new strategic orientations of the Group whilst (ii)/uni00A0meeting with regulatory requirements, including a greater consideration of non-financial criteria.\n\nFor the 2021/uni00A0plan, the Group performance weights for 40% of the total performance while the operating business performance weights for 60%. For beneficiaries in Group functions (including AXA executive o/fficers) as well as Heads of Control Functions, the considered operating business is the AXA Group.\n\nThe global performance rate is calculated based on the performance achievement on:\n\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to cash generation by the operating business, weighting for 30%;\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to underlying earnings of the operating business (for beneficiaries in Group functions, the considered indicator is the underlying earnings per share), weighting for 30%;\n- /uni25A0 one relative criterion linked to Corporate Responsibility based on the DJSI weighting for 10%. Accordingly, the average of the scores achieved by AXA according to the DJSI during the performance period will be compared to the average of the scores achieved by the other companies included in the DJSI over the same period. Consequently, under this indicator, 100% of the shares will be granted if AXA's score is equal to the 95 th /uni00A0percentile (compared to 85 th /uni00A0percentile beforehand);\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to Corporate Responsibility based on the reduction in Group operations carbon emissions, weighting for 10%;\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to Corporate Responsibility based on reduction in Group carbon footprint in G/A assets, weighting for 10%;\n- /uni25A0 one relative criterion meant to compare the growth of the total return of the AXA share (TSR) with the growth of the TSR of the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP) (the 'TSR criterion'), weighting for 10%.\n\nRegarding each afore mentioned criterion (except the TSR criterion for the members of the Management Committee), should the performance be:\n\n- /uni25A0 lower than 70% of the performance required to reach the target (the 'floor'), no share would be delivered to the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period; consequently, the beneficiaries are not guaranteed a minimal grant/gain;\n\nI",

For each criterion, between the di/fferent level of performance (floor, target and cap), the number of shares definitely granted is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieve performance.\n\nThe global performance rate is calculated as follows: 30% performance of the operating business (cash generation) + 30% performance of the operating business (underlying earnings) + 10% Corporate Responsibility (DJSI) + 10% Corporate Responsibility (operations carbon emission) + 10% Corporate Responsibility (carbon footprint in assets) + 10% Group financial relative performance, capped at 130%.\n\nFurthermore, in the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired would be automatically divided by two.\n\nOther conditions to acquire performance shares under this plan remain unchanged.",

The Performance Shares granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer will remain acquired at the end of a 3-year acquisition period and restricted from sale during a 2-year holding period.\n\nThe amounts corresponding to International Performance Shares are expensed each year under the variable accounting method. They do not create any dilution for shareholders since no new shares are issued. The payment is made in shares. Should this type of payment not be possible for legal, tax or any other reason, the payment could be made in cash.\n\nI",

This restriction applies from the date of grant until such time as the beneficiary receives the securities underlying the award upon, for example, the lapse of restrictions on performance shares or similar events. In accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the executive o/fficers of the Company make a formal commitment to not resort to such hedging transactions.\n\n## PERFORMANCE SHARES/INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE SHARES ACQUIRED BY/uni202FCORPORATE OFFICERS DURING 2020\n\n| Corporate  o/fficers   |                                                                      | Plan date   | Nature of  the/uni202Fplan   | Number  of shares  granted   | Acquisition  date   | Shares  acquired  during  the /uni202Fyear   | Performance  rate over the  acquisition  period   | Performance  rate over the  acquisition  period   | End of the  restriction  period   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Thomas Buberl          | Chief Executive O/fficer                                             | 06/06/2016  | International  Performance   | 40,341                       | 06/06/2020          | 40,845                                       | 101.2%/uni00A0                                    | (a)                                               | 06/06/2020                        |\n|                        |                                                                      | 21/06/2017  | Performance  Shares          | 100,526                      | 21/06/2020          | 109,955                                      | 109.4%/uni00A0                                    | (b)                                               | 21/06/2022                        |\n| Denis Duverne          | Chairman of the  Board of Directors                                  | -           | -                            | -                            | -                   | -                                            |                                                   | -                                                 | -                                 |\n| Helen Browne           | Representative  of employee  shareholders to the  Board of Directors | 21/06/2017  | Performance  Shares          | 11,180                       | 21/06/2020          | 12,229                                       | 109.4%/uni00A0                                    | (b)                                               | 21/06/2022                        |\n\nIn the table above all dates that are indicated are in the format of day/month/year.\n\nI\n\nI",

The purpose of these grants was to associate them with AXA's share price performance and encourage their performance over the long term. In 2019, a/f\\_ter having progressively reduced the number of stock options beneficiaries over the past few years, AXA's Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, in order to simplify AXA's compensation policy and in line with market practice and feedback received from a number of institutional investors, decided to cease awarding stock options to corporate o/fficers and AXA employees.\n\nPrevious plans are still valid until their expiration (maximum duration period of 10/uni00A0years). They were granted at market value, with no discount, and become exercisable by tranches, generally in thirds between 3/uni00A0and 5/uni00A0years following the grant date.\n\nPursuant to the stock option plan rules, beneficiaries who resign from the Group lose the right to exercise their options.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2020, more than 1,260/uni00A0AXA employees held a total of 13,575,722/uni00A0outstanding options, representing 0.56% of the Company's share capital on the same date.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nAll options granted to all members of the Management Committee until 2018/uni00A0were subject to performance condition. This performance condition also applied to the last tranche of each option grant ( i.e. the last third of the options granted) for all other beneficiaries of options.\n\nPursuant to this performance condition, the options become fully exercisable only if the AXA share price performs at least as well as the stock reference index of the insurance sector/uni00A0 (1) . No option submitted to such performance condition can be exercised as long as this criterion has not been reached. This external performance condition subjects the acquisition of the right to exercise the options to the achievement of a fully objective and public performance and allows to measure the relative performance of AXA compared to its main European competitors over a period of at least three/uni00A0years.\n\nIf the performance condition has not been met at the expiry date of the options, these options are automatically cancelled.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors decided that a second performance condition would apply to the all options granted in 2017/uni00A0and 2018, pursuant to which beneficiaries would not be able to exercise their stock options in the event the net income of the Group share is negative, and for as long as it remains.\n\nI\n\nI",

These shares shall be held during his entire term of o/ffice as Chief Executive O/fficer;\n- /uni25A0 for Performance Shares granted, the Chief Executive O/fficer must, at every performance share acquisition date, hold in registered form at least 25% of the Performance Shares acquired during his entire term of o/ffice as Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply if the Chief Executive O/fficer complies with his Minimum Shareholding Requirement.",

However, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne decided to waive payment of the annuities amounting to circa \u20ac750,000/uni00A0per year before taxes and social security charges, until termination of his term of o/ffice as Chairman of the Board without any retroactive payment.\n\nThis collective defined benefits pension scheme has been closed to any new beneficiary as of December/uni00A031, 2016. As a result, no executive employees (directeurs) or executive o/fficer appointed a/f\\_ter this date shall benefit from it.\n\nThe Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April/uni00A016, 2014, provides that, as from January/uni00A01, 2020, future pension rights must be portable and consequently can no longer be acquired in the existing defined benefit pension scheme. The collective defined benefits pension scheme was amended in 2020/uni00A0in order to ensure compliance with European Directive.\n\nMr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, AXA's Chief Executive O/fficer does not benefit from the collective defined benefits pension scheme described above.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer of the Company. Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, as well as all other employees of AXA Group entities in France, participate in a mandatory and collective supplementary pension scheme with defined contributions (collective insurance contract/uni00A0contrat d'assurance de Groupe as defined in Article/uni00A0L.141-1/uni00A0of the French Insurance Code). This AXA pension fund was implemented in 2011/uni00A0and benefits to the employees of AXA Group entities in France falling within the scope of the Collective Agreement of December/uni00A018, 2009. The individual employer contribution rate is set at 0.75% of the total gross compensation, which is not capped (the contribution base is the same as the one used for contributions related to the Social Security General Scheme). Contributions are subject to 9.7% social charges (9.2% for CSG and 0.5% for CRDS).\n\n## Retirement performance shares\n\nSince December/uni00A02016, AXA has implemented a retirement performance shares plan which benefits to all executive employees (directeurs) of AXA Group entities in France including for the Chief Executive O/fficer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl.\n\nIt provides beneficiaries with portable pension benefits until retirement in line with Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April/uni00A016, 2014/uni00A0on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.\n\nThese performance shares are subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an acquisition period of three/uni00A0years, and (ii)/uni00A0an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may sell all or part of their shares for diversification purposes (following the three-year acquisition period), as long as the sale proceeds are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary's retirement.\n\nThe definitive acquisition of these performance shares is subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0the beneficiary's presence in the AXA Group on December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the year during which the grant is decided, and (ii)/uni00A0the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period.\n\nFor all beneficiaries, to benefit from the totality of performance shares initially granted, the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period must be greater than or equal to 170%. However, if the average ratio is 150%, only half of the shares initially granted will be acquired. No shares will be acquired if the average ratio is below 150%. No minimum number of shares is guaranteed.\n\nBetween these performance levels, the number of shares definitely acquired is calculated, on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance. Eventually, in the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, no share would be definitively acquired.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that no more than 10% of the total number of shares granted during any fiscal year should be granted to AXA's executive o/fficers, to avoid an excessive concentration of retirement performance shares granted to the executive o/fficers.\n\nOn December/uni00A015, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a grant of retirement performance shares. Accordingly, 802,552/uni00A0retirement performance shares were granted to 499/uni00A0o/fficers, which represent 0.033% of the outstanding share capital on the date of the grant, of which 23,190/uni00A0retirement performance shares were granted to AXA's Chief Executive O/fficer representing 2.9% of the total grant.\n\nAll retirement performance shares granted are subject to the performance conditions described above and calculated over a three-year period beginning on January/uni00A01, 2020, and ending on December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

In this context, the Board of Directors was concerned that the decision of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl to renounce his employment contract in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code would jeopardize the continuity of his accrued and future social benefits.\n\nAs a result, on August/uni00A02, 2016, the Board of Directors took the following decisions:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized that, following the termination of his employment contract, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl would continue to have social benefits (health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance,/uni00A0etc.) on terms equivalent to those of all other Group senior employees of the AXA Group in France;\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized a contractual severance benefit for Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl designed to replicate the benefits to which he would have been entitled as AXA employee under the 1993/uni00A0collective agreement covering director-level employees of the insurance sector, but with the addition of performance conditions in accordance with the Afep-Medef recommendations. A severance benefit would be applicable, except in the case of gross or willful misconduct, solely in the event of dismissal or non-renewal further to the Board of Directors' decision. The payment of the severance benefit would be subject to the three following performance conditions as determined by the Board of Directors during its August/uni00A02,/uni202F2016, meeting: (1)/uni00A0achievement, for at least 2/uni00A0of the 3/uni00A0preceding\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfiscal/uni00A0years, of the objectives set for the beneficiary's variable compensation and corresponding to the payment of at least 60% of his variable compensation target, (2) evolution of the AXA share price at least equal to the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP) (in percentage) over a 3-year period preceding the termination of the term of o/ffice, and (3)/uni00A0the average consolidated adjusted ROE over the 3/uni00A0preceding/uni00A0years higher than or equal to 5%.\n\nThe amount of severance benefit to be paid to the beneficiary would be adjusted in accordance with the level of achievement against these performance conditions: 100% of the severance benefit will be paid if at least two of the three performance conditions are met; 40% of the severance benefit will be paid if only one performance condition is met; and no severance benefit shall be paid if none of the performance conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if only two of the three performance conditions are met, the amount of severance benefit will be reduced by 50% if performance condition (1) above is not met or if AXA's consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year is negative.\n\nNo severance benefit will be paid if the beneficiary is entitled to a pension scheme within the 6/uni00A0months following his termination.\n\nThe initial amount of the severance benefit is equal to 12/uni00A0months of the average compensation (fixed and variable) paid during the 24-month period preceding termination. One month should then be added to the initial amount of the severance benefit for each additional year of future service up to a maximum cap of 24/uni00A0months.\n\nThese commitments were approved by AXA' Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A025, 2018. They took e/ffect upon Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's e/ffective renunciation of his employment contract on September/uni00A01, 2016, and will continue as such for the duration of his mandate and under any potential renewed mandates.",

The Committee is also empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews by external experts when deemed appropriate. Such reviews allow the Committee to benefit from a technical expertise and independent insights in comparing AXA's compensation practices with general market practice.\n\n## COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n## Guiding principles of AXA's compensation policy\n\nAXA's compensation policy is designed to support the Company's long-term business strategy and to align the interests of its management with those of its shareholders and all other stakeholders by/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0establishing a close relation between performance and compensation over the short, medium and long term, (ii)/uni00A0ensuring that the Group can o/ffer competitive compensation that is consistent with the various markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interests that may lead to undue risk/uni00A0taking for short-term gain, and (iii)/uni00A0ensuring compliance of the Company's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nAXA's compensation policy aims to, among others:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop and motivate unique skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 incentivize superior performance;\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with the Company's results.\n\n## Structure and criteria for determination of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Chief Executive O/fficer's compensation\n\nIn this context, the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer is based on a pay-for-performance approach which/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0requires the achievement of challenging financial and operational targets that are defined and aligned with the Group's strategy, (ii)/uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance while incorporating risk adjustment measures in performance metrics, and (iii)/uni00A0determines the e/ffective amount of the actual individual compensation on the basis of both financial and non-financial results.\n\nThus, the 'at-risk' portion of the Chief Executive O/fficer's total compensation (variable cash compensation and share-based compensation) represents a significant component of his compensation structure, with a view to aligning his compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe di/fferent components of the Chief Executive O/fficer's total compensation are presented in detail herea/f\\_ter:\n\n## FIXED ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe determination of the amount of the Chief Executive O/fficer's fixed compensation is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices as well as applicable national and international regulations. It also takes into consideration various other factors such as experience, skills, as well as criticality and scarcity of such skills, and the Group's fairness principles or the individual's compensation history.\n\nThe Board of Directors, relying in particular on a study carried out by an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) regarding compensation practices for similar functions in a sample of CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0companies and in the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks), and upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, decided to maintain unchanged, for 2021, the amount of the Chief Executive O/fficer's fixed annual compensation, at \u20ac1.45/uni00A0million.\n\nI\n\nI",

No minimum payment is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn order to determine the Chief Executive O/fficer's target annual variable compensation, the Board of Directors sought to establish a balanced structure between the fixed part and the variable part of his cash compensation.\n\nThus, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, and following a comparative review of national, European and industry practices, decided to maintain unchanged, for 2021, the Chief Executive O/fficer's target annual variable compensation, at \u20ac1.45/uni00A0million, i.e. 100% of the amount of his annual fixed compensation.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer's total e/ffective variable compensation may not exceed 150% of his variable compensation target, i.e. 150% of his annual fixed compensation.\n\nThe evaluation of the Chief Executive O/fficer's individual performance with respect to the 2021/uni00A0fiscal year will be based on the following two components, each of them capped at a 150% achievement rate:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group's performance, evaluated on the basis of (i)/uni00A0underlying earnings per share, (ii)/uni00A0cash remittance, (iii)/uni00A0gross revenues in Commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty and in Protection, Health and unit-linked products, (iv)/uni00A0Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index) and (v)/uni00A0non-commission expenses. The relative weight of each indicator is, respectively, 30%, 20%, 20%, 15% and 15%. Each of the indicators will be capped at a 150% achievement rate.\n\nThe evolution of the choice and weight of the financial and operating indicators of the Group performance is part of a global review of the measurement of this performance on the short and long term with the objective to align them with the Group's new strategic orientations, while taking into account regulatory constraints, including a growing inclusion of extra-financial elements.\n\nThe main pillars of the new 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan: expanding Health and Protection; simplifying customer experience and accelerating e/fficiency; strengthening underwriting performance and growing cash flows across the Group, are thus included in the measurement of the Group performance applicable to the CEO's variable compensation as of 2021. The selected financial and operating indicators reflect objectives in terms of growth, cash remittance, operational e/fficiency and client proximity.\n\n- /uni25A0 individual performance, assessed on the basis of various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board  of Directors in a target letter drawn up at the beginning of each relevant year, as well as on the basis of demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/fficer. The target letter includes detailed objectives with regards to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives designed to assess the level of achievement of global strategic initiatives or relating to certain geographic areas, as well as progress on  investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations.\n\nEach of these two components will be evaluated separately so that the Chief Executive O/fficer's overall variable pay-out reflects his performance against two distinct components assessed independently.\n\nWith respect to the 2021/uni00A0fiscal year, the determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer will therefore be based on the addition of two components: the Group performance for 70% and the individual performance for 30%.\n\nIn order to ensure that AXA remains aligned with current market practice and regulations, both in France and abroad, within the financial industry, the Board of Directors has decided to continue to use a deferral mechanism with respect to the Chief Executive O/fficer's annual variable compensation.\n\nUnder this mechanism, payment of 30% of his actual annual variable compensation will be deferred over the course of two/uni00A0years and will be subject to performance condition. Thus, the actual deferred amount will vary depending on changes in the AXA share price over the deferral period, within a minimum of 80% of the deferred amount and a maximum of 120% of the deferred amount. However, no deferred variable compensation will be paid in the event that the Group's underlying earnings are negative for the year ending immediately prior to the year of the scheduled payout, or in case of resignation or dismissal for gross or willful misconduct, prior to the payout date.\n\nShould a significant change a/ffecting the calculation of the Group's economic parameters emerge (significant patrimonial transaction approved by the Board of Directors, change in accounting norms\u2026), the Board will be able to calculate the parameters mutatis mutandis , i.e. without taking into account extraordinary external elements.\n\nThe Board of Directors also reserves the right to exercise its discretionary power regarding the determination of the Chief Executive O/fficer's compensation pursuant to legal provisions and in accordance with Articles/uni00A0L.22-10-8/uni00A0and L.22-10-34/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code, should any particular circumstance arise and justify an exceptional adjustment, either upwards (within the limit of 150% of the target variable compensation) or downwards, of one or several of the criteria composing the Chief Executive O/fficer's compensation, to ensure that the application of the abovementioned criteria fairly reflect the Chief Executive O/fficer's performance as well as that of the Group.\n\nI",

However, the value of the performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer as determined in accordance with the IFRS standards may not in any event exceed half of his total compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also decided that the number of performance shares allocated to the Company's corporate o/fficers may not exceed 10% of the total number of performance shares granted to all beneficiaries within the Group.\n\nThe perfo rmance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer are entirely subject to demanding internal and external performance conditions (the details of which are presented in Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0of this Annual Report), which are assessed over a minimum period of three/uni00A0years (followed by a two-year holding period), and do not guarantee a minimum grant or gain. Moreover, the performance shares plan rules provide that in the event the Chief Executive O/fficer leaves his position/uni00A0 (1) at any time before the end of the performance period, any performance shares initially granted are irremediably lost, unless otherwise decided by the Board of Directors in a motivated decision disclosed at the time of the o/fficer's departure (in such case, all or part of the performance shares could be maintained and the vesting calendar and performance conditions of the performance shares set at the grant date would remain unchanged).\n\nGiven the principles presented above and following an analysis of practices observed on the market for similar functions in CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0companies of similar size and scope, the Board of Directors, upon proposal of its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has decided that the total value of the performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer during 2021, shall not exceed 150% of the amount of his annual variable compensation target.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\n## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S DIRECTORS' FEES\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer, who also is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is not entitled to payment of any directors' fees from the Company.\n\n## BENEFITS IN KIND GRANTED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe only benefit in kind granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer is the use of a company car.\n\n## ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION RELATING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S RETIREMENT\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer does not participate in any pension schemes with defined benefits.\n\nAs all other executives of AXA Group entities in France, he participates in the retirement performance shares plan, under which grants are made on an annual basis.\n\nThe performance shares granted under such plan are subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an acquisition period of three/uni00A0years, and (ii)/uni00A0an undertaking not to sell the performance shares before the date on which the beneficiary retires, subject to the option o/ffered to the beneficiaries, for diversification purposes, to sell their shares (a/f\\_ter the end of the acquisition period of three/uni00A0years) as long as the proceeds of such sale are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary retires.\n\nAcquisition of the performance shares is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition (the details of which are set out in Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0of this Annual Report), linked to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated over the performance period. No minimum grant or gain is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/fficer under this scheme. Furthermore, the number of shares definitively acquired would be automatically divided by two should no dividend be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, has decided that the total value of the retirement performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer during 2021/uni00A0shall not exceed 15% of his annual fixed and cash variable compensation.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This role is presented in detail in the Board's Terms of Reference as well as in Section/uni00A03.1/uni00A0of this Annual Report and goes beyond the statutory duties of a Chairman under French law.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has taken into account the fact that Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, who claimed his pension rights on September/uni00A01, 2016, has decided to waive, for the duration of his term of o/ffice as Chairman of the Board of Directors, payment of his benefits (approximately \u20ac750,000/uni00A0per year) under the supplementary pension scheme for executives within the AXA Group in France, to which he was entitled as from September/uni00A01, 2016. Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne has decided that he would claim such benefits only a/f\\_ter the end of his term of o/ffice, without application of any retroactive payment.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors has decided, upon recommendation from its Compensation/uni00A0& Governance Committee, to maintain the amount of the fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors unchanged, for 2021, i.e. at \u20ac1.2/uni00A0million.\n\nHaving considered that the most appropriate compensation structure for the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be fixed compensation only, the Board of Directors has resolved, as a consequence, that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not benefit from any variable compensation, any directors' fees, any performance shares grants, or of any other long-term compensation elements.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nFinally, there is no employment contract between the Company and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman is not entitled to any severance benefits or any allowance relating to any non-compete clause in the event that he ceases to be Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe only benefit in kind granted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors is the use of a company car.\n\nI",

The assessment procedure has been implemented within AXA since that date.\n\nThis procedure provides for the Group Legal Department to be informed prior to the conclusion, amendment, renewal, extension or termination of any agreement falling within the scope of\n\nArticle/uni00A0L.225-38/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code, regardless of the ordinary nature of the transaction or the arm's length basis of the agreement. This information enables the Group Legal Department to carry out a prior review of the agreement in order to determine whether it should be subject to the 'regulated' agreements procedure provided for under Articles/uni00A0L.225-38/uni00A0 et seq . of the French Commercial Code or whether it is exempt from such procedure. To this end, the Group Legal Department may seek the advice of the AXA Group's other relevant departments and of the Company's Statutory Auditors.\n\nIn addition, the Group Legal Department annually assesses whether ordinary agreements concluded at arm's length terms and conditions continue to meet the conditions for such qualification, in cooperation with AXA Group's relevant departments and the Company's Statutory Auditors where necessary. If the Group Legal Department considers that an agreement initially qualified as ordinary and concluded at arm's length terms and conditions constitutes a 'regulated' agreement, the Board of Directors decides on the qualification of the said agreement and on the actions to be taken on it according to the qualification adopted.\n\nI\n\n3",

It/uni202Fincludes an extra-financial performance statement that AXA publishes in accordance with the provisions of the EU Directive 2014/95/uni00A0related to extra-financial reporting/uni00A0 (1) and French law/uni00A0 (2) . This statement includes the AXA Group's business model and information on its main extra-financial risks ('sustainability risks') related to environmental, employer responsibility, society, human rights, tax evasion and corruption matters. For more information on the Group's risks exposure, refer to the Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' in this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nIn-depth information on the AXA Group's Sustainability-related policies and practices is also available in the 'Integrated Report', 'Climate Report', in the online 'Group Human Capital Report'/uni00A0 (3) and on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com), in particular in the Sustainability Section.\n\n## AXA's purpose entails sustainable value creation\n\nIn 2020/uni00A0AXA formulated its purpose encompassing its role in the economy and commitments as a responsible company serving society. AXA used a collaborative process throughout the Group. Members of the Partners Group and AXA Group's Stakeholders Advisory Panel expressed their opinions. Consultations have taken place with employees through a dedicated Pulse survey (Pulse surveys are short and focused surveys measuring a few indicators in order to quickly identify areas of improvement). Responses were analyzed to throw light on the key features of AXA's identity. This work was then followed by contributions from the 1,000/uni00A0Group leaders during AXA Days, which led to the formulation of a purpose that was submitted to the Board of Directors of the Group. Following the purpose's announcement at the Shareholders' General Assembly in June/uni00A02020/uni00A0the AXA Conversation platform has eventually enabled AXA employees to discuss and adopt this purpose.\n\nOur purpose ' Act for human progress by protecting what matters ' entails sustainable value creation with the aim to protect the environment and society in an inclusive manner. The essence of our insurance profession makes us a critical link in mutual support and social ties by pooling risks. Our understanding of risks enables all our stakeholders to anticipate the future and become more resilient. We enable individuals and communities to move forward by protecting their basic needs: environmental protection, access to healthcare, prosperity and quality of life. Our decisions and commitments are based on objective scientific data looking at things in an inclusive manner.\n\nFor more information on AXA's business model, please refer to Section/uni00A01.3/uni00A0'Business overview' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

Sustainability is also a risk/ opportunity management concern: it enables AXA to reduce certain operational costs and risks, while providing market opportunities in emerging business segments or driving innovation by taking better account of social and environmental issues.\n\nIn 2019, our Sustainability strategy has been focused around 3/uni00A0priorities: climate change and environment, health/uni00A0& prevention, social inequalities and inclusion. In 2020/uni00A0the implementation of this strategy went on. AXA uses the various levers of actions related to its expertise and activities: investment, insurance or its partnerships and its philanthropic activities, as well as its international footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAXA is also committed to being a responsible employer, striving to keep employee engagement at the heart of its strategy and to create a workplace inspired by its values that fosters diversity and equal opportunity for all, promotes engagement, encourages professional development and supports employee well-being.\n\n2020/uni00A0has been impacted by COVID-19/uni00A0unprecedented pandemic crisis: remote work for almost all our employees, AXA's commitment to protect jobs, investing in scientific research, mobilization of sta/ff to support medical frontline helpers, development of telemedicine services contributing to alleviate emergency medical services. AXA got also involved in supporting the economy and green recovery. This mobilization which reasserts AXA's role in society, beyond its commercial activities are detailed throughout this Section.  At the December/uni00A02020/uni00A0IR Day AXA announced the main priorities of its new strategic plan, which integrated climate and inclusion challenges at the heart of its strategic plan ' Driving Progress 2023 '.\n\n## AXA's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals of/uni00A0the United Nations\n\nIn 2018, the Group developed a strategic thinking framework to identify its commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (17/uni00A0SDGs/uni00A0- see sustainabledevelopment.un.org) building on its risk analysis expertise. Main commitments have been identified based on AXA's capacity to have a real impact through its activities and operations. In 2019, the Group aligned its Sustainability strategic objectives with the 8/uni00A0main SDGs on which the Group's initiatives have\n\na significant impact. This alignment has been approved in 2019/uni00A0by the Stakeholder Advisory Committee. AXA's purpose captures our commitments towards reaching the SDGs (see paragraph 'AXA's purpose entails sustainable value creation' above).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Each year, the Compensation & Governance Committee of the Board of Directors reviews this sustainability strategy. It's also presented several times a year to the Group Executive Committee for status and decision making. At the local entity level, a network of Corporate Responsibility Directors is in charge of implementing the sustainability strategy and promoting best practices.\n\nAXA also relies on its Stakeholder Advisory Committee that was put in place in 2014/uni00A0in order to better anticipate the future important matters to build stronger, safer and more sustainable societies. Twice a year, it brings together external and influential figures, who are collectively representative of civil society, as well as AXA's Management Committee and members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Stakeholder Advisory Committee has been instrumental to include AXA's role in society in the new strategic plan 2020 2023/uni00A0and to phrase AXA's purpose in 2020. It has gathered a last time in April/uni00A02020/uni00A0to discuss COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic challenges, green recovery and anticipating the crisis' impacts on social inequalities and health systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nWith the start of ' Driving Progress 2023 ' strategic cycle, this governance is evolving in line with AXA's ambition. The 'Role In Society Steering Committee' (RISSC), which is co-chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Investment O/fficer, and the Group Head of Communication, Brand and CR, has been put in place in June/uni00A02020. This Committee is in charge of implementing this new strategy, in connection with the Board of Directors and the Management Committee.\n\nIt should also be noted that AXA's sustainable business strategy and initiatives are presented at least once a year to the Company's social authorities (social partners). Dialogue with NGOs is also regular through meetings or responding to their requests (replies to questionnaires, for instance). In addition, AXA is participating to coalitions that gather NGOs and public authorities, around climate and inclusion themes (see Sections  4.3/uni00A0'Climate change and Biodiversity' and 4.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report). Through these exchanges AXA can integrate major and emerging challenges into its strategy.\n\n## Sustainability Risk Assessment\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Directive 2014/95/EU related to extra-financial reporting, AXA has conducted an internal risk assessment to identify its main sustainability risks.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY RISKS ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY\n\nThe approach implemented is based on collaborative work between Risk Management and Corporate Responsibility teams. First, risk factors for each area related to sustainability (Employer responsibility, respect for human rights, environment, society impact and business behavior) are identified, based on sustainability risks studied in prior years and the 2020/uni00A0Future Risks survey (see Section/uni00A05.8/uni00A0' Other material risks - Emerging risks'  of this Annual Report Emerging risks and axa.com/en/ magazine/2020-future-risks-report). Interests expressed by our stakeholders are also included.\n\nThese risks are assessed by an experts' panel (gathering Corporate Responsibility, Risk Management, Operational risks, Emerging risks, Human Resources, Compliance, Procurement, Investor Relations, Finance, Tax and Communication). The assessment is conducted, using the Group Operational risks' guidelines to rate potential frequency and severity. Impact of each risk on stakeholders' interests and expectations has been taken into account.\n\nIn 2020, the impact of COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic on the materiality of our main sustainability risks has been estimated. This specific assessment has not significantly changed AXA's sustainability risk profile.\n\nThese results have been cross-referenced with the AXA Group Operational Risk Profile (for more information refer to Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational risk') and emerging risks assessment, which outlines major prospective emerging risks for society at large (refer to Section/uni00A05.8/uni00A0'Other material risks - Emerging risks' of this Annual Report). Sustainability risks have also been compared to the Dow Jones of this Annual Report Sustainability Index' framework.\n\nThe sustainability risk mapping has been approved by Group Operational Risks Committee.\n\nFrom this year's update, the following emerged:\n\n- Biodiversity is a new sustainable risk included in AXA's Statement on Non-Financial Performance (see Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0' Climate change and Biodiversity - Biodiversity'  of this Annual Report 'Biodiversity' ). It was previously considered as an emerging risk; /uni25A0\n- /uni25A0 Two Employer responsibility risks have been enriched: 'Employer of choice and future of work' and 'Inclusion and Diversity breeding talent and innovation' (refer to Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report ).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These sites are part of\n\nI\n\nI\n\nan extrapolation process. In 2020, environmental indicators were collected for 98,691/uni00A0FTEs working on AXA sites (unless otherwise indicated) and were then extrapolated, continent by continent, to cover all 117, 623/uni00A0FTEs (all types of contracts) working at AXA Group in average in 2020.\n\nAXA Tianping is gradually integrated into AXA's Corporate Responsibility policies and processes. Its 2020/uni00A0environmental reporting does not cover the full framework but the environmental footprint of its whole workforce has been taken into account thanks to the extrapolation calculation that is carried out.\n\n## Scope of societal indicators\n\nOur Community Investment Survey, as described in Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive Insurer'  of this Annual Report, covers 98% of AXA's FTEs.\n\n## PERIOD\n\nThe indicators cover the period from January/uni00A01/uni00A0to December/uni00A031,/uni202F2020, unless mentioned otherwise.

This process is updated and communicated to each entity on a yearly basis. Social data are provided by local correspondents into an IT tool dedicated to the social data reporting process. Consistency checks and quality controls are carried out before and during the data collect process. There is no estimation or extrapolation made on data provided. Regarding data published in ratios and percentages, numerator and denominator are realigned for each calculation to exclude entities with empty data points.\n\n## Environmental data reporting\n\nEnvironmental data is collected since 2002, through a dedicated reporting tool filled out by the network of 300/uni00A0environmental managers from AXA sites with more than 50/uni00A0FTEs and data centers owned by AXA. The reporting procedure includes guidelines for reporting and controlling, and calculation rules. AXA monitors its environmental footprint reduction towards its targets. Reporting procedure is updated annually and contributors are trained each year. For each site, contributors specify whether the data has been measured or estimated based on the calculation rules defined in the Group's reporting procedures. In 2020, environmental data was collected for 84% of total FTEs, and the remaining 16% has been extrapolated. Reported data is validated locally by the entity CFOs. For more information, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and Biodiversity' of this Annual Report and to the footnotes of environmental data tables.\n\n## Societal data collection\n\nSocietal engagement data which is presented in Section/uni00A04.4 'Inclusive Insurer /uni00A0-  Corporate philanthropy and engagement'  of this Annual Report is collected through a dedicated reporting tool with specific definitions for engagement practices The number of unique volunteers is an estimate based on local entity knowledge of volunteering activities.\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nReporting on certain indicators may have limitations due to:\n\n- /uni25A0 the absence of nationally and/or internationally recognized definitions, concerning the di/fferent categories of employment contracts;\n- /uni25A0 the necessary estimates, the representativeness of the measurements or the limited availability of external data required for calculations as the required annual update of emission factors;\n- /uni25A0 the practical procedures for collecting and entering this information.\n\nTherefore, whenever possible, definitions, methodologies and, where applicable, the associated margins of uncertainty are specified for the concerned indicators.\n\nThe sustainability themes 'circular economy', 'food waste', 'fight against food insecurity', 'respect of animals' well-being' and 'sustainable food' are not considered as main non-financial risks to AXA and are not included in AXA's statement on non financial performance.\n\n## USE OF INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\n\nIn order to develop its Sustainability strategy and report on its extra-financial performance, AXA voluntarily complies with certain international benchmarks, as described in this chapter. These include, for example, the United Nations SDGs (as developed above), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (ghgprotocol.org) for the calculation of CO 2 /uni00A0emissions and the Science Based Target Initiative for the reduction of our carbon footprint. Other benchmarks are highlighted in the relevant sections, where appropriate.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Skilled, motivated and purpose-driven people enable the Group to best support its customers and meet the major challenges of our time: facilitating post-COVID-19/uni00A0recovery, sustaining the Group's climate leadership position and placing AXA among the most inspiring companies to work for with recognition through multiple awards in 2020/uni00A0in a significant number of AXA's operations (Germany, Italy, UK, Belgium, for example).\n\nThe Group achieves this through a culture built on AXA's values and a working environment that embraces the individual contributions of all, nurtures personal learning and development, and supports employee well-being in current Smart ways of working. AXA's people strategy for the coming years is structured around two axes:\n\n- /uni25A0 reinforcing an inclusive and purpose-driven organization; and\n- /uni25A0 empowering employees to deliver at their best.\n\n2020/uni00A0has shown the relevance of AXA's strategy, with a focus on protecting the resilience and health of businesses and people and has accelerated a number of transformational changes already underway. This has guided the following human resources (HR) priorities:\n\n- 1) equip managers and leaders to lead and drive engagement through purpose;\n- 3) act to position AXA as best in class on health and mental well-being for AXA's employees;\n- 4) engage the employees and build momentum on climate change;\n- 5) accelerate AXA's move to Smart working and leading in hybrid working environments;\n- 6) empower employees to own their development and career journey;\n- 7) support entities to rethink and redesign employee experience aligned with the purpose and the Employee Value Proposition of the Group.\n\nThose seven priorities irrigate, structure and reinforce a sustainable employer responsibility approach fostering employee career evolution through skills development, talent management and mobility. AXA aims also to become an employer of choice, reflecting 'the future of work'. Finally, as one of the strongest convictions of an international group with a social and societal responsibility, the seven priorities strengthen the inclusion and diversity across the organization to breed talent and innovation.\n\nFor Key Performance indicators and associated targets, refer to 4.1/uni00A0'AXA S ustainability strategy/uni00A0-  Sustainability Risk Assessment' of/uni00A0this/uni00A0Annual/uni00A0Report .\n\n- 2) accelerate towards being best in class on inclusion;\n\n## HIGHLIGHT AND KEY FIGURES: GEOGRAPHICAL FOOTPRINT DISTRIBUTIONS AND/uni202FAVERAGE/uni202FAGES /uni00A0(a)\n\n| Continents   | Headcount   | Distribution   | Evolution         |   Average  age |\n|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Europe       | 66,021      | 57.6%          | (-0.3/uni00A0pt ) |           43.2 |\n| Asia-Pacific | 30,675      | 26.8%          | (+0.9/uni00A0pt ) |           37.8 |\n| Americas     | 11,789      | 10.3%          | (+0.0/uni00A0pt ) |           39.3 |\n| Africa       | 6,140       | 5.3%           | (-0.6/uni00A0pt ) |           33.9 |\n| TOTAL        | 114,625     |                |                   |           40.9 |\n\n- (a)   Open-ended and fixed-term contract headcount.\n\nAXA's overall salaried workforce on December/uni00A031, 2020, was 114,625/uni00A0employees (open-ended and fixed-term contracts), which represents a decrease of more than 5% compared to 2019.

Leveraging existing security, safety and crisis management procedures, as well as working from home policies already in place in many countries, the Group was quickly able to switch to remote working, protecting employees in parallel with enabling them to remain fully operational to meet client needs.\n\nAXA intensified its communication throughout the year, cascading regular updates from the crisis leadership team, conducting two additional 'checking in' surveys, and consulting frequently with social partners. These guided a number of Group initiatives for employee well-being during the year, including:\n\n- /uni25A0 a commitment taken in April/uni00A02020/uni00A0that the sanitary crisis would have no impact on the level of employment and on the remuneration of employees during the confinement period, and that AXA would not use  furlough  or ch\u00f4mage partiel schemes;\n- /uni25A0 ensuring that employee assistance programs (telemedicine and psychological support) were available for sta/ff  across the globe;\n- /uni25A0 the creation of a dedicated resilience program, with the Resilience Institute, to support managers and employees through uncertainty via webinars and on LinkedIn Learning;\n- /uni25A0 a #HowAreYou campaign involving specialist speakers aimed at de-stigmatizing mental health in the workplace; and\n- /uni25A0 series of resources available to employees including learning mini-series for managers on Managing Mental Well-being available on LinkedIn Learning.\n\n## CARING FOR AXA'S EMPLOYEES' HEALTH AND INVESTING IN LONG-TERM PREVENTION IMPLEMENTING A GLOBAL PROGRAM ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING\n\nAXA provides comprehensive employee benefits across its entities. This is critical for attracting and engaging talent and demonstrating that AXA cares about protecting health and well-being. To go a step further in its global employee benefits strategy, AXA launched a new global program to improve employees' health and well-being.\n\n- /uni25A0 To enforce prevention and access to care, each employee will be able to benefit from a complete in-person or digital medical check-up depending on their age, receive an annual\n\nflu vaccination and participate in information and awareness days organized on AXA premises to better prevent healthrelated risks;  and\n\n- /uni25A0 To better support employees who encounter di/fficulties in their professional or personal life, AXA is giving access to an employee assistance program that provides psychological support and guidance, accessible at all times.\n\nTo be deployed in 2021/uni00A0in all AXA entities, this program complements existing health and access to care services and better aligns the benefits provided to AXA employees across the globe.\n\n## STRENGTHENING AXA'S APPROACH ON/uni202FINCLUSION\n\nAXA believes in creating a company culture that values the contributions of every individual and provides equal opportunities to all. By being a diverse and inclusive group AXA can better reflect and respond to the changing world around us, for example by innovating in business o/fferings through more inclusive insurance products, as well as strengthening team performance.\n\nThe 2020/uni00A0context/uni00A0- widespread health and socio-economic impacts, remote working,/uni00A0etc/uni00A0- has challenged AXA to think more widely about the people that the Group needs to be more conscious and inclusive of. Key topics championed centrally have been complemented by local initiatives, widening AXA's inclusion and diversity (I&D) approach:\n\n- /uni25A0 this year's Group Inclusion Conference explored ethnic and racial origins. This gained momentum in 2020/uni00A0in several entities with for example the launch of 'Rise' a Business Resource Group in AXA XL focused on developing colleagues from underrepresented groups;\n- /uni25A0 AXA in France's MIX'iN community for men and women has also broadened its scope beyond gender balance to include equality, disability, multi-generational and LGBT+ inclusion; and\n- /uni25A0 to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December, employees shared personal stories of invisible disabilities. AXA is an active contributor to cross-sector organizations such as the International Labor Organization Global Business and Disability Network and the Valuable 500, with whom the Group works to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nFor more information please see the Careers Section on www.axa.com\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA's/uni00A0I&D ambition is defined and deployed across the Group and reinforced through recruitment, learning and development and talent management policies and processes coordinated by a global community of HR professionals. AXA's leaders act as advocates for our/uni00A0I&D commitments to (i)/uni00A0reach gender balance across the organization, (ii)/uni00A0continue improving organizational awareness of diversity in all its forms, (iii)/uni00A0embed inclusion in the workplace to ensure equal opportunity regardless of age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, marital status, or disability.\n\nAt the end of 2020, women made up over 53% of AXA's sales and non-sales workforce and held 32% (+1 point  compared to 2019) of all Executive sales and non-sales positions. Since 2009, AXA has been tracking representation of women among its Top Senior Executives' population.\n\nAXA is also committed to reaching gender parity by 2023/uni00A0among its Top Senior Executives (The Global Leadership Network/uni00A0-  GLN). The GLN was established in early 2019, and at the end of 2019, women represented 32% of this population. By the end of 2020, it had reached 34%. This has been achieved through a number of key actions, including:\n\n- /uni25A0 strengthening gender-balanced talent pipelines at all levels of the organization\n\nGroup Sponsorship Program, was managed at the Group level with ensuring the active participation of Management Committee members and Partners as sponsors and cascaded across 17/uni00A0of AXA's entities,\n\n- \u00b7 in 2020, AXA launched its EVOLVE program to replace the Group Sponsorship Program. Evolve is a career management program to prepare leaders for their next career experience including future GLN positions. The first cohort/uni00A0- 15/uni00A0women and 5/uni00A0men, are from diverse backgrounds and nationalities as well as di/fferent business areas and markets;\n- /uni25A0 developing female executives. As part of Top Senior Executive development and talent review planning, AXA explores careermaps for women within the GLN, identifying next moves and working with local HR teams to prepare individuals locally for upcoming vacancies;\n- /uni25A0 recruiting female talent. AXA applies gender equality in recruitment processes. For each open GLN position, the short list of candidates includes a balanced slate. 55% of GLN positions in 2020/uni00A0were filled by female candidates;\n- /uni25A0 objective-setting to foster diversity. Diversity in teams is a shared goal for AXA's GLN.

Through this the Group mitigates any impact on AXA's competitiveness and performance as well as the potential loss of key talents.\n\n## DEVELOPING AXA LEADERS AND TALENTS\n\nAXA supports and develops talents through the Group's wellestablished career management strategy. The Organization and Talent Review (OTR) provides a systematic mapping of leadership roles and succession planning in the GLN. For the GLN population of 250/uni00A0individuals, AXA conducts annual career discussions and targeted deep executive developments. AXA also supports executive development through the AXA Leadership Academy, which in 2020/uni00A0was redesigned into a virtual format. Its curriculum focuses on business-critical skills like purpose-driven leadership and tech and data transformation.\n\nOther targeted programs include the People Manager Academy for the Group's 10,000+ managers, a continuous development program, currently in production and co-created with AXA entities. It aims at developing skills such as e/ffective team management, empowerment and resilience. AXA France has already implemented a dedicated program for its people managers (2,100/uni00A0managers) through a dedicated WeAXELERATE digital platform that runs virtual workshops, webinars and conferences.\n\n## COMMITTED TO INTERNAL MOBILITY\n\nAXA demonstrates a strong commitment to developing its people through internal mobility. In 2020, internal mobility between and within entities was at 8% (stable compared to 2019). It is AXA's commitment to further strengthen internal mobility in the coming years, and specific actions such as providing greater visibility and accessibility to jobs are underway.\n\nA strong element of AXA's appeal as an employer is its global footprint across 54/uni00A0countries. Mobility policies and processes support individual career aspirations and allow the Group to provide opportunities for development assignments abroad. Despite COVID-19/uni00A0restrictions in 2020, AXA continued its commitment to international mobility, supporting 507/uni00A0individuals in assignments across the Group (From 794/uni00A0employees in 2019). Another 2020/uni00A0initiative was the launch of a Graduate Program for AXA Group Operations giving new recruits the opportunity to work in up to three countries in key areas such as data science and so/f\\_tware engineering.\n\n## FACILITATING LIFELONG LEARNING\n\nWith the objective of becoming a self-learning organization, AXA believes in o/ffering new and continuous learning opportunities to equip employees with the necessary skills for tomorrow. For this the Group provides a mix of industry-related expertise, transversal knowledge and managerial and so/f\\_t  skills development. The e/fforts of the Group represent an investment in learning of more than \u20ac70.9/uni00A0million in 2020.\n\nThis investment supports AXA commitment to develop and train all its people at least once a year; this has been achieved over the past two years. On average, across the Group, an employee develops and trains 3/uni00A0days per year. Looking more especially to sales employees it is 6.5/uni00A0training days per year.\n\nThe shi/f\\_t  from in-person to online training as a result of the pandemic and the increasing use of a variety of shorter learning formats (video, quiz and interactive formats) resulted in a decrease of 7.5% in the total number of training days between 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0(335,269/uni00A0days in 2020/uni00A0compared to 362,448/uni00A0days in 2019). Although the new formats allow to reach improved e/fficiency of learning activities, through adaptability and innovative approach, as well as self-learning.\n\nUpskilling the Group's workforce is a challenge that AXA has accelerated through digital and on-demand learning models.\n\nKey learning programs for all employees in 2020/uni00A0included:\n\n- /uni25A0 the launch of LinkedIn Learning, which provides 16,000/uni00A0modules of customized and o/ff -the-shelf content, available anywhere, at any time and on any device. At the end of 2020, 36,000/uni00A0of AXA's employees were regular users of Linkedin Learning;\n- /uni25A0 Future Fest, AXA's third annual Learning Week, this year highlighted tech and data, focusing on Artificial Intelligence, Data, Cybersecurity and Cloud. It was an opportunity to engage employees of all levels and guide them in understanding the challenges and opportunities Tech and Data can o/ffer. Over 19,500/uni00A0employees worldwide participated in a Tech/uni00A0& Data assessment, with over 8,000/uni00A0participants on multiple global events, broadcast virtually; and\n- /uni25A0 novel and interactive formats were also introduced: AXA Switzerland launched peer-to-peer learning, sharing internal expertise in short TED-style talks, and AXA Italy broadcasted a series of podcasts from influencers, digital marketers and academics exploring self-development and talent.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This is a physical and mindset transformation increasingly adopted across the Group. A more flexible environment is deployed in the campus-style workplaces in several AXA European entities (France, Spain, and Belgium), as well as in AXA Group Operations.\n\nSmart working also accelerated in 2020/uni00A0as part of AXA's digital transformation. In 2020, 52% (+20/uni00A0points compared to 2019) of AXA salaried employees under open-ended contracts had teleworking arrangements (57% of non-sales and 22% of sales salaried workforces). This reflects both the widespread switch to remote working during the pandemic, as well as a strategic HR goal to create the workplace of the future with the target to reach 70% of teleworkers by 2023. AXA has drawn on its experiences in 2020/uni00A0to devise its future Smart working strategy and the key focus will be on how best to motivate and manage people, time and projects to optimize productivity alongside a better work-life balance. This is a long-term cultural and organizational change that AXA will continue through training and learning programs for managers and all employees.\n\n## REINFORCING ENGAGEMENT THROUGH DIALOGUE AND FEEDBACK\n\nStrengthening employee engagement has been a focus given the context of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis in 2020/uni00A0and links to our key HR action of aligning employee experience with AXA's purpose and Employee\n\nValue Proposition. AXA has maintained continuous discussions with employee representative bodies, from the European Works Council to local union groups and has ensured a high- quality social dialogue. This ensures transparency on strategic and social topics impacting the workplace, and consultation on how AXA can support employees through any transition. Social dialogue allows the Group to align global principles with locally relevant approaches.\n\nEach AXA entity engages with sta/ff  and/or their representatives for communications on a regular basis. AXA has also set up a European Works Council (EWC), which extensive role goes beyond regulatory requirements. Besides, AXA is a United Nation Global Compact signatory and is committed to uphold the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nIn 2020/uni00A0 AXA launched its Employee Shareholder offering 'Shareplan' across 37/uni00A0countries including China, demonstrating the Group's commitment to increasing engagement and ownership. Participation was lower than in 2019/uni00A0(15% in 2020/uni00A0compared to 24% in 2019), reflecting a general trend towards caution in personal investment decisions in a year with much financial uncertainty.\n\nListening to employees and taking action builds a culture of feedback that connects everyone to AXA's purpose. To measure engagement, the Group conducted two Pulse surveys in 2020/uni00A0evaluating people's strategic alignment, confidence, and sense of empowerment. Employees believe in the Group's strategic direction (up 10/uni00A0pts.) and recognize AXA as an agile, innovative organization that puts customers first (all saw double digit improvement). The Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) at Group level improved to 35/uni00A0pts./uni00A0- up from 21/uni00A0pts as of December/uni00A02019. This puts AXA among the highest scorers in the Global High Performing Companies 2020, an indicative benchmark compiled by CultureIQ from companies in widely respected rankings such as Fortune's Most Admired and Best to Work For lists.\n\n|                   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| eNPS target       | 25     | 14     | 0      | -      |\n| eNPS result       | 35     | 21     | 7      | (5)    |\n| EMPLOYEE COVERAGE | 100%   | 90%    | 85%    | 82%    |\n\nThe Employee Net promoter score is measured by asking employees one question, 'How likely are you to recommend AXA as a place to work'. The answer scale is from 0/uni00A0to 10, and the result is calculated by taking the percent of promoters (answers of 9/uni00A0- 10) and subtracting the percent of detractors (answer of 0/uni00A0- 5). This then produces a metric on a scale from (-100) to (+100).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFor more information on AXA's/uni00A0I&D policy, please refer to the 'Collecting feedback and Measuring Employee Engagement' page on www.axa.com.",

It sets the stage for Smart Working strategy with the ambition to reach 70% of teleworkers by 2023, and\n- \u00b7 besides, in 2020, in the perspective of the Health and Wellbeing initiatives, the sickness absenteeism rate decreased from 3.3% in 2019/uni00A0to 2.8% in 2020;\n- /uni25A0 foster employee career evolution through skills development, talent management and mobility\n\nProgress in this area is underpinned by individual assessment, training and learning programs as well as opportunities to move internally and internationally.\n\nThis is measured through:\n\n- \u00b7 proportion of employees having been trained: despite the crisis, the development of all employees has remained a reality for AXA./uni00A0100% of AXA salaried workforce have been trained at least once in 2019/uni00A0and in 2020, and\n- \u00b7 in 2020, the mobility within the Group has also remained stable (internal mobility rate: 8%) even if the number of international moves is slightly lower this year (507/uni00A0employees in 2020/uni00A0compared to 794/uni00A0in 2019). The turnover rate decreased by 4/uni00A0points between 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0to reach 11%, AXA's lowest turnover rate since more than 10/uni00A0years;\n- /uni25A0 strengthening inclusion and diversity to breed talent and innovation.\n- In addition to strengthening inclusion and diversity through awareness building, recruitment and development of people from underrepresented groups, AXA closely tracks progress on key gender balance commitments:\n- \u00b7 2023/uni00A0Gender parity at Top Senior Executive level: at the end of 2019, women represented 32% of this population. At the end of 2020, it reached 34%.

This Section covers all three dimensions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## AXA's position on climate change and biodiversity\n\nInsurers are well positioned to address climate-related risks. They have claims loss data, as well as models and tools to analyze and conduct forward-looking approaches. They have a duty to disseminate knowledge about new risks and create adequate insurance products and investments policies. Finally, through their significant investments, they are also well positioned to send the right signals to the investment community and to the specific companies they invest in.\n\nAXA's climate/uni00A0& biodiversity strategy, updated in November/uni00A02019, features the following developments, supporting the concept of aligning our business with the Paris Agreement:\n\n- /uni25A0 'Warming Potential' (see 'Investments' Section below) of our investments aligned on a +1.5\u00b0C trajectory by 2050. This long-term target is complemented, since December/uni00A02020, with a -20% investment-related carbon footprint target between 2019/uni00A0and 2025;\n- /uni25A0 a green investment target of Euro 24/uni00A0billion by 2023;\n- /uni25A0 the launch of the 'Transition Bond' asset class, with two issuances of \u20ac100/uni00A0million in 2019/uni00A0and 2020;\n- /uni25A0 a long-term total exit from the coal industry backed by strict investments and underwriting restrictions, as well as on other carbon-intensive industries;\n- /uni25A0 a target to contribute to carbon neutrality via our operations (direct environmental footprint);\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 a commitment to address biodiversity loss through investment and underwriting policies;\n\nThese initiatives are developed in our annual Climate Report  (see on axa.com) and in the following sections.\n\nIn addition, in 2020:\n\n- /uni25A0 the AXA Group called for the creation of an industry-led alliance to promote climate neutrality in insurance underwriting practices, the 'Net-Zero Insurance Underwriting Alliance';\n- /uni25A0 in the wake of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis, the Group supported several calls to 'build back better' a/f\\_ter the crisis: the 'Call for Mobilisation' led by EMP Pascal Canfin and the EpE association (Entreprise pour l'Environnement)led call for a green recovery. AXA presides the World Economic Forum's 'CEO Action Group for the European Green Deal' which is designed to help mobilizing private sector capital to finance the Green Deal despite the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis;\n- /uni25A0 the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis has had a significant impact on AXA's internal environmental footprint with a sharp decrease of business travel, buildings and vehicle fleet usage as a result of lockdowns and teleworking periods.",

This is why the text below extends beyond purely environmental factors. Furthermore, this text is an overview of our more detailed '2021/uni00A0Climate Report '/uni00A0 (1) , to be published on www.axa.com in Q2/uni00A02021.\n\n## DEFINITIONS AND GOVERNANCE\n\nAXA defines RI as the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into investment processes, including ownership practices. Our objective is to align investments with AXA's Sustainability agenda of/uni00A0protecting people over the long term and creating stronger and more sustainable societies./uni00A0This agenda is in line with our interests as a global insurer and investor.\n\nAXA's conviction is that ESG integration may impact long-term investment performance by o/ffering an enhanced understanding of risk drivers. This conviction is derived from academic research and empirical market data. Within ESG, climate change deserves special attention. We actively pursue measures to manage climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n\nAXA has developed a comprehensive RI strategy covering the Group's General Account assets, including its Unit-Linked investments, where relevant. The implementation of this strategy is overseen by a specific RI governance. AXA's Grouplevel Responsible Investment Committee (RIC) is chaired by the Group Chief Investment O/fficer, and includes representatives from AXA's Asset Management entity, Corporate Responsibility, Risk Management and Communication. The RIC reports to the Group Investment Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/fficer, and sensitive and/or strategic climate finance-related decisions debated in the RIC are ultimately approved by the RISSC (see Section 4.1 ' AXA  Sustainability Strategy - Sustainability governance & Stakeholder dialogue'  of this Annual Report ). In addition, in 2020/uni00A0the 'ESG Footprint Committee' reviewed risks posed by companies or sectors presenting a low ESG performance and/or serious and persistent controversies. AXA's RI policy is supported by the RI Center of Expertise, a transversal working group from AXA's local investment teams interacting with the CR network.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nAXA's Responsible Investment strategy is embodied in its Group Responsible Investment policy (published on the Group's website: www.axa.com/en/about-us/responsible-investment). In 2020, this policy was updated to include a new pillar, Climate-related portfolio alignment with Paris Agreement's objectives. The policy's six pillars are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 ESG Integration: We integrate ESG analysis into investment processes, using KPIs and qualitative research across most of our assets. ESG integration is coordinated centrally, with an active input from our asset managers that include ESG metrics in their investment analysis across asset classes and Regions. This includes the implementation of ESG 'minimum standards' rules based on ESG and controversy scores to review and potentially exclude underperforming issuers from AXA's portfolios. In addition, ESG considerations as well as the transparency of the issuers are integrated in the internal credit risk analysis;\n- /uni25A0 climate-related portfolio alignment with Paris Agreement objectives: Carbon metrics are integrated into investment decisions. AXA continues to develop metrics for measuring the climate-related impact of our investments, in particular the contribution of our investments to the objective of the COP21/uni00A0('Paris Agreement') to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C;\n- /uni25A0 exclusions and sensitive ESG investments: Sector-based restrictions apply to sectors or companies that face acute social, human rights, ethical or environmental challenges. These sector restrictions are published on AXA Group website (www. axa.com/en/about-us/responsible-investment) and currently include controversial weapons, coal mining and coal-based power generation, tar oil sands and associated pipelines, palm oil, food commodity derivatives, and tobacco;\n- a green investment target and transition financing: To increase the allocation of green assets across various asset classes and to support companies shi/f\\_ting towards less carbonintensive business models; /uni25A0\n- /uni25A0 impact investing: Investments that create intentional, positive, measurable, and sustainable impacts on society (both social and environmental issues) while simultaneously delivering financial market returns;\n- /uni25A0 active stewardship: Through voting and engagement on a range of ESG or sustainability issues.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA has implemented an online training course on responsible investment in collaboration with the AXA Group's Responsible Investment Center of Expertise and AXA Investment Managers, which is mandatory for the AXA Group's investment community and is also open to all AXA employees.\n\n## ESG integration\n\nAXA tracks its investments' ESG performance by leveraging AXA IM's in-house ESG tool, where proprietary ESG scores and 'impacttype' metrics are used to monitor ESG risks, identify areas of improvement, set targets or guide shareholder engagement. This analysis covers AXA's General Account assets (sovereign and corporate bonds, equity, property, infrastructure, and Commercial Real Estate debt):\n\n- /uni25A0 for corporate issuers (equity and debt): the ESG assessment emphasizes impact and materiality. It draws on fundamental principles, such as the United Nations Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines, the International Labour Organisation conventions, and other international principles and conventions that guide companies' activities in the field of sustainable development and social responsibility;\n- /uni25A0 for sovereign issuers: AXA's ESG scoring uses public data sources such as the World Bank, the OECD, and the UN ( e.g. environment, social and political risks), and the criteria are adapted to the development levels of countries;\n- /uni25A0 for real assets (direct property, commercial real estate loans and infrastructure debt and equity): AXA's analysis framework is based on proprietary questionnaires covering criteria such as energy e/ff iciency, environmental certificates, and accessibility.\n\nFinally, 'carbon footprinting', which is applied to our equities, corporate fixed income and sovereign debt assets, complements the ESG metrics. See also further climate-related KPI development in the following Section.\n\n## Climate-related portfolio alignment\n\nAs required by the TCFD guidelines and Article/uni00A0173, AXA strives to translate international climate objectives derived from the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement into quantitative investment targets since 2016. In 2020, AXA continued its work based on methodologies provided by external climate risk experts (Carbon Delta, Beyond Ratings, Trucost), while also using internal 'NatCat' models to cover our Real Assets investments. This work covers two broad areas: 'transition risks' and 'physical risks', as defined by the TCFD and explained in more details below.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 'TRANSITION RISKS': FINANCIAL RISKS AND/uni202F'PORTFOLIO/uni202FALIGNMENT'\n\nModelling the extent to which investors may be impacted by shi/f\\_ting market and regulatory trends related to the transition to a low-carbon economy is termed 'transition risk'. It can be measured in financial risk terms (measured in Euros) or purely 'climate impact' terms (measured in temperature rise).\n\n- /uni25A0 Climate risk (the potential impacts of climate change on AXA's investments): for equity and corporate bonds assets, AXA uses a framework developed by Carbon Delta (acquired by MSCI in 2019) which models transition risk based on 'policy-related' risks arising from regulatory e/ff orts to curb carbon emissions and comply with the 2015/uni00A0Paris Agreement. This top-down approach identifies emissions reductions targets by country, sector and company-level, applies corresponding carbon price constraints, compensated by future 'green revenue' estimates. This approach enables to project companies' potential costs or gains, which are translated into a forward-looking 'cost of climate' indicator. For AXA's sovereign portfolios, AXA uses another methodology developed by Beyond Ratings, (acquired by the London Stock Exchange in 2019) to evaluate a comparable 'transition risk' metric based on the allocation of carbon budget by countries supporting various warming scenarios, depending on macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, population growth and energy e/fficiency;\n- /uni25A0 Climate impact (the potential impacts of AXA's investments on the climate): in 2020, AXA continued its investigation of the concept of an 'investment temperature'. This approach labelled 'warming potential' in Carbon Delta's methodology, captures the climate-related aspects of a company's activities, including its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, technology developments, and 'green revenue' opportunities. This is derived from the carbon intensity alignment of each company relative to the sectoral carbon intensity target needed to reach global climate target. This produces a 'warming potential' indicator per company and sector, and ultimately for AXA's investments.\n\n## 'PHYSICAL' RISKS: CLIMATE IMPACTS ON AXA'S REAL/uni202FASSETS PORTFOLIO\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned 'transition' risks, climate change, and in particular, extreme weather events, may impact 'real assets' such as real estate. This is termed 'physical' risks according to the TCFD guidelines. As an insurer, AXA has a significant amount of claims-related data to conduct a 'physical risks' analysis on its real estate portfolio. AXA's Investments and Group Risk Management teams collaborate to evaluate the financial impact of floods and windstorms on the buildings and infrastructure of these portfolios.\n\nOur physical risk assessment for real estate uses 'NatCat' models/uni00A0generally only used to assess the impact of natural catastrophes on insured exposure/uni00A0- combining stochastic events (windstorms, floods, hurricanes) and a geolocalised portfolio of real assets.",

        "page_content": "Specific 'destruction rates', which factor location, building/ infrastructure type and construction materials are then used to determine potential damage rates and derive a loss for each and every building/infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, for corporate bonds and equities, the costs of 'physical risks' have been assessed by modeling the expected financial impacts of extreme weather events on companies' facilities. The physical risk cost estimates factor in vulnerability to business interruption risk and asset damage, based on the exposure of facility locations to extreme weather events.\n\nThe analysis of 'transition' and 'physical' risks is further developed in our Climate Report/TCFD 2021.\n\n## 2019: A CARBON NEUTRALITY/1.5\u00b0C PORTFOLIO TARGET\n\nThe Paris Agreement's goal to stabilize carbon emissions by 2050/uni00A0('carbon neutrality') requires that global warming be kept below +1.5\u00b0C compared to preindustrial levels during this century. The 'warming potential' described above, which is a forwardlooking and dynamic concept, is a relevant answer to this objective as it is similar to a 'projected carbon footprint'.\n\nFollowing in-depth analysis of 'temperature' methodologies, AXA announced in November/uni00A02019/uni00A0its commitment to align its investments with the Paris Agreement, thereby committing to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C 'warming potential' by 2050.\n\nOur 2020/uni00A0TCFD-related modelling shows that our investments (corporates and sovereign) have a 2.8\u00b0C 'warming potential'. This is below our benchmark of 3.6\u00b0C but nonetheless shows that investors are operating in a carbon-intensive economy that is not aligned with the Paris Accord. A vast energy transition e/ffort is required. All companies must evolve, and it is incumbent on investors to identify and support relevant transition strategies.\n\nAXA therefore joined the UN-led 'Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance' (the NZAOA), whose objective is aligned with this transition imperative (see below).\n\n## 2020: THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INTERMEDIATE TARGET\n\nAs part of its participation in the NZAOA, AXA commits to publish intermediate targets every five years to track progress towards climate neutrality by 2050. In December/uni00A02020/uni00A0AXA announced its intermediate target, a 20% reduction in the carbon footprint of AXA's General Account assets by 2025/uni00A0(starting date being 2019/uni00A0and representing an aggregated 20% reduction across corporate fixed income, listed equities and real estate assets). A carbon footprinting approach was chosen by NZAOA members as emissions reporting methodologies are considered currently more robust, and data availability is stronger. While various forward-looking metrics exist, such as the 'warming potential' metric, more convergence is needed. AXA's contributions to supporting methodology convergence is developed in our Climate Report/TCFD 2021.\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## Exclusions and sensitive ESG investments\n\nCertain activities and products are deemed to be inconsistent with our climate strategy and broader sustainability goals of protecting people over the long term. AXA has developed specific 'sector guidelines' which apply both to investments and insurance (see following Section). These currently include the following sectors:\n\n- /uni25A0 coal and oil sands;\n- /uni25A0 'controversial weapons' manufacturers that are banned by international conventions (antipersonnel landmines, cluster munitions/cluster bombs chemical, biological and depleted uranium weapons, nuclear weapons proliferation);\n- /uni25A0 tobacco manufacturers, whose products conflict with our role as one of the world's largest health insurers;\n- /uni25A0 palm oil producers which do not adhere to this industry's best sustainability practices (notably regarding deforestation, land and labor rights);\n- /uni25A0 so/f\\_t  commodity derivatives which may be responsible for inflating the price of basic food commodities.\n\nIn total, AXA's divestments (including new coal-related e/fforts announced in 2019/uni00A0-  see below) represent approximately \u20ac7.5/uni00A0billion (coal, tobacco, oil sands, controversial weapons and palm oil, in decreasing order of magnitude, and including AXA XL assets).\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED EXCLUSIONS: COAL AND OIL SANDS\n\nCarbon emissions will require significant curbing in order to reduce the risk of climate change, which may place business constraints on carbon-intensive industries, leaving some assets 'stranded', which in turn may lead to reduced valuations. Current valuation models may not account for such risks adequately. Coal-based power generation is seen as the most risky industry in terms of such 'asset stranding'.\n\nAXA acted early in May/uni00A02015/uni00A0with a pioneering coal divestment, later strengthened in 2017/uni00A0with underwriting restrictions, and extended these to our new entity AXA XL in 2018. In November/uni00A02019, this approach was amplified and complemented with a long-term perspective. AXA now bans investments, for General Accounts and in Unit-Linked assets in fully controlled mandates, in the following companies:\n\n- /uni25A0 power generation companies with coal share of power production (energy mix) over 30% and/or coal 'expansion plans' producing more than 300/uni00A0MW and/or over 10/uni00A0GW of coal-based power installed capacity;\n\nI\n\n4",

This approach is applied both to our investments and underwriting (see below) activity.\n\nAXA notably encourages this transition through active shareholder engagement and client communication. In particular, as a shareholder, AXA engages, alone or within specific investor coalitions such as Climate Action 100+, with the companies concerned (whether client or portfolio companies), in order to encourage them to develop and disclose an exit or closure plan.\n\nBecause oil sands are also a particularly carbon-intensive form of energy, AXA divested from the main oil sands producers and from the main associated pipelines players.\n\n## A green investment target and/uni202Ftransition/uni202Ffinancing\n\n## GREEN INVESTMENTS\n\nIn addition to 'temperature' targets and divestments, green investments encourage various sectors to ramp up their climate strategy. In November/uni00A02019, AXA committed to invest \u20ac24/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023. Green investments are defined as: green bonds, infrastructure debt/uni00A0& equity, impact investments, real estate, and commercial real estate loans. In December/uni00A02020, AXA's green investments reached \u20ac16.1/uni00A0billion (\u20ac11.7/uni00A0billion end of 2019).\n\nAXA and the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group focused on the private sector, launched a US$500/uni00A0million partnership in 2017, supporting an infrastructure fund that will notably finance green infrastructures in emerging countries, including renewable energy, water, green transport and telecoms. At the end of 2020, mandatory loans amount to US$404/uni00A0million, of which US$162/uni00A0million has already been financed (at the end of 2019/uni00A0mandatory loans amounted to US$390/uni00A0million, of which US$120/uni00A0million had already been financed). Coal and oil-sands related projects are explicitly excluded.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## TRANSITION BONDS\n\nGreen or climate bonds are a recent but successful instrument designed to support projects with climate or environmental added value. However, it is also important to support carbon intensive players that are actively decarbonizing but have not yet reached the 'greenness' that makes these e/fforts eligible to green bonds. This is why, since 2019, AXA IM has worked to develop the concept of 'transition bonds'. In November/uni00A02019, AXA announced the launch of a first, \u20ac100/uni00A0million 'transition bond' in partnership with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. In 2020, AXA announced a second transition bond of \u20ac100/uni00A0million in partnership with BPCE. The proceeds will be used to finance Natixis' assets, being project and/or corporate loans from sectors with high emissions reduction potential as well as their contribution to a low carbon economy. The details of this project are available online. Throughout 2020, AXA IM acted as co-chair of the Climate Transition Finance Working Group of the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) which published the Climate Transition Finance Handbook, the first global e/ffort to frame the concept of transition finance.\n\n## Impact investing\n\nImpact investing means investing with the clear intention of generating positive, measurable social and environmental outcomes, as well as competitive financial returns. AXA's impact investing strategy is designed to align with this traditional definition of impact investing. This approach is aligned with the Operating Principles for Impact Management sponsored by the International Finance Corporation. AXA IM is a founding signatory to these Principles and a Member of the Advisory Board. Since 2013/uni00A0AXA has committed almost \u20ac700/uni00A0million to impact investing.\n\n## Active stewardship\n\nAs a shareholder and bondholder, AXA has the possibility to engage with the management of companies in which it invests in order to help catalyze positive change on certain issues (such as climate change, health, governance, market practices,/uni00A0etc.). These engagement activities are carried out either directly by the Group or by AXA IM on behalf of the AXA Group and third-party clients. AXA IM holds constructive and challenging discussions directly with investee companies, and as part of a coalition of investors, engaging with companies in key sectors. Voting at General Meetings is performed in favor of environmental, climate-related, social and governance issues including sustainability disclosures.",

Addressing biodiversity-related risks and opportunities is a natural extension of AXA's climate e/fforts. Indeed, climate change is severely compounding the destruction of ecosystems around the world, adding pressures related to drought, ocean acidification, more intense natural catastrophes,/uni00A0etc. AXA's biodiversity strategy currently includes the following developments:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA committed to several public Pledges since 2018: 'Act4Nature', 'Business for Nature' and the 'Finance for Biodiversity' initiative. AXA's CEO also addressed the 2020/uni00A0UN General Assembly to support these initiatives;\n- /uni25A0 in 2019, during G7/uni00A0Ministerial meetings, AXA launched with the WWF the report 'Into the Wild/uni00A0- Integrating nature into investment strategies' designed to raise awareness on biodiversity loss and its economic and financial impacts. It presents several recommendations, including the launch of a 'TCFD-like' broad-based taskforce to promote the protection and restoration of biodiversity, as well as the creation of biodiversity risk metrics adapted to investors;\n- /uni25A0 AXA initiated a three years partnership (2020-2023) with the WWF which covers: cra/f\\_t ing an industry-led taskforce to develop a biodiversity risk-related guidelines for the financial services industry (TNFD), developing biodiversity risk and impact metrics, and supporting AXA's Impact Investing work and relevant policy development;\n- /uni25A0 in 2020, AXA and the WWF helped create the 'Informal Working Group' (IWG) dedicated to cra/f\\_ting the TNFD in 2021. The IWG features over 60/uni00A0members which include insurers, corporates, asset managers, commercial, development and central banks as well as governments. AXA leads its 'Governance' working group;\n- /uni25A0 AXA launched a $175/uni00A0million 'Impact Investment' fund focused on biodiversity protection. In 2020/uni00A0AXA decided to double this commitment to $350/uni00A0million. The Fund has a specific investment objective to deliver measurable impact outcomes: avoided emissions (CO 2 /uni00A0tonnes), area land conserved km 2 , ecosystems and species preserved (km 2 /uni00A0and #), waste avoided (m tonnes), vulnerable communities protected (#people). The Fund has already completed 11/uni00A0transactions ranging from a sustainable micro-forestry business in Kenya to a natural capital restoration project developer in Indonesia;\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA, together with 3/uni00A0peers, BNPP AM, Mirova and Sycomore AM, launched an RfP to identify the most promising biodiversity risks data provider. The selected partner developed a tool based on the concept of the MSA (Mean Species Abundance) which tracks damage to biodiversity that can be correlated to investment databases. The four partners have committed to fund this organization for three years (2020-2023) in order to develop adequate risk and impact metrics;\n- /uni25A0 the AXA Research Fund actively supports academic research on biodiversity risks (see Section 4.4 ' Inclusive insurer/uni00A0- AXA Research Fund'  of this Annual Report );\n- /uni25A0 AXA XL actively contributes to the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), an alliance focused on developing Risk Management strategies using the experience and expertise of the insurance and broader finance community, to protect ocean biodiversity;\n- /uni25A0 product innovation: there is growing understanding of the economic, social, and ecological importance of naturebased solutions to mitigate the e/ffects of climate change. For example, coral reefs and mangroves provide protective benefits to many/uni00A0millions of people around the world and form a critical component of disaster Risk Management and climate adaptation in more vulnerable geographies. AXA XL is leading the work to build a Coastal Risk Index. By integrating coral reefs and mangroves into risk models, we will be able to more accurately price risk and support the development of Risk Management solutions, whilst catalysing the protection and sustainable management of coastal ecosystems to increase resilience and biodiversity. In 2020, alongside partners at 'The Nature Conservancy' and the University of California, Santa Cruz, AXA published a study on how both indemnity and parametric insurance could be used as a finance mechanism to pay for mangrove restoration a/f\\_ter extreme weather events. The first coral reef insurance product (not developed by AXA) deployed o/ff  Quintana Roo in Mexico was activated a/f\\_ter Hurricane Delta in October/uni00A02020. Through a grant from the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance which AXA XL cochairs, Willis Towers Watson and the MAR Fund are working with local governments and stakeholders to design and, ultimately, deploy new parametric insurance products at four sites along the Mesoamerican reef;\n- /uni25A0 finally, AXA has called for the adoption of a robust international agreement to be reached during COP15/uni00A0in Kunming, China, at the end of 2021.\n\nI\n\n4",

The Group CR team provides a bridge with the RI-related governance. Since 2020, the RISSC (refer to 4.1,  '  AXA Sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability governance & Stakeholder dialogue' ) drives the integration of AXA's climate and biodiversity strategy in its insurance activities. In addition, a dedicated team with Group Risk Management analyses Emerging Risks which o/f\\_t en relate to long term ESG issues, and monitor their potential impact (refer to Section/uni00A05.8 ' Other material risks/uni00A0- Emerging risks'  of this Annual Report ). The Group Emerging Risk Committee issues recommendations to adapt our business o/ffer and underwriting policies.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RESTRICTIONS\n\nIt is inconsistent to commercially support industries that the Group has divested from. Therefore, AXA also restricts insurance coverage for coal and oil sands-related assets (as well as in the other industries mentioned in the previous Section), and arctic drilling. Since 2017, the underwriting restrictions ban Property and Construction covers for coal mines, coal plants, oil sands extraction sites or associated pipeline. In November/uni00A02019, AXA significantly strengthened these restrictions by adding the coalrelated restrictions at client-level, mirroring divestment criteria (see investment Section above). Oil sand activities and arctic oil exploration activities are also banned for underwriting.\n\nA business referral process is in place to monitor the implementation of these guidelines. These rules do not apply to Employee Benefits (Health, Savings, Life insurance) or to reinsurance treaty. The details of these policies are published on AXA Group's website and in our annual Climate Reports.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## COALITION-BUILDING: THE NET-ZERO INSURANCE UNDERWRITING ALLIANCE\n\nIn December/uni00A02020, at the occasion of the fi/f\\_th anniversary of the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement, AXA called for a significant new development in our underwriting business. Indeed, AXA has pioneered climate-related efforts and reframed the Paris Agreement as an investment roadmap by committing to climate neutrality in our investments. We also actively support coalitions that bring collective solutions to issues that require industry-wide cooperation. This is why AXA publicly supports the creation of a UN-convened 'Net-Zero Insurance Underwriting Alliance' to collectively extend our commitment to climate neutrality to our insurance business.\n\n## OUR PRODUCTS\n\nIn addition to reorienting its investment strategy, the Group seeks to minimize its 'indirect' impact by o/ffering insurance solutions that promote environmentally-friendly behavior.\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA XL underwriters have significant expertise and capacity for insuring clients in the energy industry, with a strong focus on renewable energy;\n- /uni25A0 Some local entities also develop Motor and car fleet insurance policies encouraging low CO 2 /uni00A0emission vehicles, home insurance policies encouraging energy e/ff iciency, renewable energy installations, and environmentally friendly claims strategies. For instance, in case of a car accident, AXA France promotes the use of second-hand parts instead of new ones, and AXA Switzerland encourages repairing damaged components ('micro-repair') rather than swapping them out;\n- /uni25A0 AXA Climate o/ffers parametric insurance products which, for example, help insured communities facing the consequences of climate-related disasters on agricultural crops (notably drought or flooding).

The TCFD was set up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and chaired by Michael Bloomberg and Mark Carney (former Governor of the Bank of England, now UN Special Envoy for Climate Action). The TCFD provides guidance on how to disclose climate change risk and opportunities. In 2019, the FSB approved AXA's renewed membership of the TCFD, notably with an ambition to investigate the relevance of 'investment temperature' metrics;\n- /uni25A0 CEO Action Group for the European Green Deal: this coalition, initiated by the World Economic Forum (Davos) in 2020, strives to help finance the EU 'Green Deal' in the wake of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis.

With this new cycle, AXA aims at continuing its e/fforts to reduce the footprint of its operations on all the 'Scopes' of its greenhouse gas emissions /uni00A0(1 ) :\n\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A01: Emissions related to fuel combustion on AXA's sites (fuel oil\u2026) as well as by its vehicle fleet (fuel);\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A02: Emissions from purchased energy (mainly electricity consumed by AXA buildings);\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A03: Emissions from business travel and IT activities. Emissions related to paper consumption, monitored until 2020, have become less material and are excluded from these new targets. Note: 'Indirect' Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions related to our investments are described in Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Investments' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA has developed new objectives, based on the approach promoted by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which AXA joined in 2015. More specifically, AXA has chosen the 'Sectoral Approach to Decarbonization' to define its 2019-2025/uni00A0objectives, aimed at achieving the goals of the Paris agreements. AXA has submitted to the SBTi a target of -25% for the energy, car fleet and business travel perimeter.\n\nThis objective is part of a broader framework that integrates the new measures related to AXA's IT activities and  which translates into an overall reduction of the Group's CO 2 /uni00A0 emissions of -20% by 2025/uni00A0compared to 2019/uni00A0(energy, car  fleet, business travel and o/ffice automation and IT activities perimeter).",

The calculation of CO 2 /uni00A0emissions related to primary energy consumption for buildings is done using ADEME emission factors or those communicated by the supplier for renewable energies such as biogas. For car fleet emissions, an emission factor per km is applied based on the vehicle's emission range. To take into account regulatory changes and new WLTP standards ('Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure'), vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to the WLTP standard.\n\nScope/uni00A01/uni00A0CO 2 /uni00A0 emissions amounted to 26,292/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 in 2020, a decrease by 31% compared to 2019. AXA's 2020/uni00A0target was 36,133/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0(target is -25% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This result  is mainly explained by less heating due to the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis, but also by energy saving measures and shi/f\\_t  to other energies. Use of vehicle fleet was also down in 2020/uni00A0compared to 2019/uni00A0with a decrease by -33% of traveled kilometers and the CO 2 /km emissions of the AXA fleet decreased from 124/uni00A0gCO 2 /km on average to 121/uni00A0gCO 2 /km (-2%).\n\n## SCOPE/uni00A02/uni00A0CO 2 /uni00A0EMISSIONS\n\nCO 2 eq emissions related to electricity consumption are calculated based on consumption in kWh. If the primary source of electricity is known, ADEME emission factors are used. Otherwise, either we use the emission factor provided by the electricity suppliers or the average emission factor for electricity in the country (source ADEME or the European Environment Agency for European countries).\n\nFor other secondary energies (heating and cooling networks) we use the emission factors provided by ADEME or the supplier if the secondary energy is produced from a primary renewable source.\n\nScope/uni00A02/uni00A0emissions amount to 40,894/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0in 2020, a decrease by -35% compared to 2019. AXA's 2020/uni00A0Target was 58,465/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 (target is -35% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This decrease is mainly due to the lower consumption induced by reduced use of buildings due to COVID-19/uni00A0situation.\n\n## SCOPE/uni00A03/uni00A0CO 2 /uni00A0EMISSIONS\n\nAXA's Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions include CO 2 /uni00A0emissions related to business travel, consumption of digital equipment (computers, fixed and cell phones, storage tools, cloud storage servers) and employee commuting. However, the target set by AXA on Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0for the period 2019-2025/uni00A0includes only business travel.\n\nAXA's Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0business travel emissions are at 17,460/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0i n 2020, a decrease by 81% compared to 2019. The target for AXA was 87,680/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0for 2020, excluding COVID-19/uni00A0e/ff  ect (target is -18% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). The COVID-19/uni00A0crisis is the main driver of this significant decline in 2020. New teleworking habits have been adopted and travel banned due to the sanitary situation. The emission factors are those of ADEME and of the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural A/ff airs (DEFRA).\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA sites with fewer than 50/uni00A0FTEs are not included in data collection, but are part of extrapolation process.\n\nFor the first time, AXA measured the Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0footprint of its IT activities. IT Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions (equipment and services) amount to 21,253/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 in 2020. Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0related to AXA's IT impacts was the subject of in-depth work in 2020  (refer to paragraph 'Environmental impact related to the use of digital equipment').\n\nTotal AXA's Scope/uni00A03 /uni00A0emissions (business travel, commuting and digital equipment and services) amount to 124,879/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0in 2020.\n\n## Analysis per consumption items\n\n## POWER CONSUMPTION\n\nAXA's power consumption includes the total energy consumed by its corporate sites (heating, cooling, daily operations electricity) and data centers during the reporting year. In 2020, total energy mix consisted of electricity (74%), gas (13%), steam (10%), chilled water (3%) and heating oil (0.5%).\n\nAXA's total energy consumption is 260,992/uni00A0MWh for 2020, a decrease by -15% compared to 2019. This consumption is lower than the 2020/uni00A0target of 300,182/uni00A0kWh for this year (AXA target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThese results are partly related to the e/ffect of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis on buildings' use with a lower occupancy rate, even though they've been largely heated and cooled to maintain accessibility. 2020/uni00A0achievements are also the result of our continued e/fforts to save energy at our sites. In 2020, 69/uni00A0AXA sites out of the 225/uni00A0o/ffice sites (31%) included in the environmental reporting will receive an environmental certificate under building certification programs such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), HQE,/uni00A0etc.\n\nIn 2020, 57% of the electricity consumed by AXA was coming from renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass) which is slightly lower than in 2019/uni00A0(59%). Some contractual constraints prevented electricity type's change in 2020/uni00A0and COVID-19/uni00A0crisis has drawn facility teams' focus. AXA's 'RE100' objective is to reach 100% by 2025, with an intermediate target of 70% by 2020/uni00A0that has been only partly met because some datacenters have not been able to switch to renewable electricity in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS TRAVEL\n\nBusiness travel measured in km decreased by -78% between 2019/uni00A0and 2020, from 393,322/uni00A0km in 2019/uni00A0to 88,276/uni00A0km in 2020, mainly impacted by the COVID-19/uni00A0context (as explained in 'Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0Business travel' above). Some entities such as AXA XL and AXA Climate have initiated a carbon pricing on business travel.\n\n## VEHICLE FLEET\n\nAXA's fleet is made up of commercial and corporate vehicles. In order to take into account for the evolution in low-emission vehicles' supply, two additional emission bands (less than 20/uni00A0gCO 2 / km and 21-60/uni00A0gCO 2 /km) have been added together with their corresponding emission factors. The standards for calculating vehicle emissions are evolving with the deployment of the WLTP standard. Vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to this new standard.\n\nIn 2020, the total distance traveled by the Group's vehicle fleet was 146,765/uni00A0km in 2020, down -33% from 2019.\n\nThe Group has implemented car fleet policies that define CO 2 /uni00A0emission limits for all types of vehicles, regardless of employee contributions. Employees are also encouraged to opt for hybrid or electric cars. These policies also include safety standards. In 2020, 23% of the kilometers traveled by AXA's vehicle fleet were driven by vehicles emitting less than 100g CO 2 /km), 37% by vehicles emitting between 101g and-120g.\n\n## PAPER\n\nAXA's paper usage concerns o/ffice paper (measured per employee) and marketing and distribution paper (brochures,/uni00A0etc., measured per client). AXA's total paper consumption was 47.7/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2020/uni00A0 versus 62.1/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2019, i.e. a decrease of -23%. 2020/uni00A0Target was 48.9kg/FTE (AXA target is -20% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025/uni00A0target).\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\nOur o/ffice paper consumption per FTE is 9.2kg/FTE in 2020/uni00A0 versus . 11.4 kg/FTE in 2019, a decrease of -19%. Many entities have implemented a printing policy that includes reducing the number of printers and installing a badge system to collect all printed documents.\n\nAXA's consumption of marketing and distribution paper per client is 0.04kg/client in 2020/uni00A0 versus . 0.06kg/client in 2019, a decrease by -26%.\n\nAXA also strives to increase the volume of paper from recycled sources or sustainably managed forests. In 2020, AXA sourced 48% of o/ffice paper and 80% of marketing and distribution paper from recycled sources, for a total of 74% ( versus 72% in total in 2019).\n\n## WATER CONSUMPTION\n\nAXA's water consumption is 4.81/uni00A0m 3 /FTE decreasing by/uni00A0-31% compared to 2019. Target for 2020/uni00A0was 6.9/uni00A0m 3 /FTE (target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This reduction in water consumption reflects better water management initiatives by the entities and the buildings' lower occupancy rate in the context of COVID-19/uni00A0crisis.\n\n## WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nAXA contributes to waste reduction and sorting for recycling.\n\nThe quantity of unsorted waste is 23.1/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2020/uni00A0decreasing by -40% compared to 2019, mainly due to COVID-19, waste reduction initiatives, and the development of selective sorting in the entities. Target for 2020/uni00A0was 37.6kg/FTE (reduction target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025).\n\nThe total amount of waste generated by AXA is 5,430/uni00A0tons in 2020/uni00A0and the recycling rate (sorted waste/total waste) is 50%.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The COVID-19/uni00A0crisis further accelerated the transformation of the Group way of working, most employees working remotely full or part time. However, digital activities are proved to have a strong environmental footprint via the extensive use of energy and raw material to build ever more sophisticated devices.\n\nIn 2020, AXA initiated a 'Sustainable Digital' program led by AXA Group Operations, with Corporate Responsibility team support, covering all AXA entities except AXA XL at this stage. This program aims at measuring the carbon footprint of AXA's digital activities, considering the di/fferent components (usage, equipment, data center and services) in a holistic way. AXA's digital impact is disclosed for the first time.\n\nReducing the environmental footprint of digital activities for AXA goes through monitoring their energy consumption as well as its equipment needs. The approach has been developed following the recommendation of The Shi/f\\_t  Project 'LeanICT' publication and encompassed several steps:\n\n- /uni25A0 elaborate and launch a Sustainable Digital strategy;\n- /uni25A0 develop a sustainable digital culture at AXA;\n- /uni25A0 measure the carbon footprint of the Information System, throughout its life cycle;\n- /uni25A0 build a sustainable Information System by integrating the requirement for sobriety into data centers operations, terminals life cycle, practice of architecture, data management, development,/uni00A0etc;\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\n- /uni25A0 engage with customers, suppliers, partners, institutions towards sustainable solutions and services through working groups or research.\n\nAXA's digital footprint is 27,845/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 in 2020. This footprint divides into four main categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 32,874/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 2,492/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 related to the electricity consumption of the servers directly used and operated by AXA Group Operations in its data centers. This is a subset of Scope/uni00A02/uni00A0electricity of AXA (refer to paragraph 'Scope/uni00A02' CO 2 /uni00A0emissions for calculation methods);\n- /uni25A0 10,456/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 4,099/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 linked to the electricity consumption of the terminals used by employees and service providers involved in AXA operations (computers, monitors, cell phones, tablets). The calculation method is based on internal inventories and manufacturers' data. The measurement includes a subset of Scope/uni00A02/uni00A0(for consumption in AXA buildings) as well as a Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0part in the case of remote work. The proportion of consumption inside and outside AXA's premises has not yet been determined;\n- /uni25A0 16,234/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0related to the manufacturing of digital equipment that have been purchased by AXA. The calculation method is based on inventories, manufacturers' and public data as well as equipment average lifespan (Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions);\n- /uni25A0 5,019/uni00A0t eq CO 2 /uni00A0 in connection with AXA's purchases of digital services like cloud computing (Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions).\n\nIn addition, AXA continues to ensure compliance with Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE), for example by extending the lifespan of IT equipment and promoting the reuse of reformed equipment.\n\n| AXA Information System Environmental footprint indicators/uni00A0 (a)                          | UNIT        | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Electricity consumption: data centers/uni00A0 (b)                                              | MWh         | 32,874 |\n| Scope/uni00A02/uni00A0CO /uni00A0 2 emissions: electricty of data centers (c) /uni00A0         | T. eq.

As a responsible insurer, AXA aims at addressing the protection gap of vulnerable communities, through business opportunities adapted to local conditions. Our goal is to (1) foster integration of more inclusive criteria and practices in our di/fferent business lines, (2) share best practices and (3) develop an impact measurement methodology.\n\nIn 2020, AXA and the entire insurance sector have been highly called upon in the context of the unprecedented COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. First of all, AXA has committed for hospitals, purchasing masks at the very beginning of the crisis with 2million masks and 20,000/uni00A0free meals (thanks to AXA-Uber partnership). Many business-related initiatives have been implemented throughout the Groups with products and services' adaptations. Insurance coverage of customers and particularly caregivers have been extended. It started in China through AXA Tianping. For examples, AXA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nFrance committed to redistribute some parts of premiums to its professional clients through various schemes. Germany has paused some premium increases and maintained Property and Casualty  insurance contracts. Switzerland and Indonesia have extended Health contracts' guarantees. AXA has leveraged its teleconsultation services to contribute to the e/ff ort of healthcare services across the globe, in France, in Belgium, in Italy and in the Asian Region.\n\nBeyond these insurance activities, AXA has also supported the economy and made e/fforts to mitigate the societal consequences of this COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. In France, AXA has contributed to the State solidarity fund to support SMEs. AXA France has contributed to strengthen SMEs' equity.\n\nIn addition, as a responsible investor, in 2020/uni00A0AXA invested over \u20ac1.9/uni00A0billion in social bonds, including in response to COVID-19.\n\n## Business-related societal initiatives\n\nAs a responsible insurer, AXA strives to make insurance accessible to all. Insurance is a major catalyst for economic development and progress in society. Risks' pooling, which is at the heart of insurance, creates a system of mutual support and reinforces a sense of community. AXA's aim is to extend the scope of insurance, by innovating to enable populations who have traditionally been less well protected to access insurance, including through the following initiatives:\n\n- /uni25A0 integrating ESG criteria in product range through dedicated product labels such as ' Assurance c itoyenne ' ('Citizen Insurance');\n- /uni25A0 being actively engaged in financial inclusion with AXA Emerging Customers;\n- /uni25A0 providing insurance solutions and opportunities for women with Women In Insurance initiative;\n- /uni25A0 developing parametric insurance solutions to protect vulnerable populations from the e/ffects of climate change, with AXA Climate;\n- /uni25A0 access to health and disease prevention through divesting from the tobacco industry and developing dedicated products.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## INTEGRATING SOCIETAL ISSUES IN/uni202FPRODUCT RANGE\n\nIn France, demand for responsible products from clients continues to grow. Consequently, back in 2015, AXA France created the Assurance citoyenne label, which guarantees that all insurance contracts o/ffer benefits to clients as well as positively impact society. In 2019, this initiative was adapted and deployed on AXA's Savings contracts under the \u00c9pargne citoyenne ('Citizen Savings') label. These two labels are based on an assessment toolkit built in collaboration with a panel of external stakeholders and audited by an independent third party. Our engagements are communicated through the label's four pillars, which are the following: 'Trust' ( e.g. simple contracts for readability and transparency), 'Prevention' ( e.g. preventive services or financial education to minimize the risks our clients are facing for themselves, their goods and their savings), 'Environment' ( e.g. paperless contract, investment decisions based on environmental impact), and 'Fairness' ( e.g. product accessibility for populations usually excluded from insurance mechanisms, investments in companies which create recruiting opportunities and protect human rights). In 2020, AXA France built all new o/ffers around these engagements and distributed in total 68/uni00A0di/fferent labelled products. Since 2015, 6.3/uni00A0million labelled contracts have been sold.",

        "page_content": "## EMERGING CUSTOMERS AND INITIATIVES TO FOSTER MORE RESILIENCE\n\nThrough the development of its Emerging Customers insurance solutions across the world, AXA addresses financial exclusion by enabling vulnerable segments of the population to access insurance products and services that accompany them in their economic progression and provide a safety net that prevents them from falling into poverty. This approach requires the design of/uni00A0propositions that are accessible, a/ffordable, and relevant to the reality of these customers. The AXA Emerging Customers products and services are designed leveraging technology, and involving co-creation with customers as well as distribution partners, including mobile network operators, banks and microfinance institutions, FMCG companies, and remittance companies.\n\nIn 2020, AXA Emerging Customers covered over 22/uni00A0million customers and has continued to develop various partnerships across more than 10/uni00A0markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 2020, there was a particular focus on developing partnerships with health-tech players combining insurance and wellness services. One example is the partnership with Alodokter, a leading health digital platform in Indonesia, which has been running for 2/uni00A0years. Another example, launched in 2020, was the first simple, digital, and accessible inclusive insurance program by AXA China and AXA Next Business Innovation Center, a PPP scheme with the Beijing Civil A/ffairs Bureau./uni00A0Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, AXA Emerging Customers engaged in the provision of free telemedicine consultations in several countries to support customers in accessing medical services.\n\n## PARAMETRIC INSURANCE\n\nWith around 100/uni00A0B2B public and private sector clients worldwide, AXA Climate (formerly AXA Global Parametrics) provides immediate protection to communities facing climate risks in order to prevent them from falling into poverty.\n\nBy drawing on the latest advances in technology and data science to protect vulnerable communities from the e/ffects of climate change, AXA Climate provides parametric insurance solutions based on satellite and weather data that triggers quick and automatic payouts within a few days a/f\\_ter a natural catastrophe or extreme weather event has struck. AXA Climate has also developed early warning systems using satellite and other weather data to anticipate and initiate contingency planning before a natural catastrophe occurs. Climate change is another field that AXA Climate is working on, developing a unique global risk adaptation platform to provide risk assessments and tailored adaptation plans.\n\nAXA Climate works closely with governments and international organizations to develop public-private partnerships in emerging markets. Public-private partnerships represent over half of the portfolio.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAXA Climate's public clients include all major international sovereign risk pools which provide governments protection against natural disaster risks including tropical cyclone, earthquake, excess rainfall and drought. AXA Climate also works with governments in the agriculture sector to protect farmers against yield losses due to multiple climate risks. AXA Climate supports the national agriculture insurance scheme in India which allows more than 55/uni00A0million farmers to benefit from agriculture insurance.\n\nMoreover, AXA Climate also works with the public sector on agriculture insurance projects at smaller scale in Pakistan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Zambia, Ethiopia and Mozambique where it protects over half a/uni00A0million farmers.\n\nCorporate clients of AXA Climate include also leading industrialists in Europe, Asia and the Americas, agriculture cooperatives, forestry organizations both in Europe and Latin America, and renewable energy companies.\n\n## WOMEN IN INSURANCE\n\nWomen, particularly in emerging countries, are less well insured than men, despite being a powerful force in the economy. In 2014, AXA published a report, 'SheForShield', which looked at women's attitudes towards insurance, as well as their needs and expectations. Since AXA has developed the 'Women in Insurance' initiative aimed at increasing women's access to insurance products and.\n\nThe 3/uni00A0 main focus areas are: women as retail clients, as entrepreneurs and in the distribution force. AXA has developed a dual approach: in mature markets, AXA will empower women to be financially independent, and in emerging markets the objective is to empower women to 'live better lives'. In 2020, 17/uni00A0entities included 'Women in Insurance' as a strategic priority and 25/uni00A0products have been developed ( versus 17/uni00A0entities and 26/uni00A0products in 2019).\n\nFurther, in 2019/uni00A0through AXA Research Fund, AXA dedicated \u20ac1/uni00A0million to research to better understand and prevent health and entrepreneurial barriers for women.\n\nSince 2018, AXA is also a strategic partner of the 'Global Women's Forum', with the objective to disseminate AXA's expertise and influence on the best practices, solutions and projects. Through this organization, AXA published in 2020/uni00A0the first Gender Equity barometer to highlight the disparity between perception and reality on gender-related topics in G7/uni00A0countries.\n\nLeading the 'Women4Health Daring Circle', AXA is striving towards giving women equal access to health and exploring unique and paramount ways to enhance their health status and their quality of life by shaping a new inclusive health system in the post COVID-19/uni00A0world.\n\nI\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, AXA teamed up with research firm Ipsos to survey 8,000/uni00A0women from di/fferent social backgrounds in eight countries. As a result, two reports have been published on the impact of COVID-19/uni00A0crisis on women. The first examined the e/ffect on women's incomes, and job security in order to understand the impacts of the crisis. The second report looked at women's health, and the e/ffect of the crisis on their physical and mental wellbeing as well as their approach to healthcare.\n\n## HEALTH AND DISEASE PREVENTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, AXA's e/fforts, in place since 2016, to divest from and end insurance covers for the Tobacco industry (\u20ac1.8/uni00A0billion) have been o/fficially certified through the 'Tobacco Free Finance' stamp. This stamp attests AXA's strong commitment in the fight against tobacco\n\nthat generates more than 8/uni00A0million deaths per year, standing out as one of the leading causes of death in the world. AXA believes that supporting an industry which is the main cause of long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, is not compatible with our role as one of the world's largest health insurers.\n\nIn parallel, AXA entities have been designing digital, simple and a/ffordable inclusive health programs in order to reduce the protection gap among poor or vulnerable populations with regards to specific health risks. AXA China has been examining substandard risks, e.g. people traditionally excluded from insurance by addressing their protection gap. Another example is AXA Philippines which has rolled out an underwriting process covering substandard lives as part of their IPMI (International Private Medical Insurance) product (reinsured by AXA PPP).\n\n## INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND GROWTH\n\nAXA continues its involvement in several coalitions for a more inclusive economy.\n\nThe 'inclusive economy coalition' was launched in 2018/uni00A0by CEOs of 33/uni00A0major companies in France, including AXA's, to act in favor of a more inclusive economy. This collective commitment is one of the private sector's responses to the social vulnerabilities in France.\n\nIn 2020, the coalition has mobilized facing the sanitary crisis. AXA contributed through the donation of 795/uni00A0digital equipment to help those isolated during the coronavirus lockdown to reach out and keep in touch. 495/uni00A0laptops were donated to the Simplon Foundation for hospitals, nursing homes and facilities for disabled people, and a further 300/uni00A0laptops and desktops to the Emmaus Connect initiative for underprivileged children.\n\nIn addition, this coalition has continued its engagement on three themes: employment (apprenticeship, integration, training), more accessible products and services, and inclusive purchasing. With regards to employment and training, one of the main\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncommitments of the coalition was a 35% increase in the number of work-study students between 2018/uni00A0and 2020. At the start of the September school year, and further to AXA's participation in various employment events, AXA businesses in France welcomed more than 1,100/uni00A0work-study students. Finally, to meet the collective objective of +5/uni00A0million hours of training in 2019/uni00A0and 2020, AXA provided more than +55,000/uni00A0hours of training in 2020/uni00A0to all AXA employees in France despite COVID-19.\n\nThe working group on products and services focused on inclusive o/ffers proposed individually or in partnerships within the coalition members. AXA got involved with Renault and Total in a joint initiative to o/ffer training for driving license to young people for whom it's a prerequisite to access to employment or education (75-100/uni00A0targeted people). In 2020, the program has started despite sanitary constraints: several young individuals obtained their driving license.\n\nAt the international level, AXA continues to be strongly involved in the 'Business for Inclusive Growth' coalition. This OECD-led coalition of private companies contributes to fighting social inequalities by working closely with policymakers to advance inclusion at both the global and local levels. The initiative was launched at the 2019/uni00A0G7/uni00A0Summit whose theme was 'fighting inequalities of all types'. Since then, a 3-year-program, monitored through a Board of CEOs, has been implemented, covering the G7, the OECD and African countries. Its main deliverables being:\n\n- /uni25A0 a founding pledge signed in our head o/ffice on promoting equality of opportunities, eliminating gender disparities, reducing spatial inequalities;\n- /uni25A0 dedicated working groups gathering OECD experts, academia focused on developing inclusive projects;\n- /uni25A0 an international incubator hosted at the OECD with the objective of building inclusive business with real social and economic impacts.\n\nIn 2020, the incubator selected two projects supported by AXA; Insurance Net for Smallholders (INES) and Telemedicine in Mexico:\n\n- /uni25A0 INES, a joint initiative of AXA Emerging Customers, AXA Climate and L'Or\u00e9al, is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive risk protection package (health, climate and value-added services) to over 50k smallholder farmers and their families as part of L'Or\u00e9al Solidarity Sourcing programs. These farmers, who had no access to insurance and consequently were vulnerable to risk, will get a health insurance and a parametric climate insurance coverage. Overall, the project aims to improve farmer livelihoods, secure L'Or\u00e9al's sourcing network and increase supply-chain resilience;\n- /uni25A0 AXA's Telemedicine project intends to increase access to low-cost, remote primary healthcare services for vulnerable populations in Mexico through investment in the AXA Keralty primary healthcare network. The initiative stemming from the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic aims at providing safe, good quality and cost-e/ffective telemedicine services to mass-market and low-income customers, employees of local B4IG companies in Mexico Corporate philanthropy and engagement.",

As a result, AXA has developed and implemented various policies and initiatives that are aligned with its responsible corporate citizenship strategy.\n\n## COMMUNITY INVESTMENT\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, AXA strives to play a positive role in society, building a culture that promotes employee volunteering to support the communities in which AXA operates.\n\nIn 2020, AXA pursued the deployment of its philanthropic strategy aligned with the three Sustainability pillars (climate and the environment, health and disease prevention, social inequalities and inclusion) through its Corporate Philanthropy Committee governance body. With the Community Investment Guidelines, AXA entities are also encouraged to focus their philanthropic actions around these three pillars. In 2020, almost 88% of the \u20ac41.4/uni00A0million in donations made by the Group and entities (including the AXA Research Fund) were dedicated to projects relating to these three Sustainability pillars.\n\nWith COVID-19/uni00A0crisis, AXA has committed to support hospitals, medical research e/ffort and care for communities and vulnerable people. On the total donations made by the Group in 2020/uni00A067% have been dedicated to COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. Significant part of health and disease prevention in 2020/uni00A0has been related to COVID-19/uni00A0(approximately \u20ac27.9/uni00A0million). Medical research e/fforts have been supported by AXA mainly through the AXA Research Fund (refer to 'AXA Research Fund' paragraph below). To be noted that 2020/uni00A0was also marked by two humanitarian crises with an international impact: the massive fires in Australia (donation of \u20ac64K from AXA Group and AXA XL) and the blast in Beirut (\u20ac200K for emergency relief with the Red Cross).\n\n## Climate and the environment\n\nAXA's global partnership with WWF that was signed in 2019, has been pursued in 2020/uni00A0to address climate and biodiversity issues. Through this three-year program, WWF supports AXA in its e/fforts to ensure that natural capital is better taken into account in all of our activities (see Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and biodiversity'). In addition, the philanthropy component of this program contributes directly to the preservation of ecosystems in Mexico and New Caledonia.\n\nOther engagement for Climate and Biodiversity: AXA XL Ocean education program has already reached and educated 8.5/uni00A0million children to ocean protection since the start of the program. AXA Ocean Education increased its accessibility in 2020, translating into 6/uni00A0languages. Local expansion strategies were launched with 5/uni00A0AXA and AXA XL o/ffices.\n\nMany AXA entities concluded partnerships to impact positively the environment and fight against climate change (for example, among others, AXA Switzerland, AXA Mexico, AXA France\u2026).\n\n## Health and disease prevention\n\nAXA partnered for 3/uni00A0years starting in 2020/uni00A0with UNICEF on a program to respond to the global epidemic of overweight and obesity, working on early childhood eating habits in the Philippines and Brazil. To reach children aged from 0/uni00A0to 5, UNICEF acts on their immediate environment, namely mothers and the health and education professionals around them. Training, communication and advocacy activities with authorities have been implemented by local UNICEF teams despite COVID-19-19/uni00A0crisis. In 2020, approximately 63,000/uni00A0children and their mothers in the Philippines and approximately 7,000/uni00A0health and education professionals in Brazil have been supported (objective of the 3/uni00A0years program is respectively 177,000/uni00A0in the Philippines and 17,500 /uni00A0in Brazil).\n\nRisks' prevention is also a key component developed by AXA's entities in connection with our insurance business. France and Spain have continued their ambitious programs to prevent many health issues (focus on women, health at workplace, children's safety on internet\u2026). Risks related to road accidents are covered, in connection with our Motor insurance business. France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Mexico have developed awareness campaigns in this area, with an investment of approximately \u20ac2/uni00A0million.\n\n## Social inequalities and inclusion\n\nNumerous actions are being carried out to provide relief in the matter of 'Social Inequalities and Inclusion' by many Group entities, particularly through the AXA Hearts In Action volunteer program (see below). 56% of the volunteer activities o/ffered by AXA Hearts in Action and 14.6% of the sums paid out are focused on projects fighting inequality. Among others, AXA France is also supporting many institutions involved in protecting women that are victims of domestic violence and AXA Switzerland is supporting a program on intergenerational dialogue.\n\nAligned with its values of protecting and passing on heritage, AXA has been engaged in significant world heritage conservation actions. The end of 2019/uni00A0was highlighted by the acquisition of a national treasure for the Louvre Museum and renovation work at Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles (Madame Du Barry's apartments), in addition to solidarity commitments for Notre-Dame de Paris reconstruction. AXA entities, such as AXA France, AXA Spain, and AXA Mexico, are also involved in philanthropy actions, promoting access to heritage and culture for all (priority 'social inequalities and inclusion').\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Fund supports top-tier research projects and engages in dissemination e/fforts based on science to better inform decision-making.\n\nWith a global commitment of \u20ac250/uni00A0million since its launch in 2008, the AXA Research Fund has granted \u20ac161/uni00A0million to the funding of 665/uni00A0projects that explore solutions to global societal challenges in the areas of climate and environment, health, and socio-economic risk. The selection of research projects is overseen by an independent Scientific Board and based on excellence and innovation.\n\nIn 2020/uni00A0the AXA Research Fund (AXARF) focused on responding to the COVID-19/uni00A0global health crisis with a commitment of \u20ac5/uni00A0million. A first tranche was dedicated to partnerships with the Institut Pasteur, the APHP (Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris) and other innovative partners working towards ground-breaking solutions to the health crisis, to understand the new virus and develop diagnostic tests, equipment, vaccines and treatments. Ten AXA Awards were granted with a second tranche of funding to support research focused on the management of the pandemic and its fallouts, including the impact on mental health and vulnerable populations.\n\nIn the area of Climate and Environment, the AXA Chair on Natural Coastal Resilience Building at the University of Santa Cruz, California was selected for funding for a total of \u20ac1/uni00A0million over 5/uni00A0years.\n\nSocio-economic research was also further developed with the support of 7/uni00A0fellowships/uni00A0in the area of Inclusive Growth (\u20ac871K), exploring projects from the sustainability of livelihoods in urban informal economies, to circular economy in cities or the digitalization of money.\n\nBased on its strong research network, the AXARF carried out visible dissemination e/ff orts through continued media exposure of its grantees. To better inform decision making in a time of crisis, a COVID-19/uni00A0task force of Researchers came together around a series of webinars and a related publication, 'COVID-19, Confronting a global crisis', sharing perspectives on/uni00A0health, economic and environmental dimensions. Through AXARF webinars, publications and articles with partners such as The Conversation, researchers from all fields were able to shed more light on issues such as climate change, mental health, women in business, explainable AI for healthcare, cyber security and biodiversity conservation.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERING\n\nAXA Hearts in Action is the international volunteering program for AXA employees. In this framework, employees carry out activities on themes aligned with the 3/uni00A0pillars of our sustainability strategy. In 2020, in order to anchor the program even more strongly in the entities, an international sponsorship Committee has been set up.\n\nThe COVID-19/uni00A0crisis that marked the year 2020/uni00A0had a significant impact on employee volunteering (fewer people on site, restrictions on the organization of face-to-face group events). However, AXA entities showed creativity and employees remained mobilized and donated their time to help the patients, frontline healthcare workers and the most disadvantaged people through virtual operations. This crisis o/ffered new solidarity opportunities with for example the AXA solidarity response global challenge, organized for the benefit of 101/uni00A0Fund (an endowment fund which gathers 1200/uni00A0medical intensive care units in 60/uni00A0countries) and the French hospitals, which generated 11,637/uni00A0posts on social networks raising \u20ac369,631/uni00A0throughout the Group.\n\nIn 2020, more than 23,000/uni00A0employees (estimated/uni00A0- almost 39,000/uni00A0in 2019) donated their time and skills. Contributing entities in 2020/uni00A0represents 98% of AXA average FTEs.\n\nIn total, AXA employees carried out a wide variety of activities (1,903/uni00A0in total), about 35,700/uni00A0volunteering acts ( versus 81,200/uni00A0in 2019), which represents almost 228,000/uni00A0hours (284,000/uni00A0hours in 2019) during the year, while working on solidarity projects. A large majority of volunteer hours are performed during working hours (almost 200,000/uni00A0hours versus 240,000/uni00A0in 2019). Through the AXA Hearts in Action program, the Group seeks to promote all forms of employee engagement, particularly skills-based philanthropy. In 2020, AXA France continued to develop the 'AXA Exp\u00e9rience Solidaire' program: 147/uni00A0employees volunteered in partner associations (versus 110/uni00A0in 2019). In total, the salaries paid for the 155,000/uni00A0hours spent on these skills-based volunteering missions represent the equivalent of a donation of nearly \u20ac8.3/uni00A0million (versus \u20ac7.9/uni00A0million in 2019). These hours are included in the total number of volunteering hours (almost 73,000/uni00A0hours of volunteering were done outside 'AXA Exp\u00e9rience Solidaire'; among which about 44,000h volunteered during working hours).\n\nThe 2020/uni00A0edition of the CR week celebrated its 10 th /uni00A0anniversary. The activities were maintained but adapted with many in a virtual way. It was also the opportunity to launch our first international solidarity sports relay that saw the participation of 9,100/uni00A0employees worldwide, among which about 2,000/uni00A0from AXA Tianping. The estimated number of volunteers for the whole CR week 2020/uni00A0was 16,500/uni00A0for a total of 24,350/uni00A0hours given in 43/uni00A0countries.",

This commitment is designed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where AXA operates, to earn the continued trust of our clients, shareholders, employees and business partners, but also frequently extends beyond legal obligations on a range of topics about which AXA has strong convictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Business ethics\n\n## COMPLIANCE/uni00A0& ETHICS GUIDE\n\nAXA's Group Compliance/uni00A0& Ethics Code seeks to establish Groupwide rules and guidelines to ensure that AXA Group companies and employees have a common understanding of the compliance and ethical standards the Group requires. The Code covers a variety of matters, including specific rules concerning conflicts of interest, anti-bribery and corruption, insider trading, management of confidential information,/uni00A0etc. The Code is available on the Group's website (www.axa.com/en/newsroom/publications/ compliance-ethics-guide). In 2019, AXA launched an updated version of the AXA Group Compliance/uni00A0& Ethics Code. The updated Code includes some subjects that have become increasingly important in recent years; these include Health/uni00A0& Safety at work, Protection and Responsible use of Customer Data, Engagement with Social Media, Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment, and Fair and Professional Treatment of customers. The content and style of the Code has also been revised to make it more accessible and easier to reference.\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY/uni00A0& FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nTo prevent the risk of bribery and corruption, AXA Group has introduced a Group Anti-Bribery/uni00A0& Corruption Policy (ABC Policy) that establishes minimum standards for ABC that must be implemented by AXA entities. This policy has been regularly updated to take account of new regulations and most notably the French law known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II' n\u00b02016-1691/uni00A0of December/uni00A09, 2016, on transparency and the fight against corruption in modern economic life. A Group Anti-Bribery O/fficer is in charge of the global ABC program at Group level and to control its implementation across entities. AXA entities have designated local Anti-Bribery O/fficers to implement their ABC programs in accordance with AXA's Standards.\n\nAXA Standards certification by entities' CEOs includes a Section on the framework 'anti-bribery and fight against corruption'. AXA's objective is to achieve a consistent anti-bribery and fight against corruption program across the Group's entities, including necessary requirements answering to International Standards (including Sapin/uni00A0II Law), and preventing corruption risks. The entire scope of entities' CEOs has signed-o/ff  the AXA standards in 2019/uni00A0and in 2020.\n\n## BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nThe Group's insurance, banking and Asset Management operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives/uni00A0- in the European Union ( e.g. Insurance Distribution Directive, MiFID/uni00A0II, PRIIPs) but also in many other parts of the world/uni00A0- designed to increase customer protection in the financial services sector. AXA has taken significant actions to comply with these requirements in each of its businesses where such measures are in place and globally to spread and implement a customer protection culture across the Group. Moreover, AXA demonstrates strong commitment in its Compliance/uni00A0& Ethics Code binding for all its worldwide employees and subsidiaries to treat its customers fairly and professionally, in particular by encouraging transparency or being honest and accountable when promoting products and services.\n\nAmong the recent initiatives, a compliance program of customer protection reviews is in place which consists of reviewing how the entities locally manage the customer protection topics and the processes in place, especially with regard to customer information, sales practices or salesforce training. These reviews were initially focused on most of the European entities.\n\nI\n\n4",

The PAP is applicable to all entities of the AXA Group and focuses in particular on the customer dimension, ensuring the product is built starting from the customers' needs and expectations, with a definition of the target market and selection of adequate distribution channels. This formal process also considers that all new products entering into the scope of application of the PAP respect the principles of 'value for customer'. 100% of the entities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\npart of the AXA standards scope have signed the Group's standards, which engaged them to conduct PAP. In 2020, to the best of our knowledge, all Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health and Property/uni00A0& Casualty products have been subject to the AXA's Product Approval Process.\n\nIn addition, compliance risks, specifically business conduct risks, are assessed on an annual basis. The results and any necessary mitigation actions are developed and shared with senior management. Internal Control processes have been developed to ensure controls are e/ffective and cover entities' own operations and those of proprietary sales channels.\n\n## Responsible data use and data privacy\n\nIn line with AXA's sustainability risk assessment, the Group has put in place various initiatives to promote the use of data to address societal challenges, as well as to ensure client data is protected.\n\n## DATA PRIVACY\n\nAXA was the first insurance group to adopt privacy-related Binding Corporate Rules, approved by European data protection authorities, and constituting an internationally approved data privacy contractual framework for the treatment of customer, employee and other stakeholder personal data. Entities that have joined Binding Corporate Rules represent 99% of AXA's revenues in 2020. These rules and AXA's Data Privacy Declaration, whereby the Group undertakes not to sell personal data of its customers, are available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/ about-us/our-commitments).\n\nThe AXA Group was committed to implementing the General Data Protection Regulation and had in this respect delivered thirty projects dedicated to data privacy, involving over three hundred people in entities located in sixteen countries. The Group is also implementing similar regulations recently adopted in countries outside the European Union.\n\nWith the massive digitalization of society, cyber risk is considered today as one of the top risks that citizens and companies must face.\n\nTo answer to this threat, and as responsible insurer, AXA has developed a risk-based security strategy that strengthens our business resilience, transforming security from a necessity to an advantage for our entities. Security is managed holistically by the corporate function, Group Security. It gathers the 3/uni00A0security key disciplines: Information Security, Operational Resilience and Physical Security/uni00A0& Safety.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThis converged organization to manage security comes with an ambitious commitment to maintain AXA most mature entities as part of the first quartile of the most secure companies in the financial industry. Therefore, yearly, the security and cybersecurity maturity level of these entities is assessed, based notably on the ISO/uni00A0270001/uni00A0norms. In 2020, AXA has reached a 3.17/uni00A0score, beyond the 3.00/uni00A0average that leads to the first quartile of the most secure companies in the industry.\n\nThis robust security maturity level is also reached by the strong mobilization of AXA's employees that are considered as AXA's first line of defense against cyberattacks. Yearly security and cybersecurity trainings are deployed across group. Thus, in 2020, 100% of salaried and non-salaried employees have been trained and certified (approximately 110,000/uni00A0employees).\n\n## RESPONSIBLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nAXA is one of the founding member of the French association Impact AI (Artificial Intelligence). Impact AI is a 'think and do tank' composed of companies, consulting firms, startups, schools and actors working on Responsible AI with 5/uni00A0programs of actions, such as analyzing the perception of AI and the development of a 'trusted AI', sharing tools for a responsible use of AI, helping people adapt to the digital era, and creating partnerships to foster responsible AI among all types of actors (companies, schools, associations,/uni00A0etc.).",

These common measures do not prevent, or restrict AXA from voluntarily taking additional actions in relation to such matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Identification and evaluation of risks to human rights and/uni202Fthe environment\n\nTo ensure that each potential risk identified is covered by a Group policy, AXA conducted an analysis to assess how the AXA Group's activities and operations may potentially impact the environment and human rights.\n\nThe work carried out by AXA to establish its mapping of corporate responsibility risks, as well as the main non-financial risks identified by the Group is presented in Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability Risk Assessment' and in Section/uni00A04.3 ' Climate change and Biodiversity/uni00A0- Investments/uni00A0- Responsible Investment strategy'  of this Annual Report.\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe AXA Group considers that its activities could have potential direct and indirect impacts on the human rights of its employees, customers and suppliers, as well as potential indirect impacts on the human rights of other persons through the Group's (i)/uni00A0relations with corporate customers or (ii)/uni00A0investments in companies, which are active in sectors and/or countries with increased risks of human rights violations.\n\nConsequently, the AXA Group regularly, and at least every three years, conducts a human rights risk assessment which aims to identify the most relevant risks to human rights that the AXA Group should consider in conducting  its business (acting both as an insurer and as an investor). The most recent study was carried out in 2020, with the help of an independent firm, and identified risks in areas such as right to free movement, equality before the law and non-discrimination (with respect to minorities), freedom from all forms of forced or compulsory labour, right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, information and expression and the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. This assessment ('AXA 2020/uni00A0Report Human Rights Risk Assessment') which includes the mapping of the risks identified and the measures taken to limit their impact, is available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/aboutus/our-commitment-to-human rights.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nof this vigilance plan during the financial year 2020/uni00A0which is included in this Section.

AXA's direct operations, focused on financial services, do not generate major impacts on the environment. As a result, AXA's environmental reporting and management processes focus on energy, water and paper consumption, as well as related CO 2 /uni00A0 emissions. AXA's global environmental reporting process, which is verified by an independent third-party, allows AXA to (i)/uni00A0evaluate its impact on the environment each year and (ii)/uni00A0identify the risks stemming from its activities for the environment.

AXA applies a minimum threshold below which companies are excluded from its contemplated investments;\n\n- /uni25A0 as a business partner, AXA has implemented processes to identify and assess the risk of human rights violations and environmental risks associated with its use of suppliers and service providers. In particular, AXA implemented an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk assessment process for its suppliers, that are identified using an internal risk categorization grid. This assessment is carried out based on procurement categories in light of five criteria (environmental, social, impact on products and services, suppliers' supply chain and business integrity). Each year, suppliers in the highest ESG risk categories are invited to share their DJSI or EcoVadis scores, or undergo an EcoVadis assessment.\n\n## Protection of Human Rights and the Environment\n\n## PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND/uni202FHUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\n\nAXA's human rights policy, available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/our-commitment-to-humanrights), aims at preventing the violation of human rights and reflects AXA's commitment to international general and sectorspecific standards. The AXA Group is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights principles as defined by the (i)/uni00A0United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, (ii)/uni00A0core standards of the ILO and (iii)/uni00A0Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (implementation of the United Nations 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' Framework or 'Ruggie Principles'). AXA's human rights policy describes the Group's commitments as an employer, a responsible business partner, an insurer and an investor. It also indicates as well as how the protection of human rights is implemented at the core of the Group's activities.\n\n## Protection of employee human rights\n\nAXA is committed to protecting AXA employees' human rights, specifically the principles of freedom of association, the right to fair and favourable working conditions and non-discrimination, through:\n\n- /uni25A0 promoting the 10/uni00A0guiding principles of the United Nations Global Compact (with principles 1/uni00A0& 2/uni00A0relating to human rights and principles 3/uni00A0to 6/uni00A0to labour standards) and encouraging the reporting of potential or actual severe violations of human rights;\n- /uni25A0 setting ambitious Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) targets and initiatives.

The identity of the author of such alert is treated in a confidential manner and cannot be disclosed without his/her consent (except to judicial authorities).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntobacco, coal, oil sands, palm oil production and so/f\\_t  commodity derivatives), and entities are required to annually certify their compliance therewith.\n\nMoreover, AXA has decided to align its investments with the Paris Agreement, committing to reach a 'warming potential' of 1.5\u00b0C by 2050.\n\nPlease refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and Biodiversity/uni00A0Investments' of this Annual Report for detailed information about AXA's responsible investment governance, policy, targets and results.\n\nAXA has expressly stated that there will be no act of retaliation against anyone who reports actual or suspected misconduct in good faith, or who participated in establishing the facts confirming a misconduct by providing evidence.\n\nFurthermore, all AXA Group companies are required to define internal regulations and other policies governing whistleblowing pursuant to local laws and regulations. In 2019, a global communication campaign, 'Speak-up', was launched to refresh employee awareness of both the local and Group alert procedures. The purpose of the campaign was to strengthen, increase consistency of, and simplify the process across the Group. Various media were used to broadcast this campaign, thus increasing its impact and making it available to all, including through newsletters, screen savers, videos, training, formal presentation,/uni00A0etc.\n\n## Follow-up and report on the e/ffective implementation of/uni202Fthe vigilance plan\n\nIn 2020, the AXA Group ensured the e/ffective implementation of all policies and procedures described in the vigilance plan through the involvement of (i)/uni00A0central teams from the Corporate Responsibility, Procurement, Legal, Compliance, Risk Management and Human Resources Departments and (ii)/uni00A0a network of local correspondents.\n\n## REPORTING PROCESS\n\nIn 2020, the Group continued its e/fforts to raise awareness on the vigilance plan amongst its entities. Awareness sessions were\n\norganized in order to remind entities of the duty of care (devoir de vigilance) regulation, as well as the penalties applicable in the event of non-compliance with legal obligations. Correspondents of the Procurement and Corporate Responsibility networks attended these sessions in 2020.\n\nIn addition, AXA relies on a reporting process for Group entities which is based on pre-existing procedures and monitoring tools and, in particular, on an internal review conducted by the Corporate Responsibility Department. In 2020, the principal operating entities were asked to conduct an internal risk assessment to identify any gaps with the vigilance plan.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This alignment means that AXA has included corporate responsibility matters in the process of selecting and monitoring its business partners. This approach focuses on two areas:\n\n- /uni25A0 responsible people/uni00A0& processes: all of the AXA employees working in a Procurement Department, must not only adhere to the Group's Code of Professional Conduct, but also sign a dedicated and reinforced Code of Ethics, which promotes fairness and neutrality, confidentiality and transparency in procurement decisions. Information on AXA's corporate responsibility strategy and the AXA Responsible Procurement policy is also provided to these employees through awareness sessions conducted by the network of Responsible Procurement identified in various AXA entities; and\n- /uni25A0 responsible vendors: AXA requires its vendors to include a 'corporate responsibility clause', which is mandatory in its contracts. This clause provides for, in particular, compliance with ILO principles (prohibiting the resort to child/forced labor, promoting employee health/uni00A0& safety, freedom of speech, and non-discrimination). 96.6% of the procurement contracts entered into or renewed in 2020/uni00A0included this corporate responsibility clause.\n\nIn addition, AXA regularly evaluates its suppliers, which are identified using an internal risk categorization grid. Suppliers in the highest risk categories are invited to share their DJSI or\n\nI\n\nI\n\nEcoVadis scores or, in certain cases, to undergo an EcoVadis assessment. 67.2% of the vendors evaluated in 2020/uni00A0disclosed to AXA a Bronze EcoVadis score or higher. Following this assessment, the Group noted that a very limited number of its main suppliers had been identified as deficient, and all such suppliers have been sent a corrective action plan by EcoVadis; it being specified that AXA teams have access to such corrective action plan through the platform. The main suppliers of the AXA Group panel can be evaluated by EcoVadis every two years.\n\nDetailed information on responsible procurement policy and standards is provided in AXA's Group Procurement Guidelines. The document is used for vendor selection and management purposes.\n\nSince 2018, AXA has been relying on a dedicated Vendor Risk program to reinforce its operational control and Risk Management of third parties. Please refer to Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational risk' of this Annual Report for further information on this program.\n\nThe AXA Group continues to abide by its commitment to implement the same principles as well and received a 'Platinum' score in its latest EcoVadis evaluation.\n\n## INVOLVEMENT OF AXA STAKEHOLDERS\n\nIn line with its strong culture of dialogue, AXA has regular discussions with its various stakeholders at di/fferent levels. Please refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability Strategy/uni00A0-  Sustainability Governance/uni00A0& Stakeholder Dialogue' of this Annual Report for further details about the stakeholder dialogue initiated by AXA.\n\nIn order to maintain e/ffective communication between employees and Management as well as a constructive social dialogue, the vigilance plan was presented on several occasions to employee representatives. Through discussions with the Group's French employee representatives and more particularly with the Social Committee of the French Group's Works Council, certain provisions of the vigilance plan have been placed at the core of the employeremployee dialogue.\n\nThe AXA Group strives to strengthen the communication of its vigilance plan to all of it stakeholders, in particular by making it available on AXA's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/ourcommitment-to-human-rights).",

For avoidance of doubt, references to 'insurance', '(re)insurance', 'Property/uni00A0& Casualty' and 'Life/uni00A0& Savings' in this Section also refer to 'Health' activities as appropriate.\n\nIn presenting the risks set forth in this Section/uni00A05.1, Management has identified the primary categories of risk and the most material risks in a manner that corresponds to M anagement's current view as to the materiality of such risk factors for the AXA Group, based on the perceived likelihood of the occurrence of such risks and the expected magnitude of their negative impact. As more fully described below, such categories include market-related risks, credit- and liquidity-related risks, pricing- and underwritingrelated risks, operational risks, regulatory-related risks and risks related to the ownership of the Company's shares. Further, there can be no assurance that Management's assessment of the relative importance of such risk factors may not change over time, whether to reflect new information, events, circumstances or otherwise.\n\nand economic conditions generally.

The spread of this pandemic has led globally governmental authorities to impose quarantines and lockdown measures, business restrictions, travel limitations and other social-distancing measures of varying scope, and has led to major disruptions in global trade and supply chains more broadly, which have significantly reduced economic activity. While the pandemic has had and will most likely continue to have an adverse e/ffect on financial markets and global economic conditions, significant uncertainties as to the duration and extent of the pandemic make its overall impact di/fficult to predict, both at local and global levels. The extent to which the economic consequences of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis will continue to a/ffect the Group's results of operations and financial condition will depend on a number of factors, including the suitability and e/ffectiveness of mitigating and support measures introduced, in particular, by governments ( e.g. governmentguaranteed loan facility programs, tax deferrals, facilitated recourse to part-time working) and central banks, as well as the timing and e/fficacy of COVID-related vaccination programs.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition, specific concerns regarding the Eurozone, including the financial condition of certain EU sovereign debt issuers, uncertainty regarding membership in the European Union, relationships between European institutions and certain Member States, potential structural reforms or other changes made to the Euro, the Eurozone or the European Union, have resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets in recent years and could have similar e/ffects in the future. In particular, the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in accordance with Article/uni00A050/uni00A0of the Treaty on European Union, on March/uni00A029, 2017/uni00A0('Brexit'), and the resulting negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union to reach a withdrawal agreement, which entered into force on January/uni00A031, 2020/uni00A0(the 'Withdrawal Agreement'), have materially impacted financial markets and macroeconomic conditions. Since Brexit became e/ff ective on January/uni00A01, 2021, the terms of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union have been set forth in both (i)/uni00A0the Withdrawal Agreement and (ii)/uni00A0the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement applicable since January/uni00A01, 2021/uni00A0(the 'TCA').\n\nAlthough the TCA provides for free trade in goods between the United Kingdom and the European Union, it contains only very limited provisions regarding financial services, so that it remains unclear what the exact terms of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will be regarding access to each other's financial markets and cross-border financial services generally. The ongoing negotiations could have unpredictable e/ffects on financial markets and, depending on their outcome, adversely impact firms providing cross-border financial services. While the Group actively follows Brexit-related developments, there can be no assurance that Brexit and its related consequences will not have an adverse e/ffect on the Group's business and financial condition.\n\nThese factors and others have had and will likely continue to have an adverse e/ffect on our revenues and results of operations, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. Our investment income is an important part of our profitability, and our sales of insurance and Asset Management products (as well as the level of product surrenders and lapses) are dependent upon financial market performance, customer behavior and confidence as well as other related factors. Our ability to make a profit on insurance and investment products, for example, depends in part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under those products, and the value of specific investments may fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions. In addition, certain types of insurance and investment products that we o/ffer expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in financial markets, including certain types of interest-sensitive or variable products such as guaranteed annuities or variable annuities, which have crediting or other guaranteed rates or guaranteed minimum benefits not necessarily\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Although we use hedging techniques to help mitigate our exposure under certain of these guarantees, not all risks can be e/ff ectively hedged against and volatility in the financial markets, combined with unanticipated policyholder behavior and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis, may increase our cost of risk and/or negatively a/ffect our ability to hedge against certain of these risks, which may in turn adversely a/ffect our profitability.\n\nMore generally, to the extent the economic environment in the jurisdictions in which we do business may become characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely a/ffected. In addition, in such circumstances, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders on certain types of policies or funds, lower surrender rates than anticipated on other types of products, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. The probability and magnitude of these risks have increased due to the sharp contraction in global economic activity caused by the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. These developments could accordingly have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely a/ffect our business, results of operations, solvency and financial condition\n\nOur exposure to interest-rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may negatively a/ffect the value of our assets (particularly fixed-income investments) and our ability to realize gains or avoid losses from the sale of those assets, all of which also ultimately a/ffect earnings. In particular, negative interest rates and low levels of interest rates generally, such as those experienced in recent years, have and may continue to negatively impact our net interest income and the profitability of our Life/uni00A0& Savings business, especially as the impact of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic and related governmental measures has generally been to extend such downward trend in interest rates, through US, EU and other central bank actions.\n\nIn-force life insurance and annuity products may become comparatively more attractive to customers in a declining interest-rate environment, resulting in an increase in our liabilities (in particular in relation to flexible-premium products), assetliability duration mismatches (as more policies and contracts remain in-force from year-to-year) and an increase in provisions for guarantees included in life insurance and annuity products.\n\nsu/ff er as the result of a decrease in the spread between interest rates credited to insurance policyholders and annuity contract owners and the rates we are able to earn on our fixed-income investment portfolio. In addition, certain regulatory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas and models that consider interest rates, such as the Group's Internal Model, and an extended period of low interest rates may increase the regulatory capital we are required to hold and the amount of assets we must maintain to support our reserves, while decreasing the amount of our Eligible Own Funds ('EOF'), which could have an adverse impact on our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio.\n\nConversely, in periods of increasing interest rates, the estimated fair value of certain of our fixed-income investments may decrease, which could negatively impact our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio and net income; surrenders of life insurance policies and fixed annuity contracts may accelerate, as policyholders seek higher returns, which may cause us to accelerate amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or to liquidate fixed maturity investments in order to obtain liquidity to satisfy such obligations, which may result in realized investment losses; our fee income may decrease due to a decline in the value of our asset managers' fixed-income assets under management, which could result in lower management fees and have an adverse impact on Asset Management net inflows. In addition, we may be required, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities, debt and bank facilities, which may increase our interest expenses.\n\nFor a description of the sensitivity of our EOF to changes in interest rates, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0- Note/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Market risks (including sensitivity analysis)'  of this Annual Report. For  additional  information  on  the  sensitivity  of  our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to financial shocks on interest rates, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nOur exposure to changes in credit spreads primarily relates to the impact of such changes on market prices and cash flow variability. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of fixed-income securities we hold (including credit derivatives where we assume credit exposure) and increase our investment income associated with purchases of new fixedincome securities in our investment portfolios; and, as issuer, we may face increased interest expenses. Conversely, credit spread tightening will generally increase the value of fixed-income securities we hold and reduce our investment income associated with new purchases of fixed-income securities in our investment portfolios. For additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to financial shocks on corporate bond spreads, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com) (1) .\n\nAccordingly, during a period of declining interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates, our profitability may\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "Although we take measures, including hedging through derivative instruments, to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest-rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Accordingly, ongoing volatility in interest rates and credit spreads, individually or in tandem with other factors, could have a material adverse e/ffect on our solvency position, and on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized gains and loss positions.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly a/ffect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and solvency\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of our business, we are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion of our shareholdings and investments, revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than Euro, while our Consolidated Financial Statements are established in Euro. Likewise, the part of our debt and other obligations denominated in currencies other than Euro is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWhile we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through hedging, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a significant impact on our Euro-denominated results of operations, cash flows, gearing ratio, shareholders' equity and solvency. In addition, the currency hedges we use to manage foreign exchange rate risk may in themselves impact our cash and liquidity position.\n\n## Inflation or deflation in our principal markets would have multiple impacts on the Group and/uni00A0may negatively a/ffect our business, solvency position and results of operations\n\nWe are subject to inflation risk in certain of our principal markets, especially in Europe, through our holdings of fixed interest rate and other instruments, and as a result of the potential for claim payments and expenses to rise faster than anticipated in our reserving and pricing assumptions.\n\nIn particular, inflation in relation to medical costs, construction costs and tort issues impacts the Property/uni00A0& Casualty industry. The impact of inflation on claim costs could be more pronounced for those Property/uni00A0& Casualty lines of business that are considered 'long tail', such as general liability, workers' compensation and professional liability, and other specialty lines of our AXA XL business, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. Changes in the level of inflation could also result in an increased level of\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nuncertainty in our estimation of claims reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business.\n\nWe are also subject to deflation risk, which has materialized in the Eurozone in recent years and, in particular, during the fourth quarter of 2020. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of certain investment assets, and may negatively impact customer behavior or otherwise negatively a/ffect our business and results of operations.\n\n## Adverse business and market conditions, as well as accounting rules, may impact the recoverability of goodwill, amortization of intangibles and/or reduce deferred tax assets and deferred policyholders' participation assets, which could materially a/ffect our results of operations and/uni00A0financial position\n\nBusiness and market conditions as well as accounting rules may impact the amount of goodwill we carry in our consolidated balance sheet, our pattern of Deferred Acquisition Costs ('DAC'), Value of Business In-Force ('VBI') and other intangible assets amortization and the value of our deferred tax assets and deferred participation assets. The value of certain of our businesses is significantly impacted by such factors as the state of the financial markets, particularly equity markets, and ongoing operating performance.\n\n## Adverse experience relative to the methodologies, estimations and assumptions used by M anagement in valuing investments and determining allowances and impairments may materially adversely a/ffect our results of operations\n\nCertain of our invested assets, for which there is no active trading market or other observable market data, are valued using models and methodologies that involve estimates, assumptions and significant M anagement judgment. During periods of market disruption, a larger portion of our investment assets may be valued using these models and methodologies as a result of less frequent trading or less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes that were previously actively traded in liquid markets. There can be no assurance that our valuations on the basis of these models and methodologies represent, for example, the price for which a security may ultimately be sold or sold at any specific point in time. In addition, the valuations of certain assets may be adversely a/ffected by external factors and developments that were not systematically taken into account in earlier models and methodologies, such as climate-related transition risks, which may cause the market and prices for\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

For further information on our climate-related transition risk analysis, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and biodiversity/uni00A0- Investments' of this Annual Report. The choice of models, methodologies and/ or assumptions may have a material impact on the estimated fair value amounts and could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments that we recognize with respect to the invested assets we hold varies by investment type, and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. In considering impairments, M anagement considers a wide range of factors, including those described in Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0Note/uni00A01.8.2/uni00A0'Financial instruments classification'  of this Annual Report, and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the investment assets and the prospects for near-term recovery. For certain asset classes, particularly debt instruments, management's evaluation involves a variety of assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer of the instrument and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance, however, that M anagement has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements, especially in light of uncertainties surrounding the impacts of systemic risks, such as those relating to the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, and the need for and timing of any additional impairments and/or allowances may have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ffect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital\n\nIn recent years, the capital and credit markets have at times experienced high levels of volatility and disruption which, during certain periods, have significantly limited the availability of additional liquidity in the markets and credit capacity for most issuers, including the AXA Group.\n\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses (including claims and surrenders), dividends and interests on our debts and to refinance certain maturing debts and other liabilities. In addition, we need liquidity in connection with derivatives transactions to which we are party which require us to transfer\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncash collateral and/or subject us to margin calls in certain circumstances. The availability of additional financing to supplement internal liquidity resources will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. While M anagement has put in place a liquidity r isk m anagement framework that includes active monitoring of the Group's liquidity position and contingency plans for accessing liquidity, liquidity constraints over a prolonged period may have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\n\n## Downgrades in our insurer and reinsurer financial strength and credit ratings could adversely impact our competitive position and damage our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties\n\nInsurer (and reinsurer) financial strength and credit ratings are important factors used by the market and customers in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies and in assessing our claims-paying ability. Rating agencies review their ratings and rating criteria and methodologies on a recurring basis, and they may change or withdraw their ratings at any time, based on relevant factors that may not be entirely within our control and/or a/ffect the insurance and reinsurance industry generally. In particular, several credit rating agencies have recently indicated that the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis had led to a risk of a ratings downgrade for the insurance sector. Consequently, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future and no undue reliance should be placed on such ratings, which should not be considered as recommendations to purchase, sell or hold any securities we have issued.\n\nA downgrade or the potential for a downgrade in our ratings could have an adverse e/ffect on us, including (i)/uni00A0damaging our competitive position, (ii)/uni00A0negatively impacting our ability to underwrite new insurance policies, (iii)/uni00A0increasing the levels of surrenders and termination rates of our in-force policies, (iv)/uni00A0increasing our reinsurance costs, (v)/uni00A0triggering termination provisions or collateral delivery requirements, or requiring us to return unearned premiums to cedants, under certain of our reinsurance and retrocessional agreements, (vi)/uni00A0negatively impacting our ability to obtain financing and/or increasing our cost of financing, (vii)/uni00A0harming our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties and/or (viii)/uni00A0adversely a/ff ecting public confidence in us.

Such third parties include private sector and government (or governmentbacked) issuers whose securities we hold in our investment portfolios  (including  mortgage-backed,  asset-backed, government bonds and other types of securities), borrowers under mortgages and other loans that we extend, reinsurers and capital market counterparties to which we have ceded (directly or indirectly) our insurance risks, customers, ceding companies, service providers, partners, trading counterparties, counterparties under swap and other derivative contracts, and other counterparties including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, other investment funds, clearing agents and market exchanges. We may also have exposures to such counterparties under insurance policies that we have written, including in respect of D&O, surety and similar coverages. Moreover, we are exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain policies we write that provide coverage to our policyholders for their credit risk exposures to third parties.\n\nUnder our reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements (including similar protection afforded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets), other insurers, reinsurers or capital market counterparties assume a portion of the losses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nand related expenses under policies we issue, although we remain liable as the direct (re)insurer on all risks reinsured. While we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers, retrocessionaires and capital market counterparties to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer/ retrocessionaire/capital market counterparty insolvencies, such counterparties may become financially unsound by the time their financial obligations to us become due and force us to recapture the reinsured or retroceded business. For information on the ratings of our reinsurers, please refer to Section/uni00A05.4/uni00A0'Credit riskRisk control and risk mitigation/uni00A0- Receivables from reinsurers: rating processes and factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nOur exposure to our counterparties may also be adversely impacted by the negative consequences of the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis on the financial condition of such counterparties. In particular, moratorium measures have been implemented by governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions, which limit the ability of creditors to enforce debts and, combined with governmental support measures (such as state-guaranteed loan facilities), may delay the opening of insolvency proceedings with respect to certain debtors. In the event that these moratorium and support measures were to be terminated, there may be a significant increase in defaults or debt restructuring, which may in turn have an adverse impact on the Group's counterparties, and the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThere can be no assurance that defaults by the foregoing or other counterparties would not materially and adversely a/ff ect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks related to the Company and its business\n\n## PRICING AND UNDERWRITING-RELATED/uni00A0RISKS\n\n## Adverse experience relative to\n\nthe/uni00A0assumptions and judgment used in setting reserves, developing and pricing products and calculating industry measures of value may significantly a/ffect our results of operations or/uni00A0performance indicators, which may have an adverse impact on the price of our securities\n\nThe profitability of our businesses largely depends on a variety of factors including social, economic and demographic trends (including, in the life insurance business, mortality and morbidity trends), policyholder behavior (including surrender and persistency rates), court decisions, changes in laws and\n\nregulations, inflation, investment returns and underwriting expenses. We make assumptions about these factors in estimating our risk exposures, determining the pricing of our products, establishing (re)insurance and employee benefits reserves and reporting capital levels and business results (using such industry measures of value as NBV or European Embedded Value ('EEV')). These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting), using both proprietary and third-party models, data analytics and related analyses. Model outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis (including availability, use, accuracy and relevance of historical, internal and industry data) and incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about market conditions (such as interest rates, inflation and currency exchange rates), capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, and policyholder behavior.

Adverse experience relative to such assumptions, in particular in the COVID-19/uni00A0context, use of and reliance on inaccurate or incomplete models, or inherent product defects may result in an increase in the pricing of our insurance products or the need for us to strengthen our product reserves, which may in turn have an adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition, or lead to litigation.\n\nIn our Property/uni00A0& Casualty business, we establish reserves for claims (either reported or unreported) and claims expenses in accordance with industry practices and accounting, actuarial and regulatory requirements. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, actuarial experience on past events, legal liability and other factors. In particular, as reserves are booked net of reinsurance, their amount is also determined based on assumptions as to the availability of reinsurance/ retrocession coverage and the applicability of such coverage to potential losses, including, for example , with respect to our ability to aggregate those losses in accordance with the relevant policy terms. While we continually review the adequacy of our claims reserves, because the establishment of claims reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving numerous estimates, including the impacts of any regulatory and legislative changes, court interpretations, medical condition of claimants, emerging trends and theories of liability, including with respect to environmental, medical and products liability exposures, and changes in economic conditions (including inflation changes and discount rates used for evaluation of settlements), there can be no assurance that ultimate losses will not materially exceed our claims reserves and have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations. The impact of certain of these factors, such as social inflation, particularly in the US (increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards and settlement expectations), as well as mass tort claims related to exposure to harmful products or substances ( e.g. asbestos, opioids, talc, glyphosate, lead paint), on our estimation of claims reserves and ultimate costs for claims is di/fficult to assess and could be material. Our estimation may also be more di/fficult during times of adverse economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn our Life/uni00A0& Savings business, our earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting the prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for obligations for technical provisions and claims. In certain cases, product features such as minimum guarantees or options to swap between underlying funds in certain savings products may with time result in higher realized losses than anticipated in initial assumptions. In particular, assessing the impact of minimum guarantees which are contained within certain of our Life/uni00A0& Savings products and the adequacy test performed on the reserves for life policies (which encompasses the recoverability of DAC, VBI and deferred policyholder participation assets) involve a significant degree of management judgment. While we use both our own experience and industry data to develop products and to estimate future policy benefits, including information used in pricing the insurance products and establishing the related actuarial liabilities, there can be no assurance that actual experience will match these estimates and that systemic risks, such as those relating to the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, would not result in loss experience inconsistent with our pricing and reserve assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, while our NBV and EEV calculations are done on a market consistent basis, changes in assumptions used in calculating these measures may have a material adverse e/ff ect on the level of our NBV and/or EEV. For example, our NBV is sensitive to interest rate movements and, consequently, an adverse evolution of interest rates relative to our assumptions may have a significant impact on our NBV and a corresponding impact on the trading price of our securities.\n\n## The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changing weather patterns, diseases and climatic conditions, and systemic risks, could adversely a/ffect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n\nCatastrophic events are inherently unpredictable. Our exposure to natural and man-made disasters depends on various factors and is often more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major urban centers, with a high concentration of customers, employees and/or insured property and assets. AXA XL, our commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty (re)insurance and specialty risk division has operations in North and Latin America, Europe, Lloyd's and Asia-Pacific, which are significantly exposed to natural and man-made catastrophes.

We monitor the evolution of these risks closely and generally seek to manage our exposure to them through individual risk selection, modelling and monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulation, purchase of third-party reinsurance and risk transfer transactions to capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to adequately anticipate such evolution, as a single catastrophic event, an accumulation of losses resulting from several events or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period may affect multiple geographic areas and lines of business, and the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates. Accounting principles and rules preventing (re)insurers to reserve for catastrophic events until they occur may also augment the impact of such events.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events may also result in an increase of our reinsurance/retrocession for own account and limit or prevent us from obtaining adequate types and amounts of reinsurance/retrocession (or entering into adequate risk transfer transactions to capital markets) for certain risks or Regions. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain appropriate reinsurance/retrocession coverage with respect to exposures to certain systemic risks, which may result in an increase of our net exposures to such risks or require us to decrease our relevant underwriting commitments. While we seek to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events, through diversification and incremental reinsurance, we have experienced and could in the future experience material losses from these types of risks, which may exceed our reinsurance and retrocessional protection (or similar protection a/fforded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets) or such protection may otherwise be inadequate\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nto protect us against losses or uncollectible reinsurance when due. In particular, we may enter into risk transfer transactions to capital markets that o/ffer reinsurance protection based on an industry loss index rather than on our actual incurred losses, which may result in our residual losses not being covered to the extent they are not fully correlated with the relevant share of the related industry loss.\n\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, including as a result of climate change, have added to the unpredictability of natural disasters and to the frequency and severity thereof and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. In particular, the consequences of climate change might significantly impact the insurance and reinsurance industry, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, and the need for new insurance products, all of which may create unforeseen risks and costs not currently known to us.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19/uni00A0crisis illustrates the significant systemic risk posed by pandemics and other systemic risks, as well as the governmental measures implemented to address the crisis they cause. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives implemented, and court decisions rendered, following major catastrophes may adversely impact our results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, in particular where they seek to expand the intended scope of coverage for catastrophe-related claims beyond policy terms, including through policyholder-friendly or otherwise broad interpretation of policy wording or retroactive extension of policy coverage.\n\nAXA continues to closely monitor the Group's exposure to the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic (including its various mutated variants) and its wide-ranging consequences, including on (i)/uni00A0the extent of claims litigation and insurance coverage impacted (in particular in Property/uni00A0& Casualty business lines); (ii)/uni00A0the impact of potential renewed localized or more generalized lockdown measures, travel limitations and business restrictions on the Group's operations and activities; (iii)/uni00A0regulatory, litigationrelated or legislative developments aimed at expanding the intended scope of coverages beyond policy terms, exclusions and other conditions; (iv)/uni00A0financial market volatility, changes in asset prices and overall financial conditions (including interest rates and corporate spreads), and consequential impacts on our investment portfolio; and (v)/uni00A0macroeconomic conditions and the flow of people, goods and services.

Changes in customer expectations for appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events, including losses incurred by our ceding insurers and reinsurers, the hardening of the reinsurance market or other factors a/ff ecting the Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance business may have an adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our risk management programs may be inadequate to protect us against the full extent of the exposure or losses we seek to mitigate and may leave us exposed to unidentified, unanticipated or incorrectly quantified risks that could result in significant losses\n\nWe employ a range of risk-mitigation strategies, including reinsurance for own account and capital markets solutions (such as catastrophe bonds), in order to avoid or limit losses and liabilities. The failure of any of our Risk Management strategies could result in significant losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWith respect to reinsurance, the ongoing COVID-19/uni00A0crisis is an illustration of the uncertainty surrounding the availability of reinsurance/retrocession coverage for losses relating to significant systemic risks. For instance, coverage for COVID-19related losses (such as business interruption losses) may be more di/ff icult to obtain, as our reinsurers may challenge the applicability of coverage to these losses or seek to reduce our ability to aggregate these losses in accordance with policy terms, which may adversely impact the amount of reinsurance recovery available to us in respect of these losses. Furthermore, we may\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbe unable to renew our reinsurance arrangements on terms similar to those applicable prior to the COVID-19/uni00A0outbreak or obtain appropriate new reinsurance coverages with respect to certain exposures under our policies, including COVID-19-related exposures.\n\nWe use derivatives (including equity futures, treasury bond futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions and equity options) to hedge certain, but not all, risks under guarantees provided to our clients or stemming from our assets.\n\nIn certain cases, however, we may not be able to apply these techniques to e/ffectively hedge our risks as intended or expected or may choose not to hedge certain risks because the derivative markets in question may not be of su/fficient size or liquidity, the cost of hedging may be too expensive (as a result of adverse market conditions or otherwise), the nature of the risk itself may limit our ability to e/ffectively hedge or for other reasons. This may result in higher realized losses and unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle transactions. Hedging counterparties may also fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralized.\n\nFurthermore, the operation of our hedging program is based on models involving numerous estimates and management judgments, including, among others, mortality, lapse rates, election rates, volatility and interest rates, and correlation among various market movements. These models or their underlying estimates and assumptions could prove inadequate for certain market environments, especially when financial markets experience high volatility, for instance as a result of unprecedented shocks like the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic and related governmental actions, such as the lockdown measures implemented in various jurisdictions. Our hedging program may change over time and there can be no assurance that actual experience will not di/ffer materially from our assumptions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## Inadequate or failed processes, controls or systems, human factors or external events may adversely a/ffect our profitability, reputation or operational e/ff ectiveness\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business and can manifest itself in various ways, including business interruption, poor vendor performance or default (including under significant outsourcing arrangements), systems malfunctions or failures, so/f\\_t ware and/ or hardware obsolescence, computer viruses, hacking incidents and/or other unauthorized access to our websites and/or systems, misappropriation of sensitive information, corruption",

We are also exposed to risks arising from potential failures in, or non-compliance with, Group and entity policies concerning such matters as internal controls and procedures and financial reporting policies, as well as from employee misconduct or negligence and fraud. While we take measures to manage such risk, operational risk is part of the business environment in which we operate and we may incur losses from time to time due to these types of risks, as well as impairments to our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. The risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions could have similar adverse e/ff ects.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the e/ffective operation of our information technology, telecommunications, electronic data and other operational systems. We rely on these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing applications and claims, providing information and support to customers and distributors, administering complex products, conducting actuarial analyses and keeping financial records. We also use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize significant amounts of sensitive customer, employee and company data and information, including proprietary and confidential information. Some of these systems, in turn, rely on third-party systems. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform necessary business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our customers and business partners. In the event of a disruption, our systems may be inaccessible, and our employees unable to perform their duties, for an extended period of time.\n\nSystemic risks may heighten and influence the aforementioned operational risks in an unprecedented fashion. As an example, the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, including related governmental measures, increased the probability and magnitude of operational risks associated with employee health problems, business continuity plans related to delays or failures in external services and measures impacting working practices (such as extensive remote working arrangements or requirements). A failure to implement appropriate management of such heightened operational risks may adversely a/ffect the Group's brand and reputation as well as its results of operations.\n\nFor additional information on the risks relating to the protection, processing and transfer of personal data (including customer and employee data), see the paragraph below 'The evolving and\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\ncomplex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer in the European Union could increase our costs and adversely impact our business'.\n\n## Cyber attacks or other security breaches of our computer systems, technologies or networks, or those of our third-party providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in damage to our reputation or significant financial losses, and expose us to potential regulatory/uni00A0sanctions\n\nThe increasing frequency and sophistication of hacking incidents and other cyber security threats directed at major financial institutions and other corporations recently has made clear the significance of these cyber risks and the damage, both financial and reputational, they can potentially inflict. In recent years, this has led to an increased regulatory focus on risks of security breaches stemming from the growing reliance of the financial sector on information and communication technology. In particular, the European Commission published in September/uni00A02020/uni00A0a dra/f\\_t  regulation designed to establish a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial institutions, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ('EIOPA') issued in October/uni00A0 2020/uni00A0 a set of guidelines aimed at promoting the operational resilience of the digital operations of (re)insurance undertakings that will apply from July/uni00A01, 2021. For further information on these new regulatory frameworks, please refer to 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0-  Regulation and Supervision/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks'.\n\nDespite the Group's implementation of a variety of security measures, the Group's computer systems, technologies and networks, as well as the services we provide or rely on (including mobile and cloud services), may in the future be subject to unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic breakins, cyber-attacks, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches. Like other global financial institutions and companies, the Group has, from time to time, experienced threats to its data, systems, technologies and networks, including phishing, malware or ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. These threats recently became more acute, as extended remote working arrangements have been put in place across the Group in the context of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, and a new smart working strategy, combining remote working and office presence, is being deployed within the Group's major entities (employing over 70% of the Group's employees) with a target implementation date of year-end 2021, and will be extended globally to other Group entities by 2023.

There is no absolute guarantee, however, that these controls and procedures will be su/fficient, properly implemented or e/ffective, and prevent all attempted intrusions into the Group's systems, technologies and networks. Any such intrusion could result in operational disruption, financial losses, unauthorized access to, tampering or loss of sensitive personal data and/or proprietary information and lead to regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions against us.

This strategic plan will be implemented through a number of major initiatives, including in our Health and Protection segments and across our commercial Property/uni00A0& Casualty business lines, all of which are further described under the caption 'Strategic Orientations' on page/uni00A07 and in Section/uni00A02.6/uni00A0'Outlook' of this Annual Report. All of these actions have been designed to deliver sustained earnings growth, driven by all our geographies, and a clear path to dividend growth, supported by enhanced cash generation, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital management. Furthermore, as\n\nI\n\nI\n\nannounced in our ' Driving Progress 2023 '/uni00A0 strategic plan, we intend to reduce the carbon footprint of our General Account assets  ( i.e. corporate  fixed-income;  listed  equities;  real estate assets) by 20% by 2025. This new non-financial target complements the Group's commitment to contain the 'warming potential' of its investment portfolio to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2050/uni00A0and its objective to reach \u20ac24/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023, both launched in 2019. There can be no assurance, however, that any or all of our strategic initiatives will be successful, or that the process of achieving their implementation will not cause material disruption to our business operations, management, personnel, brand and reputation, especially while there remain significant uncertainties and unknown risks relating to the evolution of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic.\n\nThe ' Driving Progress 2023 ' strategic plan is based on a number of assumptions, covering, inter alia, the macroeconomic environment and the development of the Group's activities. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques and forecasts regarding several factors ( e.g. interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, claims expenses, gross domestic product). As a result, the financial targets we intend to achieve as part of our 2020-2023/uni00A0strategic plan may be negatively a/ff ected by an adverse experience relative to such assumptions. Any failure to achieve such financial targets could materially impact our results of operations, share price and competitive position.\n\n## We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions to expand, complement or reorganize our business, which could adversely a/ffect our business, future profitability and growth\n\nExternal growth transactions involve risks that could adversely a/ffect our operating results, including the substantial amount of M anagement time that may be diverted from operations to carry out such transactions and related integration e/ff orts. Such transactions could also result in new debt or equity issuances, financing arrangements, and the incurrence of additional costs, contingent or unforeseen liabilities or risks and impairment and amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, and failure to mitigate the risks and uncertainties arising from such transactions through due diligence and indemnification provisions, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\n\nFurthermore, we may be exposed from time to time to certain risks relating to the integration of newly acquired companies. Such risks include difficulty or delay in integrating such companies, their IT, operations, employees and areas of expertise in an e/ff icient and e/ffective manner, which may result in the loss of certain key employees and/or customers of the acquired",

In the case of adverse developments relating to an acquired company, modifications to our expected strategy with respect to such company, or more generally our overall strategy, might have to be considered. In particular, we may be subject to, or engage in, litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions, which could have an adverse e/ffect on our results of operations.\n\nWe may also carry out divestitures, such as the announced sales of AXA Bank Belgium in 2019/uni00A0and our operations in Greece, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic  and in the Gulf Region in 2020, or reorganization of existing businesses, including AXA Switzerland from 2018/uni00A0to 2019, which may have adverse e/ff ects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Such divestitures and reorganizations, which may take the form of share or asset sales, as well as reinsurance transactions, may not be carried out within the expected timeframe or at all, due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals or other reasons; the anticipated profit and/or positive effect on our overall risk profile, our Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR') and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, or local solvency and capital adequacy requirements, from any such transactions may not be realized; or we may incur a loss on such transactions. Divestments of equity participations we hold may also be subject to volatility and other market-related risks, which could impact the carrying value of our remaining stake in such companies, including related goodwill, and adversely a/ffect our results of operations. All of such factors may be exacerbated by the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, particularly with respect to the timing of any required regulatory or other approvals. For additional information on the impact of divestitures, acquisitions and other transactions on goodwill, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0Note/uni00A05/uni00A0'Goodwill'  of this Annual Report.\n\nFrom time to time, we may also consider acquisitions of or investments in other companies, including through joint ventures.

In addition, development of alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance and securities products, including through the Internet, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Continued consolidation of the insurance and reinsurance sector may also result in increased competition.\n\nThese competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\n## The failure to respond e/ffectively to various emerging technological changes may a/ff ect our business and profitability\n\nAn ongoing challenge we face is the e/ffective adaptation to a constantly changing technological landscape.

For example, the advent of driverless cars, connected devices and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile, health or other p ersonal lines insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. In addition, the market for coverage for so-called 'cyber risks' or similar emerging threats is a rapidly evolving one, and any failure by us to provide innovative products relative to our competitors or new entrants in the market may result in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn addition, the rapid increase in the nature, volume and availability of data in recent years, whether resulting from connected customers, so-called 'big data', 'blockchain', cloud computing, satellite information, personalization of genetic data, asymmetric information with respect to genetic testing, artificial intelligence or otherwise, may have unanticipated and adverse impacts on our business, for example by changing the nature of insurance underwriting, pricing and claims handling; by allowing customers and competitors to tailor coverage in ways that we do not currently o/ffer; or by potentially exposing us to increased 'moral hazard' in business lines where we are unable for regulatory or other reasons to adjust pricing or coverage to reflect individual risk profiles. While data-driven changes in the industry are at an early stage and di/fficult to predict, they could adversely impact our business going forward, including through the expense and e/ffort that we will need to incur in order to ensure that our employees, systems and processes are able to e/fficiently adapt to and manage such changes as they arise.\n\nFurthermore, if we are unable to e/ffectively use and update or replace our key technology systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively ine/fficient, or if we fail to develop the talent and skills of our human resources to meet the new technological challenges, and to attract and assimilate new talents into our Group consistent with our business goals, our business, prospects, competitive position and financial condition could be adversely a/ffected.\n\n## We operate through arrangements with third parties, including delegation of underwriting and claims authority, which exposes us to operational and regulatory risks and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\nWe have entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with third-party service providers for a wide variety of services required in connection with the day-to-day operation of our insurance,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nreinsurance and Asset Management businesses (including policy administration, claims-related services, securities pricing and other services) and our product distribution. Such arrangements expose us to operational and regulatory risks incurred by these third parties, including employee misconduct or negligence, fraud, internal control failure, contract error, disruption to distribution arrangements, failures in processing policies and handling claims, and non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, any of which may be more likely to materialize in the context of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic.\n\nIn addition, part of our (re)insurance business is underwritten by third parties under contractual arrangements, which typically authorize such third parties to bind us to new policies and to renew policies, within the terms of our licenses and subject to various contractual obligations and restrictions. If these third parties do not abide by the terms of our licenses, amend material terms of the policies without our approval, or otherwise breach their contractual obligations to us, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions for breach of outsourcing/licensing requirements and be liable under the policies issued by breaching third parties. Furthermore, we may be exposed to additional exposure to such risks, in particular due to COVID-19-related legislative measures or judicial decisions, such as those imposing customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording, which may apply to policies that were bound on our behalf by certain of these third parties.\n\nFurthermore, as with other reinsurers, in our reinsurance business we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance treaties and we largely rely on original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. As a result, if ceding companies did not adequately evaluate the risks insured, the premiums ceded to us may not compensate us for the risks we reinsure and the losses we may incur, which may adversely a/ffect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe carry out certain of our operations through joint ventures and other partnership arrangements with third parties that we do not control. These arrangements expose us, in particular, to the failure of any of our partners to meets its contractual obligations or to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any of our contractual arrangements with third parties will not expose us to operational, financial and reputational risk, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

On December/uni00A017, 2020, EIOPA submitted an opinion to the European Commission as part of the review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion'). EIOPA's proposals include, among others, (i)/uni00A0changing the extrapolation method for the risk-free rate curve as well as changing the static and dynamic volatility adjuster design which are both used to value insurance best estimate liabilities, changing the risk margin calculation; (ii)/uni00A0granting supervisory authorities extended powers to address systemic risk and other macroprudential concerns, allowing them to impose additional measures to reinforce an insurer's financial condition, such as/uni00A0(a) setting a capital surcharge to address entity-, activity- or behaviorbased sources of systemic risk,/uni00A0(b) restricting or suspending dividend or other payments to shareholders (including share buybacks) or/uni00A0 (c) implementing other measures aimed at mitigating liquidity risk-related concerns; (iii)/uni00A0strengthening the supervisory powers of, and enforcement measures that may be imposed by, a group supervisor with respect to the holding company of the Group; and (iv)/uni00A0establishing a European network of national Insurance Guarantee Schemes. The European Commission is expected to publish its proposal regarding the review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework in the third quarter of 2021. Any changes to the Solvency/uni00A0II framework resulting in an increase of own funds that insurers are required to hold with respect to long-term insurance policies or insurance-based investment products may require us to take actions to preserve our solvency level and business model, which might in turn have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, relationships with customers, capacity to pay dividends, as well as our brand and reputation. It is di/fficult to predict the ultimate outcome of discussions regarding changes to current requirements, the impacts of which could include additional regulatory costs and operational constraints, as well as changes to our Internal Model, which may significantly and adversely a/ffect our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio and EOF, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nI\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nIn  addition,  supervisory  authorities  may  become  more conservative in the interpretation, application and enforcement of relevant regulations, as a result of which they may, for example, impose increased reserving requirements for certain types of insurers or certain types of risks, greater liquidity requirements (including capital conservations measures preventing dividend distributions), higher discounts/'haircuts' on certain assets or asset classes or more conservative calculation methodologies, or question the calculation of our insurance best estimate liabilities or take other similar measures which may significantly increase regulatory capital requirements. In particular, the ACPR, the French insurance supervisory authority may impose changes to the Internal Model we use to calculate our SCR or change its view regarding our methodologies and/or the integration method of some of our subsidiaries, which may adversely a/ff ect our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio. For additional information on our Internal Model and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Model' of this Annual Report/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nIn the event of a failure by the Group, the Company or any of our (re)insurance subsidiaries to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, insurance supervisory authorities have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions including limiting or prohibiting the issuance of new business, prohibiting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, and/ or putting a company into recovery, resolution or insolvency proceedings. In particular, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance industry (the 'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR has broad resolution powers with respect to insurance groups, insurance holding companies, such as the Company, and (re)insurance companies, including prohibiting payment of dividends and ordering portfolio transfers. Furthermore, the proposals and continuing discussions regarding recovery and resolution in the insurance sector may broaden the scope and extent of regulatory measures available to insurance supervisory authorities. In particular, EIOPA proposed in its Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion to establish a minimum harmonized and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework, advocating for strengthened preventive and resolution powers available to national authorities, while the Financial Stability Board and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ('IAIS') are increasingly focusing on the development of recovery and resolution frameworks, strategies and supervisory practices in the insurance industry.\n\nA failure of the Group and/or any of its (re)insurance subsidiaries to meet its regulatory capital requirements and/or a deterioration of its solvency position may also result in the need for significant amounts of new capital. In addition, in certain cases, the Company\n\nI\n\n5",

There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing will not have a material adverse e/ffect on the Group's liquidity position, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information on the Company's off-balance sheet commitments, please refer to Note/uni00A05/uni00A0'O/ff -balance sheet commitments' in Appendix/uni00A0III 'AXA Parent Company Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nRegulatory restrictions that inhibit our ability to freely move excess capital among our subsidiaries or which otherwise restrict fungibility of the AXA Group's capital resources may, depending on the nature and extent of the restrictions, adversely affect the capital position of our operating (re)insurance subsidiaries, which may have a consequent negative impact on the perception of the AXA's Group financial strength.\n\nAdditional regulatory developments regarding solvency capital requirements may adversely a/ffect our prudential regime as well as increase associated costs. There can be no assurance that contingency plans developed by M anagement will be e/ffective to achieve their objectives and any failure by us and/or our (re) insurance subsidiaries to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements and to maintain regulatory capital at competitive levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, credit ratings, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## As a holding company, we are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and dividend payments\n\nOur (re)insurance and financial services operations are generally conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds are dividends from subsidiaries and funds that may be raised from time to time through the issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank or other borrowings.\n\nRegulatory and other legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from all our subsidiaries. In particular, our principal (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends and debt repayments that can be paid to us and our affiliates. Such restrictions may also be strengthened by capital conservation measures implemented by competent EU, national and other supervisory authorities that prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to the Company. For additional information regarding COVID-19-related measures regarding dividend distributions, see the paragraph below 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in/uni202Fthe/uni202Fvarious jurisdictions in which we/uni202Foperate'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFinancial covenants in letters of credit and revolving credit facilities of our subsidiaries may also restrict their ability to declare and pay dividends. Moreover, our status as an Internationally Active Insurance Group ('IAIG') under the Common Framework for the Supervision of IAIGs (the 'ComFrame') developed by the IAIS could, in case of adoption of implementing legislation in relevant jurisdictions, result in the imposition of similar or other restrictions on the transfer of funds, including intra-group financing arrangements, which could negatively impact the fungibility of our capital. These factors may adversely impact our liquidity position and capacity to pay dividends.\n\n## We may have contingent liabilities from/uni00A0discontinued, divested and run-o/ff businesses and may incur other o/ff -balance sheet liabilities that may result in charges to/uni00A0our income statement\n\nWe may, from time to time, retain insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture, liquidation or run-o/ff  of various businesses. We may also, from time to time and in the course of our business, provide guarantees and enter into derivative and other types of o/ff -balance sheet transactions that could result in income statement charges.\n\n## REGULATORY AND LITIGATIONRELATED/uni00A0RISKS\n\n## Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate\n\nThe AXA Group operates in 54/uni00A0countries around the world and our operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. Our regulatory environment is evolving rapidly and supervisory authorities around the world are assuming an increasingly active and aggressive role in interpreting and enforcing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, resulting in significant compliance challenges. We have highlighted below some of the more recent and noteworthy regulatory developments that we anticipate may impact our business in the coming periods; further details regarding these and related regulatory and supervisory matters also appear in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0- Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report. The following summarizes recent developments impacting our required levels of capital and surplus; anti-money laundering and related anti-corruption measures; regulatory pronouncements with respect to interest rate and other 'benchmarks', as well as climate change-related",

The multiplicity of different regulatory regimes, capital standards and reporting requirements resulting from work on new capital standards led by the IAIS such as the Insurance Capital Standard, and the development by IAIS of the ComFrame, which will apply to IAIGs, including the AXA Group, as well as potential changes to applicable solvency and capital adequacy requirements, such as the regulatory framework established under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, could increase operational complexity, regulatory costs and competition. In this regard, a review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework by the European Commission is currently ongoing. As part of this review, EIOPA submitted its Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion to the European Commission, in which it proposes, inter alia, to (i)/uni00A0revise reporting requirements and disclosure deadlines under the Solvency/uni00A0II framework; and (ii)/uni00A0amend the g roup supervision regime (including EOF requirements and Minimum Capital Requirement for groups). The outcome of this review could significantly and adversely a/ffect our Internal Model, SCR, EOF or Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, in addition to operational constraints resulting from changes to our group supervision. For additional information on the risks relating to the Solvency/uni00A0II review, see the paragraph above, 'The Group's or its (re)insurance subsidiaries' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition'.\n\nAML and Other Compliance Matters. In recent years there has also been a significant increase in legislative and regulatory initiatives and enforcement actions in the areas of financial crime compliance, including a nti-m oney l aundering ('AML'), international trade sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations ( e.g. the U S Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691/uni00A0of December/uni00A09, 2016/uni00A0(also known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II')), which have resulted in the need for enhanced control on transactions. As a result, the financial crime compliance programs of financial institutions remains a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, while regulatory measures in this area continue to be further amended, expanded and strengthened. For instance, in France, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342/uni00A0of November/uni00A04, 2020/uni00A0and No./uni00A02020-115/uni00A0of February/uni00A012, 2020/uni00A0recently imposed enhanced requirements on French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures, and prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence-peddling committed in France and abroad. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions the relevant AML, anti-corruption and sanctions rules may be enforced on an extraterritorial basis, which could expose our operations to additional or conflicting requirements. In  addition,  increased  cooperation  among  authorities globally may, in the event we become subject to enforcement proceedings, or are otherwise found to be non-compliant in this area, result in more severe sanctions or monetary penalties.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nCustomer  Protection  Matters. Our  (re)insurance,  a sset m anagement and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services, in particular by enhancing disclosure and transparency requirements, as well as conduct of business and product governance rules, which also result in stricter scrutiny by competent authorities. In the European Union, these initiatives include in particular IDD, MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation, and similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions where the Group operates. These initiatives, as well as future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), EIOPA, the AMF and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA')), may increase our legal and compliance costs, limit or restrict our ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, which may adversely impact our brand or reputation. For further information, please refer to paragraph 'Evolution of the compliance regulatory and litigation environment' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0- Regulation and Supervision/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nBenchmark Reforms. Reforms to interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices (also known as 'benchmarks') have been recently enacted, and regulatory authorities have also proposed further reforms to and potential changes a/ffecting benchmarks. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011/uni00A0of June/uni00A08, 2016/uni00A0(as amended, the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), which entered into force on January/uni00A01, 2018, as well as the EU Benchmark Regulation as incorporated into UK law as from January/uni00A01, 2021/uni00A0(the 'UK Benchmark Regulation' and, together with the EU Benchmark Regulation, the 'Benchmark Regulation'), imposed additional requirements on the provision of financial market-related benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK. Several interbank market benchmarks have been designated as critical benchmarks under the Benchmark Regulation, including Libor, Euribor and Eonia, and their related benchmark methodologies have been made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks might be discontinued in the future, including Eonia, which is currently expected to cease being published on January/uni00A03, 2022, and Libor, as the Libor administrator is consulting on ceasing publication of Libor settings on December/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A0(or June/uni00A030, 2023/uni00A0in the case of certain USD Libor settings). Because these reforms are a/ffecting the whole financial sector, the transition to the new benchmarks creates industry-wide risks, to which the Group is therefore exposed. AXA is conducting a Group-wide project to manage this transition and the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, r isk m anagement efforts, investment strategies and product design, among others. Implementation of these and any future regulations, amendments to existing regulations, or future\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Regulatory initiatives, including at French, European Union and international levels, regarding climate change may affect our operations and those of our counterparties, and potentially limit our investments or a/ffect their value, as certain companies struggle to adapt to these regulations. These may include: (i)/uni00A0new investment requirements; (ii)/uni00A0 new disclosure requirements, such as Regulation (EU) 2019/2088/uni00A0on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector, Regulation (EU) 2020/852/uni00A0of June/uni00A018, 2020/uni00A0on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'), which apply, in particular, to undertakings (such as the Company) that are required to publish a non-financial statement, or Regulation (EU) 2019/2089/uni00A0amending the EU Benchmark Regulation as regards EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks and sustainabilityrelated disclosures for benchmarks; (iii)/uni00A0new requirements relating to the inclusion of environmental, social and governance considerations into insurance and Asset Management products and advice; or (iv)/uni00A0new climate change stress testing requirements, such as the recent climate stress test exercise conducted by the ACPR, the first results of which are expected to be published in April/uni00A02021. In particular, the European Commission conducted in 2020/uni00A0a public consultation on dra/f\\_t  legislation regarding the integration of sustainability considerations into the prudential, distribution, investment and advisory framework for (re) insurance undertakings, insurance distributors, asset managers and investment firms, which is expected to be finally adopted in the course of 2021. These and similar regulatory requirements, as well as any further regulations regarding the transition to a lower-carbon economy, climate change or our energy-related investments, could increase our legal and compliance costs and adversely a/ffect our business or the value of our investments. For further information on investment-related climate risk analysis, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and biodiversity/uni00A0Investments' of this Annual Report.\n\nChanges to IFRS. Changes to IFRS, as developed by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'), could significantly impact insurers and other financial institutions, including AXA, that prepare their consolidated financial statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  In  particular,  the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsimultaneous implementation of IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0- Insurance Contracts and IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0- Financial Instruments, scheduled to become e/ffective for annual periods beginning on or a/f\\_ter January/uni00A01, 2023/uni00A0(subject to the adoption of IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0by the European Union), is in progress within the Group and M anagement is currently assessing the impact of their adoption, which may significantly affect the accounting treatment of insurance liabilities and financial assets. For further information on these two standards, please refer to 'Evolution of Accounting Standards' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0- Regulation and Supervision/uni00A0- Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks'. The abovementioned and any other changes to IFRS that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCOVID-19-Related Judicial Decisions. In several jurisdictions, notably France, various US states and the United Kingdom, courts have rendered decisions in favor of policyholders' interests, including by adopting a policyholder-friendly interpretation of certain business interruption policy provisions. Other judicial decisions may be rendered or legislative proposals enacted to the effect of implementing premium deferrals or refunds, customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording and/or retroactive extension of policy coverage, or restricting our ability to cancel or non-renew insurance policies or collect premiums thereunder in accordance with their terms. This may require the Group to cover losses resulting from the impact of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, even though such losses were not covered under the terms of the relevant policy (or the parties did not intend to cover such losses) and the policies were not designed or priced to cover such losses. As a result, we may be exposed to higher than expected losses, especially if such losses are not covered by our reinsurance arrangements, and be required in turn to increase our reserves to take into account potential higher loss payments. In addition, we may be required to materially amend certain of our existing policy wordings or otherwise change our underwriting and pricing policies and practices to take account of changing judicial and regulatory developments with respect to COVID-19/uni00A0coverage. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing developments will not have an adverse e/ffect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations or adversely impact our brand or reputation.\n\nOther COVID-19-Related Measures. In the first half of 2020, the European Central Bank (the 'ECB'), EIOPA, the ACPR and other supervisory authorities issued various statements to the e/ffect that financial institutions should adopt a prudent approach towards dividend distributions and share repurchases through October/uni00A01, 2020, which guidance was subsequently extended",

        "page_content": "until January/uni00A0 1, 2021, following the adoption on May/uni00A027, 2020,/uni00A0 by the European Systemic Risk Board (the 'ESRB') of a recommendation regarding restrictions on distributions by financial institutions during the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic. On December/uni00A015, 2020, the ESRB and the ECB amended their earlier communications and recommended that such restrictions be extended until September/uni00A030, 2021, except in certain specific circumstances, and, on December/uni00A018, 2020, EIOPA recommended that insurers maintain extreme caution and prudence with respect to their capital management. On February/uni00A018, 2021, the ACPR issued a communication regarding distributions to shareholders (including, e.g. dividends and share buybacks), announcing that it decided to follow the ESRB's recommendation dated December/uni00A015, 2020,/uni00A0and requesting financial institutions under its supervision to apply particular caution in carrying out dividend distributions through September/uni00A030, 2021. In light of the aforementioned regulatory pronouncements, there can be no assurance that additional restrictions on dividends or other distributions by financial institutions will not be implemented in the future and, if so, how such restrictions will be interpreted and applied by competent supervisory authorities. For additional information on our dividend policy and previous dividend payments, please refer to Section/uni00A01.1/uni00A0'Key Figures/uni00A0-  Dividends and Dividend Policy' and Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0Bylaws/uni00A0-  Rights, Preferences and Restrictions Attached to the Shares' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Lloyd's Regulations for Underwriting Syndicates and Related\n\nRisks. Following the acquisition of XL G roup in 2018, we have been managing, through Catlin Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, one of the larger underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's and, as a result, are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members. In addition, if Lloyd's fails to satisfy the FCA's and the Prudential Regulation Authority's annual solvency test in any given year, Syndicate 2003/uni00A0could be required to cease or reduce underwriting through Lloyd's. A downgrading of the Lloyd's market could also impair Syndicate 2003's ability to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. In connection with Brexit, the Lloyd's model for writing business in the European Union through Lloyd's newly established Belgian underwriting subsidiary, Lloyd's Insurance Company/uni00A0SA, is under review by local supervisory authorities, which may have an impact on Syndicate 2003's ability to write EU business. As a Lloyd's syndicate providing coverage to US policyholders and covering US risks, we could also be required by US regulators to increase the level of funding required as minimum deposits for the protection of US policyholders. Any Lloyd's-related risks could have an adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nWe expect the scope and extent of applicable laws and regulations, as well as regulatory oversight, to continue to increase over the coming years. While M anagement proactively manages legal and regulatory risks and has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we do business, we cannot predict with any certainty the potential effects that a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement (or of the potential e/ffects of any new regulation or legislation in the future), or any determination we make regarding compliance with conflicting regulations, may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure by us to remain in compliance with regulations applicable to us could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact our earnings and reputation. For a description of the regulations and supervision framework applicable to the Group, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0-  Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe may also be adversely a/ffected by a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement impacting, or regulatory decisions, authorizations or approvals relating to, third parties with which we do business. For instance, certain of our letter of credit facilities for cedants are e/ffective only if the banks issuing the letters of credit are on the list of banks approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the 'NAIC'). If some or all of the issuing banks under our credit facilities cease to be NAIC approved and we are unable to replace them with NAIC approved banks, our letter of credit facility capacity could be significantly diminished, especially in situations of adverse capital and credit market conditions where the cost of replacement facilities may be significantly increased or prohibitive. See the paragraph above 'Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ffect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital'.\n\n## As a global business, we are exposed to various local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges\n\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to a wide variety of local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges, which may a/ffect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolios, the levels of capital and surplus that we are required to hold, and the credit quality of our counterparties.\n\nThese risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, restrictions on foreign trade and investment (such as\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0- Note/uni00A031/uni00A0'Litigation'  of this Annual Report. We may be involved in similar proceedings in the future.\n\nCertain of these lawsuits and investigations seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages, and certain of the regulatory authorities involved in these proceedings have substantial powers over the conduct and operations of our business. The introduction of a class action system in France in 2014/uni00A0and similar developments in certain other European jurisdictions, as well as the recent adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828/uni00A0of November/uni00A025, 2020/uni00A0on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at the EU level, have increased and are likely to continue to increase litigation, risks and costs. Similarly, in the US there is an increasing trend towards large damage awards in the consumer class action context, and such trend can be expected to continue in the future. Furthermore, the increasing number of legislative and regulatory requirements strengthening consumer protection in the financial sector may expose us to additional civil, criminal or regulatory actions, investigations, proceedings or sanctions. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0-  Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, in the context of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, holders of Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance policies have been increasingly seeking coverage for losses resulting from the COVID-19/uni00A0crisis. Many lawsuits have been introduced against insurers, such as the AXA Group, in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in respect\n\nI\n\nI\n\nof business interruption claims, and the number of claims and related judicial proceedings has continued to rise as various governmental lockdown measures and other impacts of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic have continued. In certain of these cases, defendant insurers, including AXA Group entities, have asserted that these losses were not covered under the terms of the relevant policies. However, policyholders have and may continue to assert di/fferent theories of coverage, and insurers, including the AXA Group, may incur additional expense due to the pendency of a large number of individual lawsuits. We may also be involved in proceedings with our reinsurers regarding coverage of COVID-19-related losses or related matters, which might have an adverse impact on our legal costs and the amount of reinsurance recoverables available to us.\n\nDue to the nature of certain of the aforementioned lawsuits and investigations, we cannot estimate the potential losses or predict with any certainty the potential impact thereof on our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations.\n\n## The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer in the European Union could increase our costs and adversely impact our business\n\nCollection, transfer and protection of significant amounts of sensitive data are critical to the operation of our business. Regulations in this area are quickly evolving in the European Union and in other jurisdictions, which could adversely a/ffect our business if we fail to adapt our rules, internal controls and strategy to the emerging regulatory environment.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679/uni00A0of April/uni00A027, 2016/uni00A0on the protection and movement of personal data (as amended, the' GDPR') entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018. GDPR significantly modified the EU data protection framework and, in particular, imposed new restrictions on data usage/processing (including profiling), disclosure to customers and a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. While we have adopted a global Data Privacy Organization/Governance policy designed to manage risks related to data protection, there can be no assurance that our existing or planned data protection rules, including our privacy-related Group Binding Corporate Rules, and governance organization will not need to be updated or replaced to comply with new laws and regulations and regulatory guidance applicable in the European Union or other jurisdictions where we operate or may operate in the future.",

The Group's IT and other systems may also in future be subject to hacking and unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or security breaches or other intentional or unintentional acts by parties acting from within or outside the Group, which could result in sensitive data (including customer and employee data) being stolen, lost or misused. In the context of the COVID-19/uni00A0pandemic, these threats are more likely to materialize due to extended remote working arrangements, the accelerated digitalization of our operations and, more generally, the social and business community disruption caused by the pandemic. Negligence or failure to implement and follow internal Group policies, in particular regarding encryption of data, or to fail to perform adequate internal data collection/processing controls, may also facilitate hacking and other intrusions and result in breaches of GDPR and other applicable laws.\n\nAny failure to comply with GDPR and other applicable data protection laws, and data the/f\\_t , loss or misuse, a/ffecting any Group entity or a third-party service provider, could result in significant regulatory sanctions, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, damage to our reputation, need to compensate customers, customer litigation (including class actions and individual lawsuits), and consequently have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFollowing the European Union Court of Justice's decision in 2015/uni00A0to invalidate the European Commission's Safe Harbor, which had allowed, under certain conditions, the transfer of personal information from EU companies to US companies, transatlantic data flows continued using other mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses between companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within multinational corporate groups. From July/uni00A02016, a new safe harbor had been created, known as the 'EUUS Privacy Shield', but a/f\\_ter four years this was also invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice (on July/uni00A016, 2020), which required that supplementary measures be considered for data transfers to any non-EU jurisdiction that is not considered by EU authorities as having implemented adequate protections (such as the US). As banks and (re)insurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group had continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nbetween companies within the AXA Group. While we currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the US and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required, there is no guarantee that such mechanisms will not be subject to future challenge or to stricter scrutiny by the competent authorities, or that further changes in applicable regulations will not potentially increase our legal and compliance costs, or result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation.\n\nIn addition, Brexit could significantly impact transfers of data to or from the United Kingdom. The TCA includes an interim bridging mechanism starting January/uni00A01, 2021/uni00A0that allows the continued free flow of personal data from the European Union to the United Kingdom for a six-month period. Upon expiry of this bridging mechanism, and unless an adequacy decision is adopted by the European Commission, data transfers from the European Union to the United Kingdom, which will then be considered as a third country under GDPR, would be subject to additional safeguards, comparable to those currently required for transfers between the European Union and non-EU jurisdictions. In such case, EUUK data flows between companies would continue, but rely on other mechanisms than before Brexit, such as those described above. Regarding data transfers from the United Kingdom to EU Member States, the UK government has decided to allow such transfers to continue as before Brexit, but this is subject to review. Consequently, there is a risk that the United Kingdom could impose new restrictions to outbound transfers of personal data prior to or a/f\\_t  er the expiry of the bridging mechanism, which could require implementing specific mechanisms to transfer data from the United Kingdom to the European Union. Although we currently anticipate that we can continue using the abovementioned mechanisms to transfer data to or from the United Kingdom, there is no guarantee that such mechanisms will be fully implemented in time by all external providers, or that they will not be challenged or impeded by competent authorities or as a result of amendments to applicable regulations, or that Brexit and its related consequences will not increase our legal and compliance costs, result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation, or otherwise have an adverse e/ffect on the Group's business and financial condition. More generally, future changes to UK data protection regulation could increase our legal and compliance costs, result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation, or could otherwise lead to adverse e/ffects on the Group's business and financial condition.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Common risk appetite framework: Chief Risk O/fficers are responsible for ensuring that senior management reviews and approves the risks to which the relevant entity or business unit is exposed, understands the consequences of an adverse development in such risks, and have action plans that can be implemented in case of unfavorable developments;\n- 3. Systematic second opinion on key processes: Chief Risk Officers provide a systematic and independent second opinion on product approval process, reserves, reinsurance, investments and ALM, and challenge on operational risks and strategic plan;\n- 4. Extensive use of Internal Model based on a robust economic capital metric: the Internal Model is intended to offer a concrete and powerful tool to control and measure exposure to most risks, in line with the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. The Internal Model is designed as a consistent and comprehensive Risk Management tool, which also forms an important element in the capital management and planning process;\n- 5. Proactive Risk Management: Chief Risk Officers are responsible for early detection of risks. This is ensured through challenge of and constant dialogue with the relevant business and supported by the AXA Group's emerging Risks Management framework.\n\nGRM oversees the operating entities' adherence to the ERM, supported by the local Risk Management teams. It coordinates Risk Management for the Group, steers the local Risk Management Departments and strives to develop a risk culture throughout the Group. Since September/uni00A02019, the former Group Insurance O/ffice teams have been fully integrated within GRM. They gather Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health/uni00A0& Protection, and Property/uni00A0& Casualty business experts in charge of promoting technical excellence and ensuring compliance with Group insurance guidelines and standards.\n\nSince September/uni00A02019, the newly created portfolio management team is in charge of steering the Group Solvency ratio in cooperation with Finance, and initiating, supporting or conducting initiatives aiming at optimizing further AXA Group balance sheet from a risk and solvency perspective (encompassing both the assets and the liabilities). The Head of Portfolio Management reports to the Group Chief Risk and Investment O/fficer.\n\nThe reinsurance structure in charge of Property/uni00A0& Casualty and Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health/uni00A0& Protection reinsurance (AXA Global Re) reports to the Group Chief Risk and Investment O/fficer. Its main mandate is to contribute to the protection of the Group through the centralization of the Group's purchase of reinsurance.

Adherence to the Standards and Policies ( e.g. Compliance Governance, Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions, Anti-Bribery\u2026) is mandatory.\n\nThe  Group  compliance  function  undertakes  an  annual Compliance Risk Assessment exercise via which entities are required to identify the most significant compliance risks to which they are exposed. Based on this assessment, an Annual Compliance Plan is developed for the following year. Based on the same methodology and to comply with the French extraterritorial law (Sapin/uni00A0II), an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Risk Assessment has been developed and rolled out to the entities. This risk assessment enables entities to identify in a more granular manner risks related to bribery.\n\nThe Group compliance function has implemented a number of monitoring processes. For example, the Compliance InDepth Review (formerly known as Compliance Support and Development Program/uni00A0- CSDP) which is an ongoing program of structured on-site Compliance reviews conducted by the Group Compliance Department to AXA Group Companies worldwide. The main purpose of these reviews is to measure adherence to the Group Standards and Policies, to define improvement action plans, to provide experienced advice, including on compliance technical aspects, and to rate the entity's maturity level against other Group companies. This program was introduced in 2009/uni00A0 using a risk-based approach. In 2020, COVID-19/uni00A0and confinement provided the opportunity to streamline the program and to consolidate these reviews with the technical oversight performed by Group Compliance on issues such as Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions, Data Privacy, business conduct and antibribery. This consolidation has created a more holistic, focused review process and provides a wider coverage and enhanced impact.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group compliance function reports to the Group Audit Risk/uni00A0& Compliance Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors (as required) on significant\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncompliance matters. These include major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, results of the Compliance Risk Assessment, and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\n## Group i nternal control function\n\nTo further strengthen its control environment, the AXA Group established in 2017/uni00A0a centralized i nternal control function within the second line of defense independent from business operations. Group Head of Internal Control is reporting to the Group Head of Operational Risk and Internal Control. The Group Internal Control Department is responsible for the development of a standardized methodology and framework for internal control and for oversight of its implementation in the AXA Group's subsidiaries. For more information on the internal control at local level, please refer to the paragraph 'Risk Management and internal control at local level' below.\n\nThe Internal Control framework of the AXA Group:\n\n- /uni25A0 is based on the principle of proportionality and takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of the entities operations;\n- /uni25A0 is aligned with the COSO 'Internal Control/uni00A0- Integrated Framework' of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission;\n- /uni25A0 is an integral part of the Risk Management thus providing the Executive Management with a view of the risk and control environment;\n- /uni25A0 is underpinned by the Group Internal Control Standard and Group Solvency/uni00A0II Internal Control Policy, first approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of AXA/uni00A0SA in December/uni00A02017;\n- /uni25A0 encompasses Internal Financial Control, implemented since 2010/uni00A0to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR), and extended to Solvency/uni00A0II in 2014/uni00A0to contribute to the Internal Model validation process. For more information on Internal Financial Control, please refer to the paragraphs 'Financial reporting, disclosure, controls and procedures' and 'Internal Model validation' below.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group i nternal control reports to the Group Operational Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\n## Third line of defense: G roup i nternal a udit function\n\nThe Group's i nternal a udit function provides the Group Audit Committee and the Group's Management Committee with independent and objective assurance on the e/ffectiveness of the overall control environment across the Group.\n\nThe Global Head of i nternal a udit reports to the Chairwoman of the AXA Group Audit Committee and to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/fficer.",

It helps the organization meet its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to challenge Executive Management and evaluate the e/ffectiveness of Risk Management, control and governance processes.\n\nGroup i nternal a udit sets an annual plan of work, based on an assessment of both the inherent risk and the adequacy of controls as well as consideration of the audit cycle. The plan is formally reviewed and its performance formally monitored by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOver the audit cycle, all applicable audit universe components for each entity are expected to be audited. Any exceptions identified are notified to the Audit Committee.\n\nA report is issued at the conclusion of each audit assignment to the relevant senior management. The results of the audits and resolution status of internal audit issues are presented to the relevant Audit Committee and Executive Management Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## Risk Management, I nternal control and/uni00A0A ctuarial function at local level\n\nGovernance: the Group Governance Standards require, among other things, the Boards of AXA's main subsidiaries to establish an Audit Committee. The Audit Committees have a critical role in reviewing financial results and other financial information prepared by the management of these subsidiaries, financial reporting and control processes, critical accounting policies, specific accounting issues, key risks and systems of internal control, fraud and similar issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group has established Standards that apply to AXA/uni00A0SA and entities (including Joint Ventures) where AXA has the majority of the voting rights, or has a minority interest but exercises control through other means such as management. They are mandatory for all Group entities within scope unless otherwise indicated. The Standards focus on critical requirements and form part of the overall Risk Management framework which allow the Group to have a clear understanding of risks, both locally and Group-wide.\n\nChief Executive O/fficers are required to certify annually to the Group Chief Executive O/fficer that to the best of their knowledge their entities comply with the Standards. Entity Boards must be formally informed of the Annual Certifications, together with any material breaches, areas of non-compliance and corresponding mitigation plans in order to monitor progress of remedial actions.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk Management: Risk Management is a local responsibility, in accordance with GRM standards and guidelines. The roles and responsibilities of local Risk Management teams are validated jointly by the Executive Committees of local entities and the Group Chief Risk O/fficer to ensure the alignment of central and local interests.\n\nThe minimum missions required for local Risk Management teams are:\n\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the second line of defense locally (which covers among others Compliance, Internal Control, Security) through a specific system of governance framework;\n- /uni25A0 ensuring that the risk appetite is implemented with respect to all risks consistently with the Group's risk appetite, with enhanced reporting, risk limits and decision processes;\n- /uni25A0 providing a second opinion on key processes, such as the definition of characteristics for new products before launch, reserves, ALM studies/uni00A0& asset allocation and reinsurance strategies;\n- /uni25A0 with respect to the Internal Model, Risk Management checking the adequacy of the local risk profile, and implementing, testing and validating the Internal Model.\n\nLocal Chief Risk O/fficers head the local Risk Management teams within each operational entity, and report both to their local Chief Executive O/fficer and to the Group Chief Risk O/fficer. They are independent from operations and Internal Audit Departments. Local Chief Risk O/fficers regularly report to the local Board of Directors (or to a sub-Committee) on Risk Management matters.\n\nTheir teams are responsible for controlling and managing risks within Group policies and limits, and for validating investment or underwriting decisions through local Risk Committees. The Group Chief Risk O/fficer chairs the Chief Risk O/fficers' meeting composed of the Chief Risk O/fficers of AXA's main subsidiaries, that meets on a quarterly basis and have monthly calls.\n\nInternal control: Internal control is a local responsibility in accordance with i nternal control Standard and Policy. Entities are expected to:\n\n- /uni25A0 define and document their controls and control procedures covering all important risks and processes (First line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 regularly verify and challenge the e/ffectiveness of the control environment (Second line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 implement a comprehensive monitoring and reporting on internal control deficiencies at a senior level of the organization to ensure that these are rectified in an adequate and timely manner.\n\nLocal Heads of i nternal control (or equivalent) are independent from operations and report preferably to their local Chief Risk O/fficer. Local Heads of i nternal control (or equivalent) regularly report to the local Executive Committee (or to a sub-Committee) on i nternal control matters.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Based on the Compliance Risk Assessment, an Annual Compliance Plan must be developed at the end of each year for the following year. The local Compliance function must directly report on a regular basis to local senior management and the local Audit Committee (or equivalent body), on significant compliance matters, including key compliance risks, major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, the Annual Compliance Plan, outstanding Compliance Support and Development Program action points and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\nActuarial f unction: The local Actuarial f unction h olders report both to local Finance, Risk or the Chief Executive O/fficer and to the Group Actuarial Function Holder. Their role is, in the same way as for the Group Actuarial Function, defined in accordance with Article/uni00A048/uni00A0of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive.\n\nLocal Actuarial f unction h olders produce an Actuarial report submitted to the administrative, management or supervisory body, at least annually. The Actuarial report identifies any deficiencies and gives recommendations as to how such deficiencies should be remediated.\n\nLocal Actuarial f unction h olders alert the local Executive Committee/Board of Directors and Group Actuarial Function Holder on any major deficiency on their area of responsibility.\n\nThe Group Actuarial f unction h older chairs the Chief Actuaries meeting composed of the local Actuarial f unction holders, that meets on a regular basis.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING, DISCLOSURE, CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Scope of responsibilities\n\nThe PBRC Department within the Group Finance Department is responsible for consolidation, management reporting, as well as actuarial indicators and the economic balance sheet. These missions are performed for regular closings, forecasts and strategic plan exercises. PBRC works with local PBR units within the Finance Departments of Group subsidiaries.\n\nThe local PBR units are responsible for producing their respective contribution to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPBRC's role encompasses the following principal activities:\n\n- /uni25A0 development of both accounting and reporting standards;\n- /uni25A0 managing process instructions with the subsidiaries for the various exercises;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 managing the Group's financial consolidation and reporting systems;\n- /uni25A0 producing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and analyzing key performance indicators;\n- /uni25A0 developing and using management control tools;\n- /uni25A0 managing and consolidating the European Embedded Value processes, related actuarial indicators and the economic balance sheet;\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the production of the Group's Annual Reports filed with the AMF;\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the production of reports filed with the ACPR related to Solvency/uni00A0II;\n- /uni25A0 liaising with the Statutory Auditors and contributing to Audit Committee meetings as required; and\n- /uni25A0 fostering convergence of accounting and financial reporting processes, systems and organizations for insurance activities in Europe.\n\nPBRC has defined and implemented a set of policies and procedures to ensure that the consolidation process leading to the consolidated financial statements is timely and accurate. This consolidation process is based on the following:\n\n## Definition of standards and use of a centralized information system\n\nGroup accounting standards, which are consistent with accounting and regulatory principles, are set forth in the 'AXA Group Accounting Manual' and updated regularly by PBRC experts. These guidelines are submitted to AXA's Statutory Auditors for review before being made available to AXA's subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's consolidation and reporting processes are based on a central information system 'Magnitude'. This tool is managed and updated by a dedicated team. This system is also used to deliver management reporting information and the economic balance sheet. The process through which this management reporting information and the economic balance sheet are produced and validated is the same as the one used to prepare consolidated financial information.\n\n## Operating control mechanisms\n\nAt entity level, AXA's subsidiaries are responsible for recording and controlling accounting and financial data that comply with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and reflect consolidation rules under IFRS accounting standards. In this respect, the Chief Financial O/fficer of each entity signs o/ff  on the accuracy of their respective contribution to the consolidated figures reported",

In particular, these teams analyze the compliance with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and Group actuarial standards.\n\n## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR)\n\nThe AXA Group's ICOFR is a process designed under the supervision of the Group Chief Financial O/fficer and the Group Chief Risk and Investment Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn that context, and based on the Group Internal Control Standard, the Group has implemented a comprehensive program managed by Group Risk Management, entitled Internal Financial Control (IFC), to ensure that the Group Chief Executive O/fficer has a reasonable basis to conclude that AXA Group's ICOFR is e/ffective as of the end of each financial year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group's IFC Standard, which is an internal control and governance standard based on the 'Internal Control/uni00A0- Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting, and provide an overall framework for the annual IFC program precising the scope of application and governance.\n\nThe entities in IFC scope are required to document their significant processes and key controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level. This is performed under the supervision of the Chief Financial O/fficer, sponsor of the IFC program. The independent Internal Financial Control function, anchored within Risk Management for most entities, is in charge of testing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of those key controls, and ensuring that identified control deficiencies are remediated.\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities have to perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process, involving formal sign-o/ff  by process owners and with a formal management report from the entity's Chief Financial O/fficer and Chief Risk O/fficer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff  ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group has implemented a formal internal review and sign-o/ff process pursuant to which all Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/fficers and certain other senior executives are\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nrequired to certify various matters covered in AXA's Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis process is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- 1. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off certificates, which are required to be submitted by all local Chief Financial O/fficers to PBRC, together with the required subsidiary financial reporting and consolidation information;\n- 2. IFC Management reports are required to be submitted by the Chief Financial O/fficer or another senior executive of every in-scope entity, as part of the IFC program dedicated to ICOFR;\n- 3. Disclosure Controls/uni00A0& Procedures certificates, which are required to be submitted by AXA's Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/fficers and certain other senior executives pursuant to which each of these executives is required to review the Group's Universal Registration Document and formally certify (i)/uni00A0 the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Annual Report with respect to the companies under his/her responsibility, and (ii)/uni00A0the e/ffectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and ICOFR at companies under his/her responsibility (with specific disclosure of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses). In addition, as part of this 'sub-certification' process, these executives are required to review and comment on a number of cross-sectional disclosures in the Universal Registration Document relating to risk and other matters;\n- 4. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off certificates on the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: PBRC provides Chief Financial O/fficers with the contribution of the entities under their responsibility to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to facilitate their certification on the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Universal Registration Document of the Group.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0I 'Management's annual evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting' of this Annual Report.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Group has established a comprehensive system of internal control procedures and mechanisms that M anagement believes appropriate and adapted to its business and the global scale of its operations.\n\nHowever, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee against the materialization of risks and control failures. Even systems determined to be effective by the M anagement may not prevent or detect all human errors, all system malfunctions, all fraud or all misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

At Group level, the Group Chief Risk O/fficer is responsible for developing the ORSA policy, implementing the ORSA process and coordinating the ORSA reporting.\n\nThe ORSA policy defines minimum standards for assessing and reporting own risks and S olvency to be applied across the Group. Adherence to this policy is expected to be promoted and monitored by all entity heads of Risk Management Department (Chief Risk O/fficers).\n\nThe Group ORSA report is reviewed annually by the Solvency/uni00A0II Committee and then presented, first, to the ARCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and finally to the Board of Directors, which approves the conclusions of the Group ORSA report and authorizes its filing with the ACPR.\n\nBeyond the annual ORSA report, a quarterly assessment is performed to update the Group's risk profile against Risk Appetite limits and adapt management actions accordingly. This information is reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and to the ARCC which regularly reviews all material audit, risk and compliance issues faced by the Group.\n\n## PURPOSE AND CONTENT\n\nORSA encompasses processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report the short to medium term risks to which the Group is exposed and to ensure the adequacy of the level of own funds within the Group S olvency targets, taking into account the Group's risk profile, as well as approved risk appetite limits and business strategy. As an important component of the Risk Management system, it is intended to give a comprehensive and complete vision of the risks embedded in the businesses of the Group on a continuous basis.\n\nORSA mainly encompasses Risk Management and financial activities, which are organized around the following processes:\n\n- /uni25A0 Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)/uni00A0& Eligible Own Funds (EOF) calculation;\n- /uni25A0 liquidity risk reporting;\n- /uni25A0 strategic planning and financial projections;\n- /uni25A0 risk appetite process;\n- /uni25A0 stress and scenario testing analysis and monitoring; and\n- /uni25A0 risk assessment and review of strategic risk, reputation risk, regulatory risk and emerging risk.\n\nThe ORSA report provides an assessment on:\n\n- /uni25A0 the overall S olvency needs through the measurement of quantifiable risks considering risk mitigation actions implemented in current economic context and approved business strategy detailed in the 2018-2020/uni00A0strategic plan and within approved risk appetite limits. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. This is supported by the Enterprise Risk Management system, including the identification, monitoring and management of non-quantifiable risks;\n- /uni25A0 the compliance, on a continuous basis, with (i)/uni00A0regulatory capital requirements, through the assessment of the ability to meet capital requirements using the approved Internal Model, in compliance with the Solvency/uni00A0II regulatory standard, as well as (ii)/uni00A0requirements regarding technical provisions. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. Also, the extensive use of the Internal Model outputs for key decision-making processes provides a feedback loop for improving the modelling according to the evolution of the risk profile;\n- /uni25A0 the significance with which the risk profile of the AXA Group deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculated on the basis of the Internal Model. Extensive validation tests are performed to assess the relevance of the Internal Model and the model error. Limitations of the Internal Model and evolution plan resulting from the validation activities are presented.\n\nI\n\nI",

The internal model of the Group (the 'Internal Model') is used in its Risk Management systems and decision-making processes. The ACPR has approved the use by the Group of its Internal Model to calculate its SCR under Solvency/uni00A0II. Since December/uni00A031, 2020, the Internal Model encompasses the use of AXA Group's economic capital model on all material entities, including entities that were part of the XL Group AXA acquired in 2018/uni00A0('XL entities'). The Solvency capital requirement in respect of the entities that were part of the XL Group ('XL entities') as at December/uni00A031, 2019/uni00A0was calculated in accordance with the Solvency/uni00A0II standard formula.\n\nAXA continues to review regularly the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any major change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR. In addition, the Group monitors EIOPA's work program which, through its objectives, is also expected to continue to carry out consistency reviews of European insurers' internal models. Such review may lead to further regulatory changes to increase convergence and to strengthen oversight of cross-border groups, as well as changes to internal models and Solvency/uni00A0II capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's main goal in using its Internal Model as opposed to the Solvency/uni00A0II standard formula is to better reflect the Group's risk profile in its SCR. This is reflected through several objectives:\n\n- /uni25A0 taking into account local specificities/uni00A0- the Group is a global company, and caters to a wide range of insurance markets with a variety of products o/ffered targeting certain demographics and with di/ffering risk exposures. It is therefore appropriate, to the extent possible, to calibrate stresses specific for these risk profiles and to allow for the benefits of diversification of risks which arise as a result of being spread over these markets;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- /uni25A0 addressing shortcomings inherent to the standard formula/uni00A0based on its expertise, the Group can improve on the approach of the standard formula (which is naturally constrained by its general scope and which does not cover all measurable risks) and have models more appropriate to the scope of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 allowing for better evolution of the model over time/uni00A0- as the Group's experience increases, business expands to new markets and product innovations create di/fferent risks to consider, the flexibility of an internal model allows the specificities of these developments to be reflected.\n\nThe Internal Model is based on a common definition of risks used consistently throughout the Group. It aims to ensure that the Company risk mapping is comprehensive and is followed in a consistent way across the Company and that e/fficient procedures and reporting are in place so that roles and responsibilities are allocated to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report key risks.\n\nThe Group risk grid/uni00A0 (2 ) aims to identify all material risks applicable to the Company's insurance businesses. The Internal Model is intended to capture all material risks to which the Group is exposed from the risk assessment performed at sub-risk level to the overall aggregation of risk categories.\n\nThe underlying methodologies and assumptions used in the economic capital model are regularly reviewed to ensure that they accurately reflect the AXA Group's risk profile and new methods are developed and integrated regularly (in accordance with the Internal Model change policy).\n\nThe SCR, calculated on the basis of the Internal Model, represents the value at risk of Group EOF at the 99.5 th /uni00A0percentile over a oneyear horizon. In other words, the Solvency Capital Requirement is the capital needed to sustain an extreme shock likely to occur with a 0.5% probability ( i.e. a 1/uni00A0in 200/uni00A0years event). It aims at including all measurable risks (market, credit, insurance and operational) and reflecting the Group's diversified profile.\n\nIn addition to the risks that impact the SCR through the Internal Model calculation, the Group also monitors its liquidity risk, reputation risk, strategic risk and regulatory risks as well as emerging threats.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee is supported by risk technical working groups reviewing changes proposed to the Internal Model and presenting conclusions of these diligences to the Solvency/uni00A0II\n\nCommittee. The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee also reviews the Internal Model validation and model change processes and liaises with local governance. It also reviews the conclusions of the regular validation activities.\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL VALIDATION\n\nThe Group has implemented and documented a validation process of its Internal Model to monitor its performance and continued adequacy. This process and associated governance are documented in the Group validation policy, endorsed by the ARCC.\n\nThe  Group  validation  policy  is  supplemented  by  local validation policies specifying the local validation activities and responsibilities.\n\nValidation does not only apply to the quantitative aspects of the model (input data, theory/uni00A0& methodology, parameters/uni00A0& assumptions, data, results) but also encompasses the qualitative aspects of the model: expert judgment, documentation, model governance, use test, systems/IT.\n\nRisk Management performs regular integrated validation activities, described in the Internal Model validation policy, mostly organized around:\n\n- /uni25A0 validation of the model structure, modelling choices, parameters and assumptions; and\n- /uni25A0 validation of the Solvency Capital Requirement calculation and results.\n\nThese tasks are performed mostly within the Risk Management Departments in charge of the model, through controls and validation activities using validation tools such as sensitivity tests, back testing, scenario testing, and stability analysis and any other relevant activity.\n\nThese validation procedures are complemented by independent challenge and validation of assumptions, key parameters and results through Committees (including assumptions Committees, calibration Committees and clearance Committees) intended to provide an adequate level of expertise and seniority.\n\nIn  particular,  Group  Risk  Management  teams  provide independent testing of the local model choices, local parameters, assumptions or calibration as well as local results.\n\nApart from this fully integrated validation, sanctioned by the Group Chief Risk O/fficer's review and sign-o/ff, a comprehensive independent review process has been defined and implemented to provide adequate comfort to AXA Group management and\n\nI\n\nI",

IMR controls are performed on a 3-year rolling basis, independently from closing agenda.\n\nBoth IMR and IFC are fully independent from the development, the governance and the processing of the Internal Model.\n\nAt the end of the annual validation process, the Board of Directors is provided with a report summarizing the conclusions of the internal review by Risk Management and the conclusion of the independent review by IMR and IFC as well as a review by an independent third party.\n\n## Governance of investment strategy and Asset/uni00A0& Liability Management (ALM)\n\nThe AXA Group, as an insurance group, follows an investment strategy mainly driven by Asset/uni00A0& Liability Management (ALM). The overall objectives of all investment decisions made within the Group are to meet its obligations and commitments to policyholders, to protect the solvency of the Group's entities, and to generate superior return over time.\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GUIDANCE ON INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Group Chief Investment O/fficer (Group CIO) heads the Groupwide community of local insurance companies CIOs, the central Investment/uni00A0& ALM Department and reports to the Group Chief Risk and Investment Officer. His role includes aligning AXA's investment strategy with the broader strategy of the Group, fostering closer cooperation amongst local entities, enhancing investment expertise and methodology, and steering investment decisions.\n\nLocal investment/uni00A0& ALM activities are steered by local CIOs. Local CIOs manage local portfolios, aiming at an optimized riskreturn ratio, maintain reporting lines to the Group, and manage close relationships with asset managers and local stakeholders. Moreover, they are responsible for the investment performance and for implementing and executing a sound Asset Liability Management.\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE BODIES\n\nIn order to e/fficiently coordinate local and global investment processes, decisions within the Group's investment community are taken by two main governance bodies:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group Investment Committee, which is co-chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Investment O/fficer and the Group\n\nChief Financial O/fficer. This Committee defines the Group's investment strategy, steers tactical asset allocation, evaluates new investment opportunities and monitors the Group's investment performance; and\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group Financial Risk Committee is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/fficer and the Group Chief Risk and Investment O/fficer. The Group Chief Investment O/fficer is also member of this Committee (please refer to the paragraph 'Audit Risk and Compliance Committee' above).\n\nAt the entity level, each insurance company has a local Investment and ALM Committee whose terms of reference are approved by the local Executive Committees.\n\nThese Committees are responsible for, inter alia, defining the entity's Strategic Asset Allocation, approving and monitoring investments, meeting local compliance obligations and reviewing the participation in investment proposals syndicated by the Group, as well as local investment proposals.\n\n## ALM STUDIES AND STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION\n\nALM aims to match assets with the liabilities generated by the sale of insurance policies. The objective is to define the optimal asset allocation so that all liabilities can be met with the highest degree of confidence while maximizing the expected investment return.\n\nALM studies are performed by the Investment/uni00A0& ALM Department with the support of internal asset managers when appropriate and a second opinion is provided by the Risk Management Department. They use methodologies and modelling tools that develop deterministic and stochastic scenarios, embedding policyholders' behavior considerations for the liabilities, financial market evolution for the assets and taking into account existing\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This process aims at maximizing expected returns given a defined level of risk. Furthermore, a series of additional constraints are taken into account, such as Solvency/uni00A0II economic capital model considerations, earnings stability, protection of the solvency margin, preservation of liquidity, as well as local and consolidated capital adequacy and requirement.\n\nALM constraints are also taken into account when new insurance products are being designed as part of the product approval process (see Section/uni00A05.6/uni00A0'Insurance risks/uni00A0- Product approval' of this Annual Report).\n\nAt the entity level, the strategic asset allocation issued from the ALM study must be reviewed by local Risk Management, and verified against predefined risk appetite limits, before being approved by the local Investment and ALM Committee.\n\n## INVESTMENT APPROVAL PROCESS\n\nInvestment opportunities, like non-standard investments, new strategies or new structures, are subject to an Investment Approval Process (IAP) in line with the third pillar of the Group Risk Management principles which provides for a systematic second opinion on key processes. The IAP ensures key characteristics of the investment are analyzed, such as risk and return expectations, experience and expertise of the investment management teams, as well as accounting, tax, legal and reputational issues.\n\nThe IAP is completed at Group level for any significant investment, depending on the investment size and the number of entities participating in it. The successful completion of an IAP is done a/f\\_t er the production of a second independent opinion by Group Risk Management. The IAP is used and completed at local level to cover local regulatory characteristics (including tax and statutory accounting).\n\nLocal IAP is also run for investments in new asset classes for local entities under the same principles.\n\n## GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nProducts involving hedging programs based on derivative instruments are designed and executed with the support of dedicated teams at AXA Investment Managers and AXA/uni00A0SA. In a similar way, this set-up ensures that all entities benefit from technical expertise, legal protection and good execution of such transactions within the following governance framework for derivatives.\n\nDerivative strategies are reviewed by local Investment and ALM Committees. In addition, there is a segregation of duties between those responsible for making investment decisions, executing\n\nI\n\nI\n\ntransactions, processing trades and instructing the custodian. This segregation of duties aims in particular at avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe market risks arising from derivatives are regularly monitored taking into account the Group's various constraints (such as risk appetite and Internal Model).\n\nSuch monitoring is designed to ensure market risks, arising from cash or derivative instruments, are properly controlled and remain within approved limits.\n\nLegal risk is addressed by defining a standardized master agreement. The Group's business units may trade derivatives only if they are covered by legal documentation which complies with the requirements set out in the Group standards. Any change to certain mandatory provisions defined in the Group standards must be approved by GRM.\n\nAdditionally, there is a centralized counterparty risk policy. GRM has established rules on authorized counterparties, minimum requirements regarding collateral and counterparty exposure limits.\n\nThe operational risk related to derivatives is measured and managed in the context of the Group's global operational risk framework. Furthermore, execution and management of derivatives are centralized within dedicated teams, reducing the AXA Group's operational risk.\n\nValuation Risk is also addressed through the use of dedicated teams, within the Group's asset managers and banks. They independently counter-valuate the derivatives positions so as to achieve appropriate accounting, payment and collateral management. They also challenge the prices proposed by counterparties in the event that the applicable AXA entity wishes to initiate, terminate or restructure derivatives. Such capacity in pricing requires strong expertise, which relies on rigorous market analysis and the ability to follow the most up-to-date market developments for new derivatives instruments.\n\n## INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFor a large proportion of its assets, the Group utilizes the services of asset managers to invest in the market:\n\n- /uni25A0 local AXA companies assign the day-to-day management of their asset portfolios primarily to AXA's Asset Management subsidiaries, i.e. AXA Investment Managers and Architas. Local CIOs continuously monitor, analyze, and challenge asset managers' performances; and\n- /uni25A0 in order to benefit from a more asset-specific and/or geographical expertise, the Group may also decide to invest through external asset managers. In such event, thorough due diligence analyses are performed by the Investment and the Risk Management communities and a continuous monitoring is implemented at both Group and Local levels.",

Only information referred to in Note/uni00A04/uni00A0is covered by the report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInformation in this Section should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Market-related risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group is exposed to financial market risks through its core business of financial protection ( i.e. insurance) and through the financing of its activities as part of its equity and debt management.\n\nThe market risks to which Life/uni00A0& Savings (L&S) and Property/uni00A0& Casualty (P&C) portfolios are exposed arise from a variety of factors including:\n\n- /uni25A0 a decline in market returns may cause us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of business in-force and other intangibles;\n- /uni25A0 a decline in returns on assets (linked to a sustained fall in yields on fixed income investments or to lower equity markets) could reduce investment margins on General Account products or fees on Unit-Linked contracts and impact the performance of asset managers;\n- /uni25A0 a change in yields on fixed-income investments (linked to changes in interest rates or in credit spreads) a/ffects the market value of investments and liabilities and could impact adversely the Group's solvency position, and increase policyholder's surrenders due to competitive pressures;\n- /uni25A0 a decline in asset market value (relating, for example, to equity, real estate, or alternatives,/uni00A0etc.) could adversely impact the Group's solvency position, as well as available surplus;\n- /uni25A0 a change in foreign-exchange rates would have limited impact for the operating units since foreign-currency commitments are matched to a large extent by assets in the same currency or covered by hedges, but it could affect the earnings contribution in euros;\n- /uni25A0 furthermore, Health and Property/uni00A0& Casualty activities are subject to inflation which may increase the compensation payable to policyholders, so that the actual payments may exceed the associated reserves set aside. This risk can be significant for long-tail businesses but is managed through regular pricing adjustments or specific protections against peaks of inflation.\n\nThe Group policies implemented to manage these risks are tailored to each product type and the risks relating to it.\n\nThe main market risks to which the AXA Group is exposed are the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 interest-rate risk, spread risk and equity risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries;\n- /uni25A0 exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries; and\n- /uni25A0 risks relating to the management of holding companies' exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and debt.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to market risks is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's Liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5/uni00A0'Liquidity r isk' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This approach aims to allow reacting swiftly in an accurate and targeted manner to changes in financial markets, political and economic environments in which the Group operates.\n\nA wide variety of Risk Management techniques are used to control and mitigate the market risks to which the Group is exposed. These techniques, used primarily in all operating subsidiaries, include:\n\n- /uni25A0 local risk appetite governance and processes, including functional limits on market risks defined locally and approved by the local Board or Executive Committee;\n- /uni25A0 Asset/uni00A0& Liability Management (ALM), i.e. defining an optimal strategic asset allocation with respect to the liabilities' structure in order to reduce the risk to a desired level;\n- /uni25A0 a  disciplined  investment  process,  requiring  for  any sophisticated investment a formal thorough analysis by the Investment Department, and a second opinion by Risk Management;\n- /uni25A0 hedging of financial risks when they exceed the tolerance levels set by the Group. Operational management of derivatives is based on stringent rules and is mainly performed by AXA/uni00A0SA for the holding company activities and AXA Investment Managers for operating units;\n- /uni25A0 a regular monitoring of the financial risks on the Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio; and\n- /uni25A0 reinsurance which also o/ffers solutions to mitigate certain financial risks.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs regards the market risks relating to the management of holding companies' foreign exchange and interest rates exposure, the following Risk Management measures have been defined and implemented.\n\nFor the purpose of optimizing the financial management and control of financial risks linked to AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holding companies, the Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department has defined a methodology to monitor and assess financial risks.\n\nThe policy on the management of holding companies' interest rate risk aims at monitoring and limiting the potential mediumterm variation in interest expenses and consequently at partially protecting future levels of interest expenses against movements in interest rates. Regarding foreign exchange risk, the implemented policy's objective is to limit variations in net foreign currency-denominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates. The purpose of the policy is therefore to protect partially or in full the value of AXA's net foreigncurrency investments in its subsidiaries and thus reduce the variability of Group consolidated shareholders' equity against currency fluctuations, but also of other key indicators such as liquidity, gearing and solvency ratio at Group level. In 2020, the Company has adjusted the protection of its net foreign-currency investments in its main subsidiaries outside the Eurozone to focus it on near term expected cash flows. These adjustments have allowed to maintain a similar level of protection on key financial indicators.\n\nAXA regularly monitors its exchange rate hedging strategy and will continue to review its e/ffectiveness and the potential need to adapt it taking into account impacts on earnings, value, solvency, gearing ratio and liquidity.\n\nThe Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department is in charge of producing reporting data that consolidate interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risk exposures, as well as the interest expenses of AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holdings. This reporting also includes medium-term forecasts.\n\nSynthetic reports, including information about hedging strategies, are sent to and reviewed by the Finance Committee of AXA's Board of Directors five times a year.",

This metric however reflects the IFRS accounting value of liabilities and not their economic value which is better reflected within Solvency/uni00A0II EOF.\n\nThe main elements of the reconciliation between the IFRS TNAV and the Group EOF Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01/uni00A0are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 deduction of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion of foreseeable dividends to be paid to shareholders in 2021;\n- /uni25A0 addition of \u20ac1.9/uni00A0billion reflecting the Solvency/uni00A0II technical provision adjustments corresponding to the adjustment from IFRS reserves to best estimate liabilities (\u20ac+13.9/uni00A0billion) and the risk margin (\u20ac-12.0/uni00A0billion); and\n- /uni25A0 other adjustments between IFRS TNAV and Group EOF Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01/uni00A0(\u20ac+0.2/uni00A0billion).\n\nGroup EOF are then the sum of Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01, Restricted Tier/uni00A01, Tier/uni00A02/uni00A0and Tier/uni00A03.\n\nInformation on the Group EOF is disclosed in the 'Embedded Value/uni00A0& Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds Report 2020' which is available on AXA Group website (www.axa.com).\n\nThe sensitivities of the EOF to changes in major economic assumptions were calculated as follows for the 2020/uni00A0values:\n\n- /uni25A0 upward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates simulates a sudden shock to the initial conditions. This means changes to: 1) the current market values of fixed-interest assets, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues, 2) future reinvestment rates for all asset classes, and 3) discount rates. The change is applied to the reference interest rates, including the volatility adjuster where applied in the base case. Inflation rates, the volatility on interest rates and the Ultimate Forward Rates are not changed;\n- /uni25A0 downward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates is the same as above but with a shi/f\\_t  downward;\n- /uni25A0 25% higher value of equity markets simulates a shock to the initial conditions for equities only. Listed equities and private equity values including the impact of equity hedges are shocked. This means changes to current market values of all these equities excluding hedge funds, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues;\n- /uni25A0 25% lower value of equity markets :  same methodology as mentioned above assuming a decrease.\n\n| L&S EOF sensitivities   | 2020/uni00A0EOF (in Euro/uni00A0million)   | 2020/uni00A0EOF (in percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 38,457                                     | 100%                              |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | 2,028                                      | 5%                                |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | (2,941)                                    | -8%                               |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 2,613                                      | 7%                                |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (2,738)                                    | -7%                               |\n\n| P&C EOF sensitivities   | 2020/uni00A0EOF (in Euro/uni00A0million)   | 2020/uni00A0EOF (in percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 31,250                                     | 100%                              |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | (194)                                      | -1%                               |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | 186                                        | 1%                                |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 1,044                                      | 3%                                |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (920)                                      | -3%                               |\n\nI\n\nI",

However, this classical pattern is not followed everywhere, as for certain type of business with significantly low interest rate guarantees, the EOF behaves more like a portfolio of fixedincome assets. In addition, higher interest rates a/ffect the value both positively through higher investment rate and negatively through lower starting value of fixed income assets and higher discount rates for future profits. For di/fferent product types these interactions produce di/ff erent results.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.3/uni00A0MARKET RISKS\n\n2020/uni00A0interest rate sensitivities for Property/uni00A0& Casualty business (% of P&C EOF) of -1% to upward 50/uni00A0bps and 1% to downward 50/uni00A0bps reflect mainly the impacts on fixed-income assets, o/ffset by discount on liabilities.\n\n2020/uni00A0equity market sensitivities for Life/uni00A0& Savings business (% of L&S EOF) of 7% to 25% higher value and -7% to 25% lower value reflect mainly the impact of guarantees and profit-sharing rules, along with some hedging programs to limit potential losses.

Only information referred to in Note/uni00A04/uni00A0is covered by the report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInformation in this Section should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Credit and liquidity-related risks' in the Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a third party in a transaction will default on its commitments. Given the nature of its core business activities, AXA Group monitors three major types of counterparties, using methods suitable to each type:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment portfolios held by the Group's insurance operations (excluding assets backing separate-account products where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe financial risk is borne by policyholders) as well as by banks and holding companies;\n\n- /uni25A0 receivables from reinsurers resulting from reinsurance ceded by the AXA Group; and\n- /uni25A0 credit and credit-sensitive exposures on third party obligors stemming  from  some  Group  insurance  and  assumed reinsurance businesses.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to credit risk is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in the Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5/uni00A0'Liquidity risk'   of this Annual Report).\n\n## I Risk control and risk mitigation\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, AXA Group's investment strategy, which is mainly driven by Asset/uni00A0& Liability Management, aims to meet the Group's obligations and commitments to policyholders, and to protect the solvency of the Group and of its entities (please refer to paragraph 'Governance of investment strategy and Asset/uni00A0& Liability Management (ALM)' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report).\n\nA specific set of limits take into account all AXA Group exposures on a given ultimate shareholder through debt securities, cash, equity, derivatives, reinsurance receivables, insurance and assumed reinsurance commitments. They aim at managing globally the default risk of a given counterparty.\n\nI\n\n## INVESTED ASSETS: A CENTRAL MONITORING OF COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE\n\nAXA Group concentration risk is monitored by di/fferent analyses performed at Group level by issuer and ultimate shareholder, in addition to local procedures and by a set of Group and local issuer limits.\n\nThese limits aim at managing the default risk of a given issuer, depending on its rating and on the maturity and seniority of all bonds issued by the issuer and held by the AXA Group (corporate, Government agency and sub sovereign).\n\nOn sovereign exposures, specific limits have also been defined on government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds.\n\nCompliance with the limits is ensured by the Group through defined governance. The Group Credit Risk Committee handles, on a monthly basis, the issuer exposure breaches to the Group's limits and determines coordinated actions for excessive credit concentrations. A Group Credit Team reporting to the Group Chief Investment O/fficer (Group CIO) provides credit analyses independently from Group asset managers, in addition to local CIO teams. The Group Financial Risk Committee is regularly kept informed of the main credit risks.",

These  procedures  are  adapted  and implemented locally, and aim to foster product innovation across the Group while maintaining risks under control. The validation framework relies among others on the results of the Solvency Capital Requirement's assessments, based on the AXA Group's Internal Model, to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they are brought to market.\n\nIn Life/uni00A0& Savings, as well as Health, the Product Approval Process is managed at local level for all traditional products meeting Group's minimum requirements, which allows maintaining time-to-market product launches. For sophisticated products, local entities require Group's approval before launch to ensure all long-term commitments are monitored at Group level and benefit from the Group expertise on enhanced or specific guarantees.\n\nIn Property/uni00A0& Casualty, methods are adapted to the underwriting of risks, while maintaining the principle of local decision-making\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbased on a documented approval procedure and using the output of the internal model. The aim is twofold:\n\n- /uni25A0 for pre-launch business, the aim is to ensure that new risks underwritten by the Group have been scrutinized before proposing them to customers;\n- /uni25A0 for post-launch business, appropriate profitability and risk control are performed to verify that the business remains in line with the Group's risk framework.\n\nThis framework is part of the Group underwriting policy and ensures that no risks are taken outside the Group tolerances and that value is created by adequate risk pricing.\n\n## EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nAXA Group reviews regularly its exposure to ensure that the risks underwritten are diversified geographically and by lines of business in order to manage risk concentration, and to verify adequacy of reinsurance.\n\nFor Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health and Property/uni00A0& Casualty activities, AXA Group has developed and deployed common models and metrics to consistently measure risks throughout the Group (in particular via its economic capital framework as detailed in Section/uni00A0 5.2/uni00A0 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of the Annual Report. This enables the Group to verify that its exposure complies with consolidated risk appetite limits along the dimensions of earnings, Eligible Own Funds (EOF), solvency and liquidity. These tools also contribute substantially to monitoring the major risks (claims frequency deviation, claims severity, reinsurance, pricing consistency, natural and man-made catastrophes, biometric and behavior risks deviations).\n\nThis framework is included in the governance set out previously for product development control.\n\nIn the Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health businesses, these tools allow for mortality/longevity risks to be analyzed on a multi-country basis. The AXA Group regularly monitors its exposure to these risks (including mortality, longevity and morbidity) and uses the results of this work to optimize its product design and its reinsurance coverage. These exposure analyses are supported by expert risk models in Life/uni00A0& Savings.\n\nRegarding  the  Property/uni00A0 &  Casualty  exposures, ad- hoc concentration risk models (internal and external for natural catastrophe and for man-made catastrophe) are developed to ensure yearly natural catastrophe volatility, coming from events such as windstorm, earthquake, hurricane or typhoon, or catastrophe man-made events, such as cyber or liability ones, are not likely to a/ffect the Group above the set tolerance levels.",

        "page_content": "Since 2015, the Group has strategically developed a strong in-house expertise of development and validation of natural catastrophe models to cope with their dynamic nature in the context of global climate change. This has been complemented by a reinforced and continuously enhanced expertise in the modelling of systemic events (without border in time and space) like Cyber.\n\n## CEDED REINSURANCE\n\nFor the Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health and Property/uni00A0& Casualty operations, reinsurance programs are set up as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Group's operating entities reinsurance capacity are set in alignment with Group Standards and with their local risk appetite limits considering the risk assessment previously described;\n- /uni25A0 their risks are modeled through in-depth actuarial analyses conducted on each portfolio; specifically, for Property/uni00A0& Casualty modelling, via the Group economic capital model, AXA uses several models both internal and external for assessing the risk associated with the main natural perils (storms, floods, earthquakes\u2026).\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nCentralization and harmonization of treaty reinsurance purchase is based on the same procedures for both the Life/uni00A0& Savings, Health businesses as for the Property/uni00A0& Casualty activities.\n\nIn order to build adjusted and optimized protection, the Group's operating entities are reinsured by AXA Global Re (AGRe) except for very specific cases notably for products developed in partnership with reinsurers in Life and Health and except for some AXA XL treaties (mainly quota share for specialties and for US portfolios) for which AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers under AGRe's delegation and control. AGRe can place a variable part of the local treaties on the reinsurance market, for regulatory reasons for example. A portion of the risk exposure is retained and mitigated within AGRe through the internal Group covers (including through a pool mechanism for Property) and the remaining part is ceded to external reinsurers.\n\nAGRe is responsible for all Group external cessions. Since the acquisition of the XL group, AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers under AGRe's delegation and control. 2021/uni00A0Group reinsurance protections ensure reaching risk appetite as in 2020/uni00A0and further limit the impacts of volatility (Nat Cat and man-made) induced by frequency of mid-size events.\n\nThese protections consist of major Group covers (CAT covering direct business and accepted reinsurance business from AXA XL,\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.6/uni00A0INSURANCE RISKS\n\nProperty Per Risk, International Liability, Marine, Cyber, Motor Third Party Liability and Life) and various AXA XL-dedicated covers which contribute to further decrease the net retention of AXA XL and limit its own volatility ( e.g . Aviation, US Liability, Political risks).\n\nThe structures of Group covers are designed to adequately protect the Group in compliance with the Group risk appetite framework. Specific covers are arranged through either the traditional reinsurance market or the financial one through securitization (cat bonds and Insurance Linked Securities).\n\nAs opposed to the other Group covers where the Group retention is kept by AXA Global Re, in 2020/uni00A093.2% of the Property Pool year-end financial result net of external reinsurance protections is retroceded back to local entities, through a pool mechanism managed by AGRe on behalf of those local entities.\n\nAXA also uses capital market solutions, such as catastrophe bonds, as part of the overall reinsurance strategy. The use of catastrophe bonds may not provide the same level of protection as traditional reinsurance, and the protections provided may vary depending on the Region in which the loss occurred, or the number of events that make up the loss. Like traditional reinsurance, the accessibility of the catastrophe bond market may be impacted by disruptions, volatility or uncertainty, such as those that may arise following a major catastrophic event. Also, to the extent that AXA uses catastrophe bond products providing reinsurance protections based on an industry loss index rather than on its actual incurred losses, such transactions could result in a larger residual loss than anticipated.\n\nFinally, in addition to the analyses described above, AGRe regularly monitors its credit exposure and other AXA entities' credit exposures to reinsurers, to ensure that consolidated limits remain within Group risk tolerance (see Section/uni00A05.4/uni00A0'Credit Risk/uni00A0Receivables from reinsurers' of this Annual Report).\n\n## TECHNICAL RESERVES\n\nOperational entities specifically monitor their reserve risks. Claims reserves are estimated and booked on a file by file basis by the claim handlers. Additional reserves are also booked by the local entities.\n\nThe additional reserves' calculations are carried out locally by a two-independent-opinion process.\n\nActuaries in charge of assessing reserves use various statistical and actuarial methods. Their assumptions are made following discussions with claims managers, pricing actuaries, underwriters and other specialized departments.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Its implementation is not limited to insurance activities. It encompasses all AXA entities, including insurance companies, banking activities, AXA asset managers and internal service providers consistent with AXA policy on operational Risk Management.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative requirements are defined:\n\n- /uni25A0 across the Group, the most critical operational risks of each entity and a set of stress scenarios are identified and assessed following a forward-looking and expert-opinion approach. These risk scenarios are then used to estimate the capital requirement needed to cover operational risks based on advanced models based on Solvency/uni00A0II principles. The operational Risk Management process is embedded into local governance through senior management validation to ensure that the risk assessment is adequate, appropriate and comprehensive but also to ensure that adequate corrective and pre-emptive actions are defined and implemented in respect of the main risks;\n- /uni25A0 in addition, a loss data collection process is in place within most companies of the Group in order to track and appropriately mitigate actual operational risk losses. This process is also used as a valuable source of information to back-test the assumptions taken in risk assessments.\n\nA key objective of the AXA Group's operational risk economic capital model is to understand and reduce losses resulting from operational failures and to define an appropriate risk response strategy for major operational risk scenarios. Entities and Group Operational Risk profiles are presented to local/Group Risk Committees for decisions and actions to be taken.\n\n5.7/uni00A0OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nIn 2020, the Group Operational Risk Profile is reasonably well spread out with all seven operational risk categories covered and the main risks being the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 transaction  capture,  execution  and  maintenance  risk is a top risk and relates to process error, failure, and/or misperformance;\n- /uni25A0 compliance risk due to increases in legislation and regulation remains a major concern and is under the close monitoring of Group Compliance;\n- /uni25A0 external fraud/uni00A0& system security risk continues also to be a top priority. AXA Group's exposure to cyber risk is still high with more and more new technology into AXA Group's products and services. Information on cyber risks should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Operational and businessrelated risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to operational risk is captured in the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nSpecific actions are identified at Group and local levels to mitigate these risks. Also, the implementation of the Internal Control framework will continue to contribute to better embed controls in activities and mitigate the risks.\n\nAs regards information risks, AXA has built an Information Risk Management (IRM) framework to enable information risk decisions to be made consistently across the organization and establish sustainable Risk Management capabilities that are integrated with the business.\n\nAXA relies on third-party providers for outsourcing of services at different stages of the value chain. Although relying on partners is a strategic advantage, onboarding a vendor into AXA's organization requires AXA to assess the risks it might bring, such as regulatory, compliance, IT security,/uni00A0etc.\n\nTo protect both business and customers, AXA has set up a dedicated Vendor Risk Framework program co-sponsored by Group Risk Management and Group Procurement. This program is supported by Group functions (Compliance, Data Privacy, Information Security, Operational Resilience, Legal, Reputation and Internal Control) and local stakeholders (Chief Risk O/fficers, Chief Procurement Officers and Insurance Procurement Directors).\n\nThe Vendor Risk Framework defines a set of requirements for each relationship, with a risk-based approach, i.e. existing and potential new contracts. After identification of the criticality through pre-determined criteria, an appropriate level of due diligence, minimum requirements and oversight is implemented.\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The objectives of the Reputation Risk Management approach are in line with AXA's overall Enterprise Risk Management approach aiming to develop a reputation risk culture and risk intelligence.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGiven the nature of strategic risks, there is no capital charge assessment but a strong strategic Risk Management framework to anticipate and mitigate these risks. Group Risk Management is involved at early stage in major strategic projects ( e.g. large M&A projects). The Group governance standards require among other things a Risk Management second opinion on key processes, including significant transactions and strategic plans. Furthermore, the ORSA report provides an assessment on the overall solvency needs which include the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio projection made until the strategic plan horizon and in stress scenarios as detailed in Section/uni00A05.2.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management/uni00A0- Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)' of this Annual Report.\n\nThree main objectives drive the Reputation Risk Management approach:\n\n- /uni25A0 proactively manage reputation risks, avoid or minimize negative issues impacting the reputation of AXA and build trust among all of AXA stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 define  accountability  for  reputation  risks  across  the organization, at Group and local levels;\n- /uni25A0 implement a common reputation Risk Management framework throughout the organization.\n\nAXA Group monitors in near real-time potential issues and receives periodic top reputation risk reports from local entities.\n\nThe implementation of the Reputation Risk Framework encompasses AXA Group activities including insurance, Asset Management, banking as well as internal service providers.",

Thus, IFRS/uni00A017 should be applied for annual periods starting from January/uni00A01, 2023, with earlier application permitted.\n\nThe current standard on insurance contracts, IFRS/uni00A04, has been amended accordingly to allow insurers qualifying for deferral of IFRS/uni00A09 (see below) two additional years of deferral, and thus, extending to 2023 the temporary exemption for those insurers",

This means that qualifying insurers can apply both standards for the first time to reporting periods beginning on or a/f\\_ter January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\nThe new standard applies to insurance contracts issued, to all reinsurance contracts and to investment contracts with discretionary participating features provided the entity also issues insurance contracts. It requires to separate the following components from insurance contracts: (i)/uni00A0embedded derivatives, if they meet certain specified criteria, (ii)/uni00A0distinct investment components, and (iii)/uni00A0distinct performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services. These components should be accounted for separately in accordance with the related standards.\n\nThe standard defines the level of aggregation to be used for measuring the insurance contract liabilities and the related profitability. Indeed, IFRS/uni00A017 requires to identify portfolios of insurance contracts, which comprise contracts that are subject to similar risks and are managed together. Afterwards, each portfolio of insurance contracts issued shall be divided into three groups:\n\n- /uni25A0 contracts that are onerous at initial recognition;\n- /uni25A0 contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently;\n- /uni25A0 and the remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nMoreover, contracts that are issued more than one year apart should not be in the same group.\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 17 requires a current measurement model, where the general model is based on the following 'building blocks':\n\n- /uni25A0 the fulfilment cash flows (FCF), which comprise:\n- \u00b7 probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows,\n- \u00b7 an adjustment to reflect the time value of money ( i.e . discounting) and the financial risks associated with those future cash flows, and\n- \u00b7 a risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- /uni25A0 the Contractual Service Margin (CSM).\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit for a group of insurance contracts and will be recognized as the entity provides services in the future. The CSM cannot be negative at inception; any net negative amount of the fulfilment cash flows at inception will be recorded in profit or loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of each subsequent reporting period the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts is remeasured to be the sum of:\n\n- /uni25A0 the liability for remaining coverage, which comprises the FCF related to future services and the CSM of the group at that date; and\n- /uni25A0 the liability for incurred claims, which is measured as the FCF related to past services allocated to the group at that date.\n\nThe CSM is adjusted subsequently for changes in cash flows related to future services. However, the CSM cannot be negative,\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nso negative changes in future cash flows that are greater than the remaining CSM are recognized in profit or loss. Interest is also accreted on the CSM at rates locked in at initial recognition of a contract ( i.e . discount rate used at inception to determine the present value of the estimated cash flows). Moreover, the CSM will be released into profit or loss based on coverage units, reflecting the quantity of the benefits provided and the expected coverage duration of the remaining contracts in the group.\n\nThe Variable Fee Approach (VFA) is a mandatory model for measuring contracts with direct participation features (also referred to as 'direct participating contracts'). A contract has a direct participation feature if it meets all three requirements below:\n\n- /uni25A0 the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThis assessment of whether the contract meets these criteria is made at inception of the contract and not revised subsequently, except in case of substantial modification of the contract.\n\nFor these contracts, the CSM is adjusted (i)/uni00A0for changes in the variable fee (entity's share in the change of value of underlying items that corresponds to the revenue of the insurer), (ii)/uni00A0for the time value of money, and (iii)/uni00A0for e/ffect of changes in financial risks not arising from underlying items (such as options and guarantees).\n\nIn addition, a simplified Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) is permitted for the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage if it provides a measurement that is not materially di/fferent from the general model or if the coverage period is one year or less. With the PAA, the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to premiums received at initial recognition less acquisition costs and amounts already recognized as insurance revenue at the closing date. However, the general model remains applicable for the measurement of incurred claims.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the amounts recognized in the statements of financial performance have to be disaggregated into:\n\n- /uni25A0 an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue (corresponding to the insurance service provided over the period) and insurance service expenses ( i.e . incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expense); and\n- /uni25A0 insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nThe  standard  has  to  be  applied  retrospectively  unless impracticable, in which case two options are possible:\n\n- /uni25A0 either the modified retrospective approach: based on reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost and e/ffort to the entity, certain modifications of requirements are applied to the extent their full retrospective\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The implementation of IFRS/uni00A017 and the assessment of its potential impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are in progress.\n\n## IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 9 - Financial instruments, published on July/uni00A024, 2014, replaces IAS/uni00A039. The new standard addresses the following items related to financial instruments:\n\n- /uni25A0 classification and measurement: IFRS/uni00A0 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both (i)/uni00A0the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii)/uni00A0the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding ('SPPI'). If both (i)/uni00A0the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, and (ii)/uni00A0the contractual terms of cash flows are SPPI, the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and realized gains or losses would be recycled through profit or loss upon sale. Assets not fitting either of these categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Additionally, at initial recognition, an entity can use the option to designate a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. For equity instruments that are not held for trading, an entity can also make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of the instruments (including realized gains and losses), dividends being recognized in profit or loss. Additionally, for financial liabilities that are measured as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the e/ffects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 impairment: the impairment model under IFRS/uni00A09 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS/uni00A039. Under the IFRS/uni00A09 approach, it is no longer\n\nI\n\nI\n\nnecessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition;\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge accounting: IFRS/uni00A09 introduces new requirements for hedge accounting that align hedge accounting more closely with Risk Management. The requirements establish a more principles-based approach to the general hedge accounting model. The amendments apply to all hedge accounting with the exception of portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk (commonly referred to as 'fair value macro hedges'). For these, an entity may continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements currently in IAS/uni00A0 39. This exception was granted largely because the IASB is addressing macro hedge accounting as a separate project.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 and the assessment of its potential impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, in combination with IFRS/uni00A017, are in progress.\n\nThe published e/ffective date of IFRS/uni00A09 was January/uni00A01, 2018.\n\nHowever, amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts/uni00A0'Applying IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments with IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts', published on September/uni00A012, 2016, and 'Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS/uni00A09', published on June/uni00A025, 2020, have changed the existing IFRS/uni00A04 to allow entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to mitigate certain e/ffects of applying IFRS/uni00A09 before the IASB's new insurance contract standard, IFRS/uni00A017, becomes e/ffective. The amendments provide two alternative options:\n\n- (i) apply a temporary exemption from implementing IFRS/uni00A09 until the earlier of (i)/uni00A0the effective date of IFRS/uni00A017, or (ii)/uni00A0annual reporting periods beginning on or a/f\\_ter January/uni00A01, 2023, following the deferral of the e/ffective application of IFRS/uni00A017 until the same date. Additional disclosures related to financial assets are required during the deferral period. This option is only available to entities whose activities are predominately connected with insurance and that have not applied IFRS/uni00A09 previously;/uni00A0or\n- (ii) adopt IFRS/uni00A09 but, for designated financial assets, remove from profit or loss the e/ffects of some of the accounting mismatches that may occur before IFRS/uni00A017 is implemented. During the interim period, additional disclosures are required.\n\nThe  Group  is  eligible  for  the  temporary  exemption option/uni00A0(i). Consequently, the Group has decided to defer the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 until the effective date of the new insurance contracts standard, as mentioned above . Disclosures related to financial assets required during the deferral period are included in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.",

This practical\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nexpedient enables entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities that are subject to a change with recognition of a corresponding modification gain or loss in profit or loss.\n\nIn addition, the amendments provide several exceptions to the hedge accounting requirements so that entities will be able to update the designation of the hedging relationship in response to the replacement of the original benchmark rate and to continue with the hedging relationships a/f\\_ter transition to the alternative benchmark rate.\n\nAdditional disclosures will be required to assist users of financial statements in assessing the progress an entity has made on transitioning from IBOR to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nAXA does not early adopt the amendments as the transition of financial instruments and leases of the Group from IBOR benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates is operated starting from 2021.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS/uni00A04 - deferral of IFRS/uni00A09\n\nAs mentioned above, on June/uni00A025, 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS/uni00A04 Insurance contracts extending the expiry date of the temporary exemption in IFRS/uni00A04 from applying IFRS/uni00A09 by two years, i.e . to January/uni00A01, 2023. It enables insurers eligible for this temporary exception to align the e/ffective dates of IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments and IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance contracts.

It requires a degree of judgment in the application of the Group accounting principles described below. The main balance sheet captions concerned are goodwill (in particular impairment tests described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.1), intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the value of acquired business in force, deferred acquisition costs and equivalent, certain assets accounted at fair value, deferred tax assets, liabilities relating to the insurance business, pension benefit obligations and balances related to share-based compensation. The principles set out below specify the measurement methods used for these items. These methods, along with key assumptions where required, are discussed in greater depth in the notes relating to the asset and liability items concerned where meaningful and useful.\n\nIn 2020, the environment in which AXA operates was deeply a/ffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This context has created\n\nI\n\nI\n\nadditional uncertainty regarding the estimation of the ultimate cost of net claims triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic which necessitated a high degree of judgment, and the insurance liabilities reflect the management's best estimate of both the direct consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental measures implemented in response to the crisis.\n\nAs recommended by IAS/uni00A01, assets and liabilities are generally classified globally on the balance sheet in increasing order of liquidity, which is more relevant for financial institutions than a classification between current and non-current items. As a standard practice for insurance companies, expenses are classified by destination in the income statement.\n\nAll amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and in the Notes are expressed in Euro/uni00A0million.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 CONSOLIDATION\n\n## 1.3.1 Scope and basis of consolidation\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises control are subsidiaries. They are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to AXA. Under IFRS/uni00A010, AXA controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the investee. Only substantive rights ( i.e . the holder must have the practicability to exercise them) and rights that are not protective shall be considered. AXA can have power with less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, in particular through:\n\n- /uni25A0 the proportion of ownership with regards to the other investors;\n- /uni25A0 potential voting rights;\n- /uni25A0 a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders;\n- /uni25A0 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or\n- /uni25A0 a combination of these indicators.\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A011, companies over which AXA exercises a joint controlling influence alongside one or more third parties are joint ventures and are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Under IAS/uni00A028, significant influence is presumed when AXA directly or indirectly holds 20% or more of the voting rights. Significant influence can also be exercised through an agreement with other shareholders.\n\nUnder the equity method, AXA's share of equity investments' postacquisition profit or loss is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is stated under 'Other reserves'.\n\nInvestment funds and real estate companies are either fully consolidated or accounted for under the equity method, depending on which conditions of IFRS/uni00A010/IFRS/uni00A011/IAS/uni00A028 listed above they satisfy. Fees received by asset managers are also taken into account in the assessment of the exposure to variability of returns. For fully consolidated investment funds, minority interests are recognized at fair value and shown as liabilities in the balance sheet if the companies' instruments can be redeemed at any time by the holder at fair value. Investment funds accounted by equity method are shown under the balance sheet caption 'Financial investments'.\n\nSome companies in which AXA exercises control, a joint controlling influence or a significant influence are excluded from the scope of consolidation as they are not material with respect to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. These are mainly investment funds.\n\n## 1.3.2 Business combinations and subsequent changes in the Group ownership interest\n\nIn accordance with the option made available by IFRS/uni00A01/uni00A0First-time adoption of IFRS, business combinations prior to 2004 were not restated with respect to French accounting principles in force at the time.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED OF NEWLY ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nUpon first consolidation, all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (unless they are not present obligations) of the acquired company are estimated at their fair value. However, in compliance with an exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04, liabilities related to life insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participating features are maintained at the carrying value prior to the acquisition date to the extent that this measurement basis is consistent with AXA's accounting principles. The fair value of acquired business in force relating to life insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features is recognized as an asset corresponding to the present value of estimated future profits emerging on acquired business in force at the date of acquisition (also referred to as value of acquired business in force or VBI and reflecting the di/fference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liabilities). The present value of future profits takes into consideration the cost of capital and is estimated using actuarial assumptions based on projections made at purchase date but also using a discount rate that includes a risk premium.\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features do not benefit from the exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04 in Phase/uni00A0I of the IASB's insurance project such as described above, under which the fair value of acquired liabilities is booked through the recognition of an asset corresponding to the value of acquired business in force. Liabilities relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are measured directly at fair value. In accordance with IAS/uni00A039, the fair value of these contracts cannot be less than surrender value when they contain a demand feature.\n\nOther identifiable intangible assets such as the value of customer relationships should be recognized. The value of customer relationships intangible represents the value of future cash flows expected from renewals and the cross-selling of new products to customers known and identified at the time of the acquisition. These projections include assumptions regarding claims, expenses and financial revenues, or they can be estimated on the basis of the New Business Value. In line with accounting practices in force before the adoption of IFRS, which may continue to be applied under IFRS/uni00A04, future premiums relating to acquired business may be recognized in the 'Value of acquired business in force' item.\n\nTo the extent that these other intangible assets can be estimated separately, they can also be measured by looking at the purchased marketing resources that will allow to generate these future cash flows. The nature of the intangible assets recognized is consistent with the valuation methods used when purchasing the acquired entity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In the estimate of the contingent element, attention is paid to use assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used for the valuation of intangible assets such as VBI. For business combinations that occurred before January/uni00A01, 2009, any contingent element was included in the cost of the combination to the extent the adjustment was probable and could be measured reliably. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination continues to be adjusted accordingly, taking account of the impact in terms of additional goodwill and/or adjustments of the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. For business combinations on or after January/uni00A01, 2009, any change to the estimate of the contingent element between the acquisition date and the amount actually subsequently paid is recognized in the income statement.\n\nDirect transaction costs related to a business combination are charged in the income statement when incurred.\n\nIn step acquisitions, any previous minority interest held by the Group is measured at fair value and the resulting adjustment is recognized through net income. Similarly, when an additional purchase changes the control from significant influence or joint control to control, any investment pre-existing in a former associate/joint venture is re-measured to its fair value with the gain or loss through net income (consequently also resulting in a new goodwill).\n\nAccording to a decision taken for each acquisition, any minority interest may be measured at fair value or at its proportionate interest in the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of (i)/uni00A0the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any minority interest in the acquiree and in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii)/uni00A0the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIf the cost of acquisition is less than the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the difference is directly recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAdjustments can be made to goodwill within twelve/uni00A0months of the acquisition date, if new information becomes available to complete the initial accounting. In this case, comparative information is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.\n\nIf, a/f\\_ter the period of twelve/uni00A0months, a deferred tax asset, initially considered as not recoverable, finally meets the recognition criteria, the corresponding tax benefit is recorded in the consolidated statement of income without a corresponding adjustment in goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash generating units corresponding/uni00A0to (i)/uni00A0the companies acquired or portfolios of business acquired according to their expected profitability, and (ii)/uni00A0the entities already within the AXA Group that will benefit from the synergies of the combination with the activities acquired. This allocation of goodwill is used both for segment reporting and for impairment testing.\n\n## PURCHASE AND SALE OF MINORITY INTERESTS IN/uni00A0A/uni00A0CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY\n\nPurchase and sale transactions of minority interests in a controlled subsidiary that do not change the conclusion of control are recorded through shareholders' equity (including direct acquisition costs).\n\nIf control in a subsidiary is lost, any gain or loss is recognized in net income. Furthermore, if an investment in the entity is retained by the Group, it is re-measured to its fair value and any gain or loss is also recognized in net income.\n\n## PUT OVER MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nWhen control over a subsidiary is acquired, a put option may be granted to minority shareholders. However, the recognition of the puttable instruments as a liability depends on the contractual obligations.\n\nWhen the contract involves an unconditional commitment exercisable by the option holder, it is recognized as a liability. Since the balancing entry to this liability is not specified by current IFRS, the Group's method is/uni00A0to (i)/uni00A0reclassify minority interests from equity to liability, (ii)/uni00A0re-measure this liability at the present value of the option price, and (iii)/uni00A0recognize the difference either as an increase in goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, or as a decrease in equity (Group share) for a put granted a/f\\_ter January/uni00A01, 2009, to the extent there is no immediate transfer of risks and rewards. Similarly, subsequent changes in the liability are recorded against goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, and against equity (Group share) for puts granted a/f\\_ter that date.",

However, in case of a loss, an impairment test is performed, in order to assess whether an impairment of the underlying item has to be booked.\n\nIn the event of an internal sale of an asset that is not intended to be held on the long term by the Group, deferred tax is recognized as the current tax calculated on the realized gain or loss is eliminated. The income statement impact of the potential policyholders' participation resulting from this transaction is also eliminated, and a deferred policyholders' participation asset or liability is posted to the statement of financial position.\n\nIn addition, the transfer of consolidated shares, between two consolidated subsidiaries but held with different ownership percentages, should not impact the Group net income. The only exception would be any related tax and policyholders' participation recorded in connection to the transaction, which are maintained in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These transfers also have an impact on Group shareholders' equity (with a balancing entry recorded in minority interests). This impact is identified in the 'other' changes of the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.\n\n## 1.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Euro/uni00A0million, the Euro being the Group's presentational currency.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency ( i.e . the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) di/fferent from the Group presentational currency are translated as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 assets and liabilities of entities in a functional currency di/fferent from Euro are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- /uni25A0 revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the period;\n- /uni25A0 all resulting foreign exchange di/fferences are recognized as a separate component of equity (translation di/fferences).\n\nAt the local entity level, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nprevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at closing rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied as explained in paragraph/uni00A01.10.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraph/uni00A01.3.2, goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nForeign exchange di/fferences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, borrowings and other currency instruments qualifying for hedge accounting of such investment are recorded in shareholders' equity under translation di/fferences and are recycled in the income statement as part of the realized gain or loss on disposal of the hedged net investment.\n\nForeign exchange di/fferences arising from monetary financial investments available for sale are recognized as income or expense for the period in respect of the portion corresponding to amortized cost. The residual translation di/fferences relating to fair value changes are recorded in shareholders' equity, like for non-monetary items such as equity securities.\n\nRegarding the cumulative amount of the exchange di/fferences related to disposed business, the Group applies the step-by-step consolidation method (IFRIC/uni00A016).\n\n## 1.5 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described below for all assets and liabilities where another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurement in the Notes. Principles below address mostly assets given the nature of the activities of the Group.\n\n## 1.5.1 Active market: quoted price\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities traded on active markets are determined using quoted market prices when available. An instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis between a willing seller and a willing buyer. For financial instruments traded in active markets, quotes received from external pricing services represent consensus prices, i.e . using similar models and inputs resulting in a very limited dispersion.\n\nThe fair value amounts of assets and liabilities for which fair value is determined in whole directly by reference to an active market are disclosed as level/uni00A01 in the Notes/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Liquidity for debt instruments is assessed using a multi-criteria approach including the number of quotes available, the place of issuance and the evolution of the widening of bid ask spreads.\n\nA financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market:\n\n- /uni25A0 if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument;\n- /uni25A0 when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity;\n- /uni25A0 in case of significant illiquidity;\n- /uni25A0 if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions.\n\nCharacteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/fferent in nature, inherent to the instrument or indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\n## 1.5.3 Assets and liabilities not quoted in an active market\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are estimated using:\n\n- /uni25A0 external and independent pricing services; or\n- /uni25A0 valuation techniques.\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in active market mainly based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A02 in the Notes/uni00A0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFair values mainly not based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A03 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of external pricing services.\n\nExternal pricing services may be fund asset managers in the case of non-consolidated investments in funds or brokers. To the extent possible, the Group collects quotes from external pricing providers as inputs to measure fair value. Prices received may form tight clusters or dispersed quotes which may then lead to the use of valuation techniques. The dispersion of quotes\n\nI\n\nI\n\nreceived may be an indication of the large range of assumptions used by external pricing providers given the limited number of transactions to be observed or reflect the existence of distress transactions. In addition, given current market conditions since the financial crisis and the persistency of complete inactivity of some markets since then, many financial institutions closed their desks dedicated to structured assets deals and are no longer in a position to deliver meaningful quotes.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of valuation techniques.\n\nThe objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants (a willing buyer and a willing seller) at the measurement date. Valuation techniques include:\n\n- \u00b7 market approach: the consideration of recent prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving substantially similar assets or liabilities;\n- \u00b7 income approach: use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other present value techniques to  convert  future  amounts  to  a  single  current  ( i.e . discounted) amount;\n- \u00b7 cost approach: the consideration of amounts that would currently be required to construct or replace the service capacity of an asset.\n\nValuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgment is involved in establishing fair values. They include recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable willing parties on similar assets if available and representative of fair value and involve various assumptions regarding the underlying price, yield curve, correlations, volatility, default rates and other factors. Unlisted equity instruments valuation is based on cross checks using di/fferent methodologies such as discounted cash flows techniques, price earning ratios multiples, adjusted net asset values, taking into account recent transactions on instruments which are substantially the same if concluded at arm's length between knowledgeable willing parties, if any. The use of valuation techniques and assumptions could produce di/fferent estimates of fair value. However, valuations are determined using generally accepted models (discounted cash flows, Black/uni00A0& Scholes models,/uni00A0etc.) based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or underlyings (index, credit spread,/uni00A0etc.) whenever such directly observable data are available and valuations are adjusted for liquidity and credit risk.\n\nValuation techniques may be used when there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the market, when quotes made available by external pricing providers are too dispersed or when market conditions are so dislocated that observed data cannot be used or need significant adjustments. Internal mark to model valuations are therefore normal market practices for certain assets and liabilities inherently scarcely traded or exceptional processes implemented due to specific market conditions.",

        "page_content": "- /uni25A0 Use of valuation techniques in dislocated markets.\n\nThe dislocation of certain markets may be evidenced by various factors. For example, a very large widening of bid ask spreads may be a helpful indicator in understanding whether market participants are willing to transact. The dislocation of markets may also be suspected in cases of wide dispersion in the prices (over time or among market participants), small number of transactions, closing down of primary and/or secondary markets, forced transactions motivated by needs of liquidity or other di/fficult financial conditions with insu/fficient time to market the assets to be sold, and large bulk sales to exit such markets at all costs that may involve side arrangements (such as sellers providing finance for a sale to a buyer). In such cases, the Group uses valuation techniques including observable data whenever possible and relevant, adjusted if needed to develop the best estimate of fair value, including adequate risk premiums or develops a valuation model based on unobservable data representing estimates of assumptions that willing market participants would use when prices are not current, relevant or available without undue costs and e/fforts: in inactive markets, transactions may be inputs when measuring fair value, but would likely not be determinative and unobservable data may be more appropriate than observable inputs.\n\n## 1.6 SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe segmental analysis provided in AXA's Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements reflects six operating business segments. These segments are determined on the basis of geographies or transversally for entities operating in various jurisdictions, and include France, Europe, Asia, AXA XL, International and Transversal & Central Holdings.\n\n## 1.7 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 1.7.1 Goodwill and impairment of goodwill\n\nGoodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized but subject to a regular test for impairment. Impairment tests are performed at least annually. Impairment of goodwill is not reversible.\n\nAXA performs an/uni00A0impairment test of goodwill by cash generating unit, using valuation approaches that rely on parameters such as market indicators, market value of assets, market value of liabilities and future operating profits, derived on the basis of operational and economic assumptions in order to determine any significant adverse changes that might lead to the non-\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nrecoverability of the goodwill. Compliant with IAS/uni00A036, within each cash generating unit, a comparison is made between net book value and the recoverable value (equal to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Value in use consists of the net assets and the value placed on expected future earnings from existing and new business. For Life & Savings segment, the value of future expected earnings is estimated on the basis of embedded value models or similar calculations for other activities. Fair value less costs to sell is determined in compliance with IFRS/uni00A013 fair value as described in paragraph/uni00A01.5.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for a cash generating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit or group of units is less than the carrying amount of the unit or group of units.\n\nFair value approach is based on risk neutral valuation techniques taking into account:\n\n- /uni25A0 the current shareholders' net asset value plus the future profitability of the business in force:\n- \u00b7 the current shareholders' net asset value is adjusted to take into account any di/fference between the basis of cash flows projections used in the value of business in force calculations and IFRS,\n- \u00b7 the profitability of business in force is determined using the embedded value methodology, which is an industrywide and specific valuation approach, consistent with the principle of discounted earnings, as the value of business in force is represented by the discounted value of future earnings from the in-force portfolios. The Group uses however both market consistent risk neutral approaches, aligned with fair-value calculations, and traditional discounted cash flows projections;\n- /uni25A0 the profitability of future new business:\n- \u00b7 the value of future new business is computed either on the basis of multiples of a standardized year of new business contribution (present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a year) or on a projection of each of the expected annual future earnings when multiples are not appropriate. The determination of the future earnings arising from the new business relies upon the use of operational and economic assumptions, both of which are compliant with the requirements of the di/fferent regulatory frameworks,\n- \u00b7 the recoverable value of the Life & Savings segment is first assessed on a risk free basis (basic test) and then on the basis of illustrative investment assumptions suitable for a traditional embedded value approach if the recoverable value determined for the basic test is lower than the carrying amount,\n\nI\n\n6",

Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate and a terminal value.\n\n## 1.7.2 Value of purchased life insurance business in force (VBI)\n\nThe value of purchased insurance contracts and investment contracts  with  discretionary  participating  features recognized in a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2) is amortized as profits emerge over the life of the contracts' portfolio. In conjunction with the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.2), VBI is subject to annual recoverability testing based on actual experience and expected changes in the main assumptions.\n\n## 1.7.3 Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) relating to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features rights to future management fees, also known as deferred origination costs (DOC) relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nThe incremental direct costs of acquiring a portfolio of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating  features,  primarily  related  to  the  selling, underwriting and initiating the insurance contracts in a portfolio, are deferred by recognizing an asset, Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC). In Property & Casualty segment, DAC are amortized over the terms of the policies, as premium is earned. For Life & Savings segment, the asset is amortized based on the estimated gross profits emerging over the life of the contracts. This asset is tested for recoverability and any amount above future estimated gross profits is expensed. DAC are also tested through the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.2).\n\nFor investment contracts with no discretionary participating features, a similar asset is recognized, i.e . rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC) (see Note/uni00A07) but limited to incremental costs directly attributable to the provision of investment management services. This asset is amortized by taking into account projections of fees collected over the life of the contracts. The amortization of DOC is reviewed at each closing date to reflect changes in assumptions and experience. This asset is also tested for recoverability.\n\nDAC and DOC are reported gross of unearned revenues and fees reserves. These unearned revenues and fees reserves are separately recognized as liabilities and are amortized over the contract term using the same amortization approach as the one used for DAC and DOC.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.7.4 Unearned revenues reserves\n\nRevenues received at contract inception to cover future services are deferred and recognized in the income statement using the same amortization pattern as the one used for deferred acquisition costs.\n\n## 1.7.5 Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include so/f\\_tware developed for internal use for which direct costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives.\n\nThey also include customer relationships intangibles as well as distribution agreements recognized as a result of business combinations. If these assets have a finite useful life, they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. In all cases, they are subject to impairment tests, at each closing for assets with a finite useful life and at least annually for other assets. In the event of a significant decline in value, an impairment is booked corresponding to the di/fference between the value on the balance sheet and the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## 1.8 INVESTMENTS FROM INSURANCE, BANKING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nInvestments include investment in real estate properties and financial instruments including equity instruments, debt instruments and loans.\n\n## 1.8.1 Investment in real estate properties\n\nInvestment in real estate properties (excluding investment in real estate properties totally or partially backing liabilities arising from contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders) is recognized at cost. The properties components are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, also considering their residual value if it may be reliably estimated.\n\nIn case of unrealized loss over 15%, an impairment is recognized for the di/fference between the net book value of the investment property and the fair value of the asset based on an independent valuation. Furthermore, at the level of each reporting entity, if the cumulated amount of unrealized losses under 15% (without o/ffsetting with unrealized gains) represents more than 10% of the cumulated net cost of real estate assets, additional impairment is booked on a line-by-line approach until the 10% threshold is reached.\n\nIf, in subsequent periods, the appraisal value rises to at least 15% more than the net carrying value, previously recorded impairment is reversed to the extent of the di/fference between (i)/uni00A0the net carrying value and (ii)/uni00A0the lower of the appraisal value and the depreciated cost (before impairment).",

As specified above, the financial instruments held in the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios' are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through income statement.\n\nAssets  designated  as  available  for  sale,  trading  assets, investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss and all derivatives are measured at fair value, i.e . the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. The Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLoans which are not designated under the fair value option are accounted at amortized cost using the e/ffective interest rate method.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAXA assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or a group of financial investments at (amortized) cost or designated as available for sale should be impaired. A financial asset or group of financial investments should be impaired when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events and this event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the assets that can be reliably estimated.\n\nFor debt instruments classified as 'held to maturity' or 'available for sale', an impairment based respectively on future cash flows discounted using the initial e/ffective interest rate or on fair value is recorded through the income statement if future cash flows may not be fully recoverable due to a credit event relating to the instrument issuer. A downgrade of an entity's credit rating is not, of itself, evidence of impairment. If the credit risk is eliminated or improves, the impairment may be reversed. The amount of the reversal is also recognized in the income statement.\n\nFor equity instruments classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its carrying value is considered as indication for potential impairment, such as equity instruments showing unrealized losses over a 6/uni00A0months period or more (prior to the closing date), or unrealized losses in excess of 20% of the net carrying value at the closing date. If such evidence exists for an available for sale financial asset, the cumulative loss - measured as the di/fference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment on that financial asset already booked in the income statement - is removed from shareholders' equity and an impairment is recognized through the income statement. Equity instruments impairment recognized in the income statement cannot be reversed through the income statement until the asset is sold or derecognized.\n\nImpairment testing for loans available for sale is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate (down to the loan's observable market price), or on the fair value of the collateral.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

A more global test is then performed on groups of assets with similar risk profile.\n\nMethods for calculating the net book value of assets sold (average cost, first-in first-out,/uni00A0etc.) depend on local Assets and Liabilities Management (ALM) strategies as these strategies have been set up to take into account specific commitments to policyholders. These methods may di/ffer within the Group provided that they are used consistently at each entity level.\n\n## 1.8.3 Repurchase agreements and securities lending\n\nThe Group is party to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to repurchase these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. Since substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty with a corresponding agreement. Cash flows equal to those of the underlying assets will be remitted to the Group in exchange for specified payments taking into account any increase or decline in the fair value of the assets. This results in substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remaining with the Group. As such, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets.\n\nThe Group is also party to reverse repurchase agreements under which financial assets are purchased from a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to return these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. If substantially all of the risks and rewards of the securities remain with the counterparty over the entire lifetime of the agreement of the transaction, the securities concerned are not recognized as financial assets of the Group. The amounts of cash disbursed are recorded under financial investments, except for transactions arising from banking activities, which are recorded as separate assets. Interest income on reverse repurchase agreements is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\n## 1.9 ASSETS BACKING LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WHERE/uni00A0THE FINANCIAL RISK IS/uni00A0BORNE BY POLICYHOLDERS\n\nAssets backing liabilities arising from insurance or investment contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are presented in a separate aggregate of the balance sheet so that\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthey are shown in a symmetrical manner to the corresponding liabilities. This presentation is considered more relevant for the users and consistent with the liquidity order recommended by IAS/uni00A01 for financial institutions, since the risks are borne by policyholders, whatever the type of assets backing liabilities (investment in real estate properties, debt instruments or equity instruments,/uni00A0etc.). Details of these assets are provided in the Notes.\n\n## 1.10  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at purchase date and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income unless they relate to a qualifying hedge relationship as described below. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (i)/uni00A0hedging of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or of a firm commitment (fair value hedge), or (ii)/uni00A0hedging of highly probable expected future transactions (cash flow hedge), or (iii)/uni00A0hedging of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe Group documents, at inception, the hedge relationship, as well as its Risk Management hedging objectives and strategy. The Group also documents the hedge e/ffectiveness, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, indicating the actual or expected e/fficiency level of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in o/ffsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged underlying items.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGE\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedge are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Therefore, the gain or loss relating to any ine/ffective portion is directly recognized in the income statement.\n\n## CASH FLOW HEDGE\n\nThe e/ffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity. The gain or loss relating to any ine/ffective portion is recognized in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recycled in the income statement when the hedged underlying item impacts the profit or loss for the period (for example when the hedged future transaction is recognized). When a hedging instrument reaches its maturity date or is sold, or when a hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains or losses in shareholders' equity are released in profit or loss when the initially hedged future transaction ultimately impacts the income statement.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGE\n\nThe accounting of net investments in foreign operations hedge is similar to the accounting of cash flow hedge. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the e/ffective portion of the hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity; the gain or loss relating to the ine/ffective portion is recognized in the income",

Given IAS/uni00A039 constraints, only a few hedges are eligible to hedge accounting provisions described above. However, most of the derivatives used by the Group are purchased with a view to hedge or for example to use such instruments as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions'. See Note/uni00A020.\n\nThe Group holds financial investments that also include embedded  derivatives.  Such  embedded  derivatives  are separately recorded and measured at fair value through profit or loss if the impact is deemed material.\n\nFor the statement of financial position, derivatives are presented alongside the underlying assets or liabilities for which they are used, regardless of whether these derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting.\n\nThe purpose and condition of the use of derivatives within the Group are detailed in Note/uni00A020.\n\n## PHASE 1 OF THE IBOR REFORM\n\nStarting from December/uni00A031, 2019, AXA applies the amendments to IAS/uni00A039 and IFRS/uni00A07 - Temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, related to Phase/uni00A01 of the IBOR reform, issued in September/uni00A02019 and endorsed by the European Union on January/uni00A0 15, 2020. These amendments provide temporary reliefs from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform and introduce corresponding disclosure requirements. The reliefs have the e/ffect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ine/ffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the income statement under both IAS/uni00A039 and IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nThe key reliefs provided by the amendment relate to:\n\n- /uni25A0 risk components remain clearly identifiable for fair value hedges;\n- /uni25A0 'highly probable' requirements remain for cash flow hedges;\n- /uni25A0 recycling of the cash flow hedging reserve;\n- /uni25A0 prospective assessments (economic relationship or expected to be 'highly e/ffective') and IAS/uni00A039 retrospective e/ffectiveness test.\n\nThe amendments apply for hedging relationships directly impacted by the IBOR reform qualified as fair value hedges and\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncash flow hedges to ensure the prospective assessments and highly probable requirements are still met given the uncertainty arising from the transition to the new reformed interest rates.\n\nDerivative instruments involved in aforementioned hedges are interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives like interest rate swaps, forward interest rate swaps, bond and foreign exchange forwards and cross currency swaps.\n\nThe main interest rate benchmarks used by those hedges are Euribor, libor USD, libor GBP, hibor HKD and libor CHF.\n\nNominal amounts of derivative instruments a/ffected by the IBOR ( i.e . interest rate derivatives and currencies derivatives notional amounts involved fair value hedging relationships and cash flow hedging relationships) reform and involved in an IAS/uni00A039 hedge accounting relationship are presented in Note/uni00A020.2.\n\n## 1.11  ASSETS/LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND ASSETS/LIABILITIES INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThese comprise assets, particularly buildings or operations, intended to be sold or discontinued within twelve/uni00A0months. Subsidiaries  held  for  sale  remain  within  the  scope  of consolidation until the date on which the Group loses e/ffective control. The assets and activities (assets and liabilities) concerned are measured at the lower of net carrying value and fair value net of selling costs. They are presented in separate asset and liability items on the balance sheet. The liabilities of subsidiaries (excluding shareholders' equity) held for sale are entered separately on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet, with no netting against assets.\n\nIn the event of a discontinuation of operations representing either a business line, a main and distinct geographical region or a subsidiary acquired solely with a view to reselling, their a/f\\_ter-tax contribution is stated on a separate line of the income statement. For comparison purposes, the same applies to the presentation of income statements relating to previous periods that are included in the financial statements. This separate line also includes the post-tax gain/loss recognized on the disposal of the discontinued operation at the date of loss of control.\n\n## 1.12  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits while cash equivalents are short-term, liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to low volatility.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Where treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in consolidated shareholders' equity, net of any directly related costs and tax e/ffects.\n\nHowever, treasury shares held by controlled investment funds backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are not deducted as all risks and income resulting from holding these shares are attributable to policyholders.\n\n## 1.13.5 Preferred shares\n\nPreferred shares issued by the Group are recorded as equity when there is no contractual obligation to redeem and there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial asset.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.14  LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS\n\n## 1.14.1 Contracts classification\n\nThe Group issues contracts that transfer an insurance risk or a financial risk or both.\n\nInsurance contracts, including assumed reinsurance contracts, are contracts that carry significant insurance risks. Such contracts may also transfer financial risk from the policyholders to the insurer. Investment contracts are contracts that carry financial risk with no significant insurance risk.\n\nA number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features. These features entitle the contract holder to receive additional benefits or bonuses on top of these standard benefits:\n\n- /uni25A0 they are likely to represent a significant portion of the overall contractual benefits;\n- /uni25A0 their amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 they are contractually based on the performance of a group of contracts, the investment returns of a financial asset portfolio or the Company profits, a fund or another entity that issues the contract.\n\nIn some insurance or investment contracts, the financial risk is borne by policyholders. Such contracts are usually Unit-Linked contracts.\n\nThe Group classifies its insurance and investment contracts into six categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by policyholders; these relate to Unit-Linked contracts or multifunds contracts containing a non-Unit-Linked fund with discretionary participating features; and\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by policyholders.\n\n## 1.14.2 Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features\n\nExcept where IAS/uni00A039 applies, according to IFRS/uni00A04, recognition and derecognition are based on the AXA accounting policies existing prior to IFRS and are described below, except for the elimination",

Post claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in limited cases (a detail of discounted reserves is shown in Note/uni00A014.10).\n\n## PRE-CLAIMS RESERVES\n\nUnearned premium reserves of non-life insurance contracts represent the prorata portion of written premiums that relates to unexpired risks at the closing date.\n\nFor traditional life insurance contracts (that is, contracts with significant mortality or morbidity risk), the future policy benefits reserves are calculated on a prospective basis according to each country's regulation provided methods used are consistent with the Group's policies and using assumptions on investment yields, morbidity/mortality and expenses.\n\nChanges in reserves are booked if there are impacts caused by a change in the mortality table.\n\nFuture policy benefits reserves relating to investment contracts with discretionary participation features (previously called 'savings contracts' in AXA's accounting principles) that carry low mortality and morbidity risk are generally calculated using a prospective approach based on discount rates usually set at inception with reserves similar to the retrospective approach ( i.e . 'account balance' methodology).\n\nThe discount rates used by AXA are less than or equal to the expected future investment yields (assessed on prudent basis).\n\nPart of the policyholders participation reserve is included in future policy benefits reserves, according to contractual clauses. Except when these guarantees are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments (see next paragraph), guaranteed minimum benefits reserves relating to contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders (insurance contracts because they include such guarantees or investment contracts with discretionary participating features), are built over the life of the contract based on a prospective approach: the present value of future benefit obligations to be\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\npaid to policyholders in relation to these guarantees is estimated on the basis of reasonable scenarios. These scenarios are based on assumptions including investment returns, volatility, surrender and mortality rates. This present value of future benefit obligations is reserved as fees are collected over the life of the contracts.\n\nSome guaranteed benefits such as Guaranteed Minimum Death or Income Benefits (GMDB or GMIB), or certain guarantees on return proposed by reinsurance treaties, are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments. In order to minimize the accounting mismatch between liabilities and hedging derivatives, AXA has chosen to use the option allowed under IFRS/uni00A04.24 to re-measure its provisions: this revaluation is carried out at each account closing based on guarantee level projections and considers interest rates and other market assumptions. The liabilities revaluation impact in the current period is recognized through income, symmetrically with the impact of the change in value of hedging derivatives. This change in accounting principles was adopted on the first time application of IFRS on January/uni00A01, 2004, for contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program at that date. Any additional contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program a/f\\_ter this date are valued on the same terms as those that applied on the date the program was first applied.\n\n## POST CLAIMS RESERVES\n\n## Claims reserves (life and non-life contracts)\n\nThe purpose of claims reserves is to cover the ultimate cost of settling an insurance claim. Claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in cases such as disability annuities.\n\nClaims reserves include the claims incurred and reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs. Claims reserves are based on historical claims data, current trends, actual payment patterns for all insurance business lines as well as expected changes in inflation, regulatory environment or anything else that could impact amounts to be paid.\n\n## Shadow accounting and Deferred policyholders Participation Asset (DPA) or Liability (DPL)\n\nIn compliance with the option in IFRS/uni00A04, shadow accounting is applied to insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features. Shadow accounting includes adjustments to technical liabilities, policyholders participation, other obligations, deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force to take into account unrealized gains or losses on insurance liabilities or assets in the same way as it is done for a realized gain or loss of invested assets.\n\nFor example, for contracts with discretionary participating features,  shadow  accounting  consists  in  recognizing policyholders participation in unrealized capital gains and\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Thus, when an unrealized gain is recognized, a deferred participating liability (DPL) is recorded. In case of an unrealized loss, a deferred participating asset (DPA) should be recognized only in the extent that its recoverability as defined below is highly probable. Deferred participating liabilities and assets are calculated using an appropriate long-term participation rate based on a contractual, regulatory and constructive obligation to allocate a percentage of gains/losses to policyholders. Jurisdictions where participating business is significant are Switzerland (for group insurance policies), Germany and France where the minimum is set to 90%, 90% and 85% respectively, of a basis which may include not only financial income but also other components. Participating business is less prevalent in Japan.\n\nDPL is fully recognized in the liabilities. As a consequence, there is no component recognized as an equity component and AXA does not need to ensure the liability recognized for the whole contract is not less than the amount that would result from applying IAS/uni00A039 to the guaranteed element.\n\nWhen a net unrealized loss (unrealized change in fair value, impairment, expense related\u2026) is accounted, a deferred participating asset (DPA) may be recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that it can be charged to policyholders, by entity, in the future. This could be the case if the DPA can be offset against future participation either directly through deduction of the DPL from future capital gains or the DPL netted against value of businesses in force or indirectly through deduction of future fees on premiums or margins.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses on assets classified as trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss, along with any other entry impacting the income statement and generating a timing difference, are accounted for through the income statement with a corresponding shadow entry adjustment also in the statement of income. The shadow accounting adjustments relating to unrealized gains and losses on assets available for sale (for which change in fair value is taken to shareholders' equity) are booked through shareholders' equity.\n\n## Recoverability tests and liability adequacy test (LAT)\n\n## Deferred participation\n\nWhen a net deferred participation asset is recognized, the Group uses liquidity analyses performed by the entities to assess the capacity to hold assets showing unrealized loss position, if any, generating such debits. The Group then performs projections to compare the value of assets backing policyholders' contracts with expected payments to be made to policyholders.\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nIn addition, at each balance sheet date, liability adequacy tests are performed in each consolidated entity in order to ensure the adequacy of the contract liabilities net of related DAC and VBI assets and deferred policyholders' participation asset. To perform these tests, entities group contracts together according\n\nI\n\nI\n\nto how they have been acquired, are serviced and have their profitability measured. Entities use current best estimates of all future contractual cash flows as well as claims handling and administrative expenses, and take into account guarantees and investment yields relating to assets backing these contracts:\n\n- /uni25A0 such tests are based on the intention and capacity of entities to hold financial assets according to various sets of scenarios, excluding the value of new business;\n- /uni25A0 they include projections of future investments sales according to estimated surrender patterns; and\n- /uni25A0 they determine the extent to which resulting gains/losses may be allocated/charged to policyholders, i.e . profit sharing between policyholders and shareholders.\n\nThese tests therefore measure the capacity to charge estimated future losses to policyholders on the basis of the assessment of the holding horizon and potential realization of losses among unrealized losses existing at closing date.\n\nContract specific risks directly related to the contracts (insurance risk, asset return risk, inflation risk, persistency, adverse selection,/uni00A0etc.) are also considered.\n\nDepending on the type of business, the future investment cash flows and discounting may be based on a deterministic best estimate rate, with corresponding participation, or in the case of Guaranteed Minimum Benefits, stochastic scenarios. Testing is performed either by a comparison of the reserve booked net of related assets (DAC, VBI,/uni00A0etc.) directly with discounted cash flows, or by ensuring that the discounted profit net of participation from release of the technical provisions exceeds net related assets.\n\nAny identified deficiency is charged to the income statement, initially by respectively writing off DPA, DAC or VBI, and subsequently by establishing a LAT provision for losses arising from the liability adequacy test for any amount in excess of DPA, DAC and VBI. For non-life insurance contracts, an unexpired risk provision is recognized for contracts on which the premiums are expected to be insu/fficient to cover expected future claims and claims expenses.\n\n## Embedded derivatives in insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features\n\nEmbedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are not separately measured. All other embedded derivatives are bifurcated and booked at fair value when material (with change in fair value recognized through income statement) if they are not considered as closely related to the host insurance contract and/or do not meet the definition of an insurance contract.\n\nEmbedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are described in Note/uni00A014.11.",

        "page_content": "## 1.14.3 Investment contracts with no/uni00A0discretionary participating features\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A039, these contracts are accounted for using 'deposit accounting', which mainly results in not recognizing the cash flows corresponding to premiums, benefits and claims in the statement of income (see 'Revenue recognition' paragraph/uni00A0below). These cash flows shall rather be recognized as deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThis category includes mainly Unit-Linked contracts that do not meet the definition of insurance or investment contracts with discretionary participating features. For these Unit-Linked contracts, the liabilities are valued at current unit value, i.e . on the basis of the fair value of the financial investments backing those contracts at the balance sheet date together with rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC, described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.3).\n\n## UNEARNED FEES RESERVES\n\nFees received at inception of an investment contract with no discretionary participating features to cover future services are recognized as liabilities and accounted in the income statement based on the same amortization pattern as the one used for deferred origination costs.\n\n## 1.15  REINSURANCE\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Group's acceptance of certain insurance risks that other companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance refers to the transfer of insurance risk, along with the related premiums, to other reinsurers who will assume the risks. Indeed, in the normal course of business, the Group seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers.\n\nWhen these contracts meet the insurance contracts classification requirements, transactions relating to reinsurance are accounted for in the balance sheet and income statement in a similar way to direct business transactions in agreement with contractual clauses. Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed (and any commissions recorded thereon are earned) on a monthly prorata basis over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided. Ceded unearned reinsurance premiums represent the portion of premiums ceded applicable to the unexpired term of policies in force. Reinstatement premiums ceded are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully expensed when recognized. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. Provisions are made for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount accordingly and recognizes that impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred a/f\\_ter initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.\n\nIf the Group determines that reinsurance contracts do not meet the insurance contracts definition and/or principally transfers financial risk, the agreement is recorded using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits received are included in payables and deposits made are included within receivables. As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted as appropriate.\n\n## 1.16  FINANCING DEBT\n\nFinancing debt issued to finance the solvency requirements of operational entities or to acquire a portfolio of contracts is isolated in a specific aggregate of the statement of financial position and is accounted for at amortized cost.\n\n## 1.17  OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.17.1 Income taxes\n\nThe current income tax expense (benefit) is recorded in the income statement on the basis of local tax regulations.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities emerge from temporary di/fferences between the accounting and fiscal values of assets and liabilities, and when applicable from tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to o/ffset the temporary di/fferences taking into account the existence of tax groups and any legal or regulatory requirements on the limits (in terms of amounts or timing) relating to the carry forwards of unused tax credits. The recoverability of deferred tax assets recognized in previous periods is re-assessed at each closing.\n\nIn particular, a deferred tax liability is recognized for any taxable temporary di/fference relating to the value of shares in a consolidated company held, unless the Group controls at what date the temporary di/fference will reverse and it is probable that the temporary di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. If a Group company decides to sell its stake in another consolidated entity, the di/fference between the carrying value and the tax value of these shares for the company that holds them leads to the recognition of deferred tax (including as part of a business combination when the Group as the buyer intends to sell or carry out internal restructuring of the shares following the acquisition). The same approach applies to dividend payments\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

These deferred taxes are only released if the goodwill is impaired or if the corresponding consolidated shares are sold.\n\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the expected tax impact, at the balance sheet date. That would follow the way the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. When income taxes are calculated at a di/fferent rate if dividends are paid, deferred taxes are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. The income tax consequences of dividends are only accounted when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\n## 1.17.2 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefits include the benefits payable to AXA Group employees after they retire (retirement compensation, additional pension benefit, health insurance). In order to meet those obligations, some regulatory frameworks have allowed or enforced the set up of dedicated funds (plan assets).\n\nDefined contribution plans: payments are made by the employer to a third party ( e.g . pension trusts). These payments free the employer of any further commitment, and the obligation to pay acquired benefits to the employees is transferred. The contributions paid by the employer are recorded as an expense in the income statement and no liability needs to be recorded once contributions are made.\n\nDefined benefit plans: an actuarial assessment of the commitments based on each plan's internal rules is performed. The present value of the future benefits paid by the employer, known as the DBO (Defined Benefit Obligation), is calculated annually on the basis of long-term projections of rate of salary increase, inflation rate, mortality, staff turnover, pension indexation and remaining service lifetime. The amount recorded in the balance sheet for employee defined benefit plans is the difference between the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation and the market value at the balance sheet date of the corresponding invested plan assets a/f\\_ter adjustment for any minimum funding requirement or any asset ceiling e/ffect. If the net result is positive, a provision is recorded under the provision for risks and charges heading. If the net result is negative, a prepaid pension asset is recorded in the balance sheet but not more than its recoverable amount (asset ceiling). Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in shareholders' equity (in Other Comprehensive Income) in full in the period in which they occur. Similarly, the actual return on assets and any change in asset ceiling, excluding the net interest income on assets, is\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrecognized in shareholders' equity. The regular impact in the income statement mainly relates to the current service cost (annually accruing employee benefit) and the net interest on the amount recorded in the opening balance sheet (unwinding of discount applied to the net liability/asset at start of the annual period, taking into account contributions and benefits payments during the period). Past service cost represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment to a defined benefit plan. It is recognized totally and immediately in the income statement when incurred. Gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan also have an impact in the income statement when the settlement occurs.\n\nIt should be noted that, all cumulative past actuarial gains and losses on all employee benefit plans were recognized in retained earnings as of January/uni00A01, 2004, AXA Group's transition date.\n\n## 1.17.3 Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe Group's share-based compensation plans are predominantly settled in equities.\n\nAll equity-settled share-based compensation plans are accounted for at fair value at the date they were granted and the fair value is expensed over the vesting period.\n\nCash-settled share-based compensation plans are recognized at fair value, which is remeasured at each balance sheet date with any change in fair value recognized in the statement of income.\n\nThe AXA Shareplan issued under a specific French regulatory framework includes a traditional and a leveraged formula (with an application subject to specific local regulations within the Group).\n\nThe cost of the traditional formula of Shareplan is valued according to the specific guidance issued in France by the ANC ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables ). The cost of the leveraged formula plan is valued by taking into account the five-year lockup period for the employees (as in the traditional plan) but adding the value of the advantage granted to the employees by enabling them to benefit from an institutional derivatives-based pricing instead of a retail pricing.\n\n## 1.18  PROVISIONS FOR RISKS, CHARGES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.18.1 Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring provisions other than those that may be recognized on the balance sheet of an acquired company on the acquisition date are recorded when the Group has a present obligation evidenced by a binding sale agreement or a detailed formal plan whose main features are announced to those a/ffected or to their representatives.",

        "page_content": "## 1.18.2 Other provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when the provision can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The same applies to contingent liabilities, except if identified at the time of a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2).\n\nProvisions are measured at management's best estimate, at the balance sheet date, of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, discounted at the market risk-free rate of return for long term provisions.\n\n## 1.19  REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\n## 1.19.1 Gross written premiums\n\nGross written premiums correspond to the amount of premiums written by insurance and reinsurance companies on business incepted in the year with respect to both insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features, net of cancellations and gross of reinsurance ceded. For reinsurance, premiums are recorded on the basis of declarations made by the ceding company, and may include estimates of gross written premiums. Any subsequent di/fferences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.\n\nReinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized.\n\nRetroactive loss portfolio transfer contracts are evaluated to determine whether they meet the established criteria for reinsurance accounting, and, if so, at inception, written premiums are fully earned and corresponding losses and loss expense recognized. The contracts can cause significant variances in gross premiums written, net premiums written, net premiums earned, and net incurred losses in the years in which they are written.\n\n## 1.19.2 Fees and revenues from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nAmounts collected as premiums from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are reported as\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ndeposits net of any loadings and policy fees. Revenues from these contracts consist of loadings and policy fees relating to underwriting, investment management, administration and surrender of the contracts during the period. Front-end fees collected corresponding to fees for future services are recognized over the estimated life of the contract (see 'Unearned fees reserves' paragraph/uni00A01.14.3).\n\n## 1.19.3 Deposit accounting\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features fall within the scope of IAS/uni00A039. Deposit accounting applies to these contracts, which involves the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group directly recognizes the consideration received (apart from potential fees) as a deposit financial liability rather than as revenues;\n- /uni25A0 claims paid are recognized as withdrawals with no posting in the income statement apart from potential fees.\n\n## 1.19.4 Unbundling\n\nThe Group unbundles the deposit component of contracts when required by IFRS/uni00A04, i.e . when both the following conditions are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group can measure separately the 'deposit' component (including any embedded surrender option, i.e . without taking into account the 'insurance' component);\n- /uni25A0 the Group accounting methods do not otherwise require the recognition of all obligations and rights arising from the 'deposit' component.\n\nNo such situation currently exists within the Group. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A04, the Group continues to use the accounting principles previously applied by AXA to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features. According to these principles, all rights and obligations related to contracts are recognized.\n\n## 1.19.5 Change in unearned premiums reserves net of unearned revenues and fees\n\nChanges in unearned premium reserves net of unearned revenues and fees include both the change in the unearned premiums reserve reported as a liability (see 'Unearned premiums reserves' in paragraph/uni00A01.14.2) and the change in unearned revenues and fees. Unearned revenues and fees correspond to upfront charges for future services recognized over the estimated life of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features (see 'Unearned revenues reserves' in paragraph/uni00A01.14.2) and investment contracts with no discretionary participating features (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.3 'Unearned fees reserves').\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In particular, as asset management entities of the Group deliver investment management services to their clients, revenue for providing this service may theoretically occur over-time, with a time-based measure of progress, which is relevant as the service is provided continuously over the contract period.

As a result, as management fees and performance fees received by the Group are generally calculated based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM), they are considered as variable considerations, which are subject to market volatility and are recognized only when uncertainty is resolved.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.19.8 Net investment result excluding financing expenses\n\nNet investment result includes:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment income from investments other than from banking activities, net of depreciation expense on real estate investments (depreciation expense relating to owner occupied properties is included in 'administrative expenses'); this item includes interest received calculated using the e/ffective interest method for debt instruments and dividends received on equity instruments;\n- /uni25A0 investment management expenses (excluding financing debt expenses);\n- /uni25A0 realized investment gains and losses net of releases of impairment following sales;\n- /uni25A0 the change in unrealized gains and losses on invested assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; and\n- /uni25A0 the change in impairment of investments (excluding releases of impairment following sales).\n\nIn respect of banking activities, interest income and expenses are included in the 'Net revenue from banking activities' (see paragraph/uni00A01.19.6).\n\n## 1.20  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nSubsequent events relate to events that occur between the balance sheet date and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue:\n\n- /uni25A0 such events lead to an adjustment of the Consolidated Financial Statements if they provide evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date;\n- /uni25A0 such events result in additional disclosures if indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date, and if relevant and material.",

Structured entities often have a narrow and well-defined objective or restricted activities.\n\nThe Group does not hold significant interests in unconsolidated insurance/reinsurance structured entities.\n\nFurthermore, given its insurance business, the Group holds direct investments in corporates of various sectors, such as debt instruments, equity securities and loans. These investments are not designed to be done in structured entities and the whole Group's exposure is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds interests in investment funds including real estate companies. Some of these funds are fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method (see Note/uni00A02.1.). Other funds are not consolidated because they are not controlled or under significant influence. By nature, and notably because of the power of decision usually given to the asset managers (internal or external to AXA), most of these funds are structured entities.\n\nAs investor, AXA's interests in unconsolidated funds are limited to the investments held. These ones are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Depending on the nature of its investment, AXA receives interests or dividends and can realize capital gains or losses in case of sale. These investments are subject to impairment testing as any financial asset.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

For AXA Belgium the recoverability of the goodwill is assessed using the value in use approach. Both approaches are described in Note/uni00A01.\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment recoverability of goodwill is also assessed using the value in use approach, as described in Note/uni00A01. For AXA Investment Managers the recoverability of the goodwill follows a market approach with recoverable value derived from market information, such as the price to earnings ratio of peers, and the earnings expected for the year. This methodology represents the fair value of the Company to be compared with the market capitalization.\n\n## MAIN ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment, the value in use approach uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering up to three years and discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value. The earnings included in the business plan of each CGU are agreed with AXA Management and defined locally considering best estimate operating assumptions, including expenses and loss ratios, investment income, economic capital, premium rates and taxes, all compliant with the various standards and the requirements of supervisory authorities, when\n\napplicable. The discount rates used for the valuation have been derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which includes assumptions for risk-free interest rates, equity risk premiums, insurance activity beta and leverage ratio that are consistent with the view of AXA's Management for the specific market(s) in which the CGU operates. For the main CGUs discount rates range from 3.4% to 8.4% in 2020, compared to a range of 3.0% to 7.4% in 2019, and growth rates, applied beyond the strategic plan horizon, where applicable, vary from 0.4 % to 5.4 %, compared to a range of 0.0% to 4.4% in 2019.\n\nFor Life & Savings CGUs, recoverable amounts are calculated using a risk neutral approach, relying on European Embedded Value (EEV) techniques, that are industry specific and widely used. The EEV represents the excess of the market value of assets over the market value of liabilities. The market value of the liabilities is based on best estimate liabilities which are the probability weighted average of future cash flows adjusted to allow for the time value of money, using the relevant term structure of the risk-free interest rates, as well as for deviations related to the cost of non-hedgeable, i.e . non-financial, risks. The calculation of the best estimate liabilities involves the use of operational and economic assumptions. Operational assumptions include demographic factors, such as mortality, morbidity and lapse/ surrender rates, expenses allowance and taxes, all compliant with the requirements of supervisory authorities. Future cash flows are discounted using reference rates that are compliant with EIOPA specifications of using swap rates adjusted for credit and volatility risk. The table below shows the adjustments in basis points by currency:\n\n| Reference Yield Curve  (in bps)   |   EUR |   GBP |   USD |   JPY |   CHF |   HKD |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Volatility adjustment (added)     |     7 |    11 |    27 |     9 |     9 |     5 |\n| Credit risk adjustment (deducted) |    10 |    11 |    17 |    10 |    10 |    17 |\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "In the case of AXA Belgium, the recoverable value has been derived using a Traditional Embedded Value (TEV) methodology equivalent to a real world approach here the risk allowance is implicit to the discount rate as the projected cash flows are not risk-adjusted. The discount rate used to determine the recoverable value of AXA Belgium was 4.5% as opposed to 4.0% used in 2019.\n\n## ALL CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGU)\n\nThe results of cash flow projections exceed the net carrying amount of each related CGU or group of units.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of AXA XL CGU as of December/uni00A031, 2020 evidenced a significant margin. The value in use basis reflects management projections of the cash flows, which are based on the business plan of AXA XL and reflect that (i)/uni00A0the charge booked in respect of COVID-19 crisis (\u20ac-1.7/uni00A0billion) is of one-o/ff  nature, (ii)/uni00A0significant organizational and underwriting actions are in place to improve the profitability of AXA XL going forward, including the discontinuation of unprofitable lines of business as well as an increase in the Nat Cat budget and (iii)/uni00A0in the current market environment the company has achieved large tari/ff  increases and will continue to pursue tari/ff  increases and liability limitations that contribute to profitability over the horizon of the Plan. Over a mid-term horizon, management has forecasted a combined ratio centered around 96% as a sustainable ratio, taking into account the normal volatility of this ratio inherent in the business that is underwritten by AXA XL.\n\nSensitivities  were  performed  with  regards  to  the  main assumptions and under the plausible scenarios, the value in use still exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nThe tests of the recoverability of the Goodwill for AXA Germany P&C and AXA UK & Ireland P&C CGUs as of December/uni00A031, 2020\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nevidenced significant margins, demonstrating that the decrease in Gross Written premiums due to the COVID-19 crisis were of one-o/ff  nature. Sensitivities were performed with regards to the main assumptions and under the plausible scenarios, the value in use still exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nThe recoverability of the goodwill of Japan Life & Savings CGU relies on New Business Value (NBV) projections using a reasonable new business multiple, derived from market consistent assumptions. The level of profitability of products sold by AXA Japan in 2020 reached a high margin over the premiums received. The high level of cash flow projections exceeds the carrying amount of Japan Life & Savings CGU.\n\nFor all CGUs, to the extent that the valuation of securities and interest rate levels remain low for prolonged periods of time, or volatility and other market conditions stagnate or worsen, new business volumes and profitability together with the value of the in force portfolio are likely be negatively a/ffected. In addition, the future cash flow expectations from both the in force and new business and other assumptions underlying management's current business plans could be negatively impacted by other risks to which the Group's business is subject. For each CGU, sensitivity analyses were performed with regards to the discount rate: an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment loss for any of the CGUs as the recoverable amount for each CGU would still exceed its carrying value.\n\nHowever, subsequent impairment tests may be based upon di/fferent assumptions and future cash flow projections, which may result in an impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

E/ffective maturities may di/ffer from those presented, mainly because some assets include clauses allowing early redemption, with or without penalty or duration extension features. In some cases, the effect of derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.3) modifies the maturity profile of assets presented below.\n\nDebt instruments (at cost) that are not quoted in an active market and loans and debt instruments backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are excluded from the table below. Most of the debt instruments and loans held by the Group are fixed-rate instruments ( i.e . exposed to fair value interest rate risk).\n\n|

As substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately in the line item Net investment income within the consolidated\n\nstatement of income. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps where financial assets are sold to a counterparty with an agreement in which the Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of the financial instruments. Therefore, the Group doesn't derecognize the assets.\n\nThe breakdown of transferred financial assets/liabilities not qualifying for derecognition was as follows:\n\n|                                                       | December/uni00A031, 2020                                            | December/uni00A031, 2020                      | December/uni00A031, 2020                  | December/uni00A031, 2019                                            | December/uni00A031, 2019                      | December/uni00A031, 2019                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                     | Debt instruments  designated at fair  value through  profit or loss | Debt  instruments  available  for/uni00A0sale | Debt  instruments  -

Such assets are categorized in the level/uni00A01 of the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 and 3 assets are investments which are not quoted in an active market or for which there is no active market. Fair values for level/uni00A02 and 3 assets include:\n\n- /uni25A0 values provided by external parties which:\n- \u00b7 are readily available including last transaction prices but relate to assets for which the market is not always active, or\n- \u00b7 are provided at the request of the Group by pricing services and which are not readily publicly available;\n- /uni25A0 assets measured on the basis of valuation techniques including a varying degree of assumptions supported by market transactions and observable data.\n\nThe common characteristic of level/uni00A02 and 3 assets is that their markets are considered as less active. Their value is generally based on mark to market basis, except when there is no market or when the market is distressed, in which case a mark to model approach is used. Assets not quoted in an active market which are marked to market mainly using observable inputs are classified in level/uni00A02. Assets not quoted in an active market for which fair value determination is not mainly based on observable inputs are classified as level/uni00A03. For all assets not quoted in an active market/no active market and for which a mark to model approach is used, the classification between level/uni00A02 and level/uni00A03 depends on the proportion of assumptions used supported by market transactions and market observable data:\n\n- /uni25A0 assumed to be used by pricing services or;\n- /uni25A0 used by the Group in the limited cases of application of mark to model valuations.\n\n## a)  Fair values determined in whole directly by reference to an active market (level/uni00A01)\n\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 crisis has a/ffected the corporate bonds market which prices experienced an important bid-ask spread widening in March and April. These spreads have progressively tightened since then but did not return to their pre-crisis level, leading to transfers from level/uni00A01 to level/uni00A02.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the net transfer from level/uni00A01 to level/uni00A02 amounted to \u20ac-8,659/uni00A0million. This amount comprised \u20ac4,417/uni00A0 million  transferred  from  level/uni00A0 2  to  level/uni00A0 1,  and \u20ac13,076/uni00A0million from level/uni00A01 to level/uni00A02, of which \u20ac11,330/uni00A0million for corporate bonds and \u20ac640/uni00A0million for government bonds.\n\n## b) Fair values of assets not quoted in an active market - no active markets (level/uni00A02 and level/uni00A03)\n\n## OVERVIEW OF THE NATURE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS\n\nAmounts presented in level/uni00A02 and 3 represent a variety of circumstances. A financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument, when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity, in case of significant illiquidity or if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions. Characteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/fferent in nature, inherent to the instrument or be indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\nThe identification of level/uni00A03 assets among assets not quoted in an active market involves a significant level of judgment. The following are considered as observable: inputs provided by external pricing services, information observable obtained from specialized data providers, rating agencies, external surveys. The extent to which such data are external to the Group and not assessed by internal valuation teams is one of the main criteria applied in assessing whether data are observable or not. Should those data be significantly adjusted or would they be outdated because of the lack of newly available factors, such inputs would be deemed unobservable. Another area of judgment is the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety. As a result, a di/fferent cut between observable and unobservable data and variances in the weighting of the significance of each input against the fair value measurement in its entirety could produce a different categorization.\n\nAssets such as certain unquoted debt instruments, some instruments issued on private markets such as private equity instruments or private loans were always considered as not quoted in active markets as an inherent characteristic of these investments and were included as assets not quoted in active markets/no active markets in all periods presented. Valuations are based either on external pricing providers or internal models using techniques commonly used by market participants. Valuation teams make the maximum use of current transaction prices (if any) and observable data but some of the underlying sectors to which the investments relate may be so particular that significant adjustments are performed or unobservable data are used. Private equity funds of funds are measured on the basis of the latest net asset values of funds provided to the Group.",

Specifics to the valuation of investments are further described in Note/uni00A09.10.1 and the same principles apply to the fair value of investments at amortized cost.\n\nGenerally fair values of investments in real estate properties cannot be determined via reference to quotes of an active market from an exchange market or service provider and no property is therefore categorized in level/uni00A01. However, AXA's investments in real estate properties are mostly physically located within liquid markets with identical or comparable asset sales. Given the regulatory environment, some real estate properties located in markets such us France are valued by experts using very similar approaches leading to very limited dispersion in prices, with a majority of market inputs themselves homogeneous in terms of sources and values. Hence, the Group, consistently with the policy described in Note/uni00A01.5 which notably considers, for assets\n\nnot quoted in an active market, the weight of observable inputs in the valuation, concludes that the fair value calculations, which are based on valuations performed by qualified property appraisers mainly based on market observable inputs, are considered as level/uni00A02 fair values. However, as described in Note/uni00A01.5 and Note/uni00A09.10.1, the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety involves judgment and a di/fferent weighting could produce a di/fferent categorization.\n\nThe fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined with consideration of market inputs to the extent possible. For level/uni00A02 instruments, the fair value is mainly derived using valuation techniques based upon observable market interest rate curves. For level/uni00A03 instruments, the fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined by valuation techniques using limited observable market data.\n\n## 9.11  INVESTMENTS BACKING CONTRACTS WHERE THE FINANCIAL RISK IS BORNE BY/uni00A0POLICYHOLDERS\n\n| (in Euro million)                                      | December/uni00A031, 2020  Fair value/uni00A0 (b)   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a) Fair value/uni00A0 (b)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment in real estate properties                   | 4,522                                              | 4,185                                                                  |\n| Equity instruments & non-consolidated investment funds | 63,541                                             | 62,880                                                                 |\n| Debt instruments                                       | 9,366                                              | 7,999                                                                  |\n| Others                                                 | 373                                                | 710                                                                    |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE ACTIVITIES                             | 77,802                                             | 75,774                                                                 |\n\nFinancial assets included in these investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.\n\nI\n\nI",

During this deferral period, additional disclosures related to SPPI criterion and to credit risk exposure are required.\n\nTo determine the appropriate classification of financial assets under IFRS/uni00A09, an entity would need to assess the contractual cash flows characteristics of any financial asset. Indeed, the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding i.e . cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In a basic lending arrangement, consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant elements of interest.\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 defines the terms 'principal' as being the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition, and the 'interest' as being compensation for (i)/uni00A0the time value of money, and (ii)/uni00A0the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.\n\nThe tables below set out the result of the SPPI test for the assets not currently designated as at fair value through profit and loss, with a split between Insurance and Other activities.\n\nEach investment item is presented gross of tax and excluding the e/ffect of related hedging derivatives (IAS/uni00A039 qualifying hedges or economic hedges) and the potential impact resulting from the application of the future IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard on insurance contracts that will avoid accounting mismatches in particular for contracts eligible to the variable fee approach measurement model.\n\n| INSURANCE                                                         | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020                     | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020                     | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Fail the SPPI test         | Fail the SPPI test                           | Pass the SPPI test         | Pass the SPPI test                           | Fail the SPPI test                              | Fail the SPPI test                              | Pass the SPPI test                              | Pass the SPPI test                              |\n| (in Euro million)                                                 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2020 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2020 | Fair  value                                     | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2019    | Fair  value                                     | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2019    |\n| Debt instruments held to maturity                                 | -

However, these contracts must be treated in accordance with IFRS/uni00A07 with regards to the disclosures to be provided in the Notes to the financial statements. IFRS/uni00A07 requires the disclosure of fair value or value ranges for these contracts, unless the Group cannot reliably measure the participating features.\n\nIn the context of the current IFRS/uni00A04, the IASB acknowledged the di/fficulties involved in the recognition and the measurement of discretionary participating features included in insurance or investment contracts. The IASB issued guidance to measure fair value but with no principles addressing policyholder participation features. It would therefore be premature to interpret this definitions before the implementation guidance of the future standard IFRS/uni00A017 clarifies it (see Note/uni00A01.2).\n\nTherefore, too many uncertainties remain outstanding to define how to determine the fair value of participating contracts. As a result, fair value or value ranges for investment contracts with discretionary participating features cannot be reliably disclosed.\n\n## 14.7 LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TABLE\n\nThe loss reserve development table shows movements in loss reserves between 2010 and 2020, based on previously applied accounting standards. All contracts concerned are insurance contracts as defined by IFRS.\n\nThe first line labelled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed initially at the booking date' represents the loss reserves developed in the Group's balance sheet on the reporting date for the year indicated in the column heading. For example, the amount of \u20ac46,367/uni00A0million appearing in the first line of the table in the 2010 column represents all loss reserves developed in all years of occurrence prior to and including 2010, recognized on the Group's balance sheet as of December/uni00A031, 2010.\n\nThe second line titled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2020 adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation' indicates the amount that would have been developed initially at the booking date, had the exchange rates for the current year been used (for reserves recognized by AXA Group entities that do not use the Euro as their functional currency) and assuming an identical scope of consolidation to that used for the last diagonal of the table.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The final cost estimate varies year on year as information relating to losses still outstanding becomes more reliable.\n\nThe surplus (shortfall) of the initial reserve with respect to the re-estimated (gross) final cost for each year represents, for a given year N, the di/fference between the amount shown in the second line (gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2020 adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation) and the amount shown in the final diagonal under 'Reserve re-estimated'.\n\n## Loss reserve development table: Property & Casualty\n\n| (in  Euro  million)                                                                                                                          | 2010   | 2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross reserves for unpaid  claims and claims expenses  developed initially at  the/uni00A0booking date                                       | 46,367 | 45,946 | 46,440 | 47,031 | 49,868 | 51,965 | 53,286 | 52,973 | 82,134 | 85,201 | 87,316 |\n| Gross reserves for unpaid  claims and claims expenses  developed in 2020 adjusted  for changes in exchange rates  and scope of consolidation | 44,282 | 44,748 | 45,399 | 46,501 | 47,824 | 48,897 | 50,333 | 51,001 | 77,783 | 81,185 | 87,316 |\n| Cumulative payments at:                                                                                                                      |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| One year later                                                                                                                               | 8,953  | 9,183  | 9,361  | 9,422  | 10,111 | 9,621  | 10,755 | 10,960 | 18,402 | 17,130 | -

Note/uni00A013.2.1 also contains a focus on jurisdictions with significant portions of participating business\n\nand where required minimum local policyholders'share in the entities' results are significant. This Note discloses for such jurisdictions unrealized gains and losses related to available for sale investments and related shadow accounting adjustments. The increase in deferred policyholders' participation liabilities mainly relates to an increase in unrealized gains on assets available for sale in France and Germany.\n\n## 14.9 PAYMENT, SURRENDER PROJECTIONS, INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES DISCOUNT RATES\n\nIn the tables presented in Note/uni00A014.9.1 and 14.9.2, liabilities arising from Life & Savings and Property & Casualty insurance contracts and investment contracts exclude contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders. These liabilities are not exposed to interest rate or duration risk, except Unit-Linked contracts with performance guarantees. In addition, as far as liquidity risk is concerned, entities hold Unit-Linked assets backing the corresponding liabilities arising from these contracts. Occasional mismatches result mainly from administrative timing di/fferences in the processing of day-to-day operations.\n\n## 14.9.1 Payment and surrender projections\n\nThe t able below shows the breakdown of projected payments and surrenders related to insurance and investment contracts (excluding contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders). Actual maturities may di/ffer significantly from the estimates set out below, mainly because some of the contracts contain a surrender option controlled by the policyholder that may reduce their duration.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe projections shown below cannot be compared with the reserves carried on the balance sheet and are higher than the published balance sheet figures because they represent expected cash flows without the impact of discounting. They are also shown net of inflows of periodical premiums payable by policyholders.\n\nThe figures shown in the first line of the table below represent estimated undiscounted cash outflows in connection to death, incapacity and disability claims, surrenders, annuities, minimum guaranteed benefits for Unit-Linked contracts, Property & Casualty and Health claims, net of premiums due from policyholders under contracts in-force. These cash flows are based on assumptions regarding mortality, incapacity and disability, surrender and settlement frequency for Property & Casualty businesses, which are consistent with past experience. They are gross of reinsurance. Given the strong use of estimates, it is likely that actual payments will di/ffer.",

Liabilities are based on estimates, and one of the key assumptions used in these estimates is the discount rate.\n\nAs shown in the table below, as at December/uni00A031, 2020: 84% of Life & Savings reserves (excluding Unit-Linked contracts) were discounted, of which 13% were subject to a revision of the discount rate and 71% retained the rate set at inception, subject to the liability adequacy test described in Note/uni00A01.\n\nBy convention, contracts with zero guaranteed rates are deemed undiscounted, except for products o/ffering guaranteed rates updated annually and for one year: these contracts are presented in discounted reserves. Reserves for savings contracts with\n\nnon-zero guaranteed rates are discounted at the technical restatements at closing and mainly consist of reserves for guarantees (Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, etc.).\n\nIn Property & Casualty business, most reserves (94% as of December/uni00A031, 2020) are not discounted, with the exception of disability annuities and workers' compensation liabilities that are deemed structured settlements and where the discount rate is revised regularly. Undiscounted reserves are not sensitive to interest rate risks in the financial statements.\n\nThe rates presented in the table below are weighted average rates for all the portfolios under consideration. For contracts with guaranteed rates that are revised annually, rates are considered at the closing date. The risk factors associated with policyholders contracts are set out in Note/uni00A04.\n\nDiscount rates are qualified as locked-in when those used in the first recognition of the technical liabilities remain unchanged in the subsequent years and are qualified as unlocked when updated in subsequent years.\n\n|                                                       | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   | December/uni00A031, 2019 restated/uni00A0 (a)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| (in Euro million, except percentages)                 | Carrying  value            | Average  discount rate     | Carrying  value                                 | Average  discount rate                          |\n| Life & Savings -  Locked-in discount rate/uni00A0 (b) | 218,960                    | 1.78%                      | 221,065                                         | 1.93%                                           |\n| Life & Savings -  Unlocked discount rate              | 38,170                     | 2.28%                      | 36,264                                          | 2.48%                                           |\n| Life & Savings -  Undiscounted reserves               | 50,405                     | -                          | 48,977                                          | -                                               |\n| Sub-total Life & Savings                              | 307,535                    | -                          | 306,305                                         | -                                               |\n| Non Life -  Locked-in discount rate/uni00A0 (b)       | 4,631                      | 2.85%                      | 4,614                                           | 3.15%                                           |\n| Non Life -  Unlocked discount rate                    | 2,225                      | 2.49%                      | 2,095                                           | 2.77%                                           |\n| Non Life -  Undiscounted reserves                     | 103,321                    | -                          | 102,091                                         | -                                               |\n| Sub-total - Non Life                                  | 110,177                    | -                          | 108,800                                         | -                                               |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS              | 417,712                    | -                          | 415,105                                         | -                                               |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

These features are described in Note/uni00A04. They are not embedded derivatives which AXA reports separately at fair value because:\n\n- /uni25A0 many of the features would be considered clearly and closely related to the host contract; and\n- /uni25A0 many of the features would themselves qualify as insurance contracts under IFRS/uni00A04.\n\nThis Note describes the features that are embedded derivatives and meet the definition of an insurance contract on a standalone basis. The primary features can be divided into two main categories: Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDB) or Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB) o/ffered on UnitLinked contracts and guaranteed annuity purchase rates. As of December/uni00A02020, the AXA Group exposure to these liabilities was residual as a consequence of the loss of control on Equitable Holdings, Inc in 2019.\n\nGMDB features provide a guaranteed death benefit which may be higher than the contract account balances of the Unit-Linked\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncontract, depending on performance of the Unit-Linked assets. GMIB features provide a guaranteed lifetime annuity which may be elected by the contract-holder after a stipulated waiting period, and which may be larger than what the contract account balance could purchase at then-current annuity purchase rates.\n\nThe risk of GMDB and GMIB features to AXA are related to the unhedged portion of the benefits and to the policyholder behavior becoming materially different from the expected behavior. Reserves are established for these features on the basis of actuarial assumptions related to projected benefits and related contract charges. The determination of estimated GMDB and GMIB liabilities is based on models which involve numerous estimates and subjective judgments, including those regarding expected market rates of return and volatility, policyholder behavior assumptions and GMIB election rates. There can be no assurance that ultimate experience will not di/ffer from management's estimates. In addition to providing for risk through establishing reserves, AXA also manages the risk through a combination of reinsurance programs and active financial Risk Management programs including derivatives.\n\nGuaranteed annuity purchase rates provide contract-holders with a guarantee that at a future date the accumulated balance on their contract will be su/fficient to purchase a lifetime annuity at currently defined rates. The risk to AXA in these features is either that longevity will improve significantly so that contract-holders electing to exercise this benefit will live longer than assumed in the guaranteed purchase rates, or that investment returns during the payout period will be lower than assumed in the guaranteed purchase rates. Reserves are established for these features on the basis of actuarial assumptions related to projected benefits and related contract charges. The determination of this estimated liability is based on models which involved numerous estimates and subjective judgments, including those regarding expected rates of return and volatility, policyholders' behavior assumptions, mortality, and benefit election rates. There can be no assurance that ultimate experience will not di/ffer from management's estimates. In addition to providing for risk through establishing reserves, AXA also manages these risks through asset-liability management programs including derivatives to protect against a decline in interest rates.",

As of December/uni00A031, 2020, the carrying value and fair value amount and the related contractual amount due at maturity for such liabilities were \u20ac690/uni00A0million and \u20ac644/uni00A0million respectively (\u20ac772/uni00A0million and \u20ac715/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A031, 2019), including the Euro Medium Term Notes.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5. The valuation method of liabilities arising from banking activities excluding derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.5) are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 banking liabilities issued at fair value - Retail customers (\u20ac690/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 retail customers deposits (\u20ac4,119/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020) and Corporate customers deposits (\u20ac6,555/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020) are not traded in active markets and quoted prices are not available. Given the short maturities of main liabilities arising from banking activities (see Note/uni00A015.2), the carrying amounts may be considered as reasonable proxies for fair values. Thus, the fair value of amounts displayed above for these instruments are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 interbanking refinancing (\u20ac2,110/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020):\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,001/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac1,500/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values,\n- \u00b7 \u20ac109/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac369/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019): mainly based on non-observable market data inputs and are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 refinancing  with  central  banks:  \u20ac1,887/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac774/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019): values are based on observable market data inputs. As such, the fair values of these liabilities were considered as level/uni00A02 instruments. The increase is related to the third iteration of target long-term refinancing operations as provided by the European Central Bank (TLTRO/uni00A0III).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The fair value decreased by \u20ac2,092/uni00A0million compared to December/uni00A031, 2019, mainly due to\n\nthe repayments of subordinated debt at AXA/uni00A0SA for \u20ac1,775/uni00A0million and the payment of the financing debt related to Tianping acquisition for \u20ac146/uni00A0million.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5./uni00A0The fair value amounts are mainly based on observable market data inputs and are therefore considered as level/uni00A02 fair value.\n\n## 17.3 EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES\n\nThe table below sets out the maturities based on contractual cash flows of financing debt (including the impact of derivatives detailed in Note/uni00A020.1).

Effective maturities may differ from those presented, mainly because some instruments include clauses allowing early redemption, with or without penalty.\n\n|                                                                                             | December/uni00A031, 2020 Carrying value of other debt instrument   | December/uni00A031, 2020 Carrying value of other debt instrument   | December/uni00A031, 2020 Carrying value of other debt instrument   |                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                                                           | 12/uni00A0months  or/uni00A0less                                   | More than  1/uni00A0year up  to/uni00A05/uni00A0years              | More than  5/uni00A0years                                          | Total  carrying  value |\n| Debts relating to investments under total return swap agreement ('TRS')                     | 2,599                                                              | 5,110                                                              | 726                                                                | 8,435                  |\n| Other debt instruments issued, notes and bank overdra/f\\_ts excluding  TRS -  Carrying value | 1,610                                                              | 282                                                                | 2,542                                                              | 4,433                  |\n| Collateral debts relating to investments under a lending agreement  or/uni00A0equivalent    | 30,923                                                             | 4,588                                                              | 2,367                                                              | 37,878                 |\n\n|                                                                                             | December/uni00A031, 2019                                                | December/uni00A031, 2019                                                | December/uni00A031, 2019                                                | December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                                                             | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity |                            |\n| (in Euro million)                                                                           | 12/uni00A0months  or/uni00A0less                                        | More than  1/uni00A0year up  to/uni00A05/uni00A0years                   | More than  5/uni00A0years                                               | Total  carrying  value     |\n| Debts relating to investments under total return swap agreement ('TRS')                     | 347                                                                     | 2,490                                                                   | 780                                                                     | 3,616                      |\n| Other debt instruments issued, notes and bank overdra/f\\_ts excluding  TRS -  Carrying value | 697                                                                     | 270                                                                     | 1,666                                                                   | 2,633                      |\n| Collateral debts relating to investments under a lending agreement  or/uni00A0equivalent    | 28,233                                                                  | 7,594                                                                   | 2,093                                                                   | 37,920                     |\n\nI\n\nI",

The change relates to:\n\n- /uni25A0 impact of rate differences on notional tax charges (\u20ac+663/uni00A0million) corresponding to the di/fference between the blended tax (expected tax calculated at each entity level with the applicable standard rate) and the tax calculated using the 32.02% French tax rate applicable to the Company. This tax rate is composed of a basic tax rate (31.00%) and a social contribution (1.02%).The blended standard rate was 35.96% in 2020 and 24.91% in 2019. The increase of the blended tax rate is mainly due to an unfavorable geographical mix in AXA XL;\n\n## 19.2 DEFERRED TAX\n\nIn the table below, the net deferred tax position corresponds to the di/fference between Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) and Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) carried on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position. Note that the breakdown of DTA/\n\nDTL disclosed in these tables corresponds to the deferred tax before the netting that occurs for balance sheet presentation purposes as required by IAS/uni00A012.

Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac2,736/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac-642/uni00A0million at the end of 2019), comprised of the fair value of derivatives on invested assets (\u20ac1,356 /uni00A0million and \u20ac-2,425/uni00A0million at the end of 2019 -  see Note/uni00A020.3) and the fair value of derivatives on liabilities (\u20ac-1,380/uni00A0million and \u20ac-1,784/uni00A0million at the end of 2019 -  see Note/uni00A020.4).\n\nAXA uses derivatives primarily to hedge various risks stemming from both sides of the balance sheet in the context of its Asset Liability Management (ALM) strategy in insurance companies, as well as holdings and banks. Notional amount of such hedging strategies amounted to \u20ac338.9/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac430.6/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019) and were mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 manage interest rate exposures on fixed maturity investments, long-term debt and guaranteed interest rates on insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 reduce foreign-currency exposures on foreign-currency denominated investments and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 manage liquidity positions (including the ability to pay benefits and claims when due) in connection with Asset Liability Management and local regulatory requirements for insurance and banking operations;\n- /uni25A0 limit equity risk;\n- /uni25A0 limit credit risk about certain investments in corporate debt instruments.\n\nAXA also uses derivatives as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions', for example, holding cash and equity futures instead of physical equities. Another example is the combination of government bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) as a synthetic position and an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. These schemes do not add any specific risks compared with other investment assets.\n\nThe notional amount of derivatives which is used to express the volume of instruments outstanding and to provide a basis for comparison with other financial instruments most certainly overstates the level of activity and does not directly measure risk as it greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions. It does not represent the amounts that are e/ffectively exchanged by the parties, and thus is not a measure of the Group's exposure to derivative instruments. For example, the Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its counterparties to the derivative instruments but is not exposed to credit risk on the entire notional amounts. AXA actively manages counterparty risk generated by derivatives through a specific group-wide policy. This policy includes a limit framework and an exposure monitoring process. Limits are specifically set for each authorized counterparty, based on an internal scoring system. This policy also includes daily to weekly collateralization for the majority of the Group's exposure. The total net collateral given communicated for all derivative instruments including those related to derivatives held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' (see Note/uni00A01.8.2) was \u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019). This net total includes amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and unrecognized commitments received or given disclosed in Note/uni00A029.\n\nAXA is increasing or decreasing its derivative positions in accordance with AXA's governance framework for derivatives. In particular, hedging activities are one of the most important instruments to decrease the risk of the options and guarantees that are embedded in most Life & Savings products and in some Property & Casualty products; they also lead to a reduction of the capital requirements for those business activities under Solvency/uni00A0II. The various policies that AXA applies with reference to the use of derivatives and hedging instruments, include a close monitoring of its hedging strategy and associated risks as part of a Systemic Risk Management Plan (SRMP), approved by the management Committee and the Board of Directors, in the\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

They also include 'macro-hedging' derivatives as defined by the IASB in IAS/uni00A039.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the notional amount of hedging derivative instruments as defined by IAS/uni00A039 (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and net investment hedge) of the Group was \u20ac97.1/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac79.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019. The net fair value recorded was \u20ac-52/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020, versus \u20ac-742/uni00A0million at the end of 2019.\n\n## 20.2.1 Interest rate derivative instruments\n\nThe AXA Group's primary interest rate exposure is related to contracts with guaranteed benefits and the risk that the value of the financial assets purchased with the consideration received from the contract holders is insu/fficient to fund the guaranteed benefits and expected discretionary participation payable to them. To hedge against potential adverse market conditions, derivative strategies are used to reduce the risk arising from the guarantee liability over time.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments totalled \u20ac189.7/uni00A0billion (\u20ac243.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019). Their net fair value as of December/uni00A031, 2020 amounted to \u20ac2,075/uni00A0million (\u20ac1,299/uni00A0million at the end of 2019). AXA mainly uses (i)/uni00A0interest rate swaps (67% of total notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments), (ii)/uni00A0interest rate options (17%), and (iii)/uni00A0futures and forwards (13%).\n\nThese instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 manage duration gap and/or hedge convexity risk between assets and liabilities on the General Account as a part of Asset Liability Management strategies mainly in France for \u20ac71.7/uni00A0billion ( versus \u20ac64.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019), Japan for \u20ac16.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 ( versus \u20ac17.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019) and Germany for \u20ac15.0/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 ( versus \u20ac15.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019);\n- /uni25A0 minimize the cost of Group debt and limit volatility of financial charges, mainly in the Company, with a notional amount of \u20ac13.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 ( versus \u20ac37.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019), mainly due to the e/fforts pursued to simplify and reduce the volume of derivatives;\n- /uni25A0 hedge interest rate risk and interest volatility risk as part of the Asset Liability Management strategy associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits on Variable Annuity products, with a notional amount of \u20ac35.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 (\u20ac41.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019) mainly at AXA Life Europe.\n\n## 20.2.2 Equity derivative instruments\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2020, the notional amount of equity derivative instruments amounted to \u20ac12.0/uni00A0billion (\u20ac19.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019). Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac101/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac214/uni00A0million at the end of 2019). AXA mainly uses (i)/uni00A0equity option contracts (49% of total notional amount of equity derivative instruments), (ii)/uni00A0equity futures and forwards (28%), and (iii)/uni00A0equity swaps (22%).\n\nThese instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge the exposure to equity risk, mainly in the Company for \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion in 2020 (\u20ac6.1/uni00A0billion in 2019) to support Group Solvency;\n- /uni25A0 hedge equity risk as part of the Asset Liability Management strategy associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits on Variable Annuity products, which amounted to \u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 (\u20ac0.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019);\n- /uni25A0 hedge the exposure to equity risk within the General Account assets, protecting policyholders' investments and their guaranteed liability over time, mainly in Switzerland (notional amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion in 2020 compared with \u20ac4.2/uni00A0billion in 2019) and France (notional amount of \u20ac1.6/uni00A0billion in 2020 compared with \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion in 2019).",

        "page_content": "## 20.2.3 Currency derivative instruments\n\nThe Group has entered into di/fferent currency instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Currency derivative instruments represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the notional amount of currency derivative amounted to \u20ac119.8/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac158.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019. Their market value was \u20ac1,169/uni00A0million versus \u20ac-1,822/uni00A0million at the end of 2019. AXA mainly uses (i)/uni00A0currency future and forward contracts (67% of total notional amount of currency derivative instruments), (ii)/uni00A0currency swaps (24%), and (iii)/uni00A0currency option contracts (9%).\n\nOne of the main objectives of currency derivatives instruments is to limit variations in net foreign currency-denominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates in order to protect partially or in full the value of AXA's net foreign-currency investments in its subsidiaries and thus reduce the variability of Group consolidated shareholders' equity against currency fluctuations, but also of others key indicators such as liquidity, gearing and solvency ratios. The notional amount of derivatives used by the Company to hedge the foreign currency exposure decreased from \u20ac34.6/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019 to \u20ac16.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020, as a consequence of the e/fforts pursued to simplify and reduce the volume of derivatives.\n\nCurrency derivative instruments are also used to hedge foreign exchange mismatch between assets and liabilities in insurance subsidiaries of the Group. While most of the operating units' commitments are matched by assets denominated in the same currency, some entities may invest in foreign currency denominated assets to diversify their investments. This is the case mainly in (i)/uni00A0Switzerland using such contracts to hedge exchange rate risk arising from their investments in equities and debt instruments denominated in non-CHF currencies (mainly Euro and US Dollar) with a total notional amount of \u20ac19.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 versus \u20ac29.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019, and (ii)/uni00A0Japan using future and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exchange-rate risk arising from its investments mainly in fixed-maturity debt instruments denominated in non JPY currencies with a total notional amount of \u20ac18.0/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 versus \u20ac17.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nA description of exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities ouf Group subsidiaries and the Company is included in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report with amounts of exposures to exchange-rate risk and corresponding hedges.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A021 and IAS/uni00A039, the translation di/fference relating to these debt instruments used in operational entities is recognized in profit or loss and o/ffsets most of the change in market value of associated derivative instruments, which is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 20.2.4 Credit derivative instruments\n\nThe Group, as part of its investment and credit Risk Management activities, uses strategies that involve credit derivatives, which consist mainly of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These instruments are used as an alternative to corporate bonds portfolios, when coupled with government debt instruments, but also as a protection on single names or specific portfolios.\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2020, the notional amount of credit derivatives held by the Group was \u20ac15.8/uni00A0billion compared to \u20ac18.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019 (including the instruments held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' (\u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion); see Note/uni00A01.8.2).\n\nCredit derivative instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge credit risk involving the purchase of CDS as a protection mainly on single corporate names or specific portfolios starting from a certain level of losses through tranches instruments (notional amount of \u20ac2.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 versus \u20ac3.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019);\n- /uni25A0 enhance the return mainly on government bonds portfolios by holding government bonds and at same time selling protection on very good quality names as an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. This type of ALM strategy is implemented to compensate for the lack of depth or liquidity in some markets by taking a synthetic credit risk (notional amount of \u20ac12.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 versus \u20ac14.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Same principles apply as far as derivatives instruments are concerned.\n\nThe Group mitigates counterparty credit risk of derivative instruments by contractually requiring collateral for most derivative contracts.

All investment management fees are also included in the aggregate figure.\n\nNet realized gains and losses relating to investment at cost and at fair value through shareholders' equity include write back of impairment following investment sales.\n\nNet realized gains and losses and change in fair value of investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss consist mainly of:\n\n- /uni25A0 adjustments relating to investments backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders which are o/ffset by an adjustment of related policyholder reserves, as there is a full pass through of the performance of held assets to the individual contract holder;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 changes in the fair value of investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss held by funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios' as defined in Note/uni00A01.8.2;\n- /uni25A0 changes in fair value of underlying hedged items in fair value hedges (as designated by IAS/uni00A039) or 'natural hedges' ( i.e. underlying assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss part of an economic hedge not eligible for hedge accounting as defined by IAS/uni00A039).\n\nThe changes in investment impairments for available for sale assets include impairment charges on investments, and release of impairments only following revaluation of the recoverable amount. Write back of impairments following investment sales are included in the net realized capital gains or losses on investments aggregate.\n\n## Note/uni00A023 Net result of reinsurance ceded\n\nNet result of reinsurance ceded was as follows:\n\n|                                                            | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020         | December/uni00A031, 2020    | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                          | France                     | Europe                     | Asia                       | AXA XL                     | International              | Transversal  & Central  Holdings | Inter-segment  eliminations | Total                      |\n| Premiums ceded and unearned  premiums ceded                | (2,016)                    | (922)                      | (844)                      | (6,770)                    | (787)                      | (859)                            | 755                         | (11,443)                   |\n| Claims ceded (including change  in/uni00A0claims reserves) | 1,960                      | 690                        | 323                        | 5,878                      | 194                        | 132                              | (255)                       | 8,923                      |\n| Commissions received from/paid  to/uni00A0reinsurers       | 211                        | 114                        | 162                        | 1,061                      | 141                        | 79                               | (94)                        | 1,674                      |\n| NET RESULT OF REINSURANCE  CEDED                           | 155                        | (118)                      | (359)                      | 169                        | (452)                      | (648)                            | 407                         | (845)                      |\n\n|                                                            | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019   | December/uni00A031, 2019           | December/uni00A031, 2019         | December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                          | France                     | Europe                     | Asia                       | AXA XL                     | United  States             | Interna- tional            | Trans- versal &  Central  Holdings | Inter- seg- ment  elimina- tions | Total                      |\n| Premiums ceded and unearned  premiums ceded                | (1,701)                    | (841)                      | (737)                      | (5,925)                    | (124)                      | (851)                      | (58)                               | 692                              | (9,544)                    |\n| Claims ceded (including change  in/uni00A0claims reserves) | 1,401                      | 381                        | 465                        | 4,399                      | 215                        | 422                        | 79                                 | (312)                            | 7,050                      |\n| Commissions received from/paid  to/uni00A0reinsurers       | 168                        | 113                        | 148                        | 725                        | 2                          | 163                        | 111                                | (53)                             | 1,376                      |\n| NET RESULT OF REINSURANCE  CEDED                           | (132)                      | (347)                      | (124)                      | (801)                      | 93                         | (266)                      | 132                                | 327                              | (1,118)                    |\n\nI\n\nI",

The level of benefits is generally based on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn Switzerland, the benefit plan is a Swiss contribution-based plan classified as a defined benefit plan under IAS/uni00A019 because of guarantees, risks related to the mortality and disability coverage.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index or inflation, as opposed to other countries where pensions do not necessarily receive inflationary increases once in payment.\n\nMost of the defined benefit pension plans are funded through long-term employee benefit funds or covered by insurance policies or Mutual funds.\n\nBenefit payments in the United Kingdom and Switzerland are from trustee-administered funds and plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices. The Board of trustees, generally composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the respective plan's regulations is responsible for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules in order to meet the existing minimum funding requirement or funding regime objective.\n\n- /uni25A0 International (\u20ac-518/uni00A0million) mainly due to the non-repeat of the loss related to the expected disposal of AXA Bank Belgium (\u20ac-541/uni00A0million).\n\nThis was partly o/ffset by:\n\n- /uni25A0 Asia (\u20ac+436/uni00A0million) mainly driven by the integration of AXA Tianping as from December/uni00A031, 2019 (\u20ac+489/uni00A0million);\n- /uni25A0 France  (\u20ac+266/uni00A0 million)  mainly  driven  by  a  change  in commissioning ratio and the reclassification of profit-sharing charges from technical items to commissions; and\n- /uni25A0 Europe (\u20ac+94/uni00A0million) mainly driven by restructuring costs in Germany, and in the United Kingdom & Ireland following the sale of Architas.",

The table below shows the detailed roll-forward of the statement of financial position liability, with the Separate Assets added at each year end.\n\n|                                                                                                 | Pension benefits   | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | Other benefits   | Total   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| (in Euro million)                                                                               | 2020               | 2019               | 2020             | 2019             | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Change in the liability  recognized in the statement  of/uni00A0financial position              |                    |                    |                  |                  |         |         |\n| Statement of financial position  liability at the beginning of the year                         | (8,037)            | (7,633)            | (228)            | (617)            | (8,266) | (8,250) |\n| Pension and other benefits expense                                                              | (297)              | (307)              | (113)            | (149)            | (410)   | (455)   |\n| Adjustment due to separate assets                                                               | (53)               | (75)               | -                | -                | (53)    | (75)    |\n| Employer contributions                                                                          | 155                | 149                | -                | -                | 155     | 149     |\n| Benefits directly paid  by/uni00A0the/uni00A0employer                                           | 310                | 283                | 121              | 116              | 431     | 399     |\n| Benefits paid by separate assets                                                                | 106                | 105                | 1                | 1                | 107     | 106     |\n| Net transfer (In)/Out  (including/uni00A0acquisitions,  disposals/uni00A0and reclassifications) | (3)                | 461                | 0                | 447              | (2)     | 908     |\n| Actuarial gains and (losses)  recognized in OCI                                                 | (272)              | (937)              | (10)             | (20)             | (281)   | (957)   |\n| Other                                                                                           | -                  | -                  | -                | -                | -       | -       |\n| Foreign exchange impact                                                                         | 13                 | (85)               | 12               | (6)              | 25      | (91)    |\n| Statement of financial position  liability at the end of the year                               | (8,076)            | (8,037)            | (217)            | (228)            | (8,293) | (8,266) |\n| Fair value of separate assets  at/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of the year                             | 1,303              | 1,276              | -                | -                | 1,303   | 1,276   |\n| Net balance sheet position  at/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of the year                                | (6,773)            | (6,761)            | (217)            | (228)            | (6,990) | (6,990) |\n\n## 26.2.7 Sensitivity analysis of the defined benefit obligation (DBO): gross of all assets\n\nA description of the risk that pension schemes are exposed to is presented in Note/uni00A026.2.10.

Central to the scheme funding regime are: the Statutory Funding Objective (SFO), which is a requirement that the Scheme has su/fficient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions ( i.e. the amount required, on an actuarial calculation, to make provision for the scheme's liabilities); and the Statement of Funding Principles (SFP), which is a document prepared by the trustees which sets out its policy for ensuring that the SFO is met.\n\nAs part of the triennial actuarial valuation process, acting in accordance with the scheme funding legislation and the trust deed and rules of the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, the Trustee determines an appropriate level of employer contributions to be paid to the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, having consulted with the Scheme Actuary and discussed this with AXA UK plc. The resulting schedule of contributions is prepared by the\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nTrustee and the Scheme Actuary sets out what contributions are payable and by when. This is then agreed by AXA UK plc. Where there is a deficit on a technical provision funding basis, the Trustee will also need to agree and put in place a Recovery Plan, which sets out the period over which the SFO will be met. There is no prescribed period for a recovery plan, but the Pensions Regulator will generally be concerned about long recovery plans. The Trustee is required to prepare the schedule of contributions following valuations  but may revisit (and potentially amend) the schedule of contributions in between actuarial valuations, for example if significant events occur during the period.\n\nIn Switzerland and Belgium, entities should fund the cost of the entitlements expected to be earned on at least a yearly basis where contributions are determined as a percentage of pensionable salaries depending on the age-class of the beneficiaries.\n\nIn Switzerland, the presentation of the pension liability reflects the fact that the assets covering a large part of the retirees do not qualify as pension assets defined under IAS/uni00A019 (not taken into consideration in the pension assets disclosures as described in Note/uni00A026.2.6) because managed internally by the insurance company and not handled by a third party. However, legally, the sole purpose of these assets is the coverage of the liabilities of the pension fund. This means that under statutory (and legal) requirements, the pension fund of AXA Switzerland is not underfunded and therefore there is no requirement of additional contributions from AXA.\n\nIn France, voluntary regular employer annual contributions are made to Separate Assets, with an objective of the coverage ratio remaining within a targeted range of the total defined benefit obligation after consideration of the yearly predetermined service cost.\n\nIn Germany, there is no requirement to fund employee defined benefit obligation.\n\nIn summary, considering both the Swiss case (and other entities in a similar case) and Separate Assets, the net economic situation of the funding for defined benefit plans is the following:\n\n|                                                               | Pension benefits          | Pension benefits          | Other benefits            | Other benefits            | Total                     | Total                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                             | December/uni00A031,  2020 | December/uni00A031,  2019 | December/uni00A031,  2020 | December/uni00A031,  2019 | December/uni00A031,  2020 | December/uni00A031,  2019 |\n| Statement of financial  position/uni00A0liability/uni00A0 (a) | (8,076)                   | (8,037)                   | (217)                     | (228)                     | (8,293)                   | (8,266)                   |\n| Assets other than plan assets/uni00A0 (b)                     | 2,685                     | 2,723                     | -                         | -                         | 2,685                     | 2,723                     |\n| Net economic position                                         | (5,391)                   | (5,314)                   | (217)                     | (228)                     | (5,608)                   | (5,542)                   |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The investment strategy is reviewed regularly, following actuarial valuations of the funded benefit plans.\n\nThe investment positions are managed within an Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework defining an optimal strategic allocation with respect to the liabilities structure. The management of the assets notably includes liquidity management, diversification of each asset type so that the failure of any specific investment does not present a material risk to the plans, and implementation of hedging programs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the pension scheme entered into several longevity swap transactions:\n\n- /uni25A0 in 2015, for economically hedging longevity risk inherent within the pensioner population;\n- /uni25A0 in 2019, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April/uni00A01, 2019;\n- /uni25A0 in 2020, for covering longevity risk (subject to a level of retention) of the remaining unhedged members.\n\nMoreover, caps on inflationary increases were in place in the United Kingdom to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.\n\n## 26.2.11  Statement of financial position/balance sheet reconciliation\n\n| (in Euro million)                                    | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Net position (excluding separate assets)/uni00A0 (a) | (8,293)                    | (8,266)                    |\n| (Assets)/liabilities held for sale/uni00A0 (b)       | 185                        | 169                        |\n| Other liabilities                                    | (229)                      | (233)                      |\n| TOTAL/uni00A0 (c)                                    | (8,337)                    | (8,329)                    |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The e/ffect of expected early exercise was taken into account through the use of an expected life assumption based on historical data. AXA/uni00A0SA share price volatility was estimated on the basis of implied volatility,\n\nwhich was checked against an analysis of historical volatility to ensure consistency. The expected AXA/uni00A0SA dividend yield was based on the market consensus. The risk-free interest rate was based on the Euro Swap Rate curve for the appropriate term.\n\nThe option pricing assumptions and fair value at grant date for plans issued for the last time in 2018 are shown below:\n\n|                                                                 | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assumptions                                                     |        |        |        |\n| Dividend yield                                                  | 5.79%  | 6.50%  | 6.60%  |\n| Volatility                                                      | 20.72% | 25.05% | 26.60% |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                         | 0.72%  | 0.55%  | 0.36%  |\n| Expected life  (in years)                                       | 8.6    | 8.5    | 8.5    |\n| Weighted average fair value per option at grant date  (in Euro) | 1.21   | 1.81   | 1.80   |\n\nThe total cost has been amortized over the vesting period and a nil estimated pre-vesting lapse rate was applied over the remaining vesting period. On that basis, the expense recognized in profit or loss for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020 was \u20ac2.1/uni00A0million (\u20ac3.9/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## AXA GROUP SHAREPLAN\n\nAXA o/ffers its employees the opportunity to become shareholders through a special employee share o/ffering. In countries that meet the legal and fiscal requirements, two investment options used to be available: the traditional plan and the leveraged plan.\n\nThe traditional plan allows employees to purchase, through a personal investment, AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country) with a discount of 20%. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees are subject to the share price evolution, up or down, as compared to the subscription price.\n\nThe leveraged plan allows employees to purchase, on the basis of 10/uni00A0times their personal investment, AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country) with a discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a bank, and employees also benefit from a portion of the share appreciation, calculated on the basis of the non-discounted reference price. At the end of the 5/uni00A0years holding period, the employees can, depending on their residence country, do any one of the following: (i)/uni00A0receive the cash value of their investment, (ii)/uni00A0receive the value of their investment in the form of AXA shares, or (iii)/uni00A0transfer their assets invested in the leveraged plan into the traditional plan.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, only the traditional investment option was o/ffered in 2020.\n\nThe cost of the shareplan plan is valued taking into account the five-year lock-up period, as recommended by the ANC ( Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables ). The ANC approach values the restricted shares through a replication strategy whereby the employee would sell the restricted shares forward at the end of the lockup period, borrow enough money to buy unrestricted shares immediately, and uses the proceeds of the forward sale together with dividends paid during the lock-up period to finance the loan. When it is o/ffered, the cost of the leveraged plan also includes the opportunity gain implicitly provided by AXA by enabling its employees to benefit from an institutional price for derivatives as opposed to a retail price.",

In 2020, the cost of the lock-up period was measured at 16.88% for the traditional plan.\n\nThe table below shows the main features of the shareplan, the amounts subscribed, valuation assumptions, and the cost of the plans for 2019 and 2020:\n\n|                                                                                | 2020        | 2019        | 2019      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n|                                                                                | Traditional | Traditional | Leveraged |\n| Plan maturity  (in years)                                                      | 5           | 5           | 5         |\n| [A] Discount to face value                                                     | 20.00%      | 20.00%      | 4.99%     |\n| Reference price  (in Euro)                                                     | 17.20       | 22.87       | 22.87     |\n| Subscription price  (in Euro)                                                  | 13.76       | 18.30       | 21.73     |\n| Amount subscribed by employee  (in Euro million)                               | 88.2        | 63.5        | 31.2      |\n| Total amount subscribed  (in Euro million)                                     | 88.2        | 63.5        | 311.7     |\n| Total number of shares subscribed  (in million shares)                         | 6.4         | 3.5         | 14.3      |\n| Interest rate on employee loan                                                 | 6.12%       | 6.74%       | 6.83%     |\n| 5-year risk-free rate (euro zone)                                              | -0.67%      | -0.64%      | -0.64%    |\n| Dividend yield                                                                 | 8.55%       | 8.16%       | 8.16%     |\n| Early exit rate                                                                | 1.62%       | 2.15%       | 2.15%     |\n| Interest rate for borrowing securities (repo)                                  | -0.17%      | -0.15%      | -0.15%    |\n| Retail/institutional volatility spread                                         | N/A         | N/A         | 1.24%     |\n| [B] Cost of the lock-up for the employee                                       | 16.88%      | 19.32%      | 4.98%     |\n| [C] Opportunity gain                                                           | N/A         | N/A         | 0.90%     |\n| Total cost for AXA = [A] - [B] + [C]  (as a percentage of the reference price) | 3.12%       | 0.68%       | 0.91%     |\n| TOTAL COST FOR AXA  (in Euro million)                                          | 3.43        | 0.54        | 2.95      |\n\n## OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## AXA Performance Shares\n\nPerformance Shares are granted to executive o/fficers and other key employees mainly in France. These Performance Share plans are equity-settled award plans subjected to performance conditions and a three years vesting period.\n\nIn 2020, the valuation was based on a market price of \u20ac15.52 per share at grant date and an estimate 5% pre-vesting lapse rate per year. The grant date average fair value of Performance Shares granted in 2020 was \u20ac9.82 (\u20ac16.39 for 2019 grants).\n\nThe total cost of Performance Shares recognized was \u20ac59.0/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac58.2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## AXA International Performance Shares\n\nSince 2013, AXA has issued International Performance Shares to executive o/fficers and other key employees mainly outside France.\n\nUnder the International Performance Shares (PSi) plan, beneficiaries have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of performance criteria defined by AXA. The performance period\n\nis currently three years. The vesting period (service condition) is between three and five years. The settlement is made in shares rather than in cash (except where the settlement in shares is impossible for legal or other reasons).\n\nThe total cost of the International Performance Shares recorded as of December/uni00A0 31, 2020, was \u20ac76.9/uni00A0 million in earnings (\u20ac71.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## AXA Retirement Performance Shares\n\nAs voted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A024, 2019, AXA's Board of Directors is authorized to grant retirement performance shares to designated senior executives in France. Under this plan, beneficiaries of Performance Shares have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period of three years.\n\nFor the grants from 2016 to 2018, a/f\\_ter the three years performance period, the performance shares definitively acquired are subject to (i)/uni00A0an additional restriction on transfer period of two years following the performance period, and (ii)/uni00A0an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6",

The Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan is a long-term award plan in which participants are allocated rights to acquire AXA Investment Managers shares upon completion of a specified vesting period depending on applicable local regulations, and subject to fulfilment of certain performance conditions. The performance condition is based on the achievement of Actual AXA Investment Managers Underlying Earnings Group share versus budgeted and/or investment performance conditions.\n\nThe total cost of AXA Investment Managers Performance Shares recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2020, amounted to \u20ac12.7/uni00A0million in earnings (\u20ac14.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019), gross of tax.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 26.4 COMPENSATION OF MANAGEMENT AND OFFICERS\n\nCompensation costs/expenses:\n\n- /uni25A0 short-term benefits: compensation paid to members of the Management Committee in 2020 totaled \u20ac20.4/uni00A0million (\u20ac22.6/uni00A0 million in 2019), including fixed salary, bonuses, directors' fees, benefits in kind and other short-term benefits;\n- /uni25A0 share-based compensations: the expense recognized in 2020 in respect of share-based compensations granted by AXA/uni00A0SA to Management Committee members was \u20ac10.5/uni00A0million (\u20ac9.8/uni00A0million in 2019);\n- /uni25A0 post-retirement benefits: the estimated cost to the Group of providing defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits to members of the Management Committee for the current year of service measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A019 amounted to \u20ac4.1/uni00A0million in 2020 (\u20ac3.2/uni00A0million in 2019).\n\n## 26.5 SALARIED WORKFORCE\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group employed 96,595/uni00A0salaried people on a full-time equivalent basis (compared to 99,843 at December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nThe decrease in salaried employees by 3,249 in 2020 was mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0the disposal of Central and Eastern Europe operations (-1,960), (ii)/uni00A0e/fficiency programs notably in the UK & Ireland, Germany, and Mexico, and (iii)/uni00A0AXA Assistance (-387) mainly from the exit of Brazil.",

On December/uni00A031, 2020, the Mutuelles AXA collectively owned 14.95% of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares representing 24.75% of the voting rights.\n\nEach Mutuelle AXA is supervised by a Board of Directors elected by delegates representing policyholders. One member of the Company's Management Committee serves as director of the Mutuelles AXA.\n\nThe Mutuelles AXA and two of the Company's French insurance subsidiaries engaged in the Property & Casualty insurance business and Life & Savings insurance business, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie respectively (the 'Subsidiaries'), are parties to an agreement pursuant to which they provide a full range of management services to manage the insurance operations and portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA. The agreement includes provisions designed to ensure the legal independence and protection of the respective client portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA and these Subsidiaries. Certain costs and charges (excluding commissions) are allocated between the Subsidiaries and the Mutuelles AXA through an economic interest grouping ( groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique ) or 'GIE'.\n\nThe Property & Casualty insurance business generated in France by insurance brokers was mainly underwritten through co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements between AXA Assurances IARD Mutuelle and AXA France IARD. Aggregate written premiums under these agreements amounted to \u20ac2,411/uni00A0million in 2020 (of which \u20ac2,300/uni00A0million was attributed to AXA France IARD).\n\n## 28.2 GROUPEMENT D'INT\u00c9R\u00caT \u00c9CONOMIQUE (GIE)\n\nFrom time to time the Company enters into GIEs with certain of its subsidiaries. GIEs are intercompany partnerships, governed by French law, created to perform various common services for their members and to allocate associated costs and expenses among their members. The allocation of costs and expenses invoiced to GIE members is based on various agreed criteria including particular activity drivers. The GIEs of which the Company was a member during 2020 covered a\n\nI\n\nI\n\nvariety of common services including services performed by the Group's central functions (GIE AXA) for the benefit of AXA Group companies ( e.g. finance, accounting and reporting, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, information systems, Risk Management, cash management). Expenses invoiced by these GIEs to the Company and its subsidiaries are generally invoiced at cost and are included in the consolidated expenses reflected in Note/uni00A025 'Expenses by type' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses invoiced by the GIE AXA to its members in 2020 and 2019 amounted to respectively \u20ac259 /uni00A0million and \u20ac265/uni00A0million.\n\n## 28.3 LOANS/GUARANTEES/CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ETC.\n\nThe Company has given numerous commitments, including financing  commitments,  guarantees  given  to  financial institutions and customers, pledged assets, collateralized commitments and letters of credit. For a description of these commitments and guarantees, see Note/uni00A029 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCertain of these guarantees are given by the Company for the benefit of its subsidiaries and affiliates for various business purposes including to promote development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, o/ff -shoring arrangements, internal restructurings, sales or other disposals of assets or businesses, sales or renewals of products or services or similar transactions), to support their credit ratings, and/or to promote e/fficient use of the Group's capital resources. In this context, the Company may guarantee repayment of loans or other obligations of its subsidiaries to third parties, or provide other types of guarantees to support its subsidiaries' obligations. The beneficiaries of these guarantees are generally required to compensate the Company at a negotiated rate based on prevailing market rates for guarantees with similar conditions. In addition, from time to time, the Company may provide comfort letters or similar letters to rating agencies and/or regulators in support of its subsidiaries and a/ffiliates for various business purposes, including facilitating specific transactions, achieving target rating levels and, more generally, helping to develop the business of these subsidiaries.\n\nCommitments granted by the Company to its subsidiaries are disclosed in Appendix/uni00A0III of this Annual Report 'AXA parent Company financial statements: Subsidiaries and participating interests'.\n\nThe Company may enter into various types of transactions with its subsidiaries and a/ffiliates from time to time for various business purposes including (i)/uni00A0in connection with liquidity, solvency and capital management initiatives designed to promote e/fficient use and fungibility of the Group's capital resources or (ii)/uni00A0to finance their business operations and/or to promote the development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration",

These transactions may involve loans or other types of credit arrangements, capital contributions, acquisitions or sales of assets, securities or other financial instruments (including swaps or other types of derivatives), securitization transactions, and/or other types of arrangements or transactions to which the Company may be a direct party and/or guarantor. The Company may also from time to time borrow from its subsidiaries for various business purposes. These transactions are generally carried out on arms-length terms and conditions with loans bearing interest at floating rates that generally reflect prevailing market rates at the respective dates such loans were originated.\n\n## 28.4 KEY MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, based on information reported to it:\n\n- /uni25A0 on December/uni00A031, 2020, there were no loans outstanding from the Group to the Company's two corporate o/fficers or to any member of the Company's Board of Directors;\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- /uni25A0 various members of the Company's Board of Directors as well as various other executive o/fficers and directors of other AXA Group companies may, from time to time, purchase insurance, wealth management or other products or services o/ffered by AXA in the ordinary course of its business. The terms and conditions of these transactions are substantially similar to the terms and conditions generally available to the public or to AXA employees in general. In addition, certain members of the Board of Directors are corporate o/fficers, directors or have interests, directly or indirectly, in companies that may have agreements or enter into transactions from time to time with AXA Group entities including extensions of credit, loans, purchases of securities (for their own account or for third parties), underwriting of securities and/or furnishing of other types of services or goods.

This includes the potential liability of AXA UK under customary warranties and indemnities given by AXA UK to Resolution/uni00A0Ltd. in connection with this transaction.\n\n## 29.4.2 Employee and director indemnification obligations\n\nIn addition to other employment-related obligations, various AXA subsidiaries are required to indemnify their employees and directors against certain liabilities and costs that they may incur from time to time in performing activities within the scope of their duties. These activities may include, for example, service as a director, o/fficer, agent, general partner, or in a similar capacity for/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an AXA Group company other than the employee's principal employer or (ii)/uni00A0a company outside the AXA Group where service is at the request of (or for the benefit of) the Group ( e.g. joint ventures, partnerships, or special-purpose investment Companies or funds). The potential amount of compensation relating to commitments covered by these obligations cannot be evaluated with any certainty.\n\n## 29.4.3 Supports provided without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so\n\nThe Group did not provide any material support without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so to structured entities during the period.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 29.5 OTHER ITEMS: RESTRICTION ON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO/uni00A0SHAREHOLDERS\n\nCertain AXA subsidiaries and joint ventures, principally insurance companies, are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise.\n\nIn most cases, the amounts available for distribution from AXA's insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures are limited to net income for the year and retained earnings calculated in accordance with the statutory accounting policies used by the subsidiaries to prepare their local financial statements. Further restrictions may be imposed by the local insurance regulators in countries where AXA operates. In some cases, amounts available for distribution are also subject to regulatory capital adequacy tests or the approval of an independent actuary or subject to individual provisions contained in a company's Bylaws.\n\nIn accordance with European Union directives, insurance companies with their registered office in a European Union member country are required to maintain minimum solvency ratios which must be supported by eligible elements. AXA's insurance operations in countries outside the European Union are also subject to local capital adequacy and solvency margin regulations.\n\nAXA/uni00A0 SA is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations notably stemming from its Non-Euro participations. The aim of the hedging programs of the Company is to protect the shareholder value while managing the associated costs.",

If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish a reserve and record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. However, it is o/f\\_ten di/fficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope.\n\n## 31.1 MATTERS DIRECTLY CONCERNING AXA/uni00A0SA\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA is involved in lawsuits, investigations and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where it does business, including the following:\n\nIn 2007, AXA/uni00A0SA completed the squeeze out of the minority shareholders at two German subsidiaries, AXA Konzern/uni00A0AG ('AKAG') and K\u00f6lnische Verwaltungs-AG f\u00fcr Versicherungswerte ('KVAG'). Following the effective date of these squeeze out transactions in July/uni00A02007, certain former AKAG and KVAG\n\nI\n\nI\n\nshareholders brought proceedings in Germany alleging that the cash compensation o/ffered by AXA/uni00A0SA was not adequate. In the first half of 2016, an initial expert valuation report was delivered to the court based on recent precedents in other German minority buy-out transactions and recommending a significant increase in the cash compensation to be paid to minority shareholders. In addition, interest will be payable on any additional amount finally decided. AXA/uni00A0SA appointed an independent expert to challenge this report and submitted its statement in February/uni00A02017. A court-appointed expert provided a revised report in response to AXA's expert in November/uni00A02018.\n\nA first instance decision was issued in December/uni00A02019. The court decided that the AKAG and KVAG valuation compensation should be increased by approximately 22% of the amount paid by AXA in 2007. The decision requires AXA to make a further payment of approximately \u20ac116/uni00A0million as at December/uni00A02019 which amount was significantly less than the increase proposed by the court appointed expert. The minority shareholders have appealed the decision and AXA counter appealed. Annual interest will accrue in the amount of \u20ac3.14/uni00A0million per annum while the appeal is pending. The appeal determination could take several years. Consequently, the precise financial impact of this matter cannot be estimated with any certainty at this time.",

        "page_content": "## 31.2 MATTERS CONCERNING AXA SUBSIDIARIES\n\nAXA and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions and proceedings of a character normally incidental to their business including claims litigation arising in connection with the Group's insurance business and litigation arising from the Group's Asset Management business.\n\nIn addition, several AXA subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits (both class action and individual), investigations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where they do business, including the United States.\n\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against insurers in the United States and elsewhere involving the scope and interpretation of policies, insurers' sales practices, alleged misconduct or misrepresentation, alleged failure to properly supervise agents, compensation of intermediaries, product features, fees or performance as well as numerous other matters. Some of these actions have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers (including material amounts of punitive damages) or in substantial settlements. In certain jurisdictions, juries have broad discretion in awarding punitive damages. AXA's subsidiaries are involved in these types of litigations as well as regulatory inquiries, investigations or actions with respect to these and a wide variety of other matters related to the ownership or management of real estate, asset or investment activities, corporate transactions, employee benefit disputes, alleged discrimination in employment practices, as well as other matters.\n\nFurthermore, a number of AXA subsidiaries are involved in litigations relating to COVID-19 exposure under business interruption policies.\n\nSome of the litigations described above have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants, and certain of the claimants in these actions seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages.\n\n## 31.2.1 Other litigation\n\n## AXA FRANCE\n\nA class action was brought against AXA France and AGIPI (a French insurance association) on October/uni00A028, 2014 by a French consumer association, CLCV. This action alleges that AXA France and AGIPI breached their contractual obligation to maintain a 4.5% interest rate on certain life insurance contracts subscribed by policyholders prior to June/uni00A01995. The class action complaint cites seven individual cases and is brought on behalf of all similarly situated policyholders. CLCV has appealed to the Court of Appeal of Versailles and its decision is expected in the coming months. AXA France believes that it has strong defenses to the abovementioned claims and is defending this matter vigorously.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAXA France is also involved in a significant number of litigations relating to COVID-19 exposure under standard multi-risk policies with non-damage business interruption extensions. To date, the French courts have delivered inconsistent judgments in these cases, which we expect will continue to be the case as appeals are pursued.\n\n## AXA XL DIVISION\n\nEnedis (formerly ERDF, a subsidiary of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, the primary electric utility in France) has notified claims for coverage under a professional liability policy underwritten by AXA Corporate Solutions Assurance, which was merged into XL Insurance Company/uni00A0SE on December/uni00A031, 2019 ('AXA/uni00A0XL Division'). The underlying liabilities in question arise out of a series of lawsuits (more than 500 individual suits) brought against Enedis by local electricity producers in France engaged in production of solar/green energy. These local producers allege financial losses due to Enedis' delay in processing their applications to be connected to the public grid within the statutory period, resulting in their inability to profit from attractive buyback rates under certain French government decrees promulgated in 2006 and 2010 (the 'Decrees'). AXA/uni00A0XL Division was joined to proceedings, as insurer, in over 200 cases. AXA/uni00A0XL Division pleaded the illegality of the Decrees as its defense and in September/uni00A02016, the Court of Appeal of Versailles referred the question as to the legality of the Decrees to the European Court of Justice ('ECJ') which rendered a decision in favor of the arguments raised by AXA XL Division in March/uni00A02017. In March/uni00A02019, the French Supreme Court upheld the decision of the ECJ. Lower courts continue to dismiss cases based on the above rulings.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland/uni00A0Plc ('RBS') has notified claims for coverage to AXA/uni00A0XL Division under general liability policies covering the years 2001-2004./uni00A0AXA/uni00A0XL Division insured the primary layer (up to \u00a35/uni00A0million per claim or series of related claims) under these policies. RBS seeks coverage for potential liabilities arising out of three class actions brought against NatWest (an RBS subsidiary) between 2005-2007 in the New York Federal Court under the US Anti-Terrorism Act for aiding and abetting terrorism due to certain accounts it maintained. NatWest succeeded in having this case dismissed in March/uni00A02013 on a summary judgment motion, but in 2014 this dismissal was overturned and the case was remanded to the court of first instance who granted NatWest's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the claims under the US AntiTerrorism Act. AXA/uni00A0XL Division is not a party to this litigation. The plainti/ffs appealed the court's decision and a decision is not expected before the end of Q1 2021. In the event the appellate court reverses the summary judgment decision, the exposure, if any, of AXA/uni00A0XL Division in this matter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and will depend on a variety of factors including (i)/uni00A0the ultimate outcome of the litigation for NatWest and, in the event of an adverse outcome, (ii)/uni00A0the number of deemed separate incidents that would trigger coverage, and (iii)/uni00A0whether certain policy exclusions apply.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In connection with M&A Transactions, AXA and its subsidiaries from time to time:\n\n- /uni25A0 are involved in legal actions or other claims brought by purchasers, joint venture partners, shareholders or other transaction parties asserting claims for damages on various theories (including misrepresentation, failure to disclose material  information,  failure  to  perform  contractual duties, breach of fiduciary duties), seeking contractual indemnification, or otherwise seeking to impose liability on AXA and/or its subsidiaries; and/or\n- /uni25A0 benefit from contractual rights to indemnification from third party sellers or other transaction counterparties that are designed to protect the Group against existing or potential future litigation exposures or other types of contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses or assets. These indemnities generally constitute unsecured obligations of the indemnifying party and, consequently, their value may be substantially impaired or rendered worthless in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the indemnifying party.\n\nAXA and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in tax assessment negotiations and/or active litigation with tax authorities over contested assessments or other matters in a number of jurisdictions including in France. These actions or assessments arise in a variety of circumstances including matters in connection with M&A, restructuring or financing transactions as well as in the ordinary course of business.\n\nOver the past several years a number of jurisdictions, including France and Belgium, have enacted legislation that permits corporate entities to be charged with criminal offences. The standard for attributing criminal conduct by corporate o/fficers and employees to corporate entities is not clearly defined in many of these jurisdictions and government prosecutors and judges have broad discretion in this area. In recent years, complaints against or indictments of corporate entities for alleged criminal o/ffences have become increasingly common and certain AXA Group companies have been the subject of penal complaints\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Note/uni00A032 Subsequent events\n\nThere was no material event a/f\\_ter the reporting period to be reported.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nand/or indictments from time to time including in Belgium and France. While a criminal complaint against or indictment of a corporate entity may not pose material financial risk, it has broad potential implications for a regulated financial institution like AXA both from a reputation point of view and from a regulatory perspective because a criminal conviction can have potentially far reaching negative implications for AXA Group companies engaged in regulated businesses around the world (including for their ability to obtain or maintain licenses to engage in certain types of regulated business activities such as Asset Management, insurance and banking).\n\nBeyond litigation risks of the type described above, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they do business. In this context, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject, from time to time, to examinations, investigations, enforcement proceedings and other actions by regulatory and law enforcement authorities (involving civil and/or penal matters) as well as to proposed changes in law and/or regulation that may significantly impact their business and results of operations. For additional information on these matters as well as other risks and contingent liabilities a/ffecting the Group and its business, please see  and Note/uni00A0 29 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments'  in Part/uni00A06  'Consolidated Financial Statements'   of this Annual Report.\n\nAlthough the outcome of any lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty, particularly in the early stages of an action, management believes that the ultimate resolutions of the matters described above are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group, taken as a whole. In addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, to the Company's knowledge, there were no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings, either pending or threatened, that may have, or have had a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the Company or the Group over the past 12/uni00A0months. However, due to the nature of such lawsuits and investigations and the frequency of large damage awards and regulatory sanctions in certain jurisdictions (particularly the United States) that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs or the underlying regulatory violations, management cannot make an estimate of loss, if any, or predict whether these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse e/ffect on the Group's consolidated results of operations in any particular period.",

Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of Life & Savings future policy benefit reserves including deferred acquisition costs\n\n(See Notes/uni00A01.7.3, 1.14.2, 4.4  and 14 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the matter\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group has recorded material Life/uni00A0& Savings liabilities arising from insurance contracts (\u20ac270,989/uni00A0million) and liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participation features (\u20ac36,480/uni00A0million), where risks are born by the Group, as described in Notes/uni00A014.2 and 14.3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe primary assumptions that must be made as part of the valuation include assumptions about mortality, longevity, lapses, morbidity, disability and costs as well as economic assumptions such as interest rates and equity market performance.\n\nAs described in Notes/uni00A01.14.2 and 4.4  to the consolidated financial statements, measurements of Life/uni00A0& Savings technical reserves are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 for Life and Protection insurance contracts, the future policy benefit reserves relating to these contracts are generally measured based on a prospective basis using assumptions on investment yield, mortality, longevity, lapses, morbidity and expenses;\n- /uni25A0 some of these reserves, in particular Protection and Health products, include contracts with surrender guarantees and, in some cases a guaranteed long-term rate or long-term guarantees;\n- /uni25A0 for investment contracts with discretionary participation features, future policy benefits reserves are generally calculated using a prospective approach based on discount rates usually set at inception.\n\nAssumptions used are generally locked-in at inception, and for some Life & Savings reserves are based on unlocked discount rates as stated in note/uni00A014.10.2.\n\nAt each closing, the Company uses a Liability Adequacy Test to determine that technical reserves are su/fficient, and that deferred acquisition costs are recoverable. Liability Adequacy Test is based on current best estimates of all future contractual cash flows that are valued using complex actuarial models and involve a significant degree of judgment.\n\nCertain changes in these assumptions could result in material impact to the valuation of these liabilities and assets.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the valuation of the future policy benefit reserves covering these contracts to be a key audit matter.\n\nI\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to the valuation of these liabilities and assets in the Life/uni00A0& Savings line of business was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the Group methodology with current accounting standards;\n- /uni25A0 we updated our knowledge of the methodologies for measuring future policy benefit reserves covering these contracts as well as the models used to calculate the reserves and evaluated their appropriateness;\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the IT systems used to process the technical data and integrate that data into the accounting system;\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the design of the internal control system and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal controls we deemed key to our audit;\n- /uni25A0 we tested, on a sample basis and based on our risk assessment, the calculation models applied to estimate the future cash flows used to determine the future policy benefit reserves and for the liability adequacy tests;\n- /uni25A0 we applied procedures to test the reliability of the underlying data used in the models and reserve calculations;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated the reasonability of the assumptions used by management and the sensitivity of the models to the assumptions;\n- /uni25A0 we applied analytical procedures with a view to identifying and analyzing any material unusual and/or unexpected changes.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI",

They include claims incurred and reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs.\n\nThese reserves are calculated using statistical and actuarial methods, on the basis of historical claims data and patterns, and use assumptions to estimate ultimate claims cost.\n\nFor some line of business, these estimates require a high degree of judgment, and the assumptions selected may have a significant impact on the ultimate claims cost of these reserves at the end of the reporting period as the inherent uncertainty is higher. This is especially the case for Property/uni00A0& Casualty lines of business that are considered long-tail such as general and professional liability, worker's compensation, and other specialty lines.\n\nIn addition, estimates of gross and net loss from natural catastrophe events and large man-made losses, including business written or reinsured through AXA XL, are more di/fficult to project as they are less frequent but can be of higher severity.\n\nIn particular, as noted in Note/uni00A01.2 the estimation/uni00A0uncertainty of the ultimate cost of claims triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic required a high degree of judgment.\n\nAccordingly, due to these inherent uncertainties to calculate the estimates, we deemed the measurement of claim reserves in the Property & Casualty line to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to the valuation of claim reserves was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the internal controls relating to:\n- -the management of claims and, in particular, the measurement of reserves on a case-by-case basis,\n- -the calculation of the ultimate cost (assumptions, judgments, data, methodologies, compliance with the applicable accounting principles and methods), including any second opinions supplied by Risk Management with respect to technical reserves,\n- -the IT systems used to process the technical data and integrate that data into the accounting system;\n- /uni25A0 we tested the reliability and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data;\n- /uni25A0 we applied procedures (including monitoring the change in loss ratios) to analyse the significant changes that took place over the reporting period;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated the outcome of the accounting estimates made the previous year with a view to assessing the reliability of the process used by management to calculate these estimates;\n- /uni25A0 our work also consisted in assessing the statistical methods and actuarial inputs applied, as well as of the assumptions used, with respect to the applicable regulations, market practices, on going litigations and the economic and financial context of the AXA Group taking into account contrary and corroborating evidence;\n- /uni25A0 focusing on those classes of business where reserve estimates present a higher risk of uncertainty and judgement, we undertook an independent evaluation of the reserves for certain insurance risk categories with a view to providing a basis for our professional judgment and our assessment of the estimates used by the Group;\n- /uni25A0 we have evaluated the reasonableness of management's methodology and assumptions used to estimate the COVID-19 net loss reserves.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs of the activities into which that business was incorporated.\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill, as stated in Note/uni00A01.7.1 to the consolidated financial statements, is performed at least once a year to ensure that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount and there is no impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nAs stated in Note/uni00A05 to the consolidated financial statements, value in use calculations are based on the following main assumptions:\n\n- /uni25A0 cash flow projections based on business plans;\n- /uni25A0 discount rates; and\n- /uni25A0 growth rates,\n\nthus  requiring significant judgment from management.\n\nThis is especially the case for the AXA XL CGU.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter.\n\n## SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the consolidated financial statements, reminded that it is not our responsibility to conclude on the fair presentation and consistency with the financial statements of the solvency related information required by Article/uni00A0L.356-23 of the French Insurance Code ( Code des assurances ).\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article/uni00A0L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is included in the Group's management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to recoverability of goodwill was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards and its implementation;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the internal controls related to goodwill impairment test process;\n- /uni25A0 we also performed substantive procedures regarding the main assumptions to test that:\n- -the  projected  future  cash  flows  are  consistent  with management's most recent estimates, as calculated during the budget process,\n- -the assumptions made with respect to projected future cash flows are reasonable in terms of the economic and financial context of the CGU and, by assessing the reasons for di/fferences between projected and actual performances, that the process by which the estimates were calculated is reliable,\n- -the discount rate and long term growth rate are in a reasonable range and consistent with the projected cash flows to which they apply;\n- /uni25A0 we also performed sensitivity analysis around the main assumptions to ascertain that selected adverse changes to main assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.",

As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AXA/uni00A0SA by the Shareholders' Meetings held on February/uni00A028,/uni00A01989, (PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit) and on June/uni00A08,/uni00A01994, (Mazars).

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The shareholders waived their preferential subscription rights so that this o/ffering could be made exclusively to Group employees (Shareplan 2020).\n\nIn the 38/uni00A0 countries that met the legal, regulatory and tax requirements to participate in Shareplan, a traditional plan was o/ffered to the Group employees in 2020.\n\nThe o/ffering allowed employees to subscribe through a personal investment to AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on countries) with a 20% discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law). Employees are subject to the share price evolution, up or down, as compared to the subscription price.",

The Company's registered o/ffice is located at 25, avenue Matignon, 75008 Paris, France and its  telephone  number  is  +33 (0) 1 40 75 57 00.  AXA/uni00A0 SA  was incorporated in 1957 but the origin of its activities dates to 1852. The Company's corporate existence will continue, subject to dissolution or prolongation, until December/uni00A031, 2059. The Company is registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register ( Registre du commerce et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ) under number/uni00A0572 093 920. AXA's legal entity identifier (LEI) is F5WCUMTUM4RKZ1MAIE39.\n\nThe following documents may be consulted at the AXA Group Legal Department (Tour Majunga - 6, place de la Pyramide - 92908\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Regulation and Supervision\n\nAXA is engaged in regulated business activities on a global scale through numerous operating subsidiaries. The Group's principal business activities of (re)insurance and asset management  are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in each of the various jurisdictions where the Group operates. AXA/uni00A0SA, the ultimate parent holding company of the AXA Group, is also subject to extensive regulation as a result of its listing on Euronext Paris and its direct and indirect shareholding in numerous regulated insurance  and asset management  subsidiaries. Given that the AXA Group is headquartered in Paris, France, this supervision is based to a significant extent on European Union directives and regulations and on the French regulatory system. AXA's principal regulators and supervisory authorities in France are the AMF, which is the financial markets regulator, and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), which is the insurance and financial services supervisor.\n\n## INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE OPERATIONS\n\nWhile the extent and nature of regulation varies from country to country, most jurisdictions in which AXA's (re)insurance subsidiaries operate have laws and regulations governing distribution practices, standards of solvency, levels of capital and reserves, permitted types and concentrations of investments, and business conduct to be maintained by (re)insurance companies, as well as agent licensing, approval of policy forms and, for certain lines of insurance, approval or filing of rates. In certain jurisdictions, regulations limit sales commissions, fees\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense , France) until the filing of AXA's next Universal Registration Document with the AMF: (i)/uni00A0the Bylaws of the Company, (ii)/uni00A0the reports or other documents prepared by any expert at the Company's request which are (in whole or in part) included or referred to in this Universal Registration Document, and (iii)/uni00A0AXA SA's financial statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the three financial years preceding the publication of this Universal Registration Document. These documents are also available on AXA's website and, more specifically, at the following links for the Bylaws of the Company (https://group.axa.com/en/about-us/governance-overview) and the documents referred to in (ii)/uni00A0and (iii)/uni00A0(https://group.axa.com/ en/investor/annual-and-interim-reports).\n\nand certain other marketing expenses that may be incurred by the insurer and impose product suitability and disclosure requirements. In general, insurers are required to file detailed annual financial statements with their supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such agencies may conduct regular or unexpected examinations of the (re)insurers' operations and accounts and request additional information from the (re)insurer. Certain jurisdictions also require registration and periodic reporting by holding companies that control a licensed (re)insurers . This holding company legislation typically requires periodic disclosure, reporting concerning the corporation that controls the licensed insurer and other a/ff iliated companies, including prior approval (or notice) of transactions between the (re)insurer and other a/ffiliates such as intra-group transfers of assets and payment of dividends by the controlled (re)insurer. In addition, such legislation generally provides that any direct or indirect acquisition of 'control' of our (re)insurance subsidiaries domiciled in a given jurisdiction will be subject to the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities in such jurisdiction; the definition of 'control' for such purposes generally includes any direct or indirect acquisition of shares or other instruments representing more than a 9.9% voting interest, and would include the acquisition of shares of AXA/uni00A0SA as an insurance holding company. In general, these regulatory schemes are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders. For additional information, see the paragraph 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

While the specific regulatory capital requirements (including the definition of admitted assets and methods of calculation) vary between jurisdictions, an insurer's required regulatory capital can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, business mix, product design, sales volume, invested assets, liabilities, reserves and movements in the capital markets, including interest rates and financial markets. Regulatory capital requirements may increase, possibly significantly, during periods of declining financial markets and/or lower interest rates.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II\n\nThe European Union has implemented a regulatory regime for European insurers which became e/ff ective on January/uni00A01, 2016, following the adoption of Directive 2009/138/EC of November/uni00A025, 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance, as amended (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Directive') and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together with the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, 'Solvency/uni00A0II'). Solvency/uni00A0II was implemented into French law beginning in 2015. In June/uni00A02019, amendments to the delegated regulations enacted under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive were issued in connection with the 2018 interim review of Solvency/uni00A0II.\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II is designed to implement solvency requirements that better reflect the risks that (re)insurance companies face and build a supervisory system that is consistent across all EU Member States. Solvency/uni00A0II is based on three pillars: (1) Pillar/uni00A01 consists of the quantitative requirements around own funds, valuation rules for assets and liabilities and solvency capital requirements; (2) Pillar/uni00A02 sets out qualitative requirements for the governance and Risk Management of insurers, as well as for the e/ffective supervision of insurers, including the requirement for insurers to submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ('ORSA'); and (3) Pillar/uni00A03 introduces an enhanced reporting and disclosure regime, pursuant to which subject insurance undertakings headquartered in the European Union are required to prepare the Regular Supervisory report ('RSR'), to be submitted by the undertaking to the competent national\n\nsupervisory authority on a regular basis as determined by the regulation, and the Solvency and Financial Condition report ('SFCR'), to be made publicly available on an annual basis. Solvency/uni00A0II covers, among other matters, the valuation of assets and liabilities, the treatment of insurance groups, the definition of capital and the overall level of required capital. A key aspect of Solvency/uni00A0II is that assessment of the Group's risks and capital requirements is aligned more closely with economic capital methodologies and allows the use of either a standard model or an insurer's own internal economic capital model (to permit a better understanding of the actual risks and Risk Management of the insurer) to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'), subject in the latter case to the approval of the insurer's lead supervisor.\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II provides for two separate levels of solvency capital requirements: (i)/uni00A0the Minimum Capital Requirement ('MCR'), which is the amount of own funds below which policyholders and beneficiaries are exposed to an unacceptable level of risk should the (re)insurance companies be allowed to continue their operations, and (ii)/uni00A0the SCR, which corresponds to a level of eligible own funds that enables (re)insurance companies to absorb significant losses and that gives reasonable assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made.\n\nThe ACPR has approved the use by AXA of its internal model (the 'Internal Model') to calculate its SCR under Solvency/uni00A0II. The Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of the Group as of December/uni00A031, 2020, published on February/uni00A025, 2021, was estimated at 200%/uni00A0 (1) , compared to 198% as of December/uni00A031, 2019. The Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its SCR at all times during 2020.\n\nAXA continues to regularly review the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model, and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any significant change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR.\n\nFor more information on the Internal Model, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2  'Internal Model' of this Annual Report. For further information on AXA's SCR, Internal Model and other Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2019, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com).  AXA  Group's  SFCR  for  the  year  ended December/uni00A031, 2020 is expected to be published on May/uni00A020, 2021, on the same website.\n\nI\n\nI",

EIOPA's proposals include, among others, (i)/uni00A0changing the extrapolation method for the risk-free rate curve as well as changing the static and dynamic volatility adjuster design which are both used to value insurance best estimate liabilities, changing the risk margin calculation; (ii)/uni00A0revising reporting requirements and disclosure deadlines under the Solvency/uni00A0II framework; (iii)/uni00A0granting supervisory authorities extended powers to address systemic risk and other macro prudential concerns, allowing them to impose additional measures to reinforce an insurer's financial condition, such as (a) setting a capital surcharge to address entity-, activity-, or behavior-based sources of systemic risk, (b) restricting or suspending dividend or other payments to shareholders (including share buybacks) or (c) other implementing measures aimed at mitigating liquidity risk-related concerns; (iv)/uni00A0strengthening the supervisory powers of, and enforcement measures that may be imposed by, a group supervisor with respect to the holding company of the Group; (v)/uni00A0 amending the Group supervision regime (including EOF requirements and Minimum Capital Requirement for groups); (vi)/uni00A0establishing a minimum harmonized and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework; and (vii)/uni00A0setting up a European network of national Insurance Guarantee Schemes. The European Commission is expected to publish its proposal regarding the review of the Solvency II framework in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n## Recovery and resolution regimes for/uni00A0(re)insurers\n\nIn the event of a failure by a (re)insurance company or an insurance holding company to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements (including the MCR and the SCR, as applicable), insurance supervisors generally have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions, including limiting or prohibiting the issuance of new business, prohibiting or restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, and/or putting a company into rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings. In particular, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance industry, set forth in Order No./uni00A02017-1608 of November/uni00A027, 2017 and its various implementing measures (the 'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR has broad resolution powers with respect to insurance groups, insurance holding companies, such as AXA/uni00A0SA, and (re)insurance companies, including prohibiting payment of dividends, ordering portfolio transfers, establishing temporary bridge institutions and imposing a temporary stay on early termination rights. Under the French Resolution Framework, French major insurance\n\ngroups, such as the AXA Group, are required to prepare and file with the ACPR a pre-emptive recovery plan ( plan pr\u00e9ventif de r\u00e9tablissement ) covering insurance holding companies, insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries thereof, and any other entity of such groups, providing key services ( services indispensables ) thereto, and to ensure that such recovery plan remains up-todate therea/f\\_t er.\n\nFurthermore, the proposals and continuing discussions regarding recovery and resolution in the insurance sector may broaden the scope and extent of regulatory measures available to insurance supervisory authorities. In particular, EIOPA proposed in its Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion to establish a minimum harmonized and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework, advocating for strengthened preventive and resolution powers available to national authorities, while the Financial Stability Board (the 'FSB') and the IAIS are increasingly focusing on the development of recovery and resolution frameworks, strategies and supervisory practices in the insurance industry. For instance, on August/uni00A025, 2020, the FSB published its Key Attributes Assessment Methodology for the Insurance Sector, which sets out essential criteria to guide the assessment of the compliance of a jurisdiction's insurance resolution framework with the FSB's Key Attributes of E/ffective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, as updated in 2014, which constitute the FSB's 'umbrella' standard for resolution regimes for all types of financial institutions. On the same date, the FSB also issued a note explaining the application of the aforementioned methodology and key attributes during the period of suspension of the designation of global systemically important insurers ('G-SIIs'), and indicated that the Key Attributes should continue to apply during the suspension period to any insurer that could be systemically significant. Furthermore, as part of its work on recovery and resolution, the IAIS published an Application on Recovery Planning on November/uni00A018, 2019 and recently conducted a public consultation, closed on February/uni00A05, 2021, regarding a dra/f\\_t  Application Paper on Resolution Powers and Planning, which aims to provide guidance on supervisory practices related to resolution and on the application of certain insurance core principles (' ICPs' )  and related ComFrame standards in a resolution context.\n\n## EU-US Covered Agreement\n\nIn connection with Solvency/uni00A0II, on September/uni00A022, 2017, the European Union and the United States signed the 'Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance' (the 'Covered Agreement') which sets out principles governing the imposition of Group capital and supervisory standards for insurance groups headquartered in an EU Member State or the United States with operations in both. Following approval by the European Parliament on March/uni00A01, 2018 and the European Council on March/uni00A020, 2018, the Covered\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

Pursuant to the Covered Agreement, the AXA Group will remain subject to group supervisory and capital requirements, as currently provided under Solvency/uni00A0II, with AXA's US insurance subsidiaries remaining subject to local requirements. The Covered Agreement also addresses various regulatory information-sharing and reporting matters, as well as EU/US reinsurance market issues.\n\nOn October/uni00A026, 2020, the European Union and the United States held the third meeting of the joint committee established in order to discuss the progress made toward timely implementation of the Covered Agreement and, in particular, on the removal of collateral and local presence requirements for reinsurers, as well as the provisions on group supervision and exchange of information.\n\n## LLOYD'S\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the XL Group in 2018, AXA has been managing, through Catlin Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, one of the larger syndicates at Lloyd's. As a result, AXA is exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory matters, such as the Council of Lloyd's wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members.\n\nFor further information on the risks related to regulatory capital requirements, see the paragraph 'the Group's or its (re)insurance subsidiaries' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## IAIS AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP ('IAIG') STATUS\n\nThe IAIS has developed several sets of supervisory requirements and actions applicable to the insurance industry: (i)/uni00A0ICPs , which are intended to apply to the supervision of all insurers and insurance groups, regardless of size or importance; (ii)/uni00A0the Common Framework ('ComFrame'), which builds and expands on the standards and guidance set forth in the ICPs to establish supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the e/ff ective group-wide supervision of IAIGs, as well as a globally comparable risk-based measure of capital adequacy of IAIGs, the Insurance Capital Standard (the 'ICS'); and (iii)/uni00A0policy measures for GSIIs and an assessment methodology for designating GSIIs. From 2013 to 2016, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national\n\nI\n\nI\n\nauthorities, annually published a list of GSIIs, which included AXA in each of such years. On May/uni00A018, 2020, EIOPA published an updated list of IAIGs headquartered in the European Union, established in accordance with ComFrame, which included AXA.\n\nOn November/uni00A014, 2019, the IAIS adopted the ComFrame, which includes the version 2.0 of the ICS. As part of the IAIS implementation schedule, ICS/uni00A02.0 is first subject to a five-year monitoring period, starting in January/uni00A02020, during which IAIGs can be asked by their supervisors to compute an ICS, on a voluntary basis, for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges. The end objective for the IAIS is to have the ICS implemented in all jurisdictions as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs a/f\\_ter the monitoring period. On November/uni00A014, 2019, the IAIS also adopted a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (the 'Holistic Framework'), in lieu of the previous individual GSII designation mechanism, which is currently being implemented.\n\nThe Holistic Framework comprises a set of enhanced supervisory measures and powers of intervention ( e.g. , ongoing supervisory requirements, applied to insurers, enhanced macroprudential surveillance, crisis management and recovery planning), which are embedded within certain ICPs and ComFrame materials, an annual global monitoring exercise by the IAIS (at individual insurer and sector-wide levels), as well as implementation assessment activities aimed at assessing and mitigating the potential build-up of systemic risk in the global insurance sector. The Holistic Framework moves away from the previous binary approach, in which a set of pre-determined policy measures applied to only a small group of identified GSIIs, to an approach promoting a proportionate application of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention for macroprudential purposes to a broader portion of the insurance sector.\n\nThe IAIS will however continue to use risk factors similar to those used in the past to identify GSIIs, to assess potential systemic risk at individual insurers as part of its global monitoring exercise and systemic risk assessment. In addition, many of the enhanced supervisory measures reflected in the Holistic Framework are similar to and derived from the enhanced policy measures the IAIS had formerly adopted for application to GSIIs only. In light of the development and adoption of the Holistic Framework by the IAIS, the FSB has decided to continue suspending the annual identification of GSIIs as from the beginning of 2020. In November/uni00A02022, the FSB will review the need to either discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of GSIIs based on the initial implementation of the Holistic Framework.\n\nAXA will continue to monitor the development of the Holistic Framework, ICPs and ComFrame and expects the regulatory landscape with respect to (re)insurance and financial markets",

These include, in Europe, Directive 2011/61/EU of June/uni00A08, 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (as amended, 'AIFMD'), and Directive 2009/65/ EC of July/uni00A013, 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ('UCITS'), and their various implementing regulations and transposition measures. AIFMD is currently undergoing a review by the European Commission, which is expected to publish draft legislative proposals in the third quarter of 2021, which might also lead to further adjustments to the rules applicable to UCITS. In addition, AXA's investment management operations in the United States are subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThese regulations are generally designed to safeguard client assets and ensure the adequacy of disclosures concerning investment returns, the risk characteristics of invested assets in various funds, the suitability of investments for client investment objectives and risk tolerance, as well as the identity, regulatory approvals and qualifications of the investment manager. These regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment company, censures and/or fines.\n\nThe European Union (Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0648/2012 of July/uni00A04, 2012, also referred to as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation - 'EMIR') and the US regulations (principally the Dodd-Frank Act), as amended from time to time, set several requirements and prescriptive guidelines for derivatives which\n\nimpact operations, liquidity and credit risk management  for derivatives. AXA's asset managers and banks, which manage derivatives on behalf of various AXA Group a/ff iliates (including on behalf of AXA), are currently operating in conformity with these rules, in line with the Group's financial risk framework.\n\nIn addition, certain AXA entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms, including Directive 2013/36/EU of June/uni00A026, 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (as amended 'CRD'), and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0575/2013 of June/uni00A026, 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, as amended, which set forth specific capital, governance and remuneration requirements (as amended 'CRR'). On June/uni00A027, 2019, Directive (EU) 2019/878 of May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRD/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRR/uni00A0II'), which respectively amend CRD and CRR, entered into force. CRD/uni00A0II and CRR/uni00A0II further implement the Basel/uni00A0III framework by amending various CRD and CRR provisions regarding, e.g. , holding company rules, leverage ratios, large exposures, liquidity, market risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements (including on remuneration). Most provisions of CRD/uni00A0II had to be transposed into national law by EU Member states by December/uni00A028, 2020, and were transposed in France by Order No./uni00A02020-1635 of December/uni00A021, 2020, while most CRR/uni00A0II requirements will be applicable from June/uni00A028, 2021.\n\nMoreover, certain AXA entities are subject to Directive 2014/65/EU of May/uni00A015, 2014 on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0600/2014 on markets in financial instruments, as amended ('MiFIR' and, together with MiFID/uni00A0II, and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, the 'MiFID/uni00A0II Package') which entered into force in 2018. The MiFID/uni00A0II package has been designed to better integrate the European Union's financial markets and increase cross-border investments, market transparency and investor protection, imposes a wide variety of new requirements including with respect to trading/ clearing of certain derivatives on organized platforms, regular reporting with respect to derivatives positions and certain other types of financial instruments, enhanced governance and investor protection standards, restrictions and/or prohibitions on certain types of compensation arrangements or other monetary inducements to firms providing independent investment advice and greater regulation of structured products and other complex financial instruments.\n\nThe reforms introduced by the MiFID/uni00A0II Package significantly impacted EU securities and derivatives markets. The MiFID/uni00A0II Package may also be revised in the future, including as a result of implementing regulations, transposition laws and regulatory guidance enacted or issued in connection therewith. In particular, the European Commission conducted a public consultation on the review of the MiFID/uni00A0II Package, which expired in May/uni00A02020, while ESMA was conducting a parallel public consultation on\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

Building on these consultations, the European Commission is expected to publish dra/f\\_t   legislative amendments to MiFID/uni00A0II and MiFIR in the course of 2021.\n\nFurthermore, some AXA entities are directly or indirectly subject to Regulation (EU) No./uni00A01286/2014 of November/uni00A026, 2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation') which entered into force in 2018, the objective of which is to enhance retail investor protection by standardizing the information through predefined key information documents. While the PRIIPs Regulation already started impacting insurance undertakings, banks and asset managers, its revision is under consideration by the European Commission in order to reach better convergence with other EU regulations.\n\nFor additional information, see the paragraph 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## OTHER SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS\n\n## EU Data Protection Reform\n\nThe EU Data Protection Reform, which was adopted in 2016 and entered into force in 2018, establishes a comprehensive framework governing the protection and processing of personal data in the private and public sectors, which includes the GDPR.\n\nThe main principles of the GDPR include (i)/uni00A0the strengthening of citizens' fundamental rights, giving them more control over their personal data and making it easier for them to access it, (ii)/uni00A0 an increased harmonization of the applicable law across the European Union and a 'one-stop-shop' that will streamline cooperation between the data protection authorities on issues with implications for all the European Union, and (iii)/uni00A0a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. The GDPR applies to both EU and non-EU companies, if the latter are o/ffering goods and services or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the European Union. As (re)insurance companies need an EU license for providing insurance services in the European Union, the GDPR\n\nI\n\nI\n\napplies primarily, in the insurance and reinsurance sector, to companies operating in the European Union.\n\nIn France, the EU Data Protection Reform has been transposed by Law No./uni00A02018-493 regarding personal data protection, which entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018, and various implementing measures, including Decree No./uni00A02018-687 of August/uni00A01, 2018.\n\nFor further information concerning data protection, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer in the European Union could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Personal data transfers to non-EU jurisdictions (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission)\n\nFollowing invalidation in 2015 of the European Commission's Safe Harbor Decision by the European Union Court of Justice (the '2015 ECJ Decision'), which had allowed, under certain conditions, for the transfer of personal information for commercial purposes from companies in the European Union to companies in the United States which had signed up to the US Department of Commerce 'Safe Harbor Privacy Principles,' transatlantic data flows between companies continued using other mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses with US companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within a multinational corporate group. Following the 2015 ECJ Decision, a new safe harbor, referred to as the 'EU-US Privacy Shield,' had been created in July/uni00A02016, but was invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice on July/uni00A016, 2020 (the '2020 ECJ Decision'), which also required that supplementary measures be considered for other mechanisms for data transfers to any non-EU jurisdiction (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission). As banks and (re)insurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group has continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data between companies within the AXA Group. We currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the US and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required. For further information concerning transatlantic data transfers, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer in the European Union could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Personal data transfers to and from the United Kingdom\n\nBrexit could significantly impact transfers of data to or from the United Kingdom. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes an interim bridging mechanism starting January/uni00A01, 2021 that allows the continued free flow of personal data from the European Union to the United Kingdom for a six-month period. Upon expiry of this bridging mechanism, and unless an adequacy decision is adopted by the European Commission, the United Kingdom will be considered a third country under GDPR.\n\nIn case of early termination of the bridging mechanism, or if no adequacy decision is adopted by the European Commission, data transfers from the European Union to the United Kingdom would be subject to additional safeguards, comparable to those currently required for transfers between the European Union and the non-EU jurisdictions. In such case, EU-UK data flows between companies would continue, but would rely on other mechanisms than before Brexit, such as standard contractual clauses with UK companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within a multinational corporate group with the considered supplementary measures as per the 2020 ECJ decision.\n\nRegarding data transfers from the United Kingdom to EU Member States, the UK government has decided to allow such transfers to continue as before Brexit, but this is subject to review. Consequently, there is a risk that the United Kingdom could impose new restrictions to outbound transfers of personal data prior to or a/f\\_ter the expiry of the bridging mechanism.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\nOn September/uni00A024, 2020, the European Commission published a draft regulation on digital operational resilience for the financial sector ('DORA'), which is designed to establish a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial institutions, including (re)insurance undertakings and intermediaries, credit institutions, investment firms, as well as alternative investment fund managers and UCITS management companies. This framework aims at enhancing the financial institutions' conduct of ICT Risk Management, establishing a thorough testing of ICT systems, increasing supervisors' awareness of cyber risks and ICT-related incidents faced by financial institutions, as well as introducing powers for competent supervisory authorities to oversee risks stemming from financial institutions' dependency on ICT third-party service providers. DORA also proposes to create a consistent incident reporting mechanism in order to strengthen supervisory e/ff  ectiveness. This dra/f\\_t   regulation is currently being considered by the EU Parliament and Council, through the EU legislative process. Furthermore, on October/uni00A08, 2020, EIOPA issued a set of guidelines aimed at promoting the operational resilience\n\nof the digital operations of (re)insurance undertakings. These guidelines provide guidance to national competent authorities and (re)insurance undertakings on the ICT security and governance requirements envisaged under Solvency/uni00A0II, and will apply from July/uni00A01, 2021.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II sets out the remuneration policy principles and governance requirements to be implemented by European insurers and specifies that the companies subject to Solvency/uni00A0II must adopt a written remuneration policy compliant with a number of principles set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of October/uni00A010, 2014 (as amended, the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation') which promotes sound and effective risk management  and does not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk tolerance limits of the Company. In this context, AXA has reviewed and formalized its existing Group remuneration policy, identified the individuals responsible for managing and having an impact on the Group's overall risk profile, and defined a consistent approach to manage remuneration of individuals in charge of control functions. AXA's Compensation & Governance Committee is in charge of overseeing the design of the remuneration policy and remuneration practices, their implementation and operation.\n\nSince 2008, there have been a variety of proposals with respect to executive compensation practices at financial institutions including from the FSB and other regulatory bodies. Certain of these proposals have been embodied in regulation or legislation, while others remain best practice recommendations.\n\nIn  2009,  the  FSB  published  the  'Principles  for  Sound Compensation Practices', together with implementation standards. Among the matters covered in these standards and principles are a variety of mechanisms (including minimum recommended deferrals of cash bonuses, greater use of longterm equity grants rather than cash as a form of compensation, minimum vesting/deferral periods, and performance criteria for vesting of long-term awards) that are designed to ensure an appropriate alignment of interests between (i)/uni00A0Executive Management and certain employees (such as traders) who can have a potentially significant impact on the nature and duration of risks incurred, (ii)/uni00A0the Company and (iii)/uni00A0shareholders. The FSB's principles were supplemented by additional guidance published by the FSB in 2018, which has been developed in the form of recommendations regarding improvements in compensation practices and tools that could be used to reduce misconduct risk and address misconduct incidents.\n\nIn addition, on April/uni00A07, 2020, EIOPA published an opinion on the supervision of remuneration principles in the insurance sector. This opinion is based on EIOPA's views that the remuneration principles defined in the Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation are high-level and leave considerable discretion to undertakings and supervisory\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

As a result, EIOPA's opinion sets out guidance to national supervisory authorities on how to challenge the application of certain remuneration principles, and focuses on employees identified as potential higher profile risk-takers including, subject to certain variable compensation thresholds, (i)/uni00A0members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking, (ii)/uni00A0Executive Directors who e/ff ectively run the undertaking, (iii)/uni00A0key function holders within the meaning of the Solvency/uni00A0II regulations ( i.e. , risk management , compliance, internal audit and actuarial), and (iv)/uni00A0 employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the undertakings' risk profile. EIOPA has indicated that it will begin monitoring the application of this opinion by national supervisory authorities two years a/f\\_ter its publication ( i.e. , a/f\\_ter April/uni00A07, 2022).\n\nThese principles and standards are reflected in a variety of regulations and legislative initiatives that have been enacted over the past few years in various jurisdictions where the Group does business. While these restrictions do not apply uniformly to the Group across the various jurisdictions where it does business, the Group has largely aligned its global executive compensation practices with these standards and principles, and conducts regular reviews of its compensation practices and policies in light of these standards as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The application of these principles and standards may vary among the di/fferent actors in the financial sector (such as banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity funds and hedge funds) and across the various jurisdictions where the Group does business, which may give rise to certain competitive issues for the Group, including by a/ffecting the Group's ability to attract and retain top-rate talents.\n\n## Evolution of accounting standards\n\nPolicyholders' liabilities are currently accounted for according to IFRS/uni00A04, which generally allows the use of a wide variety of accounting practices for insurance contracts, reflecting di/ff erent national accounting requirements, and the continuation of accounting policies applied prior to conversion to IFRS. On May/uni00A018, 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') issued the IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0- Insurance Contracts, which will replace IFRS/uni00A04, finalizing a long-standing project of the IASB to develop a single, consistent approach to the accounting for insurance contracts. In particular, IFRS/uni00A017 requires insurance obligations to be accounted for using current values, instead of historical costs. Amended on June/uni00A025, 2020, IFRS/uni00A017 is scheduled to become e/ff ective for annual periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2023, subject to its adoption by the European Union.\n\nIn parallel with IFRS/uni00A017, the Group will apply the IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0Financial Instruments. The published e/ffective date of IFRS/uni00A09 was January/uni00A01, 2018. However, given the interaction between financial assets and insurance liabilities, the IASB issued\n\nI\n\nI\n\namendments to IFRS/uni00A04 allowing, under certain criteria, entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to defer the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 until the e/ffective date of IFRS/uni00A017, but no later than January/uni00A01, 2023, so that qualifying insurers could apply both standards for the first time simultaneously. The Group is eligible for this temporary exemption and has decided to apply it.\n\nThe implementation of these two standards within the Group is in progress and management is currently assessing the impact of their adoption.\n\n## Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives\n\nThere are various initiatives at the French, EU and international levels with respect to climate change and sustainable finance, which generally aim at proposing reforms to and potential changes a/ffecting (i)/uni00A0investment activities; (ii)/uni00A0disclosure requirements, such as Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June/uni00A018, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'), which apply, in particular, to undertakings (such as the Company) that are required to publish a non-financial statement, or Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation as regards EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks and sustainability-related disclosures for benchmark; (iii)/uni00A0requirements relating to the inclusion of environmental, social and governance considerations into insurance and asset management  products and advice, or (iv)/uni00A0stress testing requirements, such as the recent climate stress test exercise conducted by the ACPR, the first results of which are expected to be published in April/uni00A02021. In particular, the European Commission conducted in 2020 a public consultation on dra/f\\_t  legislation regarding the integration of sustainability considerations into the prudential, distribution, investment and advisory framework for (re)insurance undertakings, insurance distributors, asset managers and investment firms which is expected to be finally adopted in the course of 2021. EIOPA released its technical advice to the European Commission on the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the delegated acts under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive and Directive (EU) 2016/97 of January/uni00A020, 2016 on insurance distribution (as amended, the 'IDD') on April/uni00A030, 2019, as well as its opinion on sustainability within the Solvency/uni00A0II framework on September/uni00A030, 2019. Furthermore, the IAIS completed in January/uni00A02021 a public consultation on a dra/f\\_t  Application Paper on the Supervision of Climate-related Risks in the Insurance Sector, which has been developed to support insurance supervisory authorities in their e/ff orts to integrate climate-related risks into supervisory frameworks. Those or similar initiatives are expected to continue in 2021 and could result in new or additional requirements for financial institutions.",

The NFRD is an amendment to the Accounting Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) that requires certain large companies, such as AXA/uni00A0SA, to publish annually a non-financial statement. The European Commission is currently reviewing the NFRD as part of its strategy to strengthen the foundations for sustainable investment, and has conducted a public consultation regarding this review that closed on June/uni00A011, 2020. The Commission is expected to issue a proposal to amend the NFRD in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFor further information on climate change, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and Biodiversity ' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Reform and potential changes to reference rates and indices (benchmarks)\n\nReforms to interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices (also known as 'benchmarks') have been recently enacted, and regulatory authorities have also proposed further reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting benchmarks. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of June/uni00A08, 2016 (as amended, the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), which entered into force on January/uni00A01, 2018, as well as the EU Benchmark Regulation as incorporated into UK law as from January/uni00A01, 2021 (the 'UK Benchmark Regulation' and, together with the EU Benchmark Regulation, the 'Benchmark Regulation') imposed additional requirements on the provision of financial market-related benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK.\n\nSeveral interbank market benchmarks have been designated as critical benchmarks under the Benchmark Regulation, including  Libor,  Euribor  and  Eonia,  and  their  related benchmark methodologies have been made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks might be discontinued in the future, including, Eonia, which is currently expected to cease being published on January/uni00A03, 2022, and Libor, as the Libor administrator is consulting on ceasing publication of Libor settings on December/uni00A031, 2021 (or, June/uni00A030, 2023, in the case of certain USD Libor settings). In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation was adopted o February/uni00A010, 2021 and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the EU financial markets' operations; this new statutory benchmark would replace other benchmarks used in contracts and  financial instruments, which (i)/uni00A0have not been renegotiated before the date of cessation of the benchmark, and (ii)/uni00A0contain either no contractual replacement (or so-called 'fallback provision'), or a fallback provision which is deemed unsuitable be supervisors.\n\nBecause these reforms are a/ffecting the whole financial sector, the transition to the new benchmarks creates industry-wide risks,\n\nto which AXA is therefore exposed. AXA is conducting a Groupwide project to manage this transition and manage the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, risk management  efforts, investment strategies and product design, among others.\n\n## Evolution of the compliance regulatory and/uni00A0litigation environment\n\nThe Group's (re)insurance, asset management  and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services. In the European Union, initiatives related to the financial sector include in particular the IDD, MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation. Similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions where the Group operates, and these initiatives are likely to continue to expand, resulting in increased operational compliance costs to meet regulatory expectations.\n\nThe IDD superseded the Insurance Mediation Directive and is designed to improve consumer protection by ensuring that all distributors of insurance products operate on a level playing field. The main provisions of the IDD relate to enhanced professional requirements ( e.g. , continuing training and development for distributors), conduct of business rules, conflicts of interest (relating to fees, commissions and bonuses), increased disclosure and transparency and extensive product governance requirements. It also includes additional requirements for the sale of insurance products with investment elements in order to ensure that policyholders receive a similar level of protection as buyers of retail investment products regulated under MiFID/uni00A0II ( e.g. , when providing advice, distributors have to assess whether the insurance-based investment product is suitable for the customer).\n\nThe IDD entered into force on October/uni00A01, 2018, while MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation entered into force at the beginning of January/uni00A02018.\n\nFinancial crime compliance programs of financial institutions (anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international sanctions compliance) continue to be a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, with increasingly significant penalties imposed for compliance failures. In particular, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691 of December/uni00A09, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy, known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II', which was introduced in June/uni00A02017, included new requirements for all large French companies to establish internal procedures to prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence peddling committed in France and abroad. Sapin/uni00A0II also established a new French anti-corruption agency ( Agence fran\u00e7aise anticorruption ), which was given strengthened supervisory and enforcement powers. Furthermore, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342 of November/uni00A04, 2020 and No./uni00A02020-115 of February/uni00A012, 2020 enhanced the requirements\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

In continental Europe, the introduction of class actions, including in France in 2014, has, and is likely to continue to, increase litigation risks and costs for insurers, asset managers and other financial institutions. Most recently, the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of November/uni00A025, 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at the EU level aims at enabling qualified entities to seek remedy through representative actions against infringements of provisions of EU law in a variety of areas (including data protection and financial services), in order to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## AXA Group tax policy\n\nBoth as a multinational company and as a provider of investments and savings products, the AXA Group follows a responsible and transparent approach on tax issues.\n\nThe taxes AXA pays are an important part of its wider economic and social impact and play a key role in the development of countries where it operates/uni00A0 (1) . AXA regards it as a critical element of its commitment to grow in a sustainable, responsible and socially inclusive way.\n\nAXA also squares its responsibilities as a co-operative, compliant taxpayer in each and every country in which it operates, with the need to support competitive business growth - serving all its stakeholders including investors, suppliers and employees.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS IN RELATION TO AXA AS/uni00A0A/uni00A0MULTINATIONAL COMPANY\n\n## The AXA Group's approach to tax issues\n\nIn the countries where it operates, AXA is both a tax payer and a tax collector, given that many specific taxes are levied on (re) insurance policies and collected from our customers as part of the insurance and Asset Management revenues while others are\n\nprovide an e/ffective and e/fficient way of protecting the collective interests of consumers. This Directive must be transposed by EU Member States by December/uni00A025, 2022 for a scheduled application date of June/uni00A025, 2023.\n\nIn addition, the litigation environment has been evolving in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with holders of property and casualty insurance policies increasingly seeking coverage for losses caused by COVID-19 and related governmental actions, such as lockdown measures. A number of lawsuits have been and may be introduced against insurers, such as AXA, in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nFor additional information, please see 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' and 'We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits and/or regulatory investigations which may a/ffect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' and Section/uni00A05.8 'Other material risks - Regulatory risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nremitted to the various state and federal administrations around the world.\n\nThe tax function is organized within the Group to ensure full compliance with all tax legislation in the countries where AXA operates. In addition to the Group Tax Department based in France, all key operational entities/countries/geographic zones have a tax team in charge of ensuring that tax regulations are well understood and fully satisfied by the entities.\n\nAs a part of the global internal risk assessment, a specific tax internal control program is implemented. These controls must be reported and documented by each team in scope to ensure full compliance.\n\nA Tax Code of Ethics, agreed between Group Tax Department and local tax teams, highlights the key principles guiding the actions of the various tax teams:\n\n- /uni25A0 to remain up to date with respect to applicable laws and regulations;\n- /uni25A0 to comply with tax laws and regulations;\n- /uni25A0 to maintain a good relationship with the local tax authorities; and\n- /uni25A0 not to engage in aggressive tax driven transactions that could compromise the good reputation of the Group.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## SHARES, SHARE/uni00A0CAPITAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nThe satisfaction of this Code of Ethics is a prerequisite of the activities performed by all AXA tax teams. In this respect, a biannual tax review process of each key entity or business line is performed by the Group Tax Department in connection with each local team. During these reviews, specific attention is given to tax audits and associated tax risks as well as market positions on tax matters that may impact AXA. These reviews o/ffer a global framework for the tax teams to identify, analyze, control, and report tax risks.\n\nIn addition, an International Tax Committee composed of various senior tax executives within AXA tax teams meets every quarter to ensure consistency in approach on some technical topics, as well as agreements on guidelines, when necessary, connected to specific items.\n\nAs an international group operating in several countries, the AXA Group is subject to various tax regimes and regulations and takes into account any changes in tax law. AXA is specifically vigilant about the changes that could result in higher tax expenses and payments, higher compliance costs or that may a/ff ect the AXA Group's tax liability, return on investments and business operations. In particular, please see the paragraph 'Changes in tax laws or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhen considering how AXA entities structure commercial arrangements, tax implications are analyzed in parallel with other consequences such as capital e/ff iciency and legal and regulatory aspects when deciding between potential alternative arrangements.\n\nAXA has no licensed insurance or operating business activities in the countries specifically identified as non-cooperative jurisdictions/uni00A0 (1) under French and European rules, except in Panama. The presence in this jurisdiction is purely driven by operational purposes.\n\nAXA still holds two operating companies in Panama (one providing assistance services to local customers, and the other delivering health claim services) employing circa 45/uni00A0people at the end of 2020.\n\nMore globally, AXA does not use non cooperative jurisdictions to avoid taxes on operational activities performed elsewhere.\n\nAny presence in countries in which AXA operates with tax rates lower than France are driven by business operations. With the\n\nacquisition of the XL Group in September/uni00A02018, AXA now has a material presence and substance in Bermuda with nearly 200/uni00A0employees working for AXA XL there. Despite the fact that Bermuda is a  low-tax jurisdiction, it is a center of expertise and one of the key locations of the worldwide reinsurance market. It is not considered as a non-cooperative jurisdiction according to the French and European Union laws. This presence is mainly driven by local capital management regulation enabling flexibility on the required capital for reinsurance activities and AXA supports the Economic Substance legislation recently enacted in this country. This situation will in no way change how the AXA Group is managed on the tax side. AXA will continue to tax its operations in the various countries where operational profits are made.\n\n## Disclosure on tax matters and information on/uni00A0taxes connected with the Group's activities in each country\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in compliance with IFRS standards (as disclosed in Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0Note/uni00A01 'Accounting principles'  of this Annual Report). Accounting for income taxes recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of the entity's assets and liabilities, as required by IAS/uni00A012 (see Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0- Note/uni00A01.17.1 'Income taxes'  of this Annual Report).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements present the reconciliation between the theoretical tax charge and the e/ffective tax charge under IFRS. All di/fferences are fully explained (see Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0Note/uni00A019 'Tax'  of this Annual Report). It should be noted that in many jurisdictions where AXA operates, the income and capital gains on savings-products benefit from a favorable tax treatment, also when such products are included in life insurance products. This leads to a lower e/ffective tax rate for life insurance companies.\n\nIn addition to the details reported around the Group e/ffective tax rate, AXA reports substantial information on the impacts of any change in local tax regulations on its business, as well as details of the tax burden per line of business and per country. AXA's income tax expenses/benefits are extensively disclosed in the Annual Report and are broken down by business segment and country. For each, a dedicated paragraph provides a comment about the line related to Tax Income (see Section/uni00A02.3 'Activity Report - Underlying Earnings, Adjus ted Earnings and Net Income Group share' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

This report is available on the AXA website (www.   axa. com) at the end of the AXA Group Tax Policy page. AXA updates this report annually and the most recent version was issued in June/uni00A02020.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS OF ACTIVITIES AND/uni00A0PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE GROUP\n\n## Activities of the Group\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to strict regulations and rigorous control in each territory in which AXA operates. In addition to these regulations, AXA has developed a set of detailed internal standards that applies to all Group entities that are managed or controlled by AXA, regardless of the activities undertaken by the entity or its ownership structure.\n\nAccording to these internal standards, Chief Executive O/fficers must ensure that sta/ff  are fully conversant, and comply with applicable laws, mandatory Codes of Conduct, rules and regulations (including applicable tax laws and regulations) relevant to their area of operations.\n\nThis means that local senior management must appreciate the tax implications of the activities in their entity. The main considerations are:\n\n- /uni25A0 compliance with the taxation of employees in the territory in which they are employed;\n- /uni25A0 compliance with the taxation of business undertaken in the territory (including levies and sales taxes); and\n- /uni25A0 cross-border tax issues.\n\nA specific focus on transfer pricing is made in application of these standards, to ensure that the pricing of our intra-group activities is consistent with the OECD 'arm's length' principle as well as\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwith local transfer pricing rules to pay adequate tax on profits where the value is created.\n\nIn  particular,  Chief  Financial  Officers  must  ensure  that (re) insurance policies entered into represent a true transfer of risk and that their status as (re)insurance contracts could not be subject to challenge. Business between Group companies must be transacted at market prices where a market price exists, or in the absence of market prices, must be supported by formally documented justification for the charge made.\n\n## Products o/ffered by the Group\n\nAXA products are not designed to allow or encourage tax evasion. The Group has set up a validation framework to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they go to market.\n\nThe local decision to launch a new product must result from a documented approval process that complies with the AXA Group's standards in terms of product features, pricing, assetliability management and aspects related to legal, compliance, regulatory, accounting and reputation.\n\nMoreover, AXA has established strict policies regarding its cross-border activities and knowledge of its customers, in order to ensure that our products and services are not misused for money laundering or tax evasion purposes and are governed by specific rules according to which cross-border life insurance proposals must be presented to the Group Tax and Compliance Departments for validation.\n\nWhile all Group entities must in any case comply with local regulations, the Group Tax Department can veto a product if this product is not compliant with internal rules.\n\nPursuant to Council Directive (EU) 2018/822, AXA may, as a provider of investments and savings products, have tax reporting obligations with respect to certain cross-border products it designs or implements. In particular, certain investments and savings products with no particular tax motive may be reportable under the above-mentioned Directive.",

Notwithstanding the above, the Board's Terms of Reference provide that no directors' fee shall be paid to corporate o/fficers .\n\nFor further information, please see Part/uni00A03  'Corporate governance' of this Annual Report.\n\n## SHARES, SHARE/uni00A0CAPITAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n## Age limit\n\nNotwithstanding the term of o/ffice for which the Chairman of the Board of Directors is appointed, his/her functions shall terminate, at the latest, at the end of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements of the preceding fiscal year and held during the year the Chairman reaches the age of 70.\n\nNotwithstanding the term of o/ffice for which the Chief Executive O/fficer is appointed, his/her functions shall terminate at the latest at the end of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements of the preceding fiscal year and held during the year the Chief Executive O/fficer reaches the age of 65. The same rule applies for the Deputy Chief Executive O/fficers.\n\nAn individual aged 70 or older may be appointed or reappointed to the Board of Directors exclusively for a two-year term of o/ffice. His/her term of o/ffice can be renewed only once.\n\nWhen the number of Board members aged 70 or older exceeds one-third of the directors in o/ffice, the oldest director is deemed to have resigned automatically unless any member of the Board of Directors aged 70 or older voluntarily resigns within three months.\n\nWhen the permanent representative of a legal entity member of the Board of Directors reaches 70/uni00A0years old, the legal entity is deemed to have resigned automatically unless it designates a new representative within three months.\n\n## Shareholding\n\nIn accordance with the Afep-Medef Code and regardless of any statutory obligation of holding shares, the directors, with the exception of directors representing employees, shall personally be shareholders of the Company and own a significant number of shares in the Company; if they do not own such shares at the time they are first appointed, they shall use their directors' fees to acquire AXA shares.

On May/uni00A026, 1977, the Shareholders' Meeting decided that each ordinary share fully paid up and held in registered form by the same person for at least two full fiscal years entitled its holder to double voting rights with respect to such share.\n\nIn the event of a capital increase by capitalization of existing reserves, profits or premiums, shares granted for free to any shareholder holding shares entitled to double voting rights will also carry double voting rights.\n\nThe rights of the holders of double voting rights may only be modified or cancelled upon the decision of an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting and after authorization by a special meeting of the holders of these rights.\n\nWith the exception of double voting rights, there is currently only one class of shares with equal rights for all shareholders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nUpon proposal by the AXA Board of Directors, the shareholders of AXA may decide to allocate all or part of distributable profits to special or general reserves, to carry them forward to the next fiscal year as retained earnings, or to allocate them to the shareholders as dividends. If AXA has earned a distributable profit since the end of the previous fiscal year, as reflected in an interim balance sheet certified by its Statutory Auditors, the Board of Directors may distribute interim dividends to the extent of the distributable profit without prior approval of the shareholders. AXA's Bylaws require AXA to distribute any dividends between its shareholders in proportion to their share in the capital.\n\nUnder the provisions of AXA's Bylaws, the actual dividend payment date is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nAXA's Bylaws provide that, the Shareholders' Meeting may grant each shareholder the choice to receive dividends in either cash or additional ordinary shares.\n\n## Pre-emptive rights\n\nUnder French law, shareholders have preferential subscription rights to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, additional ordinary shares (and/or convertible, exchangeable or other securities giving a claim, directly or indirectly, to AXA ordinary shares). This subscription right is transferable and normally trades separately during the subscription period for a capital increase. Issuing additional shares without preferential subscription rights requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Liquidation rights\n\nIf AXA is liquidated, the assets remaining a/f\\_ter it pays its debts, liquidation expenses and all prior claims will be used to repay AXA shareholders up to the amount of the liquidation balance and the par value of the shares held by each shareholder. Any surplus will be divided among all shareholders, subject to rights arising, if any, from di/fferent classes of shares, in proportion to the rights they own in the Company's share capital.\n\n## MODIFICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS\n\nUnder French law, shareholders of a French public company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) have the power to amend AXA's Bylaws. Such an amendment generally requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting. However, no such Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings may decide (i)/uni00A0to increase the liability of the shareholders in respect of the Company or a third party; or (ii)/uni00A0to reduce the individual rights vested in each shareholder (such as voting rights, right to distributable profits of the Company, right to sell one's shares and right to sue the Company).\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS\n\nShareholders are convened, meet and deliberate in accordance with applicable French laws and AXA's Bylaws.\n\nA notice of meeting must be published in the Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires ('BALO'), at least 35/uni00A0days before any Shareholders' Meeting (or 15/uni00A0days in certain specific cases), and must indicate, in particular, the agenda and the proposed resolutions.\n\nAt least 15/uni00A0days (or six days in certain cases) prior to the date set for the meeting on first call, and at least 10/uni00A0days (or four days in certain cases) before any second call, the Company shall send a final notice containing all the information requested by law by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares for more than one month prior to the date of this final notice and publish a final notice in a bulletin of legal notices, as well as the BALO.\n\nAll shareholders are entitled to attend these meetings, either in person or by proxy, provided that they show valid proof of ID and share ownership as specified under French law. This ownership is justified by a book entry showing the number of shares in the name of the shareholder (or the intermediary for the account), on the second business day preceding the meeting at 0:00 am, Paris time (France), either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by a qualified intermediary.",

However, a number of French law provisions, in particular those resulting from Law No./uni00A02014-384 of March/uni00A029, 2014 ( visant \u00e0 reconqu\u00e9rir l' \u00e9conomie r\u00e9elle ), from Law No./uni00A02019-486 of May/uni00A022, 2019 ( relative \u00e0 la croissance et la transformation des entreprises ), known as 'PACTE', or from certain provisions of Directive 2004/25/EC of April/uni00A021, 2004 on takeover bids (which was implemented in France in 2006), may have certain anti-takeover e/ffects. In the case of AXA, the relevant provisions include, among other things, the existence of AXA shares with double voting rights, which are described above, and specific notification requirements applicable when holdings exceed specified thresholds, as described below.\n\nFrench law generally requires mergers and certain consolidations to be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to decide on such matters.\n\n## NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHEN HOLDINGS EXCEED SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS\n\nPursuant to Article/uni00A07 of AXA's Bylaws, any person, acting alone or jointly, who comes to hold, directly or indirectly, through companies it controls within the meaning of Article/uni00A0L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code , a number of shares representing 0.5% of the Company's share capital or voting rights, shall notify the Company by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt within five days from the threshold crossing. This notification shall detail the total number of shares and voting rights held as well as the total number of securities giving a di/ffered claim to the share capital and the potential voting rights attached thereto.\n\nThe notification shall be repeated in the conditions stated above each time an additional fraction of 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed upward or downward.\n\nIn the event of failure to comply with the notification requirements described above, shares exceeding the fraction that should have been notified will be deprived of voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings if, at such meetings, the notification failure has been recorded and if one or more shareholders jointly holding at least 5% of the share capital so request. Loss of voting rights shall be applicable in all Shareholders' Meetings that would be held up until two years following proper notification.\n\n## CHANGES IN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's share capital may be modified only under the conditions stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions in force. The provisions of the Bylaws or the Board's Terms of Reference shall not prevail over changes in the law governing the Company's share capital.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

AXA's Statutory Auditors provide a reasonable assurance report on AXA Group's ICOFR each year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group Internal Control Standard and the Group Internal Control Policy, which include additional specific requirements for the IFC framework.\n\n## (a) IFC framework\n\nThe IFC framework is based on the 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to define the IFC scope, governance, and principles in order to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting.\n\n## (A.1) IFC SCOPE\n\nThe IFC program includes primarily the entities which are individually significant to consolidated financial position or results of operations, as well as the entities which provide significant services to AXA and/or its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\n## (A.2) IFC GOVERNANCE\n\nManagement, including the Group Chief Executive O/fficer (CEO), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICOFR.\n\nThe IFC program is steered by the Group IFC Committee chaired by the Group CFO and involves the Planning Budgets Results Central (PBRC) Department, other relevant AXA departments, and representatives from each in-scope entity. The IFC program and the conclusion of management as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR are also reviewed by AXA's Audit Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## (A.3) IFC PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA Group's ICOFR includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- /uni25A0 the maintenance of records accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Group assets;\n- /uni25A0 the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles;\n- /uni25A0 the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Group assets that could have a material e/ff ect on the Group's financial statements would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to assess the e/ffectiveness of ICOFR, financial reporting risks are initially identified at Group level with a focus on identifying those risks that may result in a material misstatement of Consolidated Financial Statements not being prevented or detected in a timely manner. This top-down and risk-based approach enables to identify in-scope entities and processes.\n\nIn line with the COSO framework, AXA Group's ICOFR is organized around the following key process categories: Entity-Level Controls (ELC), IT ELC, Financial Statement Closing Process, Business Processes, and IT General Controls.\n\nFor every key process category, the in-scope entities (i)/uni00A0document the significant processes and/or controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level, (ii)/uni00A0test the design and operational e/ffectiveness of key controls based on the test plans elaborated with insight into risks, and (iii)/uni00A0remediate identified control deficiencies.\n\nOutstanding control deficiencies are consolidated at Group level to evaluate their impact on Consolidated Financial Statements, compensating controls and other qualitative factors. This evaluation process is designed to identify any control deficiencies that may rise to the level of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on time.",

        "page_content": "I\n\n## (A.4) IFC CERTIFICATION\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities are required to perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process. This process involves formal sign-o/ff  by the entity's process owners and culminates with a formal management report from the entity's CFO or another senior executive o/fficer stating their conclusion as to the e/ffectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\nThis internal certification process across all in-scope entities is designed to assist AXA's management in its evaluation of AXA Group's ICOFR and to support its conclusion as to the e/ffectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR.\n\n## (b) Management's annual evaluation on/uni202FICOFR/uni202Fbased on the IFC framework\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the e/ffectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR in accordance with the IFC framework as described above. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that AXA Group's ICOFR was e/ffective as of December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ffective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.\n\n## (c)  Report of the Statutory Auditors on ICOFR\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars have performed audit procedures in order to be able to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether management's conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR based on the IFC framework is fairly stated.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS accounting principles. The assessment of the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria established in the Internal Financial Control (IFC) framework, as described in management's annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting on pages/uni00A0450 and 451  of this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's management's assertion, based on our audit procedures.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with French professional standards and ISAE/uni00A03000 ('Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'). These standards require that we plan and perform the audit procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether AXA management's assertion that internal control over financial reporting is e/ffective, was fairly stated in all material respects. Our audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe the evidence gathered is su/fficient and appropriate to express our opinion.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the principles or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, the Company's management's assertion that internal control over financial reporting as of December/uni00A031, 2020 is e/ffective, in all material respects, is fairly stated based on the criteria determined in the IFC framework.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March/uni00A022, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon - Gr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nMazars\n\nJean-Claude Pauly - Maxime Simoen\n\nI",

HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe significant account movements are presented in the tables in these notes.\n\n## 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## 2.1 General  principles\n\nThe financial statements as at December/uni00A031, 2020 are prepared and presented in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Chart of Accounts (regulation ANC No./uni00A02014-03 dated June/uni00A05, 2014).\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2011, AXA has applied regulation ANC No./uni00A0201505 linked to term financial instrument and hedge operation.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2005, AXA has applied regulations CRC/uni00A02002-10 related to depreciation and amortization of assets (amended by regulations CRC/uni00A02003-07 and CRC/uni00A02005-09), and CRC/uni00A0200406 related to the definition, recognition and measurement of assets, repealed and replaced by regulation ANC No./uni00A02014-03 chapter ' titre/uni00A0II, chapitre/uni00A0I Actifs non financiers' ; application of these regulations has had no impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn accordance to regulation CRC/uni00A02008-15, repealed and replaced by regulation ANC No./uni00A02014-03 chapter 'titre/uni00A0VI, chapitre/uni00A0II, Section/uni00A04 Plans d'options d'achat ou de souscription d'actions et plans d'attribution d'actions gratuites aux salari\u00e9s' (especially Articles/uni00A0624-15 and 624-16) and chapters 'titre/uni00A0IX, chapitre/uni00A0IV, Section/uni00A05 Comptes financiers' (especially Article/uni00A0945-50) treasury shares are recorded in 'Marketable securities'. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, 32,296,045/uni00A0shares were allocated to hedging purposes, representing \u20ac678/uni00A0million.\n\nThe application of regulations relating to the accounting treatment of stock options (subscription and purchase) and performance shares/units (free shares granted to employees and subject to performance conditions) had no impact on the Company's financial statements (regulation ANC No./uni00A02014-03 chapter 'titre/uni00A0VI, chapitre/uni00A0II, Section/uni00A04 Plans d'options d'achat ou de souscription d'actions et plans d'attribution d'actions gratuites aux salaries' ).\n\nFind below a summary of options and performance shares or units shares granted in 2020 and 2019 to members of the management Committee paid by the Company:\n\n|            | Year 2020                                        | Year 2020                                                                                        | Year 2019                                        | Year 2019                                                           |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in  Euro) | Value of options  granted/uni202Fduring the year | Value of performance shares  and performance units  granted/uni202Fduring/uni202Fthe/uni202Fyear | Value of options  granted/uni202Fduring the year | Value of performance  shares granted  during/uni202Fthe/uni202Fyear |\n| TOTAL      | -                                                | 4,037,100                                                                                        | -                                                | 5,619,965                                                           |\n\nStocks options, performance shares and performance units plans are described in  Section/uni00A03.2 'Executive compensation and share ownership' of this Annual Report.\n\n## 2.2 Presentation of the financial statements\n\n## BALANCE SHEET\n\nIntangible assets include concessions, patents, brands and so/f\\_t ware.\n\nTangible assets include investments in real estate, split between land and buildings, as well as fixtures and fittings.\n\nFinancial assets consist in (i)/uni00A0investments in and receivables from subsidiaries and a/ffiliates, and (ii)/uni00A0other financial assets and loans.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSecurities are classified using the following criteria:\n\n- /uni25A0 investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates are securities representing at least 10% of the share capital of the issuing company plus those which the Company deems held for the long term;\n- /uni25A0 other financial assets comprise securities representing less than 10% of the share capital and which are not investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates.\n\n## INCOME\n\nThe income statement distinguishes between ordinary operations and capital operations:\n\n- /uni25A0 ordinary operations include dividends, revenues from other investments, financial expenses, operating expenses and income from transactions in marketable securities;",

        "page_content": "- /uni25A0 capital operations include gains or losses on the disposal of investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates and portfolio management investments, impairment charges and reversals in respect of these securities and related receivables, gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements, charges and reversals of provisions for risks and charges, and exceptional income and expense.\n\nDisposals of investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates are measured using the weighted average unit cost method.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the financial statements, (i)/uni00A0charges and releases of provisions for exchange rate risk are recognized in foreign exchange result, and (ii)/uni00A0charges and reversals of provisions for tax repayment risk are recognized in income tax benefit/expense.\n\n## 2.3 Intangible  assets\n\nIntangible assets totaled \u20ac326/uni00A0million. They mainly included the AXA brand valued at \u20ac308/uni00A0million.\n\n## 2.4 Tangible  assets\n\nTangible assets are recognized at acquisition cost or transfer value. Buildings are depreciated using the straight line method over fi/f\\_ty years, and fitting work is depreciated over five or ten years as appropriate.\n\n## 2.5 Financial  assets\n\nFinancial assets are measured at acquisition cost or transfer cost. At the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, and the lower of these two values is then recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates is their going concern value for the firm. This may be determined as a function of (i)/uni00A0their share price, (ii)/uni00A0their shareholders' equity (including unrealized gains) or (iii)/uni00A0prospects for the subsidiary.\n\nThis multi-criteria analysis reflects the long-term nature of AXA's ownership in these subsidiaries and excludes factors relating to short-term market volatility. Net book value is compared with the going concern value, which is the value of the assets and expected profits of existing and new business, taking into account the entity's future prospects. The value of future profits is estimated on the basis of calculations of the European Embedded Value of the Life & Savings business published by the Group, or similar calculations for other activities. The COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on the long-term projections and the fair value of these investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates.\n\nFor other investments, the fair value is the share price for listed securities and the likely trading value for unlisted securities.\n\n## 2.6 Receivables\n\nReceivables are measured at nominal value. An impairment provision is charged in the event of risk of non-recovery.\n\nI\n\n## 2.7 Marketable  securities\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, which corresponds to the exit value for SICAV and FCP Mutual funds and to the average share price over the last month before the balance sheet date for the other securities.\n\n## 2.8 Prepayments and accrued income\n\nDeferred charges correspond to debt issue costs, which are spread over the lifetime of the issue or for a maximum of 10/uni00A0years when the debt has no predetermined maturity.\n\n## 2.9 Employee  benefits\n\nEmployee benefit liability was reviewed and a valuation was carried out, in accordance with the Recommendation ANC No./uni00A0 2013-02, so as to measure any additional adjustment necessary to ensure the coverage of defined post-retirement benefit obligations and for accounting purposes. The method 1, as defined by this Recommendation has been applied: past service costs are recognized in profit and loss over the vesting period and the expected return on asset is used in developing the net periodic pension cost. Pursuant to this review, the employee benefit liability recognized was nil as at December/uni00A031,2020. Additional information on employees' defined benefit obligations is provided in Note/uni00A026.2 of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.10 Unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses\n\nForeign currency receivables and liabilities are adjusted at the balance sheet date exchange rate. The matching item for this adjustment is a translation variance asset account when the di/fference is an unrealized loss, and a translation variance liability account when it is an unrealized gain. These items do not flow through the income statement but a provision for foreign exchange risk is made to recognize unrealized losses relating to the translation variance asset.\n\nWhen a loan or borrowing generates an unrealized translation loss, but is hedged, a provision for unhedged risk is registered.\n\n## 2.11 Derivative  products\n\n- /uni25A0 Interest rate swaps: these transactions are recognized by applying the accrued interest method. A distinction is made in the income statement and balance sheet between income from the principal transaction, which is the subject of the swap, and the net income from the swap transaction. The nominal value of the swaps serving as a basis for interest rate swaps is recognized o/ff -balance sheet;\n- /uni25A0 Derivative products qualifying as hedges against foreign exchange risk (exchange rate or currency swaps, currency futures) are recognized o/ff -balance sheet as a reciprocal liability and receivable commitment. For currency options, the premium paid on acquisition is recognized as an asset on the balance sheet in the 'cash instruments' account. When the option is\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

For option sales, a provision for risks and charges is recognized to take into account the unrealized loss. Other derivative instruments are recognized o/ff -balance sheet at their nominal value. Unrealized losses arising from the estimated market value of these financial instruments give rise to recognition of a provision for foreign exchange loss when the hedge accounting cannot be applied;\n\n- /uni25A0 Equity derivative products: equity option rights paid or received are posted in a suspense account on payment or receipt of funds. At the balance sheet date, if the option has not been exercised, the rights received, representing possible income, are not recognized in the income statement. A provision is created against rights paid if it is likely, given market trends, that the option will not be exercised. When the option is exercised, this represents an addition to the acquisition price of the underlying instrument and an addition to the sale price when the option is sold.\n\n## 3.

The tax consolidation regime provides that tax savings should be recognized directly in the Company's financial statements. However, a provision for the return of tax savings is recognized when there is a high probability that the benefit will accrue to subsidiaries as a result of the prospect of future taxable income resulting from the Group's strategic planning.",

The Company has the option of deferring payment of the coupons under certain conditions. Nonetheless, the coupons must be\n\npaid when these conditions cease to be met or on redemption of the instruments. When payment is deferred for an extended period, the coupons remain payable by law. Similarly, in the absence of dividends being paid, unpaid coupons accumulated over the years will be recognized as payable upon liquidation, if any. These instruments are classified as debt on the basis of this contractual obligation to pay the coupons.\n\n## 3.13 Financial  debt\n\n| (in  Euro  million)                                  | Value at  December/uni00A031, 2020   | Less than one/uni00A0year   | 1 to 5/uni00A0years   | More than 5/uni00A0years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| Euro Medium Term Notes                               | 500                                  | -                           | -                     | 500                        |\n| Bonds of which \u20ac6,422 m related to the Group entites | 7,209                                | 2,775                       | 3,439                 | 995                        |\n| Deposits under collateral agreements                 | 197                                  | 197                         | -                     | -                          |\n| Loans granted by Group entities                      | 8,478                                | 1,947                       | 2,403                 | 4,128                      |\n| Commercial papers                                    | 795                                  | 795                         | -                     | -                          |\n| Accrued interests                                    | 107                                  | 107                         | -                     | -                          |\n| TOTAL                                                | 17,286                               | 5,821                       | 5,842                 | 5,623                      |\n\nFinancial debt amounted to \u20ac17,286/uni00A0million from \u20ac16,389/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019, reflecting an increase of \u20ac897/uni00A0million, of which \u20ac795/uni00A0million in commercial papers issued.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## AXA/uni00A0SA\n\n25, Avenue Matignon\n\n75008 Paris\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of AXA/uni00A0SA for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December/uni00A031, 2020, and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of rules required by the French Commercial Code and the French Code of ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "It is this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code    relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates\n\n(See Notes/uni00A02.5 to the financial statements)\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the matter\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates represented \u20ac67 417/uni00A0million, a significant balance sheet item.\n\nThese investments are initially carried at acquisition cost or their contribution value. At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment allowance is recognized if the value at closing date is less than the acquisition cost.\n\nAs described in note/uni00A02.5 to the financial statements, the value at closing date corresponds to the value in use and is determined by management on the basis of the share price, the equity value (including unrealized gains), or the future prospects of the subsidiary.\n\nEstimating the value in use of these types of investments requires a significant degree of judgment from management in terms of selecting the measurement methods, depending on the investment in question, and in determining which data and assumptions should be used to estimate the expected profits when these are taken into account in the valuation. The value of future profits is estimated on the basis of the European Embedded Value (EEV) calculations for the Life & Savings segment published by the Group, or similar calculations for the other activities.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty involved in the use of forecasts (in terms of whether or not they will be achieved) in particular in a  complex and evolving context of COVID-19 pandemic and in the judgment required to assess value in use, we deemed the correct measurement of investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates, particularly those based on forward-looking data, to be a key audit matter.\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of the estimated value in use of investments in subsidiaries and a/ffiliates, based on the information provided to us, our audit work consisted primarily of verifying that the estimated values determined by management were based on an appropriate measurement method and assumptions, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nFor valuations based on forecast data:\n\n- /uni25A0 assess the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used with regard to the Solvency/uni00A0II texts and the European Embedded Value principles published by the CFO Forum when the values in use of life and non-life insurance companies are based on these frameworks;\n- /uni25A0 for the other entities, obtain the projections for cash flow and operating cash flow for the businesses produced by their respective operational management teams, and:\n- -check the consistency of the historical data used with the audited financial statements of the entities,\n- -check that the assumptions made are consistent with the economic environment at the closing date and at the date the financial statements were prepared,\n- -compare projections made in previous periods with actual results in order to assess the reliability of the estimates,\n- -verify the accuracy of the value in use calculated,\n- -confirm that the value in use, which is based on projected cash flows, has been adjusted to account for debts.\n\nWe also verified the recording of provisions for contingencies where the Company is exposed to the losses of a subsidiary with negative equity. Finally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by law and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to/uni202Fthe/uni202Ffinancial/uni202Fposition and the financial statements provided to the shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article/uni00A0D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles/uni00A0L.225-37-4, L.2210-10 et L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article/uni00A0L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or allocated to the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlled companies which are included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

        "page_content": "## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- /uni25A0 identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- /uni25A0 obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n- /uni25A0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- /uni25A0 evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article/uni00A06 of Regulation/uni00A0(EU)/uni00A0No/uni00A0537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March/uni00A022, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon - Gr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nMazars\n\nJean-Claude Pauly - Maxime Simoen\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

It is defined as the excess of market value of assets over best estimate liabilities and Risk Margin as per Solvency/uni00A0II regulation.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as per Solvency/uni00A0II, and is equal to the total amount of the Group's Eligible Own Funds ('EOF') divided by the Group's Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'). The Solvency Capital Requirement, i.e. the denominator of the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, is set at a level ensuring that insurers and reinsurers are able to meet their obligations towards policyholders and beneficiaries over the next 12/uni00A0months, with a 99.5% probability. The Solvency Capital Requirement can be calculated either based on the standard formula or an internal model. The Group is using an internal model.\n\nThe Solvency/uni00A0II ratio is estimated primarily using AXA's internal model calibrated based on an adverse 1/200/uni00A0years shock. For further information on AXA's internal model and Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to AXA Group's Solvency and Financial Condition report (SFCR) as of December/uni00A031, 2019, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com). Pursuant to the authorization from AXA's lead supervisor (the 'ACPR'), the contribution of entities that were part of the XL Group ('XL entities'), and are now part of the AXA XL division, to the Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio is, as from December/uni00A031, 2020 on, calculated with the AXA Group internal model. In compliance with the prior decision from ACPR, the XL entities contributed to the Group's solvency capital requirement as of December/uni00A031, 2019 using the Solvency/uni00A0II standard formula.\n\n## Debt Gearing*\n\nDebt Gearing refers to the level of a company's debt related to its equity capital, usually expressed as a percentage. Debt Gearing is used by Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing the gross debt (financing debt and undated subordinated debt) by total capital employed (consolidated shareholders' equity excluding undated subordinated debt and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives plus the gross debt). Furthermore, following the deconsolidation of EQH, mandatory exchangeable bonds issued by AXA in May/uni00A02018 were excluded from Debt Gearing.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

This definition is applicable to all Life & Savings products as well as Life-like Health products, with the exception of Mutual funds products.\n\n## NEW BUSINESS APE (NEW BUSINESS ANNUAL PREMIUM EQUIVALENT)\n\nNew business APE represents 100% of new regular premiums plus 10% of single premiums, in line with EEV methodology. APE is Group share.\n\n## NBV (NEW BUSINESS VALUE)\n\nThe value of newly issued contracts during the current year. It consists of the present value of future profits a/f\\_ter the costs of acquiring business, less (i)/uni00A0 an allowance for the time value of financial option and guarantees, and (ii)/uni00A0 cost of capital and nonfinancial risks. AXA calculates this value net of tax.\n\n## NBV MARGIN (NEW BUSINESS VALUE MARGIN)\n\nNew Business Value Margin is the ratio of:\n\n- /uni25A0 New Business Value representing the value of newly issued contracts during the current year; to\n- /uni25A0 Annual Premium Equivalent.\n\nThis ratio represents the profitability of the new business.\n\n## MARGIN ANALYSIS\n\nThe Margin Analysis is presented on an underlying earnings basis.\n\nEven though the presentation of the Margin Analysis is not the same as the Statement of Income (underlying basis), it is based on the same GAAP measures as used to prepare the Statement of Income in accordance with IFRS.\n\nUnderlying investment margin includes the following items:\n\n- /uni25A0 net investment income; and\n- /uni25A0 interests and bonuses credited to policyholders and unallocated policyholder bonuses (and the change in specific reserves purely linked to invested assets returns) related to the net investment income as well as the unwind of the discount rate used in calculating technical reserves.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Underlying fees & revenues include:\n\n- /uni25A0 revenues derived from mutual fund sales (which are part of consolidated revenues);\n- /uni25A0 loadings charged to policyholders (or contractual charges) on premiums of all Life & Savings products;\n- /uni25A0 loadings on deposits received on all Life & Savings products and fees on funds under management for separate account (Unit-Linked) business;\n- /uni25A0 deferred income such as capitalization net of amortization of URR (Unearned Revenue Reserve) and UFR (Unearned Fee Reserve); and\n- /uni25A0 other fee revenues, e.g. fees received on financial planning or sales of third party products.\n\nUnderlying net technical margin includes the following components:\n\n- /uni25A0 mortality and morbidity margin: the di/fference between income or earned premiums for assuming risk and the cost of benefits and claims charges directly linked to the claims experience or its anticipation (death or disability);\n- /uni25A0 surrender margin: the di/fference between the benefit reserve and the surrender value paid to the policyholder in the event of early contract termination;\n- /uni25A0 GMxB (Variable Annuity guarantees) active financial Risk Management: the net result from GMxB lines corresponding to explicit charges related to these types of guarantees less cost of hedging. It also includes the unhedged business result;\n- /uni25A0 policyholder bonuses if the policyholders participate in the risk margin;\n- /uni25A0 ceded reinsurance results;\n- /uni25A0 other changes in claims and insurance reserves: all the reserve strengthening or release coming from changes in valuation assumptions, claims experience, additional reserves for mortality risk and other technical impacts such as premium deficiencies net of derivatives if any; and\n- /uni25A0 claims handling costs.\n\nExpenses include the following components:\n\n- /uni25A0 acquisition expenses, including commissions and general expenses allocated to new business;\n- /uni25A0 capitalization of acquisition expenses linked to new business: Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) and net rights to future management fees only for investment contracts without DPF;\n- /uni25A0 amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) and net rights to future management fees for investment contracts without DPF, including the impact of interest capitalized;\n- /uni25A0 administrative expenses; and\n- /uni25A0 policyholder bonuses if the policyholder participates in the expenses of the Company.",

Expenses exclude customer intangible amortization, but include the impact from the changes in VBI amortization.\n\nThe Combined ratio is the sum of the all accident year loss ratio and the expense ratio.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nNet inflows: Inflows of client money less outflows of client money. Net inflows are used by the management to measure the impact of sales e/ff orts, product attractiveness (mainly dependent on performance and innovation), and the general market trend in investment allocation.\n\nUnderlying cost income ratio is the ratio of:\n\n- /uni25A0 general expenses excluding distribution related expenses; to\n- /uni25A0 gross revenues excluding distribution fees received.\n\nAssets under management (AUM) are defined as the assets whose management has been delegated by their owner to an Asset Management company such as AXA Investment Managers. AUM only include funds and mandates which generate fees and exclude double counting.\n\n## Banking\n\nOperating net banking revenues are disclosed before intercompany eliminations and before realized capital gains/ losses or changes in fair value of 'fair-value-P&L' assets and hedging derivatives.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",
