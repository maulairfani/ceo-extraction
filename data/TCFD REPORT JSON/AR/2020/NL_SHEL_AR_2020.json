        "page_content": "## ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nThe Royal Dutch Shell plc Annual Report (this Report) serves as the Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with UK requirements for the/uni00A0year ended December 31, 2020, for Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Shell). This Report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell (pages 216-264), the Parent Company Financial Statements of Shell (pages 283-291) and the Financial Statements of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (pages 294-297). Except for these Financial Statements, the numbers presented throughout this Report may not/uni00A0sum/uni00A0precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not/uni00A0precisely/uni00A0reflect the absolute figures due to rounding.\n\nThe financial statements contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThis Report contains certain following forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly or indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In addition to the term 'Shell', in this Report 'Shell Group', 'we', 'us' and 'our' are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. 'Subsidiaries' and 'Shell subsidiaries' refer to/uni00A0those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as 'joint ventures' and 'joint operations', respectively. 'Joint ventures' and 'joint operations' are collectively referred to as 'joint arrangements'. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as 'associates'. The term 'Shell interest' is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Shell subsidiaries' data include their interests in joint operations.\n\nAs used in this Report, 'Accountable' is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. 'Responsible' is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies.\n\nThis Report references Shell's Sky and new Sky 1.5 scenarios, specifically within the Climate change and energy transition section (pages 94-107). Unlike Shell's previously published Mountains and Oceans exploratory scenarios, the Sky scenario is based on the assumption that society reaches the Paris Agreement's goal of holding the rise in global average temperatures this century to well below two degrees Celsius (2\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels. Unlike Shell's Mountains and Oceans scenarios which unfolded in an open-ended way based upon plausible assumptions and quantifications, the Sky scenario was specifically designed to reach the Paris Agreement's goal in a technically possible manner.\n\nSky 1.5 scenario starts with data from Shell's Sky scenario but is more aggressive and challenging in its assumptions about energy transitions as the pace of change is accelerated. As in Sky, this scenario is normative, meaning we assumed that society achieves the 1.5 degrees Celsius stretch goal of the Paris Agreement, and we worked back in designing how this could occur. Of course, there are many possible paths that society could take to achieve this goal. This will be extremely challenging, but as of today, we believe there is still a technically possible path while maintaining a growing global economy. However, we believe the window for success is quickly closing.\n\nThese scenarios are a part of an ongoing process used in Shell for over 40/uni00A0years to challenge executives' perspectives on the future business environment. They are designed to stretch management to consider even events that may only be remotely possible. Scenarios, therefore, are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes. Shell's scenarios also are not intended to be projections or forecasts of the future. Shell's scenarios, including the scenarios referenced in this Report, are not Shell's strategy or business plan. When developing Shell's strategy, our scenarios are one of many variables that we consider. Ultimately, whether society meets its goals to decarbonise is not within Shell's control. While we intend to travel this journey in step with society, only governments can create the framework for success.\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, Shell's operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions do not reflect our net-zero emissions target. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement.\n\nShell's 'Net Carbon Footprint' referred to in this Report includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term 'Net Carbon Footprint' is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.\n\nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in/uni00A0respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term 'Shell share' is used for convenience to refer to/uni00A0the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary's production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell's entitlement. In all cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.",

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forwardlooking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forwardlooking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as 'aim', 'ambition', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'could', 'estimate', 'expect', 'goals', ' i n t e n d ',  'm a y ',  'o b j e c t i v e s',  'o u t l o o k ',  'p l a n',  'p r o b a b l y ',  'p r o j e c t ',  'r i s k s', 'schedule', 'seek', 'should', 'target', 'will' and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and/uni00A0delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. Also see 'Risk factors' on pages 28-37 for additional risks and further discussion. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this Report are expressly qualified in/uni00A0their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this/uni00A0section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this/uni00A0Report. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from/uni00A0the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.\n\nThis Report contains references to Shell's website, the Shell Sustainability Report, Tax Contribution Report, Industry Associations Climate Review and/uni00A0our report on Payments to Governments.

Adversity reveals character. It forces us to find strength we never knew we had.\n\nFor the good of all, many people volunteered for medical trials. Scientists and doctors from around the world shared knowledge. Vaccines were developed at a speed no one thought possible. Just imagine what humanity might achieve if it could direct such public-spirited co-operation towards other challenges, like poverty, or climate change.\n\n## PEOPLE AND PRODUCTIVITY/uni00A0\n\nIf the pandemic revealed humanity's collective strength, it also showed the resilience of Shell. As I prepare to stand down as Chair of the Royal Dutch Shell plc Board in 2021, I am convinced Shell has a bright future. I am also convinced we have a compelling investment case.\n\nThe strength and clarity of our strategy will enable us to succeed as a business in the energy transition. We will continue to power progress by/uni00A0generating value for shareholders and investing in energy projects to/uni00A0help meet demand. In turn, this will support supply chains and boost local economies.\n\nMy confidence in Shell is made even stronger by the quality of our people. During my 10 years on the Board, I have seen so many colleagues who inspired me as they helped Shell to succeed. When COVID-19 struck, and/uni00A0lockdowns spread, our people rose to the challenge. They continued to produce and deliver vital energy supplies. They helped to power hospitals and fuel ambulances, to keep homes lit and to maintain essential/uni00A0businesses. They showed ingenuity as well as resilience. They put/uni00A0technology to work. For instance, using crawler robots on the roofs of/uni00A0refinery tanks freed our inspectors from having to work at height. The\n\ninspectors could stay in the safety of their homes, focus on analysing the data gathered by the robots, and offer expert opinion. By innovating in such challenging times, we also improved safety and productivity.\n\nAnd I was struck by the courage and dedication that so many of our people showed in the face of the virus. I heard remarkable personal stories. In Iraq, Niki Jackson and his colleagues at the Basrah Gas Company (BGC) sweated through a summer where temperatures rose to 50 degrees Celsius and COVID-19 spread through the surrounding area. Niki knew he risked catching the virus, despite all the precautions taken by BGC, a joint venture between Shell, the Iraqi government and Mitsubishi. But Niki, from Aberdeen, Scotland, wanted to be on the ground with his colleagues. How else could he be effective in his job as asset services director, responsible for maintenance and engineering operations? His words are worth repeating: 'I saw the pride of my Iraqi colleagues, a pride that comes from being able to tell your family: 'I am helping to ensure that everyone around us has electricity, and gas for cooking.'\n\n'I made my decision: 'Am I still happy doing this? Too right I am. Let's get on with it.''\n\nKrishna Gupta, a shift superintendent, went out during lockdown to Shell/uni00A0Energy India's regasification facility in Hazira, Gujarat. How did he explain this to his 11-year-old son? He told him: 'If I don't go to the facility, our gas can't get to those who need it.'\n\n## ADAPTING TO THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nPeople like Krishna and Niki give me confidence about Shell's future. So/uni00A0too does our strategy. I have seen the progress we have made, and/uni00A0continue to make, towards becoming fully able to play a role in/uni00A0the/uni00A0transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nWe are helped by long experience of serving the needs of our customers. Our global network of around 46,000 service stations, for example, gives us insights into the nature of consumer demand for everything from groceries to electric vehicle charging points. It helps us to understand what we must do to be in step with society in the energy transition.\n\nAs our business customers work to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Shell will increasingly provide the low-carbon energy and products to help. We already have the kind of portfolio that other companies are trying to build. We can invest where we will be competitive, for example, in integrated power, hydrogen and low-carbon biofuels. We will also continue to supply oil and gas because the world will need both for years to come. Our Upstream business will help give us the financial strength to invest in low-carbon sources of energy.",

        "page_content": "## OUR MOST DIFFICULT DECISION\n\nThis year has shown how Shell must expect the unexpected and be/uni00A0resilient enough to cope with it. The recession of 2020 was unprecedented. US oil prices briefly turned negative for the first time/uni00A0in/uni00A0history.\n\nIn April, we faced a perfect storm. With vaccines not yet on the horizon, no one could predict how bad things might get. That was the backdrop to the most difficult decision I have experienced on a company board: the vote to rebase the dividend. It was historic for Shell. More importantly, it was human. This was about the people who invest in us, whose belief in Shell is partly rewarded by the dividend. The grim reality was there was/uni00A0only one thing worse than rebasing the dividend: not rebasing the/uni00A0dividend.\n\nWe could have borrowed to keep the dividend at the same level. But in our view that would have been a mistake. By taking the decisive action to rebase the dividend significantly as we did, I believe we ensured that Shell could emerge from the impact of COVID-19 in strong shape.\n\nIn October, we were able to raise the dividend by a modest amount, and/uni00A0signal our intention to have annual dividend increases, subject to Board approval. The fundamentals remain intact. Despite the global economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic, Shell continues to make strategic progress.\n\n## Adapting to the energy transition\n\n## Working together across Shell during the COVID-19 global pandemic\n\nShell can invest in areas where we will be competitive,/uni00A0such as hydrogen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow (clockwise from top left): Shell made innovative use of robots during lockdowns; our people kept service stations open; Krishna Gupta; Niki Jackson.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINDING A WAY\n\nBen van Beurden, the Chief Executive Officer of Royal Dutch Shell, deserves credit for this progress. Over the years, he has listened to those urging Shell to do more to help tackle climate change. He saw we could create new businesses serving new customers and new markets for low-carbon energy products. And the more governments act on climate change, the more successful these businesses can become, and the better it will be for the planet.\n\nWe are also making progress in other ways. We hope that in May, shareholders will agree to appoint a Board which, for the first time in Shell's history, will consist equally of men and women. Greater diversity brings greater understanding of people, and better decision-making.\n\nShell has set challenging emissions targets. In 2020, we announced our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 in step with society. We intend to meet our customers' demand for cleaner energy, keeping pace with society's progress towards tackling climate change. As this suggests, we cannot stand still. When necessary, we must be as fast-moving as we were when the pandemic hit. We must also strive constantly to increase productivity, to continue to build financial strength.\n\nIn the worst of times, you often see the best of people. In 2020, our people showed great character in adversity. I thank every one of them. I/uni00A0firmly believe their efforts mean Shell will continue to succeed, to deliver energy and to power progress.\n\n## CHAD HOLLIDAY\n\nChair\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBEN VAN BEURDEN Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected us all. Sadly, it claimed the lives of 20 of our Shell colleagues. I heard the stories behind these tragedies, and the cruelty of the pandemic really hit home.\n\nThe virus also wreaked havoc with the global economy, dramatically suppressing energy demand. Our income went from $16.4 billion in 2019 to a loss of $21.5 billion in 2020, which included non-cash impairments of $28.1 billion. In April, with oil prices falling rapidly, Shell took swift, decisive action to preserve cash and stay resilient. We rebased the dividend, lowering it by 66%.\n\nIt was a very difficult decision to make, but the right thing to do.\n\nOur dividend payments went from $15.2 billion in 2019 to $7.4 billion in 2020. We combined rebasing the dividend with the discipline to reduce cash capital expenditure from $23.9 billion in 2019 to $17.8 billion in 2020. We reduced net debt from $79.1 billion in 2019 to $75.4 billion at/uni00A0the end of 2020.\n\nIn October, with global energy demand looking more robust, we raised the dividend by 4% and signalled our intention to have annual dividend increases, subject to Board approval.\n\nOur industry-leading cash flows from operations confirm Shell's underlying strength. Despite the unprecedented challenges, we delivered cash flow from operating activities of $34.1 billion in 2020, compared with $42.2/uni00A0billion in 2019.\n\nOnce we have reduced net debt to $65 billion, we will target total shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow from operations.\n\nIn 2020 we began implementing our new safety approach, which places greater emphasis on increasing the chances of people emerging unhurt even if there is an incident. For the first year in our history, there were zero fatal accidents in Shell-operated facilities. I want this achievement to spur us on so that we keep working hard on safety.\n\n## THE GOALS OF POWERING PROGRESS\n\nWe worked towards refreshing our strategy in 2020, and in February 2021, we announced Powering Progress. It is what I believe Shell does. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0what I believe Shell should continue to do.\n\nOur Powering Progress strategy combines our ambitions under four goals: generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, powering lives and respecting nature. This will help us accelerate our progress towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step/uni00A0with society.\n\nWe will lower emissions from our operations, including the energy consumed in running them, and help our customers to reduce their emissions from using our products. Importantly, this will include emissions from oil and gas that others produce and we then sell in our products - an industry-leading approach.\n\nShell will deal with any of its remaining emissions using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, or offsets where plants absorb carbon dioxide.\n\nWe expect our total oil production to reduce by 1-2% a year until 2030, taking into account divestments and natural decline. But we expect Upstream oil and gas production to deliver strong cash flows into the 2030s, underpinning our returns to shareholders and helping to fund the low-carbon investments that will transform Shell's energy mix. In all these ways, Shell will change as the world adopts the low-carbon energy system needed to tackle climate change.\n\n## WINNING IN A TRANSFORMED ENERGY SYSTEM\n\nCustomers and the choices they make will define the nature of the future energy system.\n\nI think the winning energy companies will be those, like Shell, who are best placed to serve customers.\n\nWe serve more than 1 million commercial and industrial customers, and 30/uni00A0million customers at 46,000 retail service stations every day.\n\nWe have the leading market positions. We have strong starting positions in products and services that customers are going to want more and more: biofuels, electric-vehicle charging networks, and hydrogen.",

In this way, Shell would generate value for shareholders while working towards its net-zero carbon emissions target. Society would benefit from reduced emissions.\n\nTake the CrossWind consortium, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco that in 2020 won the tender for the Hollandse Kust (noord) wind farm off the/uni00A0Dutch coast. Shell's plan is to use the wind farm's renewable electricity for/uni00A0powering the industrial-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen by/uni00A0electrolysis, a process that splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nWe will then work with hauliers and truck manufacturers to develop a market for hydrogen as a low-carbon fuel for heavy goods transport.\n\n## THE VALUE OF STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\nHollandse Kust (noord) is helping Shell to form other important strategic relationships. In February 2021, Amazon signed an agreement to buy renewable electricity from the wind farm.\n\nThrough its air cargo fleet, Amazon also has a growing interest in aviation, one of those sectors that will be hard to decarbonise. Shell has one of the world's most extensive aircraft refuelling networks. We can work with customers, suppliers and regulators to develop a commercially viable and profitable market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We have agreed to supply Amazon with up to six million gallons of blended SAF for its cargo aircraft. This biofuel, produced by the company World Energy using agricultural waste fats and oils, has lower life-cycle carbon emissions than/uni00A0conventional jet fuel.\n\nWe also formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft in 2020. Shell is supplying Microsoft with renewable energy, supporting it towards its goal/uni00A0of using 100% renewable energy by 2025. Both businesses will develop digital tools to help Shell's customers decarbonise.\n\nWe are working on more of these strategic relationships, generating value/uni00A0while helping sectors to reduce their carbon emissions.\n\nIn 2020 we announced a major reorganisation which will take effect from August 2021. We believe this will make us more responsive to customers, as a nimbler organisation with lower costs.\n\nWe expect to reduce between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs as we make these changes. It will mean saying goodbye to many people who have shown us great loyalty. We will do this in the spirit of our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people.\n\nAs we prepare for the years ahead, we can draw confidence from how we/uni00A0rose to the challenges of 2020.\n\nWhat struck me was how our people combined ingenuity with determination to do the right thing: in applying financial discipline, in supplying energy during lockdowns, in making donations to help their communities fight COVID-19. In such hard times, our people generated value for society, and Shell.\n\nThey fill me with confidence for the future. With a strong strategy and good people, Shell will power progress for decades to come.\n\n## BEN VAN BEURDEN\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nt",

Integrated Gas, Upstream/uni00A0and Downstream focus on our three business pillars (see 'Strategy and outlook' on page 18). Our Projects & Technology organisation manages the/uni00A0delivery of Shell's major projects and drives research and innovation to develop/uni00A0new technology solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTEGRATED GAS (INCLUDING/uni00A0NEW/uni00A0ENERGIES)\n\nIntegrated Gas manages LNG activities and the conversion of natural gas into GTL fuels and other products. It includes natural gas exploration and extraction, and the operation of upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas to market. It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, electricity and carbon-emission rights and also markets and sells LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels.\n\nIn New Energies, which was rebranded to Renewables and Energy Solutions in 2021, we are exploring emerging opportunities and investing in those where we believe sufficient commercial value is available. We focus on new fuels for transport, such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen and charging for battery-electric vehicles; and power, including from natural gas and low-carbon sources such as/uni00A0wind and solar.\n\n## UPSTREAM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpstream manages the exploration for and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and/uni00A0operates infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DOWNSTREAM\n\nDownstream manages different Oil Products and Chemicals activities as part of an integrated value chain that trades and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of products which are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. The products we sell include gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel, marine fuel, biofuel, lubricants, bitumen and sulphur. We also produce/uni00A0and sell petrochemicals for industrial use worldwide. Our/uni00A0Downstream organisation also manages Oil Sands activities (the/uni00A0extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into/uni00A0synthetic crude oil).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROJECTS & TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur Projects & Technology organisation manages the delivery of our/uni00A0major projects and drives research and innovation to develop new technology solutions. It provides technical services and technology capability for our Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream activities. It is also responsible for providing functional leadership across Shell in the areas of safety and environment, contracting and procurement, wells activities and greenhouse gas management.\n\nOur future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery of large/uni00A0and integrated projects (see 'Risk factors' on pages 28-37).

We believe the rising standard of living of a growing global population will continue to drive demand for energy for years to come. The world will need to find a way to meet this growing demand, while transitioning to a net-zero emissions energy system to counter climate change./uni00A0\n\n## POWERING PROGRESS\n\nIn February 2021, Shell launched Powering Progress, which sets out our strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, in step with society, purposefully and profitably.\n\nWe will build a strong and resilient business by putting customers at the centre of our strategy, innovating the products and solutions customers need on their journey to net zero. This includes partnering with others to/uni00A0reduce carbon emissions, especially in sectors that are hard to decarbonise. We aim to deliver value through our integrated assets and/uni00A0supply chains, optimising value and managing risk for Shell and our customers as we produce, buy, trade, transport and sell energy products across the world.

These goals support Shell's purpose, to power progress together by providing more and cleaner energy solutions. They are underpinned by our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people, and our focus on safety.\n\nGenerating shareholder value: We aim to create the conditions for share price appreciation by preparing our business for the future and accessing the opportunities that the future of energy holds. We will do this while providing sustainable distributions today through our progressive dividend policy. The changing energy landscape means that Shell must take a dynamic approach to its portfolio of assets and products. That means continuing to provide the energy the world needs today, and increasing our investments in cleaner energy. We will keep a disciplined approach to/uni00A0capital investment, and a strong balance sheet, so that our organisation remains strong and resilient. In this way, we will achieve our aim of being a/uni00A0compelling investment case for our shareholders.\n\nAchieving net-zero emissions: Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. That is why we have set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We are transforming our business and finding new opportunities - selling more low-carbon products such as biofuels, electricity generated by solar and/uni00A0wind power, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles. We are partnering with customers, businesses and governments to address the energy transition and reduce emissions sector by sector. This includes in/uni00A0sectors that are harder to decarbonise, such as aviation, shipping,\n\n## POWERING LIVES\n\ncommercial road freight, power, heating and certain parts of industry. We/uni00A0also support government policies to reduce carbon emissions in the economy, sector by sector.\n\nPowering lives: Shell helps to power lives and livelihoods by providing vital/uni00A0energy for homes, businesses and transport. The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is also crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. Our operations support livelihoods by providing employment and training in/uni00A0the communities where we operate. We are working to become one of/uni00A0the/uni00A0most diverse and inclusive companies in the world, a place where everyone feels valued and respected. We are focusing on four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability. We respect human rights/uni00A0in all parts of our business.\n\nRespecting nature: We are stepping up our environmental ambitions, shaping them to reflect the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our environmental ambitions include protecting and enhancing biodiversity. We are also focusing on using water and other resources more efficiently across all our activities, reusing as much of them as we can. We are reducing waste from our operations and increasing recycling of plastics. We are helping to improve air quality by reducing emissions from our operations and providing cleaner ways to power transport and industry.\n\nWorking with our partners and suppliers and developing new collaborations is key. We will join with others across industry, governments, our customers and supply chains to protect nature.\n\n## RESPECTING NATURE\n\nProtecting the environment, reducing waste and making a positive contribution to biodiversity\n\nPowering lives through our products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shell will reshape its portfolio of assets and products to meet the cleaner energy needs of its customers in the coming decades. We will deliver our strategy through three business pillars: Growth, Transition, and Upstream.\n\nThrough these three areas, we are creating flexibility in investment opportunities while enabling growth in our customer-facing businesses. Our strategy delivers additional value through trading and optimisation.\n\nAchieving our strategy depends on how we respond to competitive forces. We continually assess the external environment - the markets and the underlying economic, political, social and environmental drivers that shape them - to evaluate changes in competitive forces and business models. We use multiple future scenarios to assess the resilience of our/uni00A0strategy.

        "page_content": "## OUTLOOK FOR 2021 AND/uni00A0BEYOND\n\nWe believe that our integrated business model is key to driving our strategy. It means that our portfolio is greater than the sum of its parts. This competitive portfolio has a solid track record on cash generation, where Shell is leading its peer group. We intend to evolve our portfolio of assets and the mix of energy that we sell to meet the cleaner energy needs of our customers in the/uni00A0coming decades, while delivering value for our shareholders.\n\nDelivering our strategy will require clear and deliberate capital allocation choices. We approach capital allocation at three levels: enterprise, portfolio and project. The enterprise level is about how we make choices between increasing distributions to our shareholders, investing in our business and/or strengthening our balance sheet. The portfolio level is/uni00A0about how we allocate capital between our three business pillars -/uni00A0Growth, Transition and Upstream. The project level is about how we/uni00A0evaluate and prioritise investment opportunities.\n\nAt the enterprise level, we look to achieve the right balance between shareholder distributions today and investing for value-enhancing growth.\n\nFor cash capital expenditure, we plan to spend between $19 and 22 billion per annum in the near term. In addition, we expect operating costs to be no higher than $35 billion and to deliver a divestment programme totalling around $4 billion a year in this period. We remain committed to our progressive dividend policy and focused on targeting AA-equivalent credit metrics through the cycle.\n\nSubject to Board approval, we aim to grow the dividend per share by/uni00A0around/uni00A04 percent every year. Once our net debt level has reached/uni00A0$65 billion, we will target the distribution of 20-30% of cash flow/uni00A0from operations to shareholders, and may choose to return cash to shareholders through a/uni00A0combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\n## CAPITAL ALLOCATION:\n\nOnce we have achieved this level of shareholder distributions, additional surplus cash will be allocated between further disciplined capital investments to deliver our strategy and further debt reduction to strengthen the balance sheet.\n\nWe fully support the Paris Agreement's goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We announced a long-term target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. This includes a target to be net zero on all emissions from the manufacture of all our products - (our Scope 1 and 2 emissions) - by 2050, and also net zero from the end use of all the energy products we sell (Scope 3 emissions). We aim to reduce the net carbon intensity of energy sold by 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050, in comparison with 2016. We expect that our total carbon emissions from energy sold will stay below 2018 levels. Further details are in the 'Climate change and energy transition' section on page 94.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, there continues to be significant uncertainty in the macroeconomic conditions with an expected negative impact on demand for oil, gas and related products. Demand or regulatory requirements and/or constraints in infrastructure may cause Shell to take measures to/uni00A0curtail or reduce oil and/or gas production, LNG liquefaction and utilisation of refining and chemicals plants.

        "page_content": "## SECTION 172(1) STATEMENT\n\nThe Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (2018 MRR) require Directors to explain how they considered the interests of key stakeholders and the broader matters set out in Section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006 (S172) when performing their duty to promote the success of the Company under S172. This includes considering the interests of other stakeholders which may affect the long-term success of/uni00A0the company. This S172 statement explains how Shell Directors:\n\n- \u25a0 have considered employee interests, the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and the effects of/uni00A0those considerations, including on the principal decisions taken during the financial year.\n- \u25a0 have engaged with employees, suppliers, customers and others; and\n\nThe S172 statement focuses on matters of strategic importance to Shell, and the level of information disclosed is consistent with the size and the complexity of Shell's businesses.\n\n## GENERAL CONFIRMATION OF DIRECTORS' DUTIES\n\nShell's Board has a clear framework for determining the matters within its/uni00A0remit and has approved Terms of Reference for the matters delegated to its Committees. Certain financial and strategic thresholds have been set, in order to identify matters requiring Board consideration and approval. The Manual of Authority sets out the delegation and approval/uni00A0process across the broader business. More information on/uni00A0Shell's controls and procedures can be found in \"Other regulatory and/uni00A0statutory information\" on page 182.\n\nWhen making decisions, each Director ensures that (s)he acts in the way he or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote Shell's success for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so has/uni00A0regard (among other matters) to the issues set out below.\n\n## S172(1) (a) 'THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF/uni00A0ANY/uni00A0DECISION IN THE LONG TERM'\n\nThe Directors understand the business and the evolving environment in which we operate, including the challenges of navigating through the energy transition. Based on Shell's purpose to power progress together by/uni00A0providing more and cleaner energy solutions, the strategy set by the Board is intended to strengthen our position as a leading energy company by providing oil, gas and low-carbon energy products and services that meet our customers' cleaner energy needs as the global energy system transforms, while keeping safety and social responsibility fundamental to/uni00A0our business approach.\n\nAs outlined in \"Our context\" in the \"Shell story\" section on pages 10-17, the/uni00A0rising standard of living of a growing global population is likely to continue to drive demand for energy, including oil and gas, for years to come. At/uni00A0the same time, tackling climate change requires an orderly transition to a lower-carbon, multi-source energy system that is enabled by technological changes and facilitates increasing customer choice. Shell's strategic ambitions have been set in that context. We want to increase long-term value for shareholders, recognising that the long-term success of our business depends on our stakeholders and the effects of our business activities on wider society.\n\nIn 2020, we had to operate in the unprecedented context created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting macroeconomic conditions and the imbalance between supply and demand in the oil and gas market.\n\nTo retain focus on achieving the strategic ambitions, in 2020 the Board determined a cash allocation framework designed to enable debt reduction, increase shareholder distributions, and facilitate disciplined growth as Shell reshapes its business for the future of energy. Shell also announced the reshaping of its portfolio of assets and products to meet its customers' cleaner energy needs in the coming decades. The key elements of Shell's strategic direction include:\n\n- \u25a0 growing its leading marketing business, further developing the integrated power business and commercialising hydrogen and biofuels to support customers' efforts to achieve net-zero emissions;\n- \u25a0 setting a target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step with society.\n- \u25a0 transforming its refining portfolio from the current 13 sites into six high-value energy and chemicals parks, integrated with Chemicals. Growth in Chemicals will shift to more performance chemicals and recycled feedstocks;\n- \u25a0 focusing on value over volume by simplifying Upstream to nine significant core positions, which will generate more than 80% of/uni00A0Upstream's cash flow from operations; and\n- \u25a0 extending leadership in liquefied natural gas (LNG) to enable decarbonisation of key markets and sectors;\n- \u25a0 enhancing value delivery through trading and optimisation.\n\nThe Directors recognise that there are differing societal views about our operations and that some Board decisions taken today may not align with/uni00A0all stakeholder interests. Given the complexity of the evolving energy transition, the Directors have taken the decisions they believe best support Shell's strategic ambitions.\n\n## S172(1) (b) 'THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES'\n\nThe Directors recognise that Shell employees are fundamental and core to/uni00A0our business and the delivery of our strategic ambitions. The success of/uni00A0our/uni00A0business depends on attracting, retaining and motivating talented employees. The Directors consider and assess the implications of decisions on employees and the wider workforce, where relevant and feasible. The/uni00A0Directors seek to ensure that Shell remains a responsible employer, including with respect to pay and benefits, health and safety issues, and the workplace environment. The Directors recognise that/uni00A0our/uni00A0pensioners, though no longer employees, also remain important/uni00A0stakeholders.\n\nMore information on this can be found in \"Workforce/uni00A0engagement\" on/uni00A0page 138./uni00A0\n\n## S172(1) (c) 'THE NEED TO FOSTER THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS/uni00A0AND OTHERS'\n\nDelivering our strategy requires strong mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, customers, governments, national oil companies and joint-venture partners. Shell seeks to promote and apply certain/uni00A0general principles in such relationships. The ability to promote these principles effectively is an important factor in the decision to enter into or/uni00A0remain in such relationships. This standard and others are described in the Shell General Business Principles, which are based upon our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people (i.e. our stakeholders)./uni00A0The Board periodically reviews and approves the Shell General Business Principles. The Directors take account of the General Business Principles and core values when exercising their duties and making Board decisions. 'Core Value Moments' are built into Board agendas and provide the Board with opportunities to reflect on the importance of the General Business",

        "page_content": "Principles and Core Values. The Board also reviews and approves Shell's approach to suppliers, which is set out in the Shell Supplier Principles. The businesses continually assess the priorities related to customers and those with whom we do business. The Board engages with the businesses on these topics, for example, within the context of business strategy updates and investment proposals.\n\nThe Directors also receive updates on a variety of topics that indicate how these stakeholders have been engaged.\n\nThese updates include information provided by the Projects & Technology function on suppliers and joint-venture partners, with respect to items such as project updates and supplier contract management. Businesses also provide information on customers and joint-venture partners in relation to/uni00A0business strategies, projects, and investment or/uni00A0divestment proposals.\n\n## S172(1) (d) 'THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ON THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT'\n\nThis aspect is inherent in our strategic ambitions. The Board receives information on various topics to help it make decisions relating, for example,/uni00A0to issues such as the Net Carbon Footprint target, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Shell, country-entry considerations, proposals to invest or divest, and business strategy reviews. The information also goes into Group-level overviews, such as updates on safety and environment performance, reports from the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, and/uni00A0reports from the Chief Internal Auditor. In 2020, certain Board committees/uni00A0and Non-executive Directors conducted site visits of various Shell operations and overseas offices and held external stakeholder engagements, where feasible. The physical site visits were not as extensive as in past years because of travel and other restrictions imposed by governments in response to COVID-19./uni00A0Despite the/uni00A0challenges presented by COVID-19 in terms of international travel and/uni00A0face-to-face meetings, the Board maintained a strong interface with/uni00A0businesses and staff through virtual engagements, making best use/uni00A0of/uni00A0the technology available.\n\nMore information on this, including details of face-to-face visits held pre-COVID-19, can be found in \"Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders\" on page 134, or in the reports of each Board committee.\n\n## S172(1) (e) 'THE DESIRABILITY OF THE COMPANY MAINTAINING A REPUTATION FOR HIGH STANDARDS OF/uni00A0BUSINESS CONDUCT'\n\nShell aims to meet the world's growing need for more and cleaner energy solutions in economically, environmentally and socially responsible ways. The Board periodically reviews and approves clear frameworks, such as The Shell General Business Principles, Shell's Code of Conduct, specific Ethics and Compliance manuals, the Ethical Decision-Making Framework, and its Modern Slavery Statements, to ensure that its high standards are maintained in Shell businesses and in Shell's business relationships. This,/uni00A0complemented by the ways the Board is informed and monitors compliance with relevant governance standards, helps to ensure that Board decisions and the actions of Shell companies promote high standards of business conduct.\n\n## S172(1) (f) 'THE NEED TO ACT FAIRLY AS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'\n\nAfter weighing up all relevant factors, the Directors consider which course/uni00A0of action best enables delivery of our strategy through the long term, taking into consideration the effect on stakeholders. In doing/uni00A0so, our/uni00A0Directors act fairly as between the Company's members but/uni00A0are not/uni00A0required to balance the Company's interest with those of other/uni00A0stakeholders. This can sometimes mean that certain stakeholder/uni00A0interests may not be fully aligned.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThe Board recognises that it plays an important role in assessing and monitoring that our desired culture is embedded in our values, attitudes and behaviours, including in our activities and stakeholder relationships. The Board has established honesty, integrity and respect for people as Shell's core values. The General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, and Code of Ethics help everyone at Shell to act in line with these values and comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Social Performance applies across Shell and is designed to help protect people and the environment. In 2020, we refreshed our approach to safety to avoid fatalities and life-changing injuries by building on existing strong foundations, with an increased and deliberate focus on 'human performance'. 'Human performance' is the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes interact as a system. It remains/uni00A0our ambition to achieve Goal Zero, no harm and no leaks across/uni00A0all our operations.\n\nShell has an ambitious strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 in step with society, while generating shareholder value. This also includes medium- and long-term targets of 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 100% by 2050 (compared with 2016). To achieve our strategic goals, we need to adapt our mindset and behaviours as we navigate the increasing complexity in the world around us. 'Who we are' captures the mindset and behaviours needed to succeed in the coming years, including:\n\n- \u25a0 maximising our performance: we collaborate across boundaries and speak up when we see things that can be improved. We enable people to deliver, and we work in an integrated way with discipline, clear focus on priorities, and tangible outcomes in order to reach our full potential;\n- \u25a0 applying a learner mindset: everyone has the ability to grow, learn/uni00A0from mistakes and successes, and speak up openly in a safe environment. We encourage curiosity, humility, openness, helping each/uni00A0other to make better decisions and create more value;\n- \u25a0 increasing trust in Shell: we aim to be a valued member of the communities in which we operate, and to make a positive contribution to society. We seek to listen carefully and with humility and we have a/uni00A0strong desire to understand, and, where possible, adapt to the changing needs and expectations of society, especially as they relate/uni00A0to the environment. We build strong and trusted relationships with customers and partners which are fundamental to our collective/uni00A0success;\n- \u25a0 inspiring and engaging: we aspire to a situation where everyone feels connected to what we stand for. We build trusting and effective teams where everyone feels ownership and has a voice in how work gets done. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive culture.\n- \u25a0 living by our values and Goal Zero: we live by our values and do the/uni00A0right/uni00A0things in respect to ethics, safety and the environment; and\n\nThe Board considers the Shell People Survey to be an important tool for measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to Shell. It provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high response rate. It also helps the Board to understand how the survey's outcomes are being used to strengthen Shell culture and values. The Board has noted that although staff surveys offer insight, limitations exist. The surveys may lack sufficient detail on how culture is embedded. As a result, a more rigorous approach to Board oversight of culture will be adopted in the year ahead to establish more effective ways of monitoring and assessing culture and how it aligns with purpose, values and strategy.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## SECTION 172(1) STATEMENT/uni00A0 continued\n\nThe Board recognises the important role Shell has in society and is deeply committed to public collaboration and stakeholder engagement. This commitment is at the heart of Shell's strategic ambitions. The Board strongly believes that Shell will only succeed by working together with customers, governments, business partners, investors and other stakeholders.\n\nWorking together is critical, particularly at a time when society, including businesses, governments and consumers, faces issues as complex and challenging as climate change.\n\nWe continue to build on our long track record of working with others, such/uni00A0as investors, industry and trade groups, universities, governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and, in some appropriate instances, our competitors through our joint-venture operations or industry bodies. We believe that working together and sharing knowledge and experience with others offers us greater insight into our/uni00A0business. We also/uni00A0appreciate our long-term relationships with our/uni00A0investors and acknowledge the positive impact of ongoing engagement and dialogue.\n\n## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE/uni00A0ENGAGEMENT)\n\nThe guidance on preparing information, proposals or discussion items for the Board asks for these materials to include considerations of the views, interests and concerns of stakeholders and how management addressed them. This helps to strengthen the Board's knowledge of how the broader business undertakes significant levels of stakeholder engagement. Board minutes have also reflected key points on stakeholder considerations, where appropriate. The Terms of Reference for our Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee also include, within the Committee's remit, the review and consideration of external stakeholder perspectives and how major issues of public concern that could affect Shell's reputation and/uni00A0licence to operate were, or are being addressed.\n\nThe Board also engaged with certain stakeholders directly, to understand their views. The Board also leverages its very substantial in-house expertise by receiving input from economics and policy experts on key political and/uni00A0economic themes periodically, with some updates being presented to/uni00A0the Board each quarter. More on this engagement is provided in \"Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders\" on/uni00A0page/uni00A0134.\n\nInformation on how the Directors have engaged with employees can be/uni00A0found on page 138 and in the \"Our people\" section on pages 108. The/uni00A0tables below includes examples of how Directors have considered the/uni00A0interests of Shell employees and the resulting outcomes.\n\n## PRINCIPAL DECISIONS\n\nIn the table below, we outline some of the principal decisions made by the/uni00A0Board over the year, explain how the Directors have engaged with, or/uni00A0in relation to, the different key stakeholder groups and how stakeholder interests were considered in decision-making.\n\nTo remain concise, we have categorised our key stakeholders into seven groups. Where appropriate, each group is considered to include both current and potential stakeholders. The groups are:/uni00A0\n\n- employees/workforce/pensioners;\n- investor community;\n- regulators/governments;\n- communities;\n- NGOs/civil society stakeholders/academia/think-tanks;\n- customers; and\n- suppliers/strategic partners.\n\n## Principal decisions\n\nWe define principal decisions taken by the Board as decisions taken in/uni00A02020 that are of a strategic nature and significant to any of/uni00A0our/uni00A0key stakeholder groups. As outlined in the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Guidance on the/uni00A0Strategic Report, we include decisions related to/uni00A0capital allocation/uni00A0and/uni00A0dividend policy.\n\n## How were stakeholders considered\n\nWe describe how regard was given to likely long-term consequences of/uni00A0the/uni00A0decision including how stakeholders were considered during the decision-making process.\n\n## What was the outcome\n\nWe describe which accommodations or mitigations were made, if any, and/uni00A0how/uni00A0Directors have considered different interests, and the factors taken/uni00A0into account.",

Principal decisions included: Shell's plans to/uni00A0become a net-zero emissions (NZE) energy business by 2050, in step with society, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (the NZE energy business target as announced on April 16, 2020); and the update on strategic direction that clarified the investment proposition and how the value that Shell/uni00A0generates is translated into shareholder distributions (announced on October 29, 2020).\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nGiven the significance of the strategic topics, the Board had multiple stakeholder engagements. These involved shareholders, employees and our internal climate experts throughout the year, and in earlier years where we also engaged external climate scientists, to help inform the key choices and parameters in the months leading up to the decisions, which included a three-day annual strategy meeting. These engagements included an update and discussion on: the strategic agenda; the proposed strategic pathway and underlying premises; the energy transition strategy; choices for traditional businesses and preparing for alternative strategies; and the financial framework required. These discussions were informed by research undertaken for/uni00A0the Executive Committee to better understand the requirements and expectations of Shell's external stakeholders. This research focused on: investors; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability benchmarks; customers; business partners; international organisations; NGOs; civil society stakeholders; think-tanks; academia and schools; and general public audiences. This included qualitative and/uni00A0quantitative interview-based analysis. The Board considered: implications for customer sectors to drive the/uni00A0approach to decarbonising; business opportunities in new areas to develop the energy system; changes to/uni00A0be/uni00A0made to current business to drive competitive performance, delivery and funds for future investments and shareholders; and Shell's Net Carbon Footprint. In later meetings, the strategy was subsequently refined. In these discussions, the Board considered, among other things, shifting societal expectations of the extent and/uni00A0pace of the energy transition; government and regulatory expectations; ways to meet existing investors' expectations and what would be needed to attract new investors in future; and strategic partnerships.\n\nThe Board participated in virtual staff engagement sessions that enabled the Board members to speak directly with staff from various locations on themes including leadership styles, safety and controls, the Reshape reorganisation and the future of Shell.\n\nIn relation to Shell's target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society, the Board considered whether the NZE energy business target would meet investors' expectations, how Shell can help customers find ways to decarbonise, and how to ensure Shell's credible leadership in informing and driving a societal energy transition. The outcome of those deliberations was the view/uni00A0that we should work with our customers to address the/uni00A0emissions that are produced when they use products they/uni00A0buy from Shell. This is in addition to the other elements of/uni00A0the NZE energy business target.\n\nThe direction of the strategic discussion fed through into the discussions on cash allocation, shareholder returns and to the development of Shell's Powering Progress strategy. After feedback from investors seeking an update on our strategic discussions, in October 2020, stakeholders were informed about Shell's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provided with an explanation of the driver behind the enhanced target to be a NZE energy business. The direction of the ongoing restructuring of Shell's ways of working and/uni00A0organisation was also outlined in order to provide stakeholders with continued updates in the lead-up to Shell's/uni00A0Strategy Day in February 2021.\n\nAs part of the Shell Strategy Day 2021, we announced Powering Progress, our strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to cleaner energy while delivering value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society. The strategy includes how we are working towards our target to become a/uni00A0net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We are increasing our investments in the cleaner products and solutions that our customers need, from biofuels to hydrogen and renewable power, so that we can build a low-carbon business of significant scale by the beginning of the 2030s. We will fund these investments, and our returns to shareholders, with the strong returns we expect from our oil and gas production over the rest of this decade. The Board has been involved in formulating the strategy and ensuring that the Company maintains financial resilience while being able to seize the opportunities that transition will bring as part of our journey to net zero. We are the first energy company to offer shareholders an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy at our Annual General Meeting. We will do this every three years, starting in 2021. We will also on an annual basis offer an advisory vote on our progress against the targets we set for ourselves in the energy transition strategy. The Board believe this is a time of tremendous opportunity for/uni00A0Shell. By transforming our business, we will contribute to/uni00A0achieving a net-zero world, help society reach its climate goals and create a compelling investment case for our shareholders, today and in the future. That is the essence of/uni00A0Powering Progress and it has been fully endorsed by the Board through multiple engagements with management over/uni00A0a 12-month period.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## SECTION 172(1) STATEMENT/uni00A0 continued\n\n## Financial strength, cash allocation including shareholder distributions\n\n## What was the outcome\n\nThe year 2020 involved unprecedented conditions for Shell, the industry and society generally. The challenges caused by COVID-19 resulted in material responses by Shell to successfully maintain its financial strength and resilience. The Board considered Shell's financial policies on several occasions and/uni00A0made decisions accordingly (see above, regarding the relationship and direction of the strategic and/uni00A0cash allocation discussions). The long-term financial health of Shell is crucial for staff, customers, the communities in which Shell operates, and for debt holders and shareholders. In early 2020, a/uni00A0key focus area for the Board was cash preservation, which included cost and capital spend reduction, pausing of the/uni00A0share buyback programme and the reduction of the dividend. In the later part of the year, Directors approved the cash allocation framework, which was announced as part of the third quarter 2020 results. For each quarter, the Board assessed the continuation of the share buyback programme and the ongoing payment and rate of dividend per share payable to shareholders.\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nA number of metrics and factors underpinned each decision, including the BG intention statement regarding equity issued in connection with the combination with the BG Group.\n\nWhen making decisions relating to Shell's financial policies, including the cash allocation framework, the Board asked for further information on specific yet broad topics that impacted various stakeholders, such as: information on the proposed operating and capital expenditure reductions; the potential impact of a reduced dividend on strategic options; the articulation of cash allocation plans to investors and other stakeholders; and potential asset and project risks associated with counterparty financial viability risks. These considerations were balanced against prior intention/uni00A0statements.\n\nTo support these discussions, the Board was provided with information from an investor survey. This was discussed extensively in order to understand the perceptions of the market in relation to Shell's direction, strategy and financial strength. Having equity advisors and banks present directly to the Board helped build the Board's knowledge of what the markets were looking for. This helped guide the content of the third quarter 2020 communications.\n\nAn annual investor perception study was commissioned and considered by the Board. The Board was/uni00A0also/uni00A0provided with periodic reports from the Executive Vice President, Investor Relations which summarised/uni00A0feedback from various brokers and provided detailed analysis of how Shell's messages had/uni00A0been received by investors.\n\nThe Board was regularly updated on, and discussed, the management and impact of COVID-19 on Shell's/uni00A0activities and workforce.\n\n## Approval of Shell's detailed Operating Plan 2021-2023 (OP20)\n\n## What was the outcome\n\nThe approval of OP20 followed an in-depth review by the Board of proposals on capital allocation, capital investment outlook, competitive outlook, operating expenses, return on average capital employed and shareholder distributions. This included reviews in the latter part of 2020 as an advance engagement on OP20 while it was under preparation, and in December 2020 for final approval.\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nOP20 discussions included a full review against Shell's strategic ambitions. The Directors and Executive Committee balanced the priorities in the operating plan versus the strategy by using feedback received as/uni00A0part of continual engagement with investors, discussions with equity and debt market analysts, and commitments made regarding share buybacks, gearing and organic free cash flow. The plan was discussed extensively and reviewed thoroughly.\n\nIn the assessment, the interests of investors and capital markets received particular attention and featured heavily in many discussions. Potential differences of interests between debt and equity investors were observed. This was balanced against the importance of the value that societies - (including communities, employees, customers, suppliers) - place on Shell because of the services it provides and the way it conducts business.\n\nInformation on employees and our organisational structure featured as part of OP20. The plan maintained the approach to salaries, benefits, health, worker welfare, focus on employee experience and training.\n\nMetrics agreed within OP20 underpin the 2021 organisational scorecard, against which the majority of/uni00A0employee bonuses are calculated. Both the Board and the Remuneration Committee discussed these metrics at length to ensure they are suitably stretching and motivating, support the right culture within the/uni00A0business, and align to the strategic ambitions.\n\nOP20 reflects the refreshing of the strategy with the growth of low-carbon, customer-facing businesses. It/uni00A0considered the economic and social effects of the pandemic in developing the plan and sought appropriate balance between key priorities, including sustaining cash flows, pivoting the portfolio to/uni00A0deliver the strategy (including reductions in carbon emissions), reducing debt and increasing shareholder distributions.\n\nFollowing the review of the draft operating plan, the Board requested further information on a number of specific matters. Responses were provided on these items and changes were incorporated into the plan where appropriate.\n\nThe overall outcome of this decision is an operating plan that the Board believes underpins Shell's strategic ambitions and has taken into account different stakeholder views, realising that not all stakeholder views can or will completely align with/uni00A0OP20.\n\nWhile stakeholder opinion may differ on Shell's approach, OP20 is based on society's demand for products and services. OP20 supports Shell in maintaining a reputation for/uni00A0high standards on business conduct and health, safety, security and environment issues. It maintained the approach to employee remuneration and benefits to pensioners. OP20 seeks to reward our investors with returns and maintain long-term financial strength to invest in more and cleaner forms of energy and meet the current and future needs of/uni00A0society.\n\nThe Board and management carefully considered various stakeholders in their decisions to reinforce the financial strength and resilience of Shell's business. They also took action to protect staff and customers. Their considerations focused on three key areas: care for staff, customers, and communities; business continuity and the need to continue to/uni00A0ser ve customers in every way we can, including providing them with certainty; and generating and preserving cash to/uni00A0protect the future financial health of Shell.\n\nFor example, in relation to staff and the wider workforce, the Board considered with management the appropriate timing of any large-scale redundancies, given the stress involved and the potential vulnerability of staff and their families to issues associated with COVID-19; how management was engaging with staff while most people were working from home; and how work sites were being equipped and return-to-work plans/uni00A0were being formulated to ensure people could return to/uni00A0work safely.\n\nIn relation to the decision to lower the dividend level, the Board and Management considered employees, Shell pensioners, lenders, debt holders, credit-rating agencies, suppliers, customers, governments, partners and communities. As a reduced dividend meant greater retention of cash to use/uni00A0for increasing financial resilience, the outcome of the consideration of stakeholders was that the decision would be/uni00A0largely positive for all stakeholders in the longer term.\n\nInvestor feedback received towards the middle of 2020 led to the decision to more clearly communicate the cash allocation framework to investors and the prioritisation of allocation between balance sheet strength, shareholder distributions and investments. More information on this can be found in 'Dividend policy' on 183.",

        "page_content": "## Investing in new business, acquisitions and divestments, and closures\n\n## What was the outcome\n\nOver the course of the year, the Board discussed and approved new opportunities, new projects and proposed divestments or closures across the different segments. This was in order to continually high-grade the portfolio, to deliver the best from our traditional businesses, to grow our customer-centric business and to rapidly and purposefully innovate for our future business models.\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nThe Board obtained a clearer perspective on the role of Shell's Trading and Supply organisation in the energy transition (for example, in biofuels and renewable energy). This assisted the Board in assessing the/uni00A0possible impact on stakeholders and risks to its reputation in relation to certain stakeholder groups. These considerations included assessing the impact on cash allocation and shareholder distributions.\n\nInvestors shared their opinions on significant acquisitions in the New Energies sector compared with organic growth/investment.\n\nOil and gas - During the year Shell secured new opportunities in a number of regions, some of which were considered and approved by the Board. The Directors carefully reviewed new significant entries and risk and rewards of new projects. During these discussions, the Board was aware that some stakeholders may disagree with Shell's strategy to continue to invest in oil and gas during the energy transition.\n\nOffshore wind farm Hollandse Kust (noord) - The CrossWind Consortium, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco, was awarded the tender for this wind farm. The consortium plans to have Hollandse Kust (noord) operational in 2023 with an installed capacity of 759 MW, generating at least 3.3 TWh per year. This is enough renewable power to supply more than 1 million Dutch households with green electricity. The/uni00A0Board was informed of stakeholder engagements, including with the Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (the ministerial entity responsible for the tender).\n\nAs a result of discussion and decisions in this area, the Board obtained insights on renewables growth, customers' priorities (around price and interest in clean power), and information on/uni00A0anticipated market direction and regulatory frameworks.\n\nOil and gas /uni00A0- The Board recognises that societal views vary/uni00A0widely in this area. It must also bear in mind that global demand for energy is still growing. Although renewable resources will meet a growing share of the rising energy demand, Shell and other experts believe there continues to be/uni00A0a need for oil and gas for many years to come through the/uni00A0energy transition. The Directors also appreciate that it is/uni00A0this business that provides the capital to invest in the energy/uni00A0transition.\n\n## Offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust (noord) -\n\nThroughout 2019, the Board obtained a clearer understanding of New Energies' investments and their alignment with the Power strategy. In 2020, the Board continued to receive updates on strategic priorities for New Energies/Power investments. The Board also received a summary of potential opportunities being considered in order for Shell to deliver upon the overarching goal of creating a profitable, cohesive and integrated business in the Power strategy's core markets. North-west Europe is a priority region for implementing Shell's Power Strategy. The Board reflected on Shell's differentiators to be successful in the tender, including technology and innovation. During the Board's discussion, particular attention was paid to where this proposal fits in the capital programme and the role of this proposal in customer offerings for decarbonised power.\n\nt",

Accordingly, investors should carefully consider/uni00A0these risks.\n\n## STRATEGIC RISKS\n\n## Risk description\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe are exposed to macroeconomic risks including fluctuating prices of crude oil,/uni00A0natural gas, oil products and chemicals.\n\nThe prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals/uni00A0are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties can also affect production costs and demand for our products. Government actions may also affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. This could happen, for example, if governments promote the sale of lower-carbon electric vehicles or even prohibit future sales of new diesel or gasoline vehicles, such as the prohibition in the United Kingdom (UK) that is expected to come into force in 2030. Oil and gas prices can also move independently of each other. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, pandemics such as COVID-19, political instability, conflicts, economic conditions and actions by major oil and gas producing countries. In a low oil/uni00A0and gas price environment, we/uni00A0would generate less revenue from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and parts of those businesses could become less profitable or incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted and could continue to result in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they/uni00A0become uneconomic in this type of price environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or/uni00A0rising costs,/uni00A0have resulted and could continue to result in projects being delayed or cancelled. Assets have been impaired in the past, (including in 2020), and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices could also affect our ability to maintain our long-term capital investment programme and dividend payments. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas revenue. In a high oil and gas price environment, we could experience sharp increases in costs, and, under some production-sharing contracts, our entitlement to proved reserves would be reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for our products, which could result in lower profitability, particularly in our Oil Products and Chemicals business. Higher prices can also lead to more capacity being built, potentially resulting in an/uni00A0oversupply of/uni00A0products that can negatively affect our LNG and Chemicals businesses.\n\nAccordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/uni00A0financial condition./uni00A0\n\n## See 'Market overview' on page 38./uni00A0\n\n## Our ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends in part on the accuracy of our price assumptions.\n\nWe use a range of oil and gas price assumptions, which we review on a periodic basis. These ranges help/uni00A0us to evaluate the robustness of our capital allocation for our evaluation of projects and commercial opportunities. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## See 'Market overview' on page 40./uni00A0\n\n## Our ability to achieve our strategic objectives depends on how we react to competitive forces.\n\nWe face competition in all our businesses. In the crude oil, natural gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses we seek to differentiate our products, but many of them are competing in commodity-type markets. Accordingly, failure to manage our costs and our operational performance could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. We also compete with state-owned oil and gas entities with access to vast financial resources. State-owned entities could be motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions. Accordingly, when bidding on new leases or projects, we could find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage because these state-owned entities may not require a competitive return. If we are unable to obtain competitive returns when bidding on new leases or projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 'Strategy and outlook' on page 20./uni00A0\n\nWe maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate the impact of price volatility. We test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against a range of prices and costs for crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. We prepare annual strategic and financial plans that test different scenarios and their impact on prices on our businesses and company as a whole. These plans are appraised regularly throughout the year, especially during/uni00A0periods of significant price and demand volatility/uni00A0as experienced in 2020. We also aim to maintain a strong balance sheet to provide resilience against weak market prices.\n\nThe range of commodity prices used in our project and portfolio evaluations is subject to a rigorous assessment of/uni00A0short-, medium- and long-term market drivers. These drivers include the extent and pace of the energy transition.\n\nWe continually assess the external environment - the markets and the underlying economic, political, social and/uni00A0environmental drivers that shape them - to evaluate changes in competitive forces and business models. We use multiple future scenarios to assess the resilience of our strategy. We maintain business strategies and plans that focus on actions and capabilities to create and sustain competitive advantage.\n\nFurther background on each risk is set out in the relevant sections of this Report indicated by way of cross-references under each risk factor.\n\nThe Board's responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing our significant and emerging risks is discussed in 'Other Regulatory and Statutory Information' on pages 182-189.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGIC RISKS/uni00A0 continued\n\n## Risk description\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nIf we fail to stay in step with the pace and extent of society's demands with regard to the energy transition to a low-carbon future, we could fail in sustaining and growing our business.\n\nThe pace and extent of the energy transition could pose a risk to Shell if our own transition towards decarbonisation moves at a different speed to society. If we are slower than society, customers may prefer/uni00A0a different supplier which would adversely impact our reputation and demand for our products. If/uni00A0we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or low-carbon products that/uni00A0are unsuccessful because there is limited demand for them. This could have a material adverse effect/uni00A0on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n- See \"Strategy and outlook\" on page 21 and 'Climate change and energy transition' on/uni00A0page 97.\n\nRising climate change concerns and the effects of the energy transition have led and could lead to a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. This may also lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, potential litigation, operational restrictions and additional compliance obligations.\n\nSocietal demand for urgent action has increased especially after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5\u00b0C special report of 2018 and the Paris Agreement's goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Society's increasing focus on climate change and the effects of the energy transition has created a risk landscape that is changing rapidly in response to a wide range of stakeholder actions at global, local and business levels. The potential impact and likelihood of climate change effects on Shell could vary across different time horizons, depending on the specific components of the risk.\n\nWe expect that a growing share of our GHG emissions will be subject to regulation, resulting in increased compliance costs and operational restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain fossil fuel projects or make it more difficult to obtain required permits. Achieving our target to become net zero on all emissions from our operations will result in additional cost. We also expect that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will continue to lower demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels, as will GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for our assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.\n\nThe physical effects of climate change such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect our operations and supply chains.\n\nSome groups are putting pressure on certain investors to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If/uni00A0this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets. Groups are also putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financing fossil fuel companies. According to press reports, some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to certain fossil fuel projects. Accordingly, our ability to use financing for these types of future projects may/uni00A0be adversely affected. This could also adversely affect our potential partners' ability to/uni00A0finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt.\n\nIn some countries, governments, regulators, organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for costs associated with climate change. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit, losing any of them could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn summary, rising climate change concerns and effects of the energy transition have led and could lead to/uni00A0a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. If we are unable to find economically viable, publicly acceptable solutions that reduce our GHG emissions and/or GHG intensity for new and existing projects and for the products we sell, we could experience financial penalties or extra costs, delayed or cancelled projects, potential impairments of our assets, additional provisions and/or reduced production and product sales. This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe actively monitor societal developments, such as regulation-driven carbon-pricing mechanisms and customer-driven preferences for products. We incorporate these into scenarios which provide insights into how the energy transition may unfold in the medium and long term. These insights and those from various other external scenarios (such as the IPCC Special Report 1.5\u00b0C) guide/uni00A0us how we set our strategic direction, capital allocation and carbon emission commitments. We have updated our strategy and organisational structure to be more focused on the sectors where our customers operate, in order to make us better able to compete in the current evolving energy landscape.\n\nOur response to the evolving risk landscape requires transparency and clarity around our plans and actions to achieve our climate target. We have a climate change risk management structure which is supported by standards, policies and controls, as part of our health, safety, security and environment and social performance (HSSE & SP) control framework. Climate change and risks resulting from GHG emissions are reviewed and managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and Executive Committee. We have established several dedicated climate change and GHG-related forums at different levels of the organisation. These forums seek to address, monitor and review climate change issues. Our strategy to assess and manage risks and opportunities resulting from climate change includes considering different time horizons and their relevance to risk identification and business planning.\n\nOverall, mitigation of the risk is addressed through our strategy to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions, purposefully and profitably. This approach has three components:\n\n- \u25a0 demonstrating resilience by adopting the guidance on/uni00A0disclosure by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures; and\n- \u25a0 reducing the GHG-emissions intensity of our operations. We expect to reduce our carbon intensity primarily through altering our product mix as customer (Scope 3) emissions represent the largest component of/uni00A0our carbon intensity. Our aim is to achieve this by shifting the focus of our portfolio as we build our power, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and storage and nature-based/uni00A0solutions businesses and activities;\n- \u25a0 working towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\nFor further explanations of our climate change governance, risk management, climate ambition and strategy, our portfolio and performance, please refer to/uni00A0the section 'Climate change and energy transition' on/uni00A0page 98.\n\nFor further explanations of how we manage the risk of/uni00A0the/uni00A0physical effects of climate change affecting our operations and supply chains, please refer to the risk factor \"The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which we work, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks\".\n\nt",

We may be unable to/uni00A0divest these assets successfully in line with our strategy.\n\nWe may be unable to divest assets at acceptable prices or within the timeline envisaged because of market conditions or credit risk. This would result in increased pressure on our cash position and potential impairments. In some cases, we have also retained certain liabilities following a divestment. Even in cases where we have not expressly retained certain liabilities, we may still be held liable for past acts, failures to/uni00A0act or liabilities that are different from those foreseen. We may also face liabilities if a purchaser fails to/uni00A0honour their commitments. Accordingly, if any of the above circumstances arise, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition./uni00A0\n\n## See 'Strategy and outlook' on page 21./uni00A0\n\nWe operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We and our joint arrangements and associates also face the risk of litigation and disputes/uni00A0worldwide.\n\nDevelopments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our operations. Potential impacts include: forced divestment of assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights; additional taxes including windfall taxes, restrictions on deductions and retroactive tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price controls; local content requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Tensions between nation states can also affect our business. Any/uni00A0of these, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn 2020, many governments ran deficits to deal with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, there will be uncertain long-term fiscal consequences, with possible subsequent effects on government policies that affect Shell's business interests.\n\nFrom time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non-compliance with policies and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; failing to honour existing contractual commitments; and seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants.

Challenges include: uncertain geology; frontier conditions; the existence and availability of/uni00A0necessary technology and engineering resources; the availability of skilled labour; the existence of transportation infrastructure; project delays; the expiration of licences; delays in obtaining required permits; potential cost overruns; and technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. These challenges are particularly relevant in certain developing and emerging-market countries, in frontier areas/uni00A0and in deep-water fields, such as off the coast of Mexico. We may fail to assess or manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles could impair our delivery of these projects, our ability to/uni00A0fulfil the full potential value of the project as assessed when the investment was approved, and/or our/uni00A0ability to fulfil related contractual commitments. This could lead to impairments and could have a/uni00A0material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition./uni00A0\n\nFuture oil and gas production will depend on our access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, and through developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields. Failure to replace proved reserves could result in an accelerated decrease of future production, potentially having a material/uni00A0adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition./uni00A0\n\n## Oil and gas production available for sale\n\n|                                              |       | Million boe [A]   | Million boe [A]   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                              | 2020  | 2019              | 2018              |\n| Shell subsidiaries                           | 1,104 | 1,182             | 1,179             |\n| Shell share of joint ventures and associates | 135   | 156               | 159               |\n| Total                                        | 1,239 | 1,338             | 1,338             |\n\n## Proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves [A][B] (at December 31)\n\n|                                                                |                    | Million boe [C]    | Million boe [C]    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                | December  31, 2020 | December  31, 2019 | December  31, 2018 |\n| Shell subsidiaries                                             | 8,222              | 9,980              | 10,294             |\n| Shell share of joint ventures and associates                   | 902                | 1,116              | 1,285              |\n| Total                                                          | 9,124              | 11,096             | 11,578             |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interest in Shell subsidiaries | 322                | 304                | 331                |\n\n- [C] Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Shell story' on page 16.\n\nThe estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements based on available information and the application of complex rules.

Processing, managing and monitoring many trading transactions across the world, some of them complex, exposes us to operational and market risks, including commodity price risks which saw significant levels of volatility in 2020. We use derivative instruments such as futures and contracts for differences to hedge market risks. We do not hedge all our activities and where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected. The risk of ineffective controls and oversight of trading activities, and the risk that traders could deliberately act outside limits and controls, either individually or as a group, could have material adverse effects on our earnings, cash/uni00A0flows/uni00A0and financial condition.\n\n- See 'Liquidity and capital resources' on page 81 and Note 19 to the 'Consolidated Financial/uni00A0Statements' on pages 251-255.\n\nIn effecting commodity trades and derivative contracts, the company operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks are managed within authorised limits./uni00A0For example, the use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading organisations that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. Our trading organisation has a compliance manual addressing our operational risks which all staff are required to follow. Senior Management regularly reviews mandated trading limits. We monitor market risk exposure daily, using value-at-risk (VAR) techniques. We monitor trading positions against limits every day. We use marking to fair value to assess trading exposures where appropriate, with a department that is independent of the traders reviewing the market values applied. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, trader monitoring tools have been upgraded. During the period of extreme market volatility, additional oversight has been provided by a dedicated 'Liquidity Forum', chaired by senior executives in our trading organisation. We have increased the monitoring of the financial resilience of our customers, suppliers and the clearing houses that we deal with.\n\nt",

The number and breadth of such laws continue to expand. For example, the EU and the USA continue to impose restrictions and prohibitions on certain transactions involving countries such as Syria, Venezuela, Russia and Cuba. The USA continues to impose comprehensive sanctions against Iran, while the EU and other nations continue to maintain targeted sanctions. The EU and the USA imposed restrictions and controls on defined oil and gas activities in Russia in 2014, and these remain in force. The USA introduced further restrictions regarding Russia in 2017, expanding them in 2018. The EU and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, with the USA expanding them in 2018 and 2019. The US sanctions primarily target the government of Venezuela and the oil industry. Many other nations are also adopting trade-control programmes similar to those administered by the EU and the USA. The expansion of sanctions, the frequent additions of prohibited parties, the number of markets in which we operate and the large number of transactions we process, make compliance with all sanctions complex and sometimes challenging. Shell has voluntarily self-disclosed potential violations of sanctions in/uni00A0the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased trade compliance risks, due to factors such as growing state involvement in business dealings, the need to maintain and develop business opportunities and cross-border movement of goods and technologies, and the increasing likelihood that counterparties will/uni00A0change ownership as the economic crisis continues.\n\nAny violation of sanctions could lead to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on or prosecution of Shell or its employees. This could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 'Other Regulatory and Statutory Information' on page 186.\n\nInvestors should also consider the following, which could limit shareholder remedies.\n\n## OTHER (Generally applicable to an investment in securities)\n\n## Risk description\n\nHow this risk is managed\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association determine the jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This could limit shareholder remedies./uni00A0\n\nOur Articles of Association generally require that all disputes between our shareholders in such capacity and the Company or our subsidiaries (or our Directors or former Directors), or between the Company and our Directors or former Directors, be exclusively resolved by arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands, under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Our Articles of Association also provide that, if this provision is to be determined invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the dispute could only be brought before the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief, including in respect of securities law claims, could be determined in accordance with these provisions./uni00A0\n\nWe continue to develop and maintain a trade compliance programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance, which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, a specific website for trade compliance, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing trade compliance risks. The effectiveness of the trade compliance programme is assessed annually (or more frequently if necessary). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have promoted an increased focus on compliance and assurance. For example, in Trading and Supply we have promoted a particular focus on compliance with trade controls in high-risk areas such as port agency, inspections and terminal operations.\n\nt",

Services and consumption, which/uni00A0account for a higher share of GDP in developed countries, were disproportionately affected by restrictions on movement and closures of/uni00A0hospitality and leisure facilities. Developing economies suffered from collapses in capital inflows and commodity prices, and from a sharp compression in consumption and investment. Massive fiscal and monetary support measures were deployed in the major economies. In China, the authorities funded infrastructure investments. In the USA and Europe, government transfers supplemented incomes and supported businesses, in order to prevent deeper declines in employment and disposable income.\n\nLed by mainland China, the Asia-Pacific region led the recovery during the year, as public health measures helped to contain community transmission of COVID-19. In other countries, the pandemic proved more difficult to/uni00A0control. European countries experienced renewed rises in infection rates during the fourth quarter of 2020. They responded by reinstating restrictions on activities that have a high risk of transmitting COVID-19./uni00A0\n\nEncouraging news on vaccines and improvements in therapeutics have increased the chances of a recovery in 2021, but the global economic outlook remains precarious, because markets fear that more virulent variants of COVID-19 could trigger additional waves of infections. The deep recessions triggered by the pandemic could leave lasting scars in/uni00A0the/uni00A0form of: lower investment by companies; high unemployment; increased global debt; and a potential retreat from global trade and supply linkages. There is concern that these effects may well restrict growth in the medium term./uni00A0\n\n## GLOBAL PRICES, DEMAND AND SUPPLY\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the main crude oil and natural gas price markers to which we are exposed:\n\n## Oil and gas average industry prices [A]\n\n|                                           |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent ($/b)                               |     42 |   64   |   71   |\n| West Texas Intermediate ($/b)             |     39 |   57   |   65   |\n| Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)                       |      2 |    2.5 |    3.1 |\n| UK National Balancing Point (pence/therm) |     25 |   35   |   60   |\n| Japan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b)         |     46 |   67   |   73   |\n\n## CRUDE OIL\n\nOn a daily average basis, Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, traded between $13 per barrel (/b) and $70/b in 2020, ending the year around $50/b. Brent crude oil prices averaged $42/b for the year, 34% (or $22/b ) lower than/uni00A0in 2019./uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, oil markets experienced unprecedented developments in demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of 2020, global oil demand for the year was expected to grow by 1.2 million barrels per day (b/d). Then in January, oil demand started to contract because demand fell in China as lockdown was imposed to contain the virus outbreak. In subsequent months, oil demand contracted further as the outbreak in China evolved into a global pandemic and lockdowns were introduced across the world. In April, oil demand fell to its lowest level, around 22 million b/d below year-average demand in 2019, according to an estimate of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Contraction of such magnitude has never been recorded before. Country lockdowns deeply impacted transportation sectors, especially passenger road and passenger air in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies. In subsequent months, oil demand started recovering, but only partially, because resurgences of COVID-19 triggered re-imposition of social distancing and travel restrictions. By the/uni00A0fourth quarter, global oil demand was still estimated to be around 5.5/uni00A0million b/d below the 2019 level, according to the Oil Market Report published by the IEA in January 2021. Averaged for the full year, oil demand contracted by around 9 million b/d, or 9%, to 91.2 million b/d. Oil demand fell by 5.7 million b/d in OECD economies, and by 3.2 million b/d in non-OECD economies. By contrast, oil demand in 2019 was 0.8/uni00A0million b/d higher than in 2018./uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, oil markets also experienced unprecedented developments in supply. In March, there was a serious disagreement within the OPEC+ alliance, which consists of OPEC members and co-operating non-OPEC resource holders such as Russia. Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on what to do about falling demand for oil. Saudi Arabia responded to the disagreement by boosting its production to almost 12 million b/d, a/uni00A0monthly record. By April, storage capacity was filling up quickly and oil/uni00A0prices were falling rapidly. On April 12, the OPEC+ alliance agreed to jointly reduce production by an unprecedented 9.7 million b/d for May and June. For the month of June, Saudi Arabia voluntarily cut production further, by around 1 million b/d. For the rest of the year, the OPEC+ alliance agreed on and complied with a production cut of 7.7 million b/d./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "In April, supply from outside the OPEC+ alliance also started to fall, most notably in the USA. The US Energy Information Administration reported a supply contraction of around 2 million b/d by the end of May, from a level of around 13 million b/d at the start of the year. US producers cut budgets, leading to an unprecedented fall in the number of oil drill rigs to around 26% of the total at the start of the year. Supply from the USA occasionally fell even further to around 10 million b/d because of production shut-ins during the hurricane season./uni00A0\n\nIn aggregate, production of oil supply in 2020 is estimated in the Oil Market Report at 93.9 million b/d, which is 6.7 million b/d lower than in/uni00A02019. OPEC production is estimated to have fallen by 3.8 million b/d. Supply from the USA fell by 0.8 million b/d from 2019. By contrast, global/uni00A0oil supply in 2019 was 0.1 million b/d higher than in 2018.\n\nDaily average oil prices reached a low at the end of April before the OPEC+ supply curtailments came into effect. Brent crude oil prices fell to around $14/b. Contract prices of some crude grades, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), even traded well below $0/b for a short period. Brent crude oil prices started to recover from May and traded in a price range of around $35-45/b from June. Towards the end of 2020, announcements of promising COVID-19 vaccines supported Brent crude oil prices, allowing them to break through the upper end of this range./uni00A0\n\nOn a yearly average basis, WTI crude oil traded at a discount of about $2.5/b to Brent crude oil in 2020, compared with $7/b in 2019. The discount narrowed from 2019 because falling US supply prevented bottlenecks in pipeline capacity from the landlocked Cushing storage hub/uni00A0to the US Gulf Coast. According to the US Energy Information Administration, US crude oil exports increased further to a yearly average of around 3.1 million b/d in 2020, up by 0.1 million b/d from 2019. This helped to ensure a narrow price differential between Brent and WTI.\n\nLooking ahead, the IMF's global economic outlook indicates some increase in global economic growth, which should support oil demand/uni00A0growth./uni00A0\n\nDemand growth could accelerate further if vaccines can help contain COVID-19 and allow a return to pre-pandemic demand patterns in perhaps two or three years. According to the IEA, global oil demand is projected to increase by around 5.4 million b/d for 2021 to reach 96.6 million b/d. This is still 3.4 million b/d less than in 2019. OPEC+ members may have to carefully balance supply growth with sustained production curtailments in order to achieve price stability. In the near term, once demand has recovered to 2019 levels, the need for OPEC+ cuts may diminish. If there is further demand growth, tightness of supply could even/uni00A0develop. This is because any supply growth from the US shale basins/uni00A0could be limited, since US operators have shifted their focus from/uni00A0volume to value. We expect this shift to be permanent.\n\nThe supply growth potential from outside OPEC+ and the USA could be limited by industry-wide lack of investment in new supply projects which also tend to have a long lead time.\n\nIn the near term, prices could rise if demand is quicker to recover and OPEC+ members successfully constrain supply. On the other hand, the price environment could weaken if the impact of COVID-19 prevents full demand recovery, and/or OPEC and the non-OPEC resource holders relax their production agreement. The price environment could also weaken if there is an increase in supply from other non-OPEC producers, such as US shale producers./uni00A0\n\n## NATURAL GAS\n\nGlobal gas demand is estimated to have declined by around 2.4% in 2020, in contrast with the 2.5% annual growth rate observed since the start of the century. The deterioration in gas demand for power generation and in industry was mainly caused by lockdowns related to COVID-19. Resilient gas demand for heating helped offset the overall decline. Demand declined across all regions except non-OECD Asia. In nonOECD Asia, demand grew in China, which experienced a robust recovery after mitigating the impacts of COVID-19. Outside China, aggregate gas demand in non-OECD Asia remained flat year-on-year.\n\nIn 2020, global LNG imports were almost unchanged from 2019, rising by about 2 million tonnes year-on-year to 360 million tonnes. Growth in LNG supply capacity was mostly limited to the USA, where 21 million tonnes of new liquefaction started commercial operations in 2020. Liquefaction plants already in operation in the USA responded to the weak gas price environment by significantly curtailing production in the middle of the year. Supply from major LNG-exporting countries such as Egypt, Malaysia and Norway was also lower year-on-year because of operational disruptions and shut-ins to prevent economic losses.\n\nNatural gas prices can vary from region to region.\n\nIn the USA, the natural gas price at the Henry Hub averaged $2.0 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2020, 21% lower than in 2019. It traded in a range of $1.5 to 3.2/MMBtu. In the earlier part of 2020, there was downward pressure on prices because of decreased demand from a/uni00A0mild winter, lower LNG exports and a weak domestic market caused by/uni00A0COVID-19. Supply fell because activity declined as producers cut investments and because lower oil production meant there was less associated gas. During the summer, prices found support from growing demand for gas that could generate power for cooling during the hotter months of the year. Later in 2020, demand strengthened because of storage ahead of the winter season and increasing US LNG exports.\n\nIn Europe, the average price at the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) in/uni00A02020 was 28% lower than in 2019. At the main continental gas trading hubs - in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany - prices were also lower, as reflected by weaker Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices. European gas prices were lower because of: the slump in demand in power generation and industry; robust supply of pipeline gas; well-filled gas storage inventories at the start of the year; and competition with renewables in power.\n\nWe also produce and sell natural gas in regions where supply, demand and regulatory circumstances differ markedly from those in the USA or/uni00A0Europe.\n\nLong-term contracted LNG prices in the Asia-Pacific region in 2020 were lower than in 2019 because they are predominantly indexed to oil prices, particularly the Japan Customs-cleared Crude (JCC) index which dropped by an 32% year-on-year, tracking Brent crude prices. Meanwhile, delivered North Asia spot prices, reflected by the Japan Korea Marker, declined by 20% compared with 2019, because of oversupply in the global LNG market and weak demand.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect gas markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific to find support from markets recovering from the pandemic. Price developments are very uncertain and dependent on many factors.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## MARKET OVERVIEW/uni00A0 continued\n\nIn the USA, Henry Hub gas prices are expected to increase over the next few years. This is because while production of gas is expected to recover by perhaps late 2021, it could lag behind demand, which may grow earlier, to supply LNG exports and exports to Mexico by pipeline, and to/uni00A0supply residential and industrial users. The Henry Hub gas price could rise more than expected if oil prices stay low, leading to the Permian Basin/uni00A0producing less oil and supplying less associated gas as a result.\n\nOn the other hand, if producers increase investments substantially, the extra supply could exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nIn Europe, we believe gas prices will be increasingly influenced by the cost of LNG imports from the USA. In the Asia-Pacific region, long-term gas prices are expected to continue to be strongly influenced by oil prices. Spot prices are expected to be increasingly influenced by gas supply and/uni00A0demand fundamentals.\n\n## CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE ASSUMPTIONS\n\nOur ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities ultimately depends on the accuracy of our price assumptions (see 'Risk factors' on page 28). We use a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market uncertainties to determine what ranges of/uni00A0future crude oil and natural gas prices to use in project and portfolio evaluations. Market uncertainties include, for example, future economic conditions, geopolitics, actions by major resource holders, production costs, technological progress and the balance of supply and demand. See/uni00A0also Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages/uni00A0234-238./uni00A0\n\n## REFINING MARGINS\n\nRefining marker average industry gross margins\n\n|                      | 2020   | 2019   | $/b 2018   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| US West Coast        | 8.5    | 13.5   | 11.5       |\n| US Gulf Coast Coking | 2.3    | 4.9    | 7. 0       |\n| Rotterdam Complex    | 0.4    | 2.3    | 2.5        |\n| Singapore            | (0.5)  | (0.6)  | 1.4        |\n\nIndustry gross refining margins weakened in 2020 because demand for/uni00A0oil/uni00A0products was significantly reduced by the fall in economic activity and/uni00A0increase in travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. Demand for transportation fuels such as gasoline for passenger cars and kerosene for air transportation was hit particularly hard. During most of the second half of the year, mobility and the resulting demand for transportation fuels improved in some parts of the world, especially in China and South-east Asia. At the end of the year, new waves of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the Americas severely limited any global increase in demand for transportation fuels.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the new International Maritime Organization low-sulphur shipping fuel specification came into effect, limiting the sulphur content of maritime fuel to 0.5%. This had a limited effect on margins because of the economic slowdown in 2020 and because companies had/uni00A0prepared for the new regulations by building inventory in the second/uni00A0half of 2019.\n\nThe destruction of demand caused by COVID-19 led to industry idling some refinery capacity. Permanent refinery closures were also announced in 2020, but construction of new capacity did occur during the year, especially in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nThe outlook for refining margins for the next few years will be influenced by the uncertainty around the pace of economic and demand recovery from the pandemic, and by the continued addition of new refinery capacity in the Middle East and Asia, often integrated with chemicals production. On balance, refining marker margins are expected to remain under pressure for 2021.\n\n## PETROCHEMICAL MARGINS\n\nCracker industry margins [A]\n\n|                                    |   2020 |   2019 |   $/tonne 2018 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| North East/South East Asia naphtha |    362 |    302 |            594 |\n| Western Europe naphtha             |    513 |    528 |            562 |\n| US ethane                          |    433 |    440 |            412 |\n\nCracker margins were volatile during 2020 because of how COVID-19 affected demand. Overall margins, however, were broadly similar to those in 2019. The effect on chemicals depended on end use. Some sectors, such as automotive, were hit particularly hard, while others, such as packaging, showed robust demand. Chinese demand recovered relatively quickly because the virus was swiftly brought under control. Overall chemicals demand was not hit as hard as GDP. West European cracker margins were supported by the sudden fall in the price of crude oil in March and April. The fact that crude oil was at a lower price than in 2019 reduced naphtha feedstock costs, which reduced product prices. This in/uni00A0turn put pressure on US ethane cracker margins, although plentiful ethane supply helped counter the impact./uni00A0\n\nThe outlook for petrochemical margins in 2021 and beyond depends on/uni00A0feedstock costs and supply and demand balances. Demand for petrochemicals will be affected by the speed and extent of recovery from/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply of petrochemicals will depend on/uni00A0the net capacity effect of new builds and plant closures (taking into account any delays or cancellations in building new plants or closing old ones). Product prices reflect the prices of raw materials, which are closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. The balance of all these factors will drive margins./uni00A0\n\nThe statements in this 'Market overview' section, including those related/uni00A0to our price forecasts, are forward-looking statements based on/uni00A0management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein.

See Note 4 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 230-232.\n- [B]  See 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 305-306./uni00A0\n\n## EARNINGS 2020-2019\n\nIncome for the period was a loss of $21,534 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $16,432 million in 2019. After current cost of supplies adjustment, total segment earnings were a loss of $(19,701) million in 2020, compared with earnings of $15,827/uni00A0million in 2019.\n\nEarnings on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings) exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts, after making allowance for the tax effect. The purchase price of volumes sold in the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period, rather than on the historic cost calculated on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Therefore, when oil prices are decreasing, CCS earnings are likely to be/uni00A0higher than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis and, when prices are/uni00A0increasing, CCS earnings are likely to be lower than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis./uni00A0\n\nIntegrated Gas earnings in 2020 were a loss of $6,278 million, compared with earnings of $8,628 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by higher impairments, lower realised oil, LNG and gas prices, higher charges related to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and lower contributions from marketing and trading. These effects were partly/uni00A0offset by lower operating expenses. See 'Integrated Gas' on/uni00A0pages 46-52./uni00A0\n\nUpstream earnings in 2020 were a loss of $10,785 million, compared with/uni00A0earnings of $3,855 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by lower realised oil and gas prices, higher impairments, higher losses on sales of assets, lower production volumes and unfavourable deferred tax movements. This was partly offset by lower operating expenses and lower well write-offs. See/uni00A0'Upstream' on pages 53-60./uni00A0\n\nOil Products earnings in 2020/uni00A0were a loss of $494 million, compared with/uni00A0earnings of $6,139 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by higher impairments, lower combined Refining and Trading margins as well as lower marketing margins. This was partly offset by lower operating expenses and other items mainly including taxation movements. See/uni00A0'Oil/uni00A0Products' on pages 70-76./uni00A0\n\nChemicals earnings in 2020 were $808 million, compared with $478/uni00A0million in 2019. The increase was mainly driven by lower tax and operating expenses and higher chemicals prices, which was partly offset by higher redundancy and restructuring charges and higher depreciation, depletion and amortisation. See \"Chemicals\" on pages 77-79.\n\nCorporate segment in 2020 was an expense of $2,952 million, compared with $3,273/uni00A0million in 2019. The lower expense was mainly driven by the favourable deferred tax movements. See 'Corporate' on page 80./uni00A0\n\n## EARNINGS 2019-2018\n\nIncome for the period was $16,432 million in 2019, compared with $23,906 million in 2018. After current cost of supplies adjustment, total segment earnings were $15,827 million in 2019, compared with $24,364/uni00A0million in 2018.\n\nIntegrated Gas earnings in 2019 were $8,628 million, compared with/uni00A0$11,444 million in 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower gains on sale of assets, lower realised oil, LNG and gas prices, higher impairments, higher operating expenses, negative movements in deferred tax positions and lower liquids production volumes. These effects were partly offset by stronger contributions from LNG marketing and trading, and gains related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives. See 'Integrated Gas' on pages/uni00A046-52./uni00A0\n\nUpstream earnings in 2019 were $3,855 million, compared with $6,490/uni00A0million in 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by higher impairments, lower realised oil and gas prices, higher depreciation and/uni00A0higher well write-offs. This was partly offset by increased gains on/uni00A0sale of assets and/uni00A0higher volumes. See/uni00A0'Upstream' on pages 53-60./uni00A0\n\nOil Products earnings in 2019 were $6,139 million, compared with $6,025/uni00A0million in 2018. The increase was mainly driven by higher Marketing margins and lower operating expenses partly offset by lower Refining and Trading margins. See \"Oil Products\" on pages 70-76.\n\nt",

The decrease was mainly driven by lower margins/uni00A0and higher legal provisions. See 'Chemicals' on pages 77-79.\n\nCorporate segment in 2019 was an expense of $3,273 million, compared with $1,479 million in 2018. The higher loss was mainly driven by the introduction of IFRS 16 and reduced capitalised interest, as well as reduced tax credits from financing and one-off charges. See 'Corporate'/uni00A0on page 80./uni00A0\n\n## PRODUCTION AVAILABLE FOR SALE\n\nOil and gas production available for sale in 2020 was 1,239 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), or 3,386 thousand boe per day (boe/d), compared with 1,338 million boe, or 3,665 thousand boe/d, in 2019. In/uni00A02020, lower production was due to the impact of divestments, higher maintenance, demand reduction and OPEC+ restrictions.

This comprised decreases of 614 million boe/uni00A0from Shell subsidiaries and decreases of 72 million boe from the Shell/uni00A0share of joint ventures and associates. The decrease from Shell subsidiaries included a net decrease of 607 million boe from revisions and reclassifications, an increase of 88 million from extensions and discoveries and a net decrease of 95 million boe related to purchases and sales of minerals in place. The decrease of 72 million boe from the Shell share of/uni00A0joint ventures and associates comprises a net decrease of 73 million boe from revisions and reclassifications.\n\nIn 2020, total oil and gas production was 1,286 million boe, of which 1,239 million boe was available for sale and 47 million boe was consumed in operations. Production available for sale from subsidiaries was 1,104 million boe and 40 million boe was consumed in operations. The Shell share of the production available for sale of joint ventures and/uni00A0associates was 135 million boe and 7 million boe was consumed in/uni00A0operations.\n\nAccordingly, after taking production into account, our proved reserves decreased by 1,972 million boe in 2020, to 9,124 million boe at December 31, 2020, with a decrease of 1,758 million boe from subsidiaries and a/uni00A0decrease of 214 million boe from the Shell share of joint ventures and/uni00A0associates.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND OTHER INFORMATION\n\nCash capital expenditure was $17.8 billion in 2020, compared with $23.9/uni00A0billion in 2019.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by $3.1 billion in 2020, to $34.8 billion.\n\nOur return on average capital employed (ROACE) decreased to (6.8)%, compared with 6.7% in 2019, mainly driven by lower income in 2020.\n\nNet debt was $75.4 billion at the end of 2020, compared with $79.1 billion at the end of 2019, mainly driven by lower share buybacks and dividend payments.\n\nGearing was 32.2% at the end of 2020, compared with 29.3% at/uni00A0the/uni00A0end/uni00A0of 2019, mainly driven by lower earnings in 2020.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\nSee Note 2 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 221-229.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nSee Note 25 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages/uni00A0260-262.",

The data used are a weighted average in dollars for A/uni00A0and B shares. The TSRs of major publicly traded oil and gas companies can be compared directly, providing a way to determine how we are performing relative to our industry peers.\n\n## Cash flow from operating activities ($ million)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 34,105 2019: 42,178\n\nCash flow from operating activities is the total of all the cash receipts and/uni00A0payments associated with our sales of oil, gas, chemicals and other products. The components that provide a reconciliation from income for the period are listed in the 'Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows'. This indicator reflects our ability to generate cash to service and reduce our debt and for distributions to shareholders and for investments.\n\n- See 'Liquidity and capital resources' on pages 81-84.\n\n## Free cash flow ($ million)*\n\n## 20,828/uni00A0 2019: 26,399\n\nFree cash flow is the sum of \"Cash flow from operating activities\" and \"Cash flow from investing activities\", which are listed in the 'Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows'. This indicator is used to evaluate the cash available for financing activities, including dividend payments, after investment in maintaining and growing our business.\n\n- See 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 305-306.\n\n## Organic free cash flow ($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 7, 6 3 4 /uni00A0 2019: 20,116\n\nOrganic free cash flow is defined as free cash flow excluding the cash flows from acquisition and divestment activities.

Capital employed is the sum of total equity and total debt. ROACE measures the efficiency of our utilisation of the capital that we employ and/uni00A0is a common measure of business performance.\n\n- See 'Summary of results' on pages 41-42 and 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 305-306.\n\n## Adjusted earnings ($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4,846 2019: 16,462\n\nAdjusted earnings are income/(loss) attributable to shareholders plus cost of sales adjustment and excluding identified items. This measure aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items. These items are in some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period. This measure excludes earnings attributable to non-controlling interest.\n\n- See 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 305-306.\n\n## Adjusted earnings per share ($)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0.62/uni00A0\n\n2019: 2.04\n\nAdjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted earnings, divided by/uni00A0the weighted average number of shares used as the basis for basic earnings per share./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 305-306./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Divestment proceeds ($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4,010/uni00A0\n\n2019: 7,871\n\nDivestment proceeds represent cash received from divestment activities in/uni00A0the period.

The segment includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of upstream and midstream infrastructure that delivers gas and/uni00A0liquids to market. It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, electricity and carbon-emission rights, and markets and sells LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels./uni00A0\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS\n\nGlobal gas demand is estimated to have declined by around 2.4% in 2020, in contrast with the 2.5% annual growth rate observed since the start of the century. The deterioration in gas demand for power generation and in industry was mainly caused by lockdowns related to COVID-19. Resilient gas demand for heating helped offset the overall decline. Demand declined across all regions except non-OECD Asia. In nonOECD Asia, demand grew in China, which experienced a robust recovery after mitigating the impacts of COVID-19. Outside China, aggregate gas/uni00A0demand in non-OECD Asia remained flat year-on-year.\n\nIn 2020, global LNG imports were almost unchanged from 2019, rising by about 2 million tonnes year-on-year to 360 million tonnes. Growth in LNG supply capacity was mostly limited to the USA, where 21 million tonnes of/uni00A0new liquefaction started commercial operations in 2020. Liquefaction plants already in operation in the USA responded to the weak gas price environment by significantly curtailing production in the middle of the year. Supply from major LNG-exporting countries such as Egypt, Malaysia and Norway was also lower year-on-year because of operational disruptions and shut-ins to prevent economic losses.\n\nNatural gas prices can vary from region to region.\n\nIn the USA, the natural gas price at the Henry Hub averaged $2.0 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2020, 21% lower than in 2019. It/uni00A0traded in a range of $1.5 to 3.2/MMBtu.\n\nIn Europe, the average price at the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) in/uni00A02020 was 28% lower than in 2019. At the main continental gas trading hubs - in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany - prices were also lower, as reflected by weaker Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices.\n\nLong-term contracted LNG prices in the Asia-Pacific region in 2020 were/uni00A0lower than in 2019 because they are predominantly indexed to oil/uni00A0prices,/uni00A0particularly the Japan Customs-cleared Crude (JCC) index which dropped by an 32% year-on-year, tracking Brent crude prices. Meanwhile, delivered North Asia spot prices, reflected by the Japan Korea Marker, declined by 20% compared with 2019.\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 38-40./uni00A0\n\n## PRODUCTION AVAILABLE FOR SALE/uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, production was 333 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), or 911 thousand boe per day (boe/d), compared with 336 million boe, or 922 thousand boe/d in 2019. Natural gas production was 83% of total production in/uni00A02020 and 2019. In 2020 natural gas production decreased by 1% compared with 2019. This was mainly because of extended maintenance at the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility and maintenance activities at the Gorgon project in Australia, as well as lower wells performance. These were partially offset by the transfer of Rashpetco operations in Egypt from the Upstream segment and field ramp-ups. Liquids production decreased by/uni00A02%, in/uni00A0line with the decrease in natural gas production.\n\n## LNG LIQUEFACTION VOLUMES/uni00A0\n\nLNG liquefaction volumes of 33.2 million tonnes in 2020 were 6% lower than/uni00A0in 2019, mainly driven by lower feedgas availability, higher maintenance activities, primarily at Prelude FLNG and Gorgon, as well as cargo timing.\n\nLNG sales volumes of 69.67 million tonnes in 2020 were 6% lower than in/uni00A02019, driven by lower LNG liquefaction volumes partly offset by higher purchases from third parties.\n\nThrough our Shell Energy organisation, we market a portion of our share of/uni00A0equity production of LNG and sell and market LNG volumes around the/uni00A0world through our hubs in the UK, Dubai and Singapore. Shell has term sales/uni00A0contracts for the majority of our LNG liquefaction and term purchase contracts. We are able to maximize the income we generate from our LNG cargos through our shipping network, regasification terminals and ability to purchase and deliver LNG spot cargos from third parties. For example, if one customer does not need a scheduled cargo, we can deliver that cargo to another customer who is in need. Similarly, if a customer needs an additional cargo not available from our production facilities, we can contract with third parties to deliver the additional cargo. We also conduct paper trades primarily to manage commodity price risk related to sales and purchase contracts. We also sell trucked LNG in China, Singapore and Europe.",

The net charge mainly reflected impairment charges of $890 million mostly in Australia, negative movements in deferred tax positions of $292 million in Australia and write-offs of $131/uni00A0million in Trinidad and Tobago. These were partly offset by a gain/uni00A0of/uni00A0$787 million related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and a/uni00A0gain of $203 million on a sale of assets in Australia.\n\nExcluding the net charge described above, segment earnings were $4,383/uni00A0million in 2020 compared with $8,955 million in 2019. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower realised LNG, oil and gas prices, and/uni00A0lower contributions from marketing and trading, partly offset by lower/uni00A0operating expenses.\n\n## EARNINGS 2019-2018/uni00A0\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 were $8,628 million, which included a net charge of $326 million as described above./uni00A0\n\nSegment earnings in 2018 were $11,444 million, which included a net gain of $2,045 million. The net gain primarily reflected gains of $1,937 million on sale of assets, mainly related to the divestment of assets in Thailand, New Zealand and India. It also comprised a gain of $481 million related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and impairment charges of $371 million related to investments in Trinidad and Tobago and/uni00A0Shell's investment in a joint venture.\n\nExcluding the net charge above, segment earnings were $8,955/uni00A0million in/uni00A02019 compared with $9,399 million in 2018. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower realised oil, LNG and gas prices, higher operating expenses (of which about 50% related to New Energies, reflecting underlying business growth), and lower liquids production volumes, partly/uni00A0offset by significantly stronger contributions from LNG marketing/uni00A0and trading.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE/uni00A0\n\nCash capital expenditure in 2020 was $4.3 billion, unchanged from $4.3/uni00A0billion in 2019. Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be around $6 billion in 2021.\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In February 2020, we announced that we will build and operate our first industrial-scale solar electricity farm near Wandoan in central Queensland, Australia. The solar farm will generate 120 MW of solar/uni00A0electricity and is expected to be completed in early 2021.\n\nKey portfolio events in 2020 included the following:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In March 2020, we decided not to proceed with an equity interest in the proposed Lake Charles LNG project. Energy Transfer will take over as the project developer.\n- \u25a0 In July 2020, the CrossWind consortium, a joint venture between Shell in the Netherlands and Eneco, was awarded the tender for the offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust (noord). Both companies have already taken their final investment decisions (FID) on the project. The consortium plans to have Hollandse Kust (noord) operational in 2023 with an installed capacity of 759 MW.\n\nThe following major milestones were reached in 2020:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In May 2020, we took a FID on a new LNG processing unit known as/uni00A0Train 7 at Nigeria LNG (NLNG).\n- \u25a0 In April 2020, we took a FID to develop the first phase of Arrow Energy's Surat Gas Project in Queensland, Australia. This decision will/uni00A0bring up to 90 billion cubic feet per year of new gas by the end of/uni00A0the decade, which will flow to Shell-operated QGC to be sold locally and exported through its plant on Curtis Island.\n- \u25a0 In August 2020, the tenth and final movable modular liquefaction system (MMLS) unit at the Elba Island export terminal in Georgia, USA, was delivered to the energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan.\n- \u25a0 In August 2020, the Blauwwind consortium, which is developing offshore wind projects in the Netherlands, achieved its first power.\n\nWe continued our divestment activities for selected assets during 2020, including:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In December, QGC Common Facilities Company Pty Ltd, a whollyowned subsidiary of Shell, announced it had agreed to the sale of a 26.25% interest in the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) Common Facilities to Global Infrastructure Partners Australia. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval in Australia and customary conditions. It/uni00A0is expected to complete in the first half of 2021.\n\nt",

It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market./uni00A0\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS\n\nIn 2020, oil markets experienced unprecedented developments in demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of 2020, global oil demand for the year was expected to grow by 1.2 million barrels per day (b/d). Then in January, oil demand started to contract because demand fell in China as lockdown was imposed to contain the virus outbreak. In subsequent months, oil demand contracted further as the outbreak in China evolved into a global pandemic and lockdowns were introduced across the world. In April, oil demand fell to its lowest level, around 22 million b/d below year-average demand in 2019, according to/uni00A0an estimate of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Contraction of such magnitude has never been recorded before. Country lockdowns deeply impacted transportation sectors, especially passenger road and/uni00A0passenger air in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies. In subsequent months, oil demand started recovering, but only partially, because resurgences of COVID-19 triggered re-imposition of social distancing and travel restrictions. By the/uni00A0fourth quarter, global oil demand was still estimated to be around 5.5/uni00A0million b/d below the 2019 level, according to the Oil Market Report published by the IEA in January 2021. Averaged for the full year, oil demand contracted by around 9 million b/d, or 9%, to 91.2 million b/d. Oil demand fell by 5.7 million b/d in OECD economies, and by 3.2 million b/d in non-OECD economies. By contrast, oil demand in 2019 was 0.8/uni00A0million b/d higher than in 2018.\n\nOn a daily average basis, Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, traded between $13 per barrel (/b) and $70/b in 2020, ending the year around $50/b. Brent crude oil prices averaged $42/b for the year, 34% (or $22/b) lower than/uni00A0in 2019.\n\nOn a yearly average basis, WTI crude oil traded at a discount of about $2.5/b to Brent crude oil in 2020, compared with $7/b in 2019. The discount narrowed from 2019 because falling US supply prevented bottlenecks in pipeline capacity from the landlocked Cushing storage hub/uni00A0to the US Gulf Coast. According to the US Energy Information Administration, US crude oil exports increased further to a yearly average of around 3.1 million b/d in 2020, up by 0.1 million b/d from 2019. This helped to ensure a narrow price differential between Brent and WTI./uni00A0\n\nGlobal gas demand is estimated to have declined by around 2.4% in 2020, in contrast with the 2.5% annual growth rate observed since the start of the century. The deterioration in gas demand for power generation and in industry was mainly caused by lockdowns related to COVID-19. Resilient gas demand for heating helped offset the overall decline. Demand declined across all regions except non-OECD Asia. In nonOECD Asia, demand grew in China, which experienced a robust recovery after mitigating the impacts of COVID-19. Outside China, aggregate gas/uni00A0demand in non-OECD Asia remained flat year-on-year.\n\nIn the USA, the natural gas price at the Henry Hub averaged $2.0 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2020, 21% lower than in 2019. It traded in a range of $1.5 to 3.2/MMBtu. In the earlier part of 2020, there was downward pressure on prices because of decreased demand from a/uni00A0mild winter, lower LNG exports and a weak domestic market caused by/uni00A0COVID-19. Supply fell because activity declined as producers cut investments and because lower oil production meant there was less associated gas. During the summer, prices found support from growing demand for gas that could generate power for cooling during the hotter months of the year. Later in 2020, demand strengthened because of storage ahead of the winter season and increasing US LNG exports.\n\nIn Europe, the average price at the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) in/uni00A02020 was 28% lower than in 2019. At the main continental gas trading hubs - in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany - prices were also lower, as reflected by weaker Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices. European gas prices were lower because of: the slump in demand in power generation and industry; robust supply of pipeline gas; well-filled gas storage inventories at the start of the year; and competition with renewables in power./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 38-40./uni00A0\n\n## PRODUCTION AVAILABLE FOR SALE\n\nIn 2020, production was 887 million boe, or 2,424 thousand boe/d, compared with 982 million boe, or 2,691 thousand boe/d in 2019.

        "page_content": "## UPSTREAM/uni00A0 continued\n\nThe decrease in liquids production was mainly caused by divestments, OPEC+ curtailment, higher maintenance and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico interrupting production. Increased production from ramp-ups and/uni00A0new field start-ups more than offset field decline. The decrease in gas/uni00A0production was mainly caused by divestments, lower demand from Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM) in the Netherlands, and/uni00A0the transfer of Rashpetco operations in Egypt from Upstream to Shell's/uni00A0Integrated Gas segment./uni00A0\n\nWe expect that oil production peaked in 2019. Going forward, we expect a gradual reduction in oil production of around 1-2% each year, including divestments and natural decline.\n\n## EARNINGS 2020-2019\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 were a loss of $10,785 million, which included a net charge of $6,447 million related to impairments, primarily in the US Gulf of Mexico, unconventional assets in North America, offshore assets in Brazil and Europe, and a project in Nigeria (OPL245), mainly triggered by/uni00A0revision of Shell's mid- and long-term commodity price and updated Appomattox sub surface understanding. Also included was a net charge of $782 million related to the impact of the weakening Brazilian real on a/uni00A0deferred tax position./uni00A0\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 were $3,855 million, which included a net charge of $1,930 million related to impairments, primarily in the US Appalachia unconventional gas assets and a drilling rig joint venture, partly offset by a gain of $1,609 million on sale of assets, mainly in Denmark and the US Gulf of Mexico./uni00A0\n\nExcluding the net charges described above, segment earnings in 2020 were a loss of $2,852 million, compared with a profit of $4,452 million in/uni00A02019. Earnings excluding the net charges were adversely impacted by/uni00A0lower prices and lower volumes, mainly driven by the unfavourable macroeconomic conditions as described in the business condition section/uni00A0and severe weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we made cost interventions by reducing the size of our contingent workforce and initiating an organisational review in line with Reshape.\n\n## EARNINGS 2019-2018\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 were $3,855 million, which included a net charge of $598 million as described above.\n\nSegment earnings in 2018 were $6,490 million, which included a net gain of $19 million. This included a net gain of $888 million on sale of assets, mainly related to our divestments in Iraq, Malaysia, Oman and Ireland, and a gain of $152 million related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives. These gains were partly offset by a charge of/uni00A0$561/uni00A0million related to the impact of the weakening of the Brazilian real/uni00A0on a deferred tax position, a net impairment charge of $350 million mainly related to assets in North America and deep-water rig joint ventures, and a charge of/uni00A0$90 million related to the release of historic currency differences./uni00A0\n\nExcluding the net charges described above, segment earnings in 2019 were $4,452 million compared with $6,472 million in 2018. Earnings excluding the net charge were adversely impacted by lower realised oil and gas prices, higher depreciation and higher well write-offs, mainly in Albania and Kazakhstan, partly offset by higher sales volumes associated with the timing of liftings.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure in 2020 was $7.3 billion, compared with $10.2/uni00A0billion in 2019. Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be/uni00A0around $8 billion in 2021.\n\nLower cash capital expenditure in 2020 was mainly driven by actions to preserve cash. The lower cash capital expenditure and capital investments in 2020 also reflected our continuing efforts to improve capital efficiency by pursuing developments which cost less./uni00A0\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\n- \u25a0 In Argentina, in January 2020, partnering with Equinor, we completed the acquisition of Schlumberger's 60% interest in the Bandurria Sur block, located in the Vaca Muerta Basin (Shell interest 30%).\n\nWe took the following key portfolio decisions during 2020:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, in August 2020, we took the final investment decision (FID) to/uni00A0contract the Mero 3 floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to be deployed at the Mero field within the offshore Santos Basin.\n- \u25a0 In Kazakhstan, in December 2020, we successfully settled a longrunning contractual dispute with the Republic of Kazakhstan government about the profit share between the parties in the Karachaganak joint venture. Shell paid $424 million as its share of/uni00A0the/uni00A0settlement./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 In Brunei, in March 2020, we completed the acquisition of deep-water exploration Block CA-1 (Shell interest 86.95%).\n- \u25a0 In Norway, in May 2020, partnering with Equinor and Total, we made a final investment decision on the Northern Lights carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. The project will involve the capture, transport and storage of carbon dioxide produced from industrial regions around the Norwegian continental shelf. Equinor is the operator of the project.\n- \u25a0 In Russia, with Gazprom Neft, we established a joint venture (Shell interest 50%) to explore and develop the Leskinsky and Pukhutsayakhsky blocks in the Gydan peninsula, in north-western Siberia. The deal was completed in November 2020.\n- \u25a0 In Russia, in April 2020, we cancelled our acquisition of the 50% participation interest in LLC Meretoyahaneftegaz from Gazprom Neft.\n- \u25a0 In September, we agreed to acquire seven exploration licences in four countries from Kosmos Energy. Suriname represents a new country entry for Shell. In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, we will deepen our position in two blocks and enter two others. In both Namibia and South Africa, we will expand our position in two blocks. Transfer has been completed in Suriname, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Namibia. South Africa is expected to complete in 2021.\n- \u25a0 In the US Gulf of Mexico, in March 2020, we acquired seven blocks across multiple plays in the Gulf of Mexico Lease 254.\n\nWe achieved the following operational milestones in 2020:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, Atapu 1, (the FPSO vessel P-70), came on stream and delivered first oil in June.\n\nWe continued to divest selected assets during 2020, including:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, we agreed to sell our 23% interest in the P-71 FPSO vessel, the/uni00A0deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021.\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, in June 2020, we sold a 30% interest in the Gato do Mato project in the Santos Basin. We are still the project operator, with a 50% interest.\n- \u25a0 In Canada, in August 2020, we completed the sale of our Tourmaline/uni00A0shares.\n- \u25a0 In Nigeria, we agreed to sell our 30% interest in oil mining lease (OML17). The deal was completed in January 2021.\n- \u25a0 In Canada, we agreed to sell our Duvernay shale light oil position in/uni00A0Alberta. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter/uni00A0of/uni00A02021.\n- \u25a0 In the USA, we completed the sale of our Appalachia shale gas position. The deal was completed in July 2020.\n- \u25a0 In Egypt, we agreed to sell our onshore assets in the Western Desert. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY\n\nOur subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are involved in all aspects/uni00A0of upstream activities, including such matters as land tenure, entitlement to produced hydrocarbons, production rates, royalties, pricing,/uni00A0environmental protection, social impact, exports, taxes and foreign exchange./uni00A0\n\nThe conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. In almost all cases outside North America, legal agreements are generally granted by, or entered into with, a government, state-owned company, government-run oil and gas company or agency. The exploration risk usually rests with the independent oil and gas company. In North America, these agreements may also be with private parties that own mineral rights. Of these agreements, the following are most relevant to our interests:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Lease agreements, which are typically used in North America and are/uni00A0usually governed by terms similar to licences. Participants may include governments or private entities. Royalties are either paid in/uni00A0cash or in kind./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Licences (or concessions), which entitle the holder to explore for hydrocarbons and exploit any commercial discoveries. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities, and is responsible for financing these activities. In/uni00A0principle, the licence holder is entitled to the totality of production less any royalties in kind. The government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company may sometimes enter into a joint arrangement as a participant, sharing the rights and obligations of the licence but usually without sharing the exploration risk. In a few cases, the state-owned company, government-run oil and gas company or agency has an option to purchase a certain share of production./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Production-sharing contracts (PSCs) entered into with a government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company. PSCs generally oblige the independent oil and gas company, as contractor, to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration, development and production activities in exchange for a share of the/uni00A0production. Usually, this share consists of a fixed or variable part/uni00A0that is/uni00A0reserved for the recovery of the contractor's cost (cost oil). The remaining production is split with the government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company on a fixed or volume/revenue-dependent basis. In some cases, the government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company will participate in the rights and obligations of the contractor and will share in the costs of development and production. Such participation can be/uni00A0across the venture or on a field-by-field basis. Additionally, as the price of oil or gas increases above certain predetermined levels, the independent oil and gas company's entitlement share of production normally decreases, and vice versa. Accordingly, its interest in a project/uni00A0may not be the same as its entitlement.\n\n## Europe Italy\n\nWe have a 39% interest in the Val d'Agri producing concession, operated by ENI.\n\nWe also have a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa producing concession operated by Total./uni00A0\n\n## Netherlands\n\nShell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM). A significant part of NAM's gas production comes from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which NAM holds a 60%/uni00A0interest. The remaining 40% interest is held by EBN, a Dutch government entity./uni00A0\n\nProduction from the Groningen field induces earthquakes that have damaged houses and other buildings and structures in the region. This has/uni00A0led to complaints and claims for compensation for damage from the local community. NAM is working with the Dutch government and other stakeholders to fulfil its obligations to the residents of the area. These obligations include compensating for earthquake damage./uni00A0\n\nSince 2013, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate (the Minister) has set an annual production level for the Groningen field, taking into account all interests, including residents' safety, security of supply in the domestic gas market and supply commitments in EU member states. The production level in the gas year 2019-2020 (ending October 1, 2020) was/uni00A08.7 billion cubic meters.\n\nIn June 2018, NAM's shareholders and the Dutch government signed a heads of agreement (HoA) to reduce production from Groningen and to ensure the financial robustness of NAM to fulfil its obligations. In the HoA, NAM's shareholders agreed not to declare dividends for 2018 and 2019. Dividend payments in 2020 and beyond will be made only if a solvency ratio of 25% is reached and maintained. In September 2018, detailed agreements were signed to further implement the HoA. As part of these agreements, Shell guarantees NAM's payment obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Dutch government in relation to earthquake-related damages and costs of/uni00A0strengthening houses, up to a maximum of 30%. This maximum equates/uni00A0to Shell's indirect interest in the Groningen production system./uni00A0\n\nIn conjunction with the HoA, it was agreed that NAM would cease all/uni00A0involvement in handling damage claims or strengthening buildings to/uni00A0make them safe. The Dutch government has stepped into these two roles and has developed legislation and policies to deal with earthquakerelated matters. One of the consequences of the legislation is that duty/uni00A0of/uni00A0care has shifted from NAM to the Dutch government. The Dutch government passes on to NAM the cost of the elements for which NAM is liable. There are escalation and arbitration options to settle any disputes.\n\nIn September 2019, the government issued an update announcing that it/uni00A0was able to reduce Groningen production faster, stopping production in/uni00A02022, eight years earlier than initially planned. Negotiations are ongoing between the government and the NAM shareholders regarding the compensation payable by the government to NAM in order to restore the balance of the package of arrangements laid down in the 2018 HoA. If no agreement can be reached on such re-balancing, NAM shareholders can go to arbitration to resolve the matter./uni00A0\n\nNAM also has a 60% interest in the Schoonebeek oil field and operates 25 other hydrocarbon production licences. Some of these are onshore and others are offshore in the North Sea./uni00A0\n\nt",

In this phase the partnership is governed by a collaboration agreement between Equinor, Shell and Total (equal partners).\n\nThe Nyhamna gas plant processes gas from the Ormen Lange field, 120 kilometres off the Norwegian coast.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UK\n\nWe operate a significant number of our interests on the UK continental shelf under a 50:50 joint-venture agreement with ExxonMobil. On February 24, 2021, ExxonMobil announced that it had signed an agreement with HitecVision (through its wholly owned portfolio company Neo Energy) for the sale of most of its non-operated upstream assets in the UK central and northern North Sea, including a number of interests subject to the Shell ExxonMobil 50:50 joint venture agreement. The sale, which ExxonMobil expects will close later in 2021, is subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. In addition to our oil and gas production from North Sea fields, we have various interests in the Atlantic Margin area where we are not the operator, principally in the West of Shetland area (Clair, Shell interest 28%), and Schiehallion (Shell interest 44.89%).\n\nIn 2020, new production came on stream in the Fram (Shell interest 32%), Shearwater (Shell interest 28%) and Pierce (Shell interest 92.52%) fields. We are a participant in the Acorn project, which is in its early stages and will involve carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen production (joint venture, Shell interest 25%).\n\nWe continued with decommissioning Heather assets and the Curlew FPSO, and continued Brent decommissioning. In June 2020 the Pioneering Spirit vessel safely completed the single-lift removal of the 17,000-tonne Brent Alpha topside from the North Sea. This was followed in August 2020 by the SSCV Sleipnir vessel safely lifting and removing the upper portion of the Brent Alpha jacket. Brent Alpha is the third of four platforms, after Brent Delta and Brent Bravo, to be decommissioned and removed from the Brent oil and gas field. In July 2020, the UK government approved the Brent Alpha decommissioning programme, including the derogation to leave in place the Brent Alpha steel jacket footings. A decision on the proposed derogations to leave in place each of the gravity-based concrete installations of Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie and/uni00A0Brent Delta is expected in the first half of 2021.\n\n## Rest of Europe\n\nWe also have interests in Albania, Bulgaria and Germany./uni00A0\n\n## Asia (including the Middle East and Russia) Brunei\n\nShell and the Brunei government are 50:50 shareholders in Brunei Shell Petroleum Company Sendirian Berhad (BSP). BSP has long-term oil and gas/uni00A0concession rights onshore and offshore Brunei, and sells most of its gas production to Brunei LNG Sendirian Berhad (see 'Integrated Gas' on pages 46-52), with the remainder (23% in 2020) sold in the domestic/uni00A0market./uni00A0\n\nIn addition to our interest in BSP, we have a 35% non-operating interest in the offshore Block B concession, where gas and condensate are produced from the Maharaja Lela field./uni00A0\n\nWe also have non-operating interest in a gas holding area for deep-water exploration Block CA-2 (Shell interest 12.5%), under a PSC. The exploration acreage in Block CA-2 was relinquished in 2020./uni00A0\n\nWe completed the acquisition of Total E&P Deep Offshore Borneo B.V. on/uni00A0March 31, 2020, and renamed the company Shell Exploration and Production Brunei B.V. The acquisition gives us an operator interest in the/uni00A0deep-water Block CA-1 (Shell interest 86.95%), under a PSC.\n\n## Iraq\n\nWe have a 44% interest in the Basrah Gas Company, which gathers, treats and processes associated gas that was previously being flared from/uni00A0the Rumaila, West Qurna 1 and Zubair fields. The processed gas and/uni00A0associated products, such as condensate and LPG, are sold to the/uni00A0domestic market. Any surplus condensate and LPG is exported.\n\n## Kazakhstan\n\nWe are the joint operator of the onshore Karachaganak oil and condensate field (Shell interest 29.3%), where we have a licence until the end of 2037. In December 2020, we successfully settled a long-running contractual dispute with the Republic of Kazakhstan government about the profit share between the parties in the Karachaganak joint venture. Shell paid $424 million as its share of the settlement.\n\nWe have an interest in the North Caspian Sea production-sharing agreement (Shell interest 16.8%) which includes the Kashagan field in the/uni00A0Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea. The North Caspian Operating Company is the operator. This shallow-water field covers an area of around 3,400/uni00A0square kilometres. Phase 1 development of the field is expected to lead to plateau oil production capacity of around 66 thousand boe/d (Shell interest) by 2021, with the possibility of increases/uni00A0after later phases of development.\n\nThe Pioneering Spirit vessel has now lifted and removed the topsides of Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo and Brent Delta.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This resulted in preliminary audit findings. The Company has determined it is probable that each uncertain tax treatment used in its income tax filings will ultimately be defensible, either during the next phase of the audit or on appeal to the courts. To/uni00A0date, no notices of additional assessments have been received.\n\nOffshore Sabah, we operate two producing oil fields. These are the Gumusut-Kakap deep-water field (Shell interest 29%), and the Malikai deep-water field (Shell interest 35%). In August 2020, we took FID on phase 3 of the Gumusut-Kakap project. The project involves drilling four subsea wells, (two oil producers and two water injectors), to enhance Gumusut-Kakap's expected recoverable oil volumes.\n\nIn October 2020, drilling started for phase 2 of the Malikai project. Phase/uni00A02 is expected to deliver first oil in 2021. We also have a 21% interest/uni00A0in the Siakap North-Petai deep-water field and a 30% interest in/uni00A0the Kebabangan field, both operated by third parties. We also have exploration interests in Blocks SB-J, SB-G, SB-N, SB-3G, ND-6 and ND-7./uni00A0\n\nOffshore Sarawak, in 2020 we were the operator of eight producing gas fields (Shell interest 30%-50%) and one field producing oil and gas (Shell interest 50%). Shell handed over interest and operations of the E11 field/ hub, one of the eight producing gas fields, to Petronas at the end of December 2020. After a binding heads of agreement (HoA) in December 2019 to extend the MLNG PSC, the PSC and joint operating agreement (JOA) were amended on November 16, 2020. Under the extended MLNG PSC, as of January 1, 2021, Shell (with 40% interest) will continue to be the operator of the F6 and F23 hubs and the producing E8, F13 East and F13 West fields. Shell will also continue to be the operator for new exploration acreage and new fields (F22, F27, Selasih)./uni00A0\n\nShell is also the operator for Block SK318 PSC (Shell interest 75%), which/uni00A0contains the discovered Rosmari, Marjoram and Timi fields.\n\nIn Block SK408 (Shell interest 30%), first gas was successfully produced from the Gorek field in May 2020 and from Bakong in June 2020. The/uni00A0block also contains the producing Larak gas field.\n\nFirst oil and gas for phase 2 of the E6 project in Malaysia is expected in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor SK308 PSC, first oil and gas for phase 2 of the E6 project is expected in 2021.\n\nFirst gas is expected from the Pegaga field in Block SK320 (Shell interest 20%) by the fourth quarter of 2021./uni00A0\n\nNearly all the gas produced offshore Sarawak is supplied to Malaysia LNG and to our gas-to-liquids plant in Bintulu. See 'Integrated Gas' on pages 46-52.\n\nShell has exploration interests in Block SK320. Exploration periods expired in June 2020 for Blocks SK318 and SK408, and in December 2020 for Block SK319. We also have a 40% interest in the amended 2011 Baram Delta enhanced oil recovery PSC, and a 50% interest in Block SK-307.\n\n## Oman\n\nWe have a 34% interest in the Block 6 concession and its operator Petroleum Development Oman (PDO); the Omani government has a 60% interest. PDO is the operator of more than 200 oil fields, mainly located in/uni00A0central and southern Oman, over an area of 90,874/uni00A0square kilometres.\n\nWe have a 50% interest in the Block 42 exploration and productionsharing agreement. Oman Oil (OQ) has the remaining 50% interest. Shell is the operator of Block 42, an area of 31,068 square kilometres. We have signed an exploration and production-sharing agreement that makes us the operator and gives us a 100% working interest in Block 55, an area of/uni00A07,564 square kilometres.\n\n## Russia\n\nWe have a 50% interest in Salym Petroleum Development N.V., a joint venture with Gazprom Neft that is developing the Salym fields in the Khanty Mansiysk Autonomous District of western Siberia. In March 2020, Salym Petroleum Development N.V. expanded its area of operations by acquiring a 100% interest in LLC Salymsky 2, holder of the licence for the/uni00A0Salymsky 2 block.\n\nShell and Gazprom Neft each have a 50% interest in the KhantyMansiysk Petroleum Alliance VOF partnership. Through this, Shell is a holder of 50% of shares in the JSC Khanty-Mansiysk Petroleum Alliance. Acquisition of the 50% participating interest in LLC Meretoyahaneftegaz from Gazprom Neft through the VOF was cancelled in April 2020. Since then, neither Khanty-Mansiysk Petroleum Alliance VOF partnership nor/uni00A0JSC Khanty-Mansiysk Petroleum Alliance has undertaken any significant activities.\n\nBecause European Union and US sanctions prohibit certain defined oil and gas activities in Russia, we have since 2014 suspended our support to Salym Petroleum Development N.V. and JSC Khanty-Mansiysk Petroleum Alliance in relation to shale oil activities.\n\nIn November 2020, Shell acquired from Gazprom Neft a 50% shareholding in LLC Gazpromneft-Aero Bryansk, which holds the Leskinsky and Pukhutsayakhsky licences on the Gydan peninsula. The joint venture will be managed by Gazprom Neft and Shell on a parity basis aiming to develop an exploration cluster in the north-eastern part of the Gydan Peninsula.\n\n## United Arab Emirates\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, we have a 15% interest in the licence of ADNOC Gas Processing.

SSPD holds a 31.3% interest in Al Furat Petroleum Company (AFPC), a Syrian joint stock company, which performs operations under SSPD contracts. In December 2011, in compliance with/uni00A0international sanctions on Syria, including European Council Decision/uni00A02011/782/CFSP, Shell suspended all exploration and production/uni00A0activities in Syria.\n\n## Rest of Asia\n\nWe also have interests in Kuwait, the/uni00A0Philippines and Turkey.

In August 2019, the Federal High Court ruled in favour of SPDC, affirming that it has fulfilled its obligations under the law for the renewal of OML 11. The court ordered the FGN to renew OML 11 for 20 years. In December 2019, the court refused to grant an application by the/uni00A0FGN to suspend the implementation of the judgement. The FGN appealed the court's decision and, in February 2021, the Court of Appeal granted a stay of the judgment in favour of FGN thereby suspending implementation pending a determination of the appeal on the merits. SPDC is taking various steps to protect its right to continue operating OML/uni00A011 pending a determination of the appeal.\n\nIn separate litigation, in August 2020, the Rivers State Government (RVSG) obtained judgment against SPDC. This judgement, by the Rivers State High Court, sought to reinforce the RVSG's purported purchase of SPDC's interest in OML 11. The purported purchase was said to have\n\noccurred through a court-auction sale arising out of the Ejema Ebubu (Ogoniland) community litigation. SPDC has appealed against the judgement of the Rivers State High Court.\n\nNotwithstanding the FGN appeal and the judgement in favour of the RVSG, SPDC continues to operate OML 11. In doing so, it is supported by/uni00A0the August 2019 Federal High Court judgement in its favour, which remains in force.\n\nSPDC supplies gas to Nigeria LNG Ltd (see 'Integrated Gas' on pages/uni00A046-52) mainly through its Gbaran-Ubie and Soku projects.\n\n## Offshore\n\nOur main offshore deep-water activities are carried out by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCO, Shell interest 100%). SNEPCO has interests in four deep-water blocks, three of which are under PSC terms: the producing assets Bonga (OML 118) and Erha (OML 133) and the non-producing asset Bolia Chota (OML 135). SNEPCO operates OMLs 118 (including the Bonga field FPSO, Shell interest 55%) and 135 (Bolia and Doro, Shell interest 55%) and has a 43.8% non-operating interest in OML 133 (including the Erha FPSO). Separately, SNEPCO holds a 50% non-operating interest in oil prospecting licence (OPL) 245 (Zabazaba, Etan) under a productionsharing agreement./uni00A0\n\nAuthorities in various countries are investigating our investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block. See Note 25 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages/uni00A0260-262./uni00A0\n\nSPDC also has three shallow-water licences (OMLs 74, 77 and 79) and a/uni00A040% interest in the non-Shell-operated Sunlink joint venture that has one/uni00A0shallow-water licence (OML 144)./uni00A0\n\nIn our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse conditions which could have a significant adverse effect on our operational performance, earnings, cash flows and financial condition (see 'Risk factors' on pages 28-37). There are limitations to the extent to which we can mitigate these risks. We carry out regular portfolio assessments to remain a competitive player in Nigeria for the long term. We support the Nigerian government's efforts to improve the efficiency, functionality and domestic benefits of Nigeria's oil and gas industry. We monitor legislative developments and the security situation. We liaise with host communities, governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote peace and safe operations. We continue to be transparent about how we manage and report spills, and how we deploy oil-spill response capability and technology. We implement a maintenance strategy to support sustainable equipment reliability and have begun a multi-year programme to reduce routine flaring of associated gas. See 'Climate change and energy transition' on pages 94-107.\n\n## Rest of Africa\n\nWe also have interests in Algeria, Mauritania, Namibia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia./uni00A0",

In August 2020, we announced the final investment decision to contract the Mero 3 FPSO vessel to be deployed at the Mero field. We agreed to sell our 23% interest in the P-71 FPSO, the deal is expected to be completed in the first/uni00A0quarter of 2021./uni00A0\n\n## Rest of South America\n\nWe also have interests in Suriname and Uruguay./uni00A0\n\n## TRADING AND SUPPLY\n\nWe market and trade crude oil from most of our Upstream operations./uni00A0",

This comprised of decreases of 614 million boe from Shell subsidiaries and of decreases of 72 million boe from the Shell share of joint ventures and associates./uni00A0\n\nAfter taking production into account, our proved reserves decreased by 1,972 million boe in 2020 to 9,124 million boe at December 31, 2020./uni00A0\n\n## SHELL SUBSIDIARIES\n\nBefore taking production into account, Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves decreased by 614 million boe in 2020. This comprised decreases of 7/uni00A0million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 664 million boe (3,848 thousand million scf) of natural gas and an increase of 57 million barrels of synthetic crude oil. The 614 million boe decrease is the net effect of a net decrease of 607 million boe from revisions and reclassifications, an increase of 88 million boe from extensions and discoveries, and a net decrease of 95 million boe related to purchases and sales of minerals in place. On January 15th 2021 Shell announced that the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) had completed the sale of its 30% interest in Oil Mining Lease (OML17) in the Eastern Niger Delta, and associated infrastructure. Proved reserves at end-2020 associated with this transaction were 26 million boe./uni00A0\n\nAfter taking into account production of 1,144 million boe (of which 40/uni00A0million boe were consumed in operations), Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves decreased by 1,758 million boe in 2020 to 8,222 million boe. In/uni00A02020, Shell subsidiaries' proved developed reserves (PD) decreased by/uni00A0872 million boe to 6,978 million boe, and proved undeveloped reserves (PUD) decreased by 886 million boe to 1,244 million boe.\n\n## SHELL SHARE OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES\n\nBefore taking production into account, the Shell share of joint ventures and/uni00A0associates' proved reserves decreased by 72 million boe in 2020. This comprised a decrease of 31 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and a decrease of 41 million boe (232 thousand million scf) of/uni00A0natural gas. The 72 million boe decrease comprises a net decrease of/uni00A073 million boe from revisions and reclassifications and an increase of/uni00A01/uni00A0million boe from extensions and discoveries.\n\nAfter taking into account production of 142 million boe (of which 7 million boe were consumed in operations), the Shell share of joint ventures and associates' proved reserves decreased by 214 million boe to 902 million boe at December 31, 2020./uni00A0\n\nThe Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PD decreased by 169/uni00A0million boe to 791 million boe, and proved undeveloped reserves (PUD) decreased by 45 million boe to 111 million boe./uni00A0\n\n- For further information, see \"Supplementary Information - oil and gas (unaudited)\" on pages 265-282.\n\n## PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES\n\nIn 2020, Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PUD decreased by 932 million boe to 1,355 million boe. There/uni00A0were decreases of 339 million boe due to maturation to proved developed - mainly 98 million boe in Brazil, 95 million boe in the USA and/uni00A0146 million boe spread across other countries. There were also decreases of 682 million boe due to other revisions resulting mainly from a/uni00A0combination of lower year average price and reductions in planned\n\ncapital expenditure (mainly in Australia (354 million boe), USA (121 million boe) and Brazil (100 million boe)), partly offset by net increases of 89/uni00A0million boe due to extensions and discoveries./uni00A0\n\nIn addition to the maturation of 339 million boe from PUD to PD, 75 million boe was matured to PD from contingent resources through PUD as a result of project execution during the year./uni00A0\n\nPUD held for five years or more (PUD5+) at December 31, 2020, amounted to 184 million boe, a decrease of 74 million boe compared with the end of 2019. These PUD5+ remain undeveloped because development either requires the installation of compression equipment and the drilling of additional wells, which will be executed when required to support existing gas delivery commitments (Russia), or will take longer than five years because of the complexity and scale of the project (Australia and the UK)./uni00A0\n\nThe decrease in PUD5+ during 2020 was driven mainly by changes in Jansz-Io (Australia) and Clair (UK)./uni00A0\n\nThe fields with the largest PUD5+ at December 31, 2020, were Lunskoye (Russia), Gorgon and Jansz-Io (Australia) and Clair (UK)./uni00A0\n\nDuring 2020, we spent $6.5 billion on development activities related to/uni00A0PUD maturation./uni00A0\n\n## DELIVERY COMMITMENTS\n\nWe sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit us to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, although some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below./uni00A0\n\nIn the past three years, we met our contractual delivery commitments, with/uni00A0the notable exceptions of Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, and Malaysia. In the period 2021-2023, we are contractually committed to deliver to third parties, joint ventures and associates a total of 7,490 billion scf of natural gas from our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. The sales contracts contain a mixture of fixed and variable pricing formulae that are/uni00A0generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery./uni00A0\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, we expect to meet our delivery commitments for/uni00A0almost all the areas in which they are carried, with an estimated 71.9% coming from PD, 5.5% through the delivery of gas that becomes available to us from paying royalties in cash, and 22.6% from the development of PUD as well as other new projects and purchases.\n\n## The key exceptions are:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Trinidad and Tobago (East Coast Marine Area and North Coast Marine Area), where PD for all fields fail the economic test at the yearly/uni00A0average price for natural gas. But we expect to cover 86% of/uni00A0our delivery commitments from existing developed resource volumes/uni00A0and/uni00A0new projects, resulting in an expected true shortfall of/uni00A0some 103/uni00A0billion scf; and/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 BG Egypt Development NOV: The government decision to divert gas from the offshore West Delta Deep Marine fields to domestic use has caused a tangible shortfall of 770 billion scf (83% of the promised gas delivery), expected to continue in the near future leaving LNG gas commitment mostly under force majeure;\n- \u25a0 In Malaysia, one of the third-party gas supply lines which was under maintenance has not been repaired during 2020. Force majeure has been declared, and no penalties have been incurred, resulting in an expected true shortfall of some 72 billion scf (54% of the promised gas/uni00A0delivery).",

        "page_content": "## OIL AND GAS INFORMATION/uni00A0 continued\n\n## EXPLORATION\n\nWe continue to focus and high-grade our portfolio of growth options.\n\n## In February 2020:\n\nWe acquired a 70% interest as operator of the UK Southern North Sea licences P2304 and P1929 which contain the Resolution gas discovery. Our appraisal programme consists of 3D seismic and a contingent appraisal well.\n\nWe added 4,553 square kilometres of exploration licences in the UK/uni00A0and/uni00A0Netherlands Southern North Sea across multiple plays.\n\nWe signed a farm-out agreement with Ecopetrol into the Colombia Offshore COL-5, Purple Angel, and Fuerte Sur blocks, as operator with/uni00A0a/uni00A050% working interest. Government ratification was obtained in/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nTwo exploration blocks, C-M-659 and C-M-713, awarded through Brazil's 16th National Petroleum Agency (ANP) bid round, were ratified. These Shell-operated blocks (Shell interest 40%) are located in the outboard Campos Basin and cover an area of around 1,800 square kilometres. The/uni00A0joint venture has a commitment to acquire 3D seismic in both blocks and to/uni00A0drill one well in Block C-M-659.\n\n## In March 2020:\n\nWe completed the sale and purchase agreement signed in October 2019/uni00A0for the acquisition of Total E&P Deep Offshore Borneo B.V. and all its interests in the deep-water exploration Block CA-1 (Shell interest 86.95%) production-sharing agreement (PSA). We assumed operatorship of Block CA-1, with a total area of around 5,800 square kilometres which is largely unexplored. The deal also gave us access to the Jagus East oil field which lies within CA-1.\n\nAn exploration and production-sharing agreement for Block 55 in the south-east of the Sultanate of Oman was ratified by Royal Decree. Oman Shell now has a 100% working interest and operatorship of Block 55, with a total area of 7,564 square kilometres. The agreement includes a work programme of regional studies, seismic acquisition and other potential exploration activities./uni00A0\n\nIn US Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 254, we acquired seven blocks across multiple plays in the US Gulf of Mexico./uni00A0\n\nIn July 2020, we signed a sales and purchase agreement for the Esenin deal, a 50% farm-in into two Gazprom Neft-held blocks on the Gydan peninsula in north-west Siberia, Russia. The deal was finalised in November 2020. The blocks cover an area of around 3,850 square/uni00A0kilometres.\n\nIn September 2020, Shell and Kosmos Energy executed a portfolio transaction under which Kosmos divested seven deep-water exploration licences to Shell across four countries: Suriname, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Namibia and South Africa. Suriname (Block 42) represents a new country entry for Shell with a 33.33% participating interest. In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Shell will expand its position in two blocks - (Block 6 by 25% working interest and Block 11 by 35% working interest) - and enter two others (10 and 13) with a 35% interest in both. In both Namibia and South Africa, Shell will deepen its position by 45% working interest in the two blocks, PEL0039 and NCUD. The agreement received all necessary regulatory approvals and third-party consents in December 2020, with the exception of South Africa which is expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n## In November 2020:\n\nWe agreed a farm-in transaction with CNOOC E&P Mexico, acquiring a/uni00A0participating interest (Shell interest 30%) in the deep-water round 1.4/uni00A0Block 4 exploration licence in the offshore Mexico Perdido. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nWe agreed a farm-in transaction with Impact Africa Limited to acquire a/uni00A050% participating interest in the frontier deep-water blocks Transkei/ Algoa (ER252) off the east coast of South Africa, with an area of around 46,000 square kilometres. Pursuant to the agreement, we will secure the operatorship from the counterparty. The agreement is subject to customary conditions including regulatory approvals.\n\nIn the delayed US Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 256 held in November 2020, Shell secured a further 19 blocks.\n\n## In December 2020:\n\nOur exploration presence in offshore Egypt was bolstered by entries into new blocks in the West Mediterranean and the Red Sea. For the West Mediterranean, Herodotus Block 3 North Ras Kanais (Shell interest 30%) was ratified in December 2020 with more than 4,400 square kilometres of acreage. Red Sea Block 3 (Shell interest 90%, operator) was ratified in December 2020 and covers more than 3,000 square kilometres in an under-explored area south of the Gulf of Suez. Some blocks have been awarded but are yet to be ratified; Red Sea Block 4 (Shell interest 63%, operator) and Herodotus Blocks 6 (North Marina, Shell interest 63%) and/uni00A07 (North Cleopatra Offshore, Shell interest 63%) all of which are awaiting government ratification.\n\nIn Brazil, we were awarded Block C-M-757 (Outboard Campos Basin)/uni00A0(Shell interest 100%) in the Permanent Offer Bid Round. This is/uni00A0awaiting ratification.\n\nIn total, the net undeveloped acreage in our exploration portfolio increased by around 9.4 million acres in 2020. The largest contributions were licence entries in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, the Sultanate of Oman, the/uni00A0Arab Republic of Egypt, Namibia and the Nation of Brunei. There were some relinquishments and divestments, with the largest being in Australia, Norway and Italy.\n\n- For further information, see \"Supplementary Information - oil and gas (unaudited)\" on pages 265-282.",

The products we sell include gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel, marine fuel, low-carbon fuels, lubricants, bitumen and sulphur. We also trade crude oil,/uni00A0oil products and petrochemicals. We provide access to electric vehicle/uni00A0charge points at home, at work and on-the-go, including at our/uni00A0forecourts and at a range of public locations./uni00A0\n\nOur Oil Products activities comprise Refining and Trading, and Marketing. These are referred to as classes of business. Marketing includes Retail, Lubricants, Business-to-Business (B2B), Pipelines and Low-Carbon Fuels (biofuels and renewable natural gas (RNG)). In Trading and Supply, we trade crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals to optimise feedstocks for/uni00A0Refining, to supply our Marketing businesses and third parties, and for/uni00A0our own profit. We also manage Oil Sands activities - the extraction of/uni00A0bitumen from mined Oil Sands and its conversion into synthetic crude oil. Our Oil Sands activities were previously reported under Upstream. As/uni00A0of/uni00A0January 1, 2020, they are reported under Oil Products./uni00A0\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS\n\nIn 2020, oil markets experienced unprecedented developments in demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of 2020, global oil demand for the year was expected to grow by 1.2 million barrels per day (b/d). Then in January, oil demand started to contract because demand fell in China as lockdown was imposed to contain the virus outbreak. In subsequent months, oil demand contracted further as the outbreak in China evolved into a global pandemic and lockdowns were introduced across the world. In April, oil demand fell to its lowest level, around 22 million b/d below year-average demand in 2019, according to/uni00A0an estimate of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Contraction of/uni00A0such magnitude has never been recorded before. Country lockdowns deeply impacted transportation sectors, especially passenger road and/uni00A0passenger air in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies. In subsequent months, oil demand started recovering, but only partially, because resurgences of COVID-19 triggered re-imposition of social distancing and travel restrictions. By the/uni00A0fourth quarter, global oil demand was still estimated to be around 5.5/uni00A0million b/d below the 2019 level, according to the Oil Market Report\n\npublished by the IEA in January 2021. Averaged for the full year, oil demand contracted by around 9 million b/d, or 9%, to 91.2 million b/d. Oil demand fell by 5.7 million b/d in OECD economies, and by 3.2 million b/d in non-OECD economies. By contrast, oil demand in 2019 was 0.8/uni00A0million b/d higher than in 2018.\n\nIndustry gross refining margins weakened in 2020 because demand for/uni00A0oil/uni00A0products was significantly reduced by the fall in economic activity and/uni00A0increase in travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. Demand for transportation fuels such as gasoline for passenger cars and kerosene for/uni00A0air transportation was hit particularly hard. During most of the second half of the year, mobility and the resulting demand for transportation fuels improved in some parts of the world, especially in China and South-east Asia. At the end of the year, new waves of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the Americas severely limited any global increase in demand for transportation fuels.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the new International Maritime Organization low-sulphur shipping fuel specification came into effect, limiting the sulphur content of maritime fuel to 0.5%. This had a limited effect on margins because of the economic slowdown in 2020 and because companies had/uni00A0prepared for the new regulations by building inventory in the second/uni00A0half of 2019.\n\nThe destruction of demand caused by COVID-19 led to industry idling some refinery capacity. Permanent refinery closures were also announced in 2020, but construction of new capacity did occur during the year, especially in the Middle East and Asia. /uni00A0\n\n## See 'Market overview' on pages 38-40./uni00A0\n\n## REFINERY UTILISATION\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2020, Shell discloses utilisation instead of/uni00A0availability to improve transparency on refinery production volumes. Utilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a percentage of/uni00A0the rated capacity.\n\nUtilisation was 72% in 2020, compared with 78% in 2019. Lower utilisation in 2020 was mainly because of lower demand and economic optimisation of sites./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "## OIL PRODUCTS SALES\n\nOil Products sales volumes decreased by 28% in 2020 compared with 2019 The decrease in sales volumes was largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic affecting Marketing volumes. There was also a reporting change effective from January 1, 2020 and certain additional Oil Products contracts held for trading purposes were reported on a net rather than a/uni00A0gross basis. This reporting change decreased sales volumes by 10%.\n\n## EARNINGS 2020-2019\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 came to a loss of $494 million, 108% lower than in 2019. Earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $6,489 million, compared with a net charge of $93 million in 2019 which is described at/uni00A0the end of this section./uni00A0\n\nExcluding the impact of the net charges, earnings in 2020 were $5,995 million, compared with $6,231 million in 2019. Marketing accounted for 76% of these 2020 earnings, Refining for -19% and Trading & Supply for 43%./uni00A0\n\nThe decrease in Oil Products earnings, excluding the net charge, was $236 million (4%) lower compared with 2019. This was driven by lower Refining and Trading margins (around $2,400 million), lower Marketing margins (around $600 million), partly offset by lower operating expenses (around $2,000 million) and other items mainly including tax movements (around $700 million).\n\nThe decrease in earnings of $236 million, analysed by class of business was as follows:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Marketing earnings were $135 million lower than in 2019, mainly driven by lower sales volumes due to the impact of the pandemic. This was largely offset by strong margins in Retail and Lubricants on account of/uni00A0better margin management, higher penetration of premium fuels and/uni00A0lower operating expenses./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Refining and Trading earnings were $101 million lower than in 2019, mainly because of lower realised refining margins driven by lower demand because of the pandemic and its effect on the economy. This/uni00A0was partly offset by higher earnings from crude and oil products trading and optimisation, lower operating expenses and favourable deferred tax movements./uni00A0\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $6,489 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 restructuring costs of $365 million (mainly shutdown of Convent, Bukom transformation and various initiatives across Oil Products);\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $5,530 million (across sites, reflecting revisions to medium- and long-term price outlook assumptions in light of: changes in supply and demand fundamentals in the energy market; macroeconomic conditions; the COVID-19 pandemic; expenditure at/uni00A0Pulau Bukom in Singapore including transformation; and the shutdown of the Convent refinery in Louisiana, USA;\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $552 million (mainly onerous contract provisions/uni00A0due to shutdown of Convent); and\n- \u25a0 a net charge of $101 million due to the fair value accounting of/uni00A0commodity derivatives.\n\nThese charges were partly offset by:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 net gains from disposal of assets of $59 million./uni00A0\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 included a net charge of $93 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 costs of $84 million relating to restructuring (various initiatives across/uni00A0Oil Products);/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $337 million (mainly expenditure at Bukom and/uni00A0other assets);/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 net charge of $66 million due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives; and/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $26 million (mainly provision for discount rate/uni00A0change).\n\nThe above were partly offset by:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 gains from one-off tax items of $91 million (tax rate changes in/uni00A0Alberta,/uni00A0Canada).\n- \u25a0 net gains of $329 million from disposal of assets; and/uni00A0\n\n## EARNINGS 2019-2018\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 of $6,139 million were 2% higher than in 2018. Earnings in 2019 included a net charge of $93 million described above. Earnings in 2018 included a net gain of $231 million, reflecting gains on/uni00A0disposal of assets of $273 million (mainly our Oil Products assets in/uni00A0Argentina and other smaller disposals), a net gain from fair value accounting of commodity derivatives of $224 million, gains from one-off tax items of $91 million (mainly corporate income tax rate changes in the Netherlands and the USA) and other net gains of $50 million (which included a one-off gain from the Ontario cap-and-trade scheme). These/uni00A0were partly offset by impairment charges of $309 million and/uni00A0redundancy and restructuring charges of $98 million.\n\nExcluding the impact of these items, earnings in 2019 were $6,231 million, compared with $5,794 million in 2018. Marketing accounted for 75% of these 2019 earnings, Refining for 4% and Trading & Supply for 21%.\n\nThe increase in Oil Products earnings, excluding the net charge, was $437/uni00A0million (8%) compared with 2018. The increase was driven by higher Marketing margins (around $500 million), benefit from foreign exchange (around $250 million) and the change in accounting policy IFRS 16 (around $140 million). This was partly offset by lower Refining and Trading margins (around $400 million) and other impacts resulting in a net charge of around $50 million. Marketing margins benefited from stronger unit margins. These were partly offset by lower earnings from Ra\u00edzen, the joint venture (Shell interest 50%) in Brazil, caused by adverse foreign exchange and lower fuel margins. Refining and Trading margins were lower than in/uni00A02018, mainly because of lower realised refining margins caused by adverse price variance across all regions, driven by lower global demand/uni00A0growth and an increase in worldwide refining capacity./uni00A0\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure (cash capex) was $3.3 billion in 2020, compared with $4.9 billion in 2019.\n\nCash capital expenditure in Refining and Trading decreased by $1.3/uni00A0billion/uni00A0mainly because of cash preservation initiatives (lower capital/uni00A0expenditure spends including turnaround deferrals). In Marketing, cash capital expenditure decreased by $0.3 billion as a result of cash preservation initiatives and reduced spending in US pipelines projects as/uni00A0they are nearing completion. Our cash capital expenditure is expected/uni00A0to be around $4-4.5 billion in 2021./uni00A0\n\nt",

This is part of our strategy to integrate our refining portfolio with Chemicals, resulting in approximately six high-value energy and chemicals parks, of which Bukom will be one. Bukom will/uni00A0switch from a crude-oil, fuels-based product slate towards new low-carbon value chains. Crude processing capacity at Bukom will/uni00A0be/uni00A0reduced by around half.\n- \u25a0 In August 2020, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, a subsidiary of/uni00A0Royal Dutch Shell in which we have an interest of 55%, announced that it will permanently shut down its Tabangao Refinery in Batangas City, Philippines, and convert it to a full import terminal.\n- \u25a0 In November 2020, we announced that we are shutting down the Convent Refinery in Louisiana, USA. Shell continues to assess market interest for the potential divestment of the asset during and after the shutdown, but does not intend to operate it in the future.\n- \u25a0 In January 2021, Shell signed an agreement to acquire 100% of ubitricity, a leading European provider of on-street charging for electric/uni00A0vehicles. The acquisition was completed in February 2021.\n- \u25a0 In January 2021, Shell reached an agreement with Postlane for the sale/uni00A0of A/S Dansk Shell in Denmark, which consists of the Fredericia Refinery and local trading and supply activities.\n- \u25a0 In January 2021, Shell announced the signing of commercial agreements to invest in Varennes Carbon Recycling, the first waste to/uni00A0low-carbon fuels plant in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Shell will have a 40% interest in the plant, which will use technology developed by Enerkem. The facility will produce low-carbon fuels and renewable chemicals products from non-recyclable waste. Commissioning of the first phase of the facility is scheduled for 2023.\n\n## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY/uni00A0 Refining and Trading Refining\n\nWe have interests in 13 refineries worldwide, (after converting Tabangao in the Philippines into a terminal and deciding in November 2020 to shut down Convent, in Louisiana, USA). We have the capacity to process a total of 2.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (Shell share, before it was announced that Bukom's crude capacity would reduce by around 200 thousand b/d). The distribution of our refining capacity is 46% in Europe and Africa, 33% in the Americas and 21% in Asia.\n\nShell's Refining business is transforming. We will further concentrate our/uni00A0refineries portfolio to meet our strategic aims and to capitalise on/uni00A0the/uni00A0strong integration between our customers, trading operations, chemical plants and, increasingly, our low-carbon fuels output.\n\nThe six sites expected to form our energy and chemicals parks include Deer Park and Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands, Rheinland in Germany and Pulau Bukom in Singapore,\n\nOur Bukom refinery will move from a crude-oil, fuels-based product slate towards new, low-carbon products. It will reduce its crude processing capacity as a result by around 200 thousand b/d sometime in July 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC) approved the transformation of the Tabangao refinery into an import terminal. Shell also/uni00A0decided to shut down the Convent Refinery in Louisiana, USA, starting the process in November 2020./uni00A0\n\n## Trading and Supply\n\nThrough our main trading offices in London, Houston, Singapore and Rotterdam, we trade crude oil, refined products, chemical feedstocks and/uni00A0environmental products. Trading and Supply trades in physical and financial contracts, lease storage and transportation capacities, and manages shipping and wholesale commercial fuel activities globally./uni00A0\n\nOperating in around 25 countries, with more than 125 Shell and joint-venture terminals, we believe our supply and distribution infrastructure/uni00A0is well positioned to make deliveries around the world./uni00A0\n\nShipping and Maritime/uni00A0enables the safe delivery of the Shell Trading and/uni00A0Supply contracts. This includes supplying feedstocks for our refineries and chemical plants, and finished products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel to our Marketing businesses and customers./uni00A0\n\nShell Wholesale Commercial Fuels provides fuels for transport, industry and heating. Our range of products, from reliable main-grade fuels to/uni00A0premium products, is designed to provide tangible vehicle and business/uni00A0benefits./uni00A0\n\n## Oil Sands\n\nSynthetic crude oil is produced by mining bitumen-saturated sands, extracting the bitumen, and transporting it to a processing facility where hydrogen is added to make a wide range of feedstocks for refineries. The/uni00A0Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) includes the Albian Sands mining and extraction operations, the Scotford upgrader and the Quest/uni00A0carbon capture and storage (CCS) project.\n\nWe have a 50% interest in 1745844 Alberta Ltd. (formerly known as/uni00A0Marathon Oil Canada Corporation), which holds a 20% interest in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Athabasca Oil Sands Project.

Overall margins, however, were broadly similar to those in 2019. The effect on chemicals depended on end use. Some sectors, such as automotive, were hit particularly hard, while others, such as packaging, showed robust demand. Chinese demand recovered relatively quickly because the virus was swiftly brought under control. Overall chemicals demand was not hit as hard as GDP. West European cracker margins were supported by the sudden fall in the price of crude oil in March and April. The fact that crude oil was at a lower price than in 2019 reduced naphtha feedstock costs, which reduced product prices. This in turn put pressure on US ethane cracker margins, although plentiful ethane supply helped counter the impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 38-40.\n\n## CHEMICAL PLANT UTILISATION\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2020, Shell discloses utilisation instead of availability to improve transparency on chemicals production volumes. Utilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a percentage of/uni00A0the rated capacity.\n\nChemicals manufacturing plant utilisation was 80% in 2020 compared with 76% in the full year 2019, mainly because of higher maintenance activities in Asia and Europe in 2019, and the impact of strike actions in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Netherlands in 2019.\n\n## CHEMICALS SALES\n\nIn 2020, Chemicals sales volumes were 15,036 thousand tonnes, which was 1% lower than 2019 sales volumes of 15,223 thousand tonnes due to/uni00A0lower demand.\n\n## EARNINGS 2020-2019\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 of $808 million were 69% higher than in 2019. Earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $154 million, compared with a net charge in 2019 of $263 million, which is described at the end of this section.\n\nExcluding the impact of these charges, earnings in 2020 were $962/uni00A0million, compared with $741 million in 2019.\n\nThe increase in Chemicals earnings, excluding the net charges, was $221/uni00A0million (30%) compared with 2019. This was driven by higher margins (around $130 million) because of a favourable price environment, lower operating expenses (around $50 million) as a result of various initiatives, and favourable tax movements (around $60 million) partly offset by other costs (around $20 million).\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $154 million.\n\nThis included:\n\n- \u25a0 costs related to restructuring of $38 million (various initiatives across Chemicals);\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $4 million;\n- \u25a0 net loss from disposal of assets of $1 million; and\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $115 million (mainly legal provision).\n\nThese charges were partly offset by:\n\n- \u25a0 a net gain from fair value accounting of commodity derivatives of/uni00A0$4/uni00A0million.\n\nSegment earnings in 2019 included a net charge of $263 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 loss of $11 million from disposal of assets;\n- \u25a0 net charges of $247 million (mainly legal provisions);\n- \u25a0 costs of $5 million related to restructuring; and\n- \u25a0 impairment charge of $4 million.\n\nThese charges were partly offset by:\n\n- \u25a0 gain from one-off tax items of $5 million (tax rate changes in Alberta,/uni00A0Canada).\n\nt",

Earnings in 2019 included a net charge of $263 million described above. Earnings in 2018 included a net charge of $192 million, reflecting impairment charges of $76 million, a net loss from disposal of $50 million, redundancy and restructuring charges of $2 million, and other net charges/uni00A0of $97 million (related to onerous contracts in connection with decommissioning the Stanlow site). These were partly offset by gains from/uni00A0one-off tax items of $27 million, (mainly corporate income tax rate/uni00A0changes in the Netherlands), and a net gain of $6 million from fair/uni00A0value accounting of commodity derivatives.\n\nExcluding the impact of these items, earnings in 2019 were $741 million, compared with $2,076 million in 2018.\n\nThe decrease in earnings, excluding the net charges, was $1,335 million (64%) compared with 2018. This was driven by lower margins (around $1,500 million), partly offset by lower operating costs (around $140 million) and the change in accounting policy relating to IFRS 16 leases (around $20/uni00A0million). Margins were impacted by lower realised base chemicals and/uni00A0intermediate margins and by higher maintenance activities in Asia and/uni00A0Europe, including the impact of strike action in the Netherlands in 2019.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure (cash capex) was $2.6 billion in 2020, compared with $4.1 billion in 2019.\n\nCash capex decreased by $1.5 billion, mainly because of lower spend on/uni00A0account of the COVID-19 pandemic impact in the construction of our/uni00A0cracker facilities in Pennsylvania and cash preservation initiatives. Our/uni00A0cash capex expenditure is expected to be around $3 billion to $3.5/uni00A0billion in 2021.\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- \u25a0 In the USA, in March 2020, we announced our intention to sell/uni00A0the/uni00A0Mobile site in Alabama.\n\nSignificant portfolio and business developments during 2020:\n\n## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY Manufacturing\n\nOur plants produce a range of base chemicals, including ethylene, propylene and aromatics, and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer, propylene oxide, solvents, detergent alcohols, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. We have the capacity to produce around 6.5/uni00A0million tonnes of ethylene a year. We are expanding our product portfolio to include sustainable chemicals, more intermediates and performance chemicals such as polyethylene and polycarbonate. We operate chemical plants worldwide and have a global balance of locations, feedstocks and products that allows us to seize commercial opportunities and get through cycles of lower margins.\n\nShell's Chemicals business is transforming and will be further integrated with our Refining business. In addition to our standalone, chemicals-only production sites, the six sites (Deer Park and Norco in the USA, Scotford in/uni00A0Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands, Rheinland in Germany and Pulau Bukom in Singapore) are expected to form our energy and chemicals parks. Growth will shift towards performance chemicals and recycled/uni00A0feedstocks.\n\n## Marketing\n\nIn 2020, we supplied more than 15/uni00A0million tonnes of petrochemicals to/uni00A0around 1,000 industrial customers worldwide. Products made from chemicals improve everyday life in health care, construction, transport, electronics, agriculture and sports. As global demand for chemicals increases, we plan to grow our business, by understanding and responding to our customers' needs.\n\n## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WITH SUDAN AND SYRIA Sudan\n\nWe ceased all operational activities in Sudan in 2008.\n\n## Syria\n\nWe ceased supplying polyols, via a Netherlands-based distributor, to/uni00A0private sector customers in Syria in 2018. Polyols are commonly used/uni00A0for the production of foam in mattresses and soft furnishings.\n\n## CHEMICALS DATA TABLES\n\nThe tables below reflect Shell subsidiaries and instances where Shell owns the crude oil or feedstocks processed by a refinery.

It/uni00A0comprises Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, self-insurance activities and headquarters and central functions. All finance expense and income and related taxes are included in Corporate segment earnings rather than in the earnings of business segments.\n\nThe holdings and treasury organisation manages many of the Corporate entities. It is the point of contact between Shell and external capital markets, conducting a wide range of transactions, such as raising debt/uni00A0instruments and transacting foreign exchange. Treasury centres in/uni00A0London and Singapore support these activities.\n\nHeadquarters and central functions provide business support in communications, finance, health, human resources, information technology, legal services, real estate and security. They also provide support for shareholder-related activities. The central functions are supported by business service centres, which process transactions, manage data and produce statutory returns, among other services. Most headquarters and central-function costs are recovered from the business segments. Costs that/uni00A0are not recovered are retained in Corporate.\n\n## EARNINGS 2020-2018\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 were an expense of $2,952 million, compared/uni00A0with $3,273 million in 2019 and $1,479 million in 2018.\n\nNet interest decreased by $89 million compared with 2019. This was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense following reductions in interest rates, partly offset by a reduction in interest income generated on cash balances. In/uni00A02019, net interest increased by $1,005 million compared with 2018. This was/uni00A0primarily due to the adoption of IFRS 16 and reduced capitalised interest.\n\nTaxation and other earnings increased by $233 million in 2020, compared with 2019 This largely reflected favourable deferred tax impacts due to the strengthening Brazilian real on financing positions and/uni00A0a reduction in Shell's share of financing expenses from joint ventures and associates, partly offset by a foreign exchange loss from adverse exchange rate movements. In 2019, taxation and other earnings decreased by $790 million compared with 2018, because of reduced tax/uni00A0credits from financing and one-off charges, and unfavourable exchange rate movements producing net foreign exchange losses.\n\n## SELF-INSURANCE\n\nWe mainly self-insure our risk exposure. Capital is set aside to meet self-insurance obligations (see 'Risk factors' on page 35). We seek to ensure this capital is at least as much as would be held in third-party insurance markets. Periodic surveys of key assets provide knowledge and/uni00A0best practices aimed at reducing exposure to hazards. Follow-up actions are monitored to completion.\n\n## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBER-SECURITY\n\nGiven our digitalisation efforts and increasing reliance on information technology (IT) systems for our operations, we continually monitor external\n\ndevelopments and actively share information on threats and security incidents. Shell employees and contract staff are subject to mandatory courses and regular awareness campaigns aimed at protecting us against cyber-threats. We periodically test and adapt cyber-security response processes and seek to enhance our security monitoring capability.\n\nGiven our dependence on IT systems for our operations and the increasing role of digital technologies across our business, we are aware that cyber-security attacks could cause significant harm to Shell in the form of/uni00A0loss/uni00A0of productivity, loss of intellectual property, regulatory fines and/or reputational damage. As a result, we continuously measure and, where required, further improve our cyber-security capabilities to reduce the likelihood of successful cyber-attacks. Our cyber-security capabilities are embedded into our IT systems, and our IT landscape is protected by various detective and protective technologies. The identification and assessment capabilities are built into our support processes and adhere to industry best practices. The security of IT services, operated by external IT companies, is managed through contractual clauses and additionally through formal supplier assurance reports for critical IT services.\n\nShell is frequently subjected to cyber-attacks and the pandemic in 2020 caused an increase in such activity. COVID-19 necessitated a switch from office to remote working, which changed and increased the attack surface. Shell's CyberDefence Team responded by enhancing cyber-security controls for remote connectivity, strengthening its monitoring/detection, and taking additional measures to improve cyber-awareness.\n\nIn 2020, malicious actors infiltrated several companies and government agencies through a supply chain attack via SolarWinds Orion software. They injected malware into an update that was distributed to SolarWinds' customers globally, allowing the actors to access SolarWinds systems and from there attempt to access other systems. Shell uses SolarWinds software. We detected the malicious SolarWinds applications in our environment, and/uni00A0isolated and removed them. No evidence has been found that any Shell/uni00A0systems were accessed by the attackers. Shell has followed the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's guidance to rebuild and/or patch affected systems.\n\nIn 2020, none of the cyber-security events led to known breaches of our business-critical IT landscape and, as such, did not result in any material business impact. When significant incidents happen, they are addressed through a robust incident management framework and, if needed, will result/uni00A0in appropriate follow-up actions, including notifications towards regulators. See 'Risk factors' on Page 33.\n\n## BRAND VALUE/uni00A0\n\nIn January 2021, Shell's brand value was estimated at $42.2 billion in Brand Finance Global 500 2021, the annual report by leading brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance. This was down 11% compared with 2020, but up/uni00A033% compared with 2016. According to the valuation the Shell brand remains the most valued in the oil and gas industry and the gap to second place widened from $761 million in 2020 to $4.7 billion in 2021. The report also showed that Shell's brand rating stayed at AAA, unchanged from 2020.",

        "page_content": "## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe manage our businesses to deliver strong cash flows to fund investment for profitable growth. Management's priorities for applying Shell's cash are first the reduction of net debt to $65 billion and, on achieving this milestone, distributing a total of 20-30% of cash flow from operations to/uni00A0shareholders. Remaining cash will be allocated to disciplined and measured capital expenditure growth and further debt reduction.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nDespite the weak macroeconomic and commodity price environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, Shell Group generated cash flow from operations of $34.1 billion and free cash flow of $20.8 billion in 2020. Through the course of the year, Shell took decisive actions (including reducing costs, rebasing the dividends and not continuing with the next tranche of the share/uni00A0buyback programme following completion of the seventh tranche) to increase liquidity and underpin the strength of the balance sheet, positioning the business to navigate the challenging environment and supporting long-term value creation. Reflecting mitigating actions taken, net debt decreased to $75.4 billion at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019:/uni00A0$79.1 billion). Gearing increased to 32.2% at December 31, 2020, compared with 29.3% at December 31, 2019 due to the reduction in equity mainly driven by lower earnings in 2020. Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 241-243 provides information on our debt arrangements, including net debt and gearing definitions.\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\n- \u25a0 a $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, with maturities/uni00A0not exceeding 270 days;\n\nWe satisfy our funding and working capital requirements from the cash generated from our operations, the issuance of debt and divestments. In 2020, access to the international debt capital markets remained strong, with/uni00A0our debt principally financed from these markets through central debt/uni00A0programmes consisting of:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 a $10 billion US CP programme, with maturities not exceeding 397/uni00A0days;\n- \u25a0 an unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 an unlimited Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme (also referred/uni00A0to as the Multi-Currency Debt Securities Programme); and\n\nAll these CP, EMTN and US shelf issuances are issued by Shell International Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, with its debt being guaranteed by Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company). We plan to file a new US shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 20-F./uni00A0\n\nWe also maintain committed credit facilities. The core facilities, totalling $10 billion, were extended in December 2020 with $2 billion now expiring in 2021 and $8 billion in 2025. Each facility includes a further one-year extension option at the discretion of each lender. Both remained undrawn at December 31, 2020. These core facilities and internally available liquidity provide back-up coverage for our CP programmes. In/uni00A0addition, in April 2020, to increase liquidity amid COVID-19-related uncertainties, Shell entered into a dual currency $7.2 billion and EUR/uni00A04.4/uni00A0billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2021, with two/uni00A0six-month extension options at our discretion. This facility remains undrawn. The extension options have not been exercised, and the facility will expire in/uni00A0April 2021. Other than certain borrowing by local subsidiaries, we do/uni00A0not have any other committed credit facilities./uni00A0\n\nOur total debt increased by $11.6 billion to $108 billion at December 31, 2020. The total debt excluding leases will mature as follows: 16% in 2021; 6% in 2022; 7% in 2023; 6% in 2024; and 64% in 2025 and beyond. The/uni00A0portion of debt maturing in 2021 is expected to be repaid from a combination of cash balances, cash generated from operations, divestments and the issuance of new debt./uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, we issued $6.3 billion of bonds under our US shelf registration and $6.7 billion equivalent under our EMTN programme. Periodically, for/uni00A0working capital purposes, we issued CP. We believe our working capital is/uni00A0sufficient for current requirements./uni00A0\n\nWhile our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign withholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations./uni00A0\n\n## MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK\n\nWe are affected by the global macroeconomic environment as well as financial and commodity market conditions. This exposes us to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk) and credit risk. See 'Risk/uni00A0factors' on page 34 and Note 19 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 251-255. The size and scope of our businesses require a robust financial control framework and effective management of/uni00A0our various risk exposures./uni00A0\n\nWe utilise various financial instruments for managing exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Our treasury and trading operations are highly centralised and seek to manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. Our portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. Other than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. Credit risk policies are in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness, and/uni00A0include detailed credit analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk. We/uni00A0maintain a committed credit facility. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.\n\n## PENSION COMMITMENTS\n\nWe have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks (see 'Risk factors' on page 32). We address key pension risks in a number of ways. Principal among these is the Pensions Forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in reviewing the results of assurance processes in respect of pensions risks. In general, local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans, with contributions paid based on independent actuarial valuations in accordance with local regulations. Our total employer contributions to funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans were $0.6 billion in 2020 and are estimated to be $1.6 billion in 2021 See Note/uni00A017 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 246-249.\n\n## Capitalisation table\n\n$ million\n\n|                                                           | December  31, 2020   | December  31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Equity attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders | 155,310              | 186,476              |\n| Current debt                                              | 16,899               | 15,064               |\n| Non-current debt                                          | 91,115               | 81,360               |\n| Total debt [A]                                            | 108,014              | 96,424               |\n| Total capitalisation                                      | 263,324              | 282,900              |\n\nt",

The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2019, compared with $53.1 billion in 2018, was mainly due to lower earnings and an unfavourable working capital impact./uni00A0\n\nCash flow from investing activities in 2020 was an outflow of $13.3 billion, compared with an outflow of $15.8 billion in 2019. The decreased cash outflow was mainly due to lower capital expenditure in 2020. The increased cash outflow in 2019 compared with $13.7 billion in 2018 was/uni00A0mainly due to lower proceeds from the sale of equity securities, partly/uni00A0offset by higher proceeds from sale of assets in 2019./uni00A0\n\nCash flow from financing activities in 2020 was an outflow of $7.2 billion, compared with outflows of $35.2 billion in 2019 and $32.5/uni00A0billion in/uni00A02018., due to lower dividends payments to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders of/uni00A0$7.4 billion (2019: $15.2 billion; 2018: $15.7 billion), net/uni00A0issuance of debt of $5.6/uni00A0billion (2019: $3.4 billion net repayment; 2018: $8.3/uni00A0billion net repayment), and lower repurchases of shares of $1.7/uni00A0billion (2019:/uni00A010.2/uni00A0billion; 2018: $3.9 billion)./uni00A0\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $31.8 billion at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: $18.1 billion; December 31, 2018: $26.7 billion)./uni00A0\n\n## CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe most significant factors affecting our cash flow from operating activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices for crude oil, natural gas and LNG; production levels of crude oil, natural gas and LNG; chemicals, refining and marketing margins; and movements in/uni00A0working capital./uni00A0\n\nThe impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends on: the extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market prices; the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax impacts; and the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow through into operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any particular period therefore provide only a broad indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings in that period. Changes in/uni00A0any one of a range of factors, derived from either within the industry or the broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing margins. The precise impact of any such changes depends on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; and the collective speed of response of refiners and product marketers in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region to region and/uni00A0from period to period./uni00A0\n\n## DIVESTMENT AND CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nThe level of divestment proceeds and cash capital expenditure in 2020/uni00A0and 2019 reflects our discipline, and focus on capital efficiency and/uni00A0cash preservation.\n\n## Divestment proceeds\n\n|                           | 2020   | 2019     | $ million 2018   |\n|---------------------------|--------|----------|------------------|\n| Integrated Gas            | 503    | 723      | 3,156            |\n| Upstream                  | 1,909  | 5,384    | 3,364            |\n| Oil Products              | 1,368  | 1,517    | 540              |\n| Chemicals                 | 26     | 22       | 1                |\n| Corporate                 | 205    | 225      | 3,405            |\n| Total divestment proceeds | 4,010  | 7, 8 7 1 | 10,465           |\n\nCash capital expenditure is used to monitor investing activities on a cash basis, excluding items such as lease additions which do not necessarily result in cash outflows in the period.

The Group may choose to return cash to/uni00A0shareholders through a combination of dividends and share/uni00A0buybacks.\n\nWhen setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro-environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of Shell Group, the current balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans, and existing commitments. We returned $7.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends in/uni00A02020./uni00A0\n\nThe fourth quarter 2020 interim dividend of $0.1665 per share will be payable to shareholders on the register at February 19, 2021. See Note 23 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 259. The Board expects that the first quarter 2021 interim dividend will be $0.1735 per share, representing an increase of around 4% on the fourth quarter 2020/uni00A0interim dividend.\n\n## PURCHASES OF SECURITIES\n\nOn July 26, 2018, the Company announced the commencement of a share buyback programme of at least $25 billion, subject to further progress with debt reduction and oil price conditions. On March 23, 2020, the Company announced that in light of the economic and oil price/uni00A0environment, it had decided not to continue with the next tranche of/uni00A0the share buyback programme following the completion of the tranche announced on January 30, 2020. On April 14, 2020, the seventh tranche/uni00A0of the share buyback programme was completed, and no/uni00A0further/uni00A0tranches were undertaken in 2020.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, 496 million A shares with a nominal value of \u20ac34.7 million ($41.8 million) and 39 million B shares with a nominal value of \u20ac2.8 million ($3.2 million) (6.85% of the Company's total issued share capital at December 31, 2020) had been cumulatively purchased and cancelled since the beginning of this programme, for a total cost of $15.8/uni00A0billion including expenses, at an average price of $29.45 per share.\n\nThis was in accordance with the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the Company to repurchase up/uni00A0to a maximum of 10% of its issued ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares (834 million ordinary shares), and at the 2019 AGM, to repurchase up to a maximum of 815 million ordinary shares, such authority to expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 21, 2020 and the end of the 2020 AGM. At the 2020 AGM, shareholders granted a renewal of this authority, to repurchase up to a maximum of 783 million ordinary shares, such authority to expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 19, 2021 and the end of the 2021 AGM. As at December 31, 2020, 783 million ordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM authority. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2018 to 2020 was to/uni00A0reduce the issued share capital of the Company.\n\nA new resolution will be proposed at the 2021 AGM to renew the authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to specified limits, for a further year. This proposal will be described in/uni00A0more/uni00A0detail in the 2021 Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\nShares are also purchased by the employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities (see the 'Other regulatory and statutory information' on/uni00A0page 185) to meet delivery commitments under employee share plans. All share purchases are made in open-market transactions./uni00A0\n\nThe table below provides information on purchases of shares in 2020 by the Company and affiliated purchasers. Purchases in euros and sterling are converted into dollars using the exchange rate on each transaction date./uni00A0\n\nt",

Sustainability is core to our project planning and operational activities. We aim to provide more and cleaner energy solutions in a responsible manner - in a way that balances short- and long-term interests, and that integrates economic, environmental, and social considerations into decision-making.\n\nToday, we continue to build on these foundations while driving change across the organisation to help society meet its most pressing challenges, including those related to climate change, the environment, diversity and inclusion, and human rights. We seek the views of various groups and individuals about the role of an organisation like Shell in addressing these/uni00A0challenges.\n\n## Sustainability reporting boundary and guidelines\n\nData in this section are reported on a 100% basis in respect of activities where a Shell company is the operator (unless noted otherwise). Reporting on this operational control basis differs from that applied for financial reporting purposes in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 216-264. Detailed data and information on our 2020 environmental and/uni00A0social performance are expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021./uni00A0\n\nWe use certain guidelines to inform our reporting on sustainability issues:\n\n- \u25a0 We report in line with guidelines developed by IPIECA, the global oil/uni00A0and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance.\n- \u25a0 As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, we support the organisation's updated criteria for/uni00A0membership from 2022, which includes requirements for corporate/uni00A0transparency.\n- \u25a0 The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) help to guide and inform our reporting. For more information, see the 'Climate change and energy transition' section.\n- \u25a0 In January 2021, we agreed to adopt the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, a set of environmental, social and governance metrics released by the World Economic Forum and its International Business/uni00A0Council.\n\n## OUR STRATEGY: POWERING PROGRESS\n\n- \u25a0 portfolio and disciplined capital allocation;\n\nIn February 2021, we announced our updated business strategy, called Powering Progress. It has four main goals in support of our purpose - to power progress together by providing more and cleaner energy solutions: generating shareholder value: growing value through a dynamic\n\n- \u25a0 achieving net-zero emissions: working with our customers and across sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions;\n- \u25a0 respecting nature: protecting the environment, reducing waste and/uni00A0making a positive contribution to biodiversity.\n- \u25a0 powering lives: powering lives through our products and activities, and/uni00A0by supporting an inclusive society; and\n\nPowering Progress is underpinned by our core values and our focus on/uni00A0safety. These include our commitment to doing business in an ethical and transparent way.\n\n- For more information on what we mean by becoming a net-zero emissions business, please refer to \"Climate change and energy transition\" on pages 94-107.\n\n## IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - HELPING COLLEAGUES, CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a serious impact on people's health and livelihoods around the world. During 2020, we worked hard to assist in the global fight against the virus, and to support recovery efforts while taking care of our employees, our customers and the communities we work with.\n\nIn January 2020, Shell set up our Global Health Alert Monitoring Team to equip Shell staff and companies with information and guidance to remain operational in a responsible way. Certain elements of this approach were adopted as the industry standard by the joint health committee of two acknowledged industry associations: the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), and IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance.\n\nMore information on the steps we took to protect our staff is expected to/uni00A0be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.\n\n## UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nThe UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address the world's biggest challenges, including ending poverty, improving health and education, making cities sustainable and tackling climate change.\n\nGovernments are responsible for prioritising and implementing approaches that meet the SDGs, but achieving these tasks will require unprecedented collaboration and collective action across businesses, governments and civil society.\n\nWe will play our part in helping governments and societies to achieve the SDGs. The goals were one of the considerations in the development of our Powering Progress strategy. Actions we take as part of our Powering Progress strategy can help directly contribute to 13 of the SDGs, while indirectly contributing to others. See our website shell.com for information on how Shell/uni00A0and our Powering Progress strategy are contributing to the SDGs.\n\n## BOARD OVERSIGHT FOR SUSTAINABILITY\n\nWe describe Shell's overall governance framework on pages 128-129. It/uni00A0provides information on the roles of the Board, its committees, and the Executive Committee. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) advises the Board on safety, environment including climate change, and Shell's overall sustainability performance. More information on the SESCo's role and activities during 2020 is provided on page 143-144.\n\nThe Annual Report on Remuneration (see page 170) provides details of how/uni00A0the Shell scorecard captures key performance indicators for safety, environment and climate.\n\n## SHELL GENERAL BUSINESS PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Shell General Business Principles set out our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and society. They set the standards for how we conduct business with integrity, care and respect for people, while seeking to protect the environment and establish mutually beneficial relationships with communities. All ventures that a Shell company operates must conduct their activities in line with our business principles.\n\nt",

Shell conducts an environmental, social and health impact assessment for every major project. We determine whether a project qualifies as major by considering its cost and capacity, including the potential consequences of/uni00A0adverse incidents. This helps us to understand and manage how our projects could affect the surrounding environment and local communities. We have standards and a governance structure to help manage potential impacts. We are committed to the safety of our people and contractors. The Shell HSSE & SP Control Framework (CF) specifies the standards for health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP) and the scope for applying these standards. The CF consists of a series of/uni00A0mandatory manuals that align with the Shell Commitment and Policy on/uni00A0HSSE & SP and the Shell Code of Conduct. They are supported by guidance documents and complemented by assurance protocols./uni00A0\n\nThe CF applies to every Shell entity and Shell-operated venture, including all employees and contract staff. The CF defines standards and accountabilities at each organisational level and sets out the procedures and processes that we require people to follow. We require that all significant HSSE & SP risks associated with our business activities are assessed and managed to make them as low as reasonably practicable. Our HSSE & SP functions provide expert advice and support for our businesses.\n\nThe Process Safety and HSSE & SP Assurance team provides assurance to/uni00A0the Board on the effectiveness of the HSSE & SP CF through an audit programme. The full Shell portfolio comprises about 200 organisational\n\ngroups covered by this programme. Audits are performed with a frequency of between three and five years, depending on the overall risk and complexity of a particular facility or organisational group. Overall, this results in a rolling five-year plan, with every annual plan being approved by the Board. On average, the assurance team conducts about 50 audits per year. The scope of the audits is designed to test risk areas as defined in the CF. This includes the overall HSSE & SP management system and specific requirements for areas such as personal safety, environment and contractor management. Based on audit outcomes, the audit frequency for an entity may be increased. Audit findings and action items/uni00A0identified are documented and tracked to completion by the relevant business.\n\nWe expect joint ventures not operated by Shell to apply standards and/uni00A0principles substantially equivalent to our own. We support these joint/uni00A0ventures in their implementation of these standards and principles, and/uni00A0we/uni00A0offer to assist them in their review of the effectiveness of their implementation. Even if such a review is not conducted, we periodically evaluate HSSE & SP risks faced by the ventures that we do not operate. If/uni00A0one of these joint ventures does not meet our HSSE & SP expectations, we seek to improve performance by working with our partners to develop/uni00A0and implement remedial action plans./uni00A0\n\nShell aims to work with suppliers that behave in a safe, economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner. Our approach to suppliers is set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles. These cover expectations in areas such as business integrity, health and safety, environment, and human rights.",

        "page_content": "## SAFETY\n\nA focus on safety is one of the pillars that supports our Powering Progress strategy. We build and operate our facilities with the aim of preventing incidents that may damage or harm our employees, contract staff, nearby communities, the environment or our assets. We strive to help improve safety throughout the energy industry by sharing our safety standards and/uni00A0experience with other operators, contractors and professional organisations, including the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) and the Energy Institute./uni00A0\n\nSafety risks are managed across our businesses through the use of standards, controls and compliance systems. We combine this with a culture of care and an ambition to learn and continually improve. We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any incident.\n\nOur standards also apply to any joint ventures we operate. We seek to/uni00A0improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal, process and transport. We require and assure ourselves that people responsible for tasks involving a significant safety hazard have the necessary training, skills and/uni00A0competencies. We also take human performance into account when deciding how to approach safety. This means that in order to minimise the/uni00A0risk of people being harmed, we seek to optimise the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes interact.\n\nWe employ many contractors and we work with them so that they understand our safety requirements. Together we seek to improve safety performance by building skills and expertise, and by creating an inclusive and safe work environment. We expect everyone working for us to comply with our mandatory Life-Saving Rules which set out simple \"do's/uni00A0and don'ts\" for activities with the highest potential safety risks. Employees are expected to discuss, coach and intervene so that everyone understands how the rules apply to a particular work task. If employees break these rules, we seek to understand why, but individuals may face disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment if they do not follow the Life-Saving Rules. If contract staff break the Life-Saving Rules, they can be removed from the worksite./uni00A0\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated new kinds of risk assessments beyond those that are normally conducted in our industry. The results led/uni00A0to us adopting extra measures to take care of our employees, our contractors, our customers and the communities we work with. We identified potential impacts beyond our local operations, and we continue/uni00A0to work hard to help the global fight against the virus and/uni00A0to/uni00A0support recovery efforts.\n\nWe took many practical steps to protect the health of our staff, including requiring or encouraging office-based staff to work from home, based on the advice of local authorities. From March 2020, the average occupancy rate of our 18 largest offices fell to around 10% for the rest of the year. Our information technology (IT) teams ensured that thousands of people could work from home each day. At the same time, measures were taken to protect colleagues' health where operations had to be maintained by/uni00A0staff/uni00A0on sites. We created a wide range of tools and resources which also addressed potential mental, physical and social health issues. For example, we set up a programme called Care for Self to encourage staff/uni00A0to/uni00A0pay/uni00A0attention to their physical and mental well-being, and to support them/uni00A0as they did so.\n\n## Safety strategy\n\nIn 2019, the Board and the Executive Committee spent considerable time reflecting on the worrying safety performance, measured by the number of fatalities, and what needed to change across Shell to prevent fatalities and all other serious incidents. This included conducting a full review of/uni00A0Shell's safety approach, which covered the effectiveness of current preventative tools, such as the Life-Saving Rules and Goal Zero ambition.\n\nWe have made progress in improving the safety of operations since the/uni00A0early 2000s. This was largely because of a stronger safety culture, guided by our Goal Zero ambition to achieve no harm and no leaks, more/uni00A0effective standards, and requirements such as the Life-Saving Rules. In recent years the vast majority of fatalities had no link to a breach of the/uni00A0Life-Saving Rules. Sadly, we have been unable to eliminate all fatal incidents involving Shell employees and contractors.\n\nIn 2020, we started what is expected to be a multi-year effort to refresh our approach to safety. The purpose is to avoid life-changing injuries and fatalities by building on existing strong foundations. We aim to achieve this with an increased and deliberate focus on human performance. We recognise that people are key to executing complex tasks and to finding solutions to problems. We call the belief that we can always improve, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes and successes, and speak up without being punished a learner mindset. We seek to create conditions that encourage employees and contractors to share ideas and concerns without fear of rejection or punishment. In addition to specific training, events like our annual Safety Day 2020 provided Shell teams and contractors with the chance to reflect on this concept.\n\nWe are now building on our current approach to safety with a more consistent focus on the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes all interact. The majority of our fatalities over the last five years were down to the complex interaction between these elements. We aim to better understand the gap between how we anticipate work will be done safely and how the work is actually carried out. We continue to work to prevent incidents by maintaining safety barriers and providing training. We/uni00A0acknowledge that people make mistakes and not all incidents may be preventable. As a result, we started to focus more on how people can 'fail safely', and on their response in the moment to avoid the risk of a serious injury. This approach is a change of philosophy, put into practice by improving processes for planning and completing work, and debriefing afterwards. In 2020, tangible changes were piloted and deployed for application by employees and contractors. For example, in 2020, we used earlier experience with drones, remote sensing technology, robots and digital technology, such as augmented reality, as lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the movement of people. This technology enabled us to carry out more remote monitoring and to continue to assure data to meet safety and environmental performance reporting standards.\n\n## Personal and process safety\n\nWe continue to strengthen the safety culture and leadership among our/uni00A0employees and contract staff. This aligns with our focus on caring for/uni00A0people. Our safety goal is to achieve no harm and no leaks across all/uni00A0Shell company operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition./uni00A0\n\nWe expect everyone to consider two aspects of their tasks: the hazards that could potentially cause serious harm, and the effectiveness of the barriers in place to avoid serious harm if an incident occurs. In addition to/uni00A0our ongoing safety awareness programmes, we hold an annual global Safety Day to give employees and contractors time to reflect on how to prevent incidents. During Safety Day 2020, we asked all our staff and contractors to reflect on the importance of showing care for each other and ensuring that we are in control of risks with robust barriers in place, particularly under the current challenges of the pandemic. More information on how we implement these measures is expected to be/uni00A0published in our Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.\n\nProcess safety management is about keeping hazardous substances inside pipes, tanks and vessels, and ensuring that well fluids are contained during well construction and well intervention so that they do not harm people or the environment. It starts at the design and construction stage of projects and continues throughout the life cycle of facilities to ensure they are safely operated, well maintained and regularly inspected.

For example, to mitigate the risk of an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons, offshore wells are to be designed with at least two independent barriers in the direction of flow. We regularly inspect, test and maintain these barriers to ensure they meet our standards. In the event of a loss of containment such as a spill or a leak, our standards require the use of independent recovery measures to stop the release from becoming catastrophic. This system of barriers and recovery measures is called a 'bow-tie', a model that visually represents a system where personal and process safety hazards are managed through prevention and response barriers./uni00A0\n\nWe have embedded a set of process safety fundamentals to strengthen barriers that involve critical safety tasks carried out by frontline staff. These fundamentals provide guidelines for good operating practice that should prevent unplanned releases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe routinely prepare and practise our emergency response to potential incidents such as a spill or a fire. This involves working closely with local services and regulatory agencies to jointly test our plans and procedures. These tests continually improve our readiness to respond. If an incident does occur, we have procedures to reduce the impact on people and the environment./uni00A0\n\n## Transport safety\n\nTransporting large numbers of people, products and equipment by road, rail, sea and air poses safety risks. We seek to reduce these risks by developing best-practice standards within Shell. We also work with specialist contractors, industry bodies, NGOs and governments to find/uni00A0ways of reducing transport safety risks.\n\nShell employees and contractors drove a combined distance of around 470 million kilometres on business in 2020 in over 50 countries. We run/uni00A0road safety programmes that promote safe driving techniques and behaviour in a number of countries where we operate, for example in India, Malaysia, and the UK. We require everyone driving more than 7,500 kilometres a year on Shell company business on public roads and/uni00A0those who drive in countries with higher road safety risks to take a defensive driving course. We also run an annual online defensive driving course for all who drive on public roads while on Shell company business. Fatigue is one of the most significant risks when on the road. In 2020, at the Shell-operated QGC facility in Queensland, Australia, we worked with four universities and eight contracting companies to evaluate fatigue detection devices and to find the one that performed best in testing. The collaboration was the largest of its kind and involved evaluating around 100 devices on long stretches of Australia's road network. As a result, we aim to start introducing recommended devices in Malaysia in 2021.\n\nWe also work to improve general road safety in several communities and countries where we operate, through organisations such as the Global Road Safety Partnership. For example, in India, we continue our road safety campaign which includes eye testing of third-party professional drivers. In 2020, around 20,000 Shell employees and contractors completed such testing.\n\n## Safety performance\n\nIn 2020, despite the unprecedented challenges faced, Shell and its contractor partners had the safest year that we have ever experienced. It/uni00A0was the first year with zero fatal injuries, and also the best ever process safety performance at ventures operated by Shell. Tragically, two contractors died after they caught COVID-19 during the course of their/uni00A0work for Shell.\n\nOur Total Recordable Case Frequency (injuries per million working hours) was 0.7 in 2020, compared with 0.9 in 2019. There were 103 operational Tier 1 and 2 process safety events in 2020, compared with 130 in 2019. Detailed information on our 2020 safety performance is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.\n\nFrom 2021, the Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF) will be replaced on the Group scorecard by Serious Incidents and Fatalities Frequency (SIF-F). The new metric reflects the number of serious incidents and fatalities per 100 million working hours. The Executive Committee and the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) have endorsed the change. Several industry safety leadership groups confirm that root causes for serious and high-potential incidents are often different from the majority of lower-consequence events. Shell's shift is intended to help focus attention on improving its safety systems, and it targets the prevention of life-altering injuries, which aligns with the emphasis on human performance and Goal Zero. We will continue to report on TRCF/uni00A0for benchmarking purposes.\n\nWe require incidents to be investigated so we can understand the underlying causes, including technical, behavioural, organisational and human factors. We share learnings and implement mitigations at the site and in the country and business where the incident occurred. We seek to turn incident findings into improved standards or better ways of working that can be applied widely across similar Shell facilities. This is part of embedding the learner mindset approach across the organisation and engaging with contractors to share these learnings.\n\nFor example, in 2020, we continued to implement learnings from a tragic roll-over incident that occurred in Pakistan in 2017 and which was not under our operational control. Pakistan continues to be among the countries with the highest risks for road transport. The investigation offered several learnings. Our focus has now moved from technical standards to driver professionalism, including aspects such as fitness to work, training and coaching on the job. One of the most significant risks when on the road is fatigue. Shell Pakistan Limited is managing this through the creation/uni00A0of enhanced awareness for this topic, reduced duty hours and/uni00A0better rest/uni00A0facilities.\n\nIn 2021, Shell will take a further step to focus our efforts to enhance safety. We will transition from applying our 12 Life-Saving Rules to using the simplified set of nine Life-Saving Rules of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP). A common approach across the industry makes working within the supply chain easier and can accelerate the adoption of safety measures.",

Now we are stepping up our environmental ambitions and shaping them to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOur environmental ambitions include protecting and enhancing biodiversity - the plant and animal life that is vital for the planet. We are/uni00A0also focusing on using water and other resources more efficiently across all our activities, reusing as much of them as we can.\n\nWe are reducing waste from our operations and increasing recycling of/uni00A0plastics. We are helping to improve air quality by reducing emissions from our operations and providing cleaner ways to power transport and/uni00A0industry. Working with our partners and suppliers and developing new collaborations is key. We will join with others across industry, governments, our customers and supply chains to protect nature.\n\nIn February 2021, we launched our new environmental framework which focuses on four priority areas: biodiversity, water, circular economy and waste, and air quality. We have set environmental ambitions for 2030 and/uni00A0later, as well as shorter-term goals:\n\n- \u25a0 By 2030, we will increase the amount of recycled plastic in our packaging to 30% and ensure that the packaging we use for our products is reusable or recyclable.\n- \u25a0 We will reduce the amount of fresh water consumed in our facilities, starting by reducing fresh-water consumption by 15% by 2025 compared with 2018 levels in areas where there is high pressure on/uni00A0fresh-water resources.\n- \u25a0 We are aiming for zero waste by increasing reuse and recycling in/uni00A0our/uni00A0business and supply chains.\n- \u25a0 We will demonstrate an overall positive impact on biodiversity from our/uni00A0new projects in areas rich in biodiversity, called critical habitats. This will include investing in conservation and taking steps to safeguard/uni00A0and, where possible, enhance local environments.\n\nWe will continue to look for opportunities to go further and will report our/uni00A0progress in a transparent way. We use external standards and guidelines, such as those developed by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, to inform our approach. We follow/uni00A0global environmental standards for managing our emissions and/uni00A0discharges, for conserving biodiversity, and for minimising our water/uni00A0use/uni00A0and impact on water resources.\n\nShell's global environmental standards cover our environmental performance. They include details of how to manage emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), consume energy more efficiently, reduce gas/uni00A0flaring, prevent spills and leaks of hazardous materials, use less fresh/uni00A0water and conserve biodiversity. We seek to apply our global environmental standards wherever we operate. When planning new major projects, we conduct detailed environmental, social and health impact assessments./uni00A0\n\n- See also 'Control Framework' on page 86, more information on how/uni00A0we manage our GHG emission in 'Climate change and energy transition' on page 106, and read about our new environmental framework on our website shell.com.\n\nWe believe some areas are too sensitive to enter. Therefore, we made the commitment that we will not explore for or develop oil and gas resources in natural and/or cultural World Heritage Sites.\n\nWe aim to minimise the impact of our projects on biodiversity and ecosystems by applying the mitigation hierarchy, a decision-making framework that involves a sequence of four key actions: avoid, minimise, restore and offset. We first aim to avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Where our operations have affected biodiversity and communities that rely on biodiversity for their livelihoods, we seek to help restore damaged habitats. We also look for opportunities to make a positive contribution to conservation, also known as a net-positive impact (NPI). For example, to offset and compensate for clearing vegetation and habitat while developing gas resources, the Shell-operated QGC gas project in Australia manages the Valkyrie property, an area with a rich ecosystem. We monitor and measure the impact and seek ways to improve the mitigation strategy.\n\nManaging our impacts on water and ensuring the availability of fresh water is a growing challenge in some parts of the world. Increasing demand for water resources, growing stakeholder expectations and concerns, and water-related legislation may reduce the access to water for our operations. We manage water use carefully, and tailor our use of fresh water to local conditions and requirements. We sometimes use alternatives to fresh water in our operations. These include water that has been recycled from our operations, processed sewage water and desalinated water. For example, the QGC project in Australia produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) from natural gas in a water-scarce region of the Surat Basin in Queensland. Water is produced as a natural by-product during the extraction of gas. Two water plants treat the produced water so that it is suitable for use by local farmers, industry and town water suppliers. We require that all Shell company facilities and projects are assessed to see what risks they might pose to water availability. In places where water is scarce, we develop water-management action plans for using less fresh water, increasing water recycling and closely monitoring water use.\n\nIn 2020, our intake of fresh water was 171 million cubic metres, compared with 192 million cubic metres in 2019. The reduction was partly because of/uni00A0divestments in Canada and the USA. Around 90% of our fresh water intake was used for manufacturing oil products and chemicals, with the rest mainly used for oil and gas production. Around 35% of fresh water intake was from public utilities, such as municipal water supplies, with the rest taken from surface water such as rivers and lakes (around 55%) and groundwater (around 10%).\n\nDetailed information on our 2020 environmental performance is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021./uni00A0\n\n- See 'Climate change and energy transition' on page 106 for more information on how we manage our GHG emissions./uni00A0\n\n## SPILLS\n\nLarge spills of crude oil, oil products and chemicals associated with our operations can harm the environment, and result in major clean-up costs, fines and other damages. They can also affect our licence to operate and harm our reputation./uni00A0\n\nWe have requirements and procedures designed to prevent spills. We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention of avoiding spills. To further reduce the risk of spills, Shell has routine programmes to reduce failures and maintain the reliability of facilities and pipelines. Our/uni00A0business units are responsible for organising and executing spill responses in line with Shell guidelines and relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Our offshore installations have spill response plans for when/uni00A0an incident occurs. These plans set out response strategies and techniques, available equipment, and trained personnel and contracts. We can engage specialist contracted services for oil-spill response, including vessels, aircraft or other equipment and resources, if required, for/uni00A0large spills. We conduct regular exercises that seek to ensure these plans remain effective and fit for purpose./uni00A0\n\nt",

The onshore response plans also provide for the initial assessment of incidents and the mobilisation of resources to manage them. In the event of spills on land, businesses are supported by our global Soil & Groundwater team which reviews and implements appropriate remedies./uni00A0The global Soil & Groundwater Team is engaged throughout the life cycle of our assets./uni00A0For example, during acquisition and divestment of assets, the team conducts due diligence to identify land contamination liabilities./uni00A0Through research and development initiatives, the team collaborates with regulators in developing, modifying, and applying sustainable remediation techniques./uni00A0\n\nSpills still occur for reasons such as operational failure, accidents or unusual corrosion. In 2020, there were 68 operational spills of more than 100 kilograms compared with 67 in 2019. The weight of operational spills of oil/uni00A0and oil products in 2020 was 0.4 thousand tonnes, compared with 0.2/uni00A0thousand tonnes in 2019. At the time of publication of this Report, there were/uni00A0four spills under investigation in Nigeria that may result in adjustments.\n\n## Spills in Nigeria\n\nIn the Niger Delta, over the last 10 years, the total number of operational hydrocarbon spills and the volume of oil spilled from them into the environment have been significantly reduced.\n\nMost oil spills in Nigeria's Niger Delta region continue to be caused by crude oil theft or sabotage of oil and gas production facilities, and by illegal oil refining, including the distribution of illegally refined products.\n\nIn 2020, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) managed to reduce the number of operational spills of more than/uni00A0100 kilograms to around 0.02 thousand tonnes of crude oil (10/uni00A0incidents) compared with around 0.03 thousand tonnes of crude oil/uni00A0(seven/uni00A0incidents) in 2019. This was a year-on-year reduction in operational/uni00A0spills of one-third by weight.\n\nTo reduce the number of operational spills, SPDC has an ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain and replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines. Over the last nine years, about 1,330 kilometres of pipelines and flow lines have been replaced. This is organised through a/uni00A0pipeline and flow line integrity management system that proactively addresses pipeline integrity. It puts barriers in place where necessary, and/uni00A0recommends when and where pipeline sections should be replaced to prevent failures. In 2018, this integrity management system was enhanced to manage threats arising from frequent pipeline sabotage or vandalism.\n\n## Spills caused by sabotage reduced in 2020\n\nIn 2020, about 90% oil spills of more than 100 kilograms from the SPDC joint venture's facilities were caused by the illegal activities of third parties. In 2020, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 100 kilograms caused\n\nby sabotage was 1.4 thousand tonnes (122 incidents), compared with 2.3/uni00A0thousand tonnes (156 incidents) in 2019. The decrease in incidents and/uni00A0volumes was because of improved security and surveillance, including/uni00A0community-based pipeline surveillance.\n\nSPDC continues to undertake initiatives to prevent and reduce spills caused by theft from or sabotage of its facilities in the Niger Delta. In 2020, SPDC continued on-ground surveillance of its areas of operation, including its pipeline network, to mitigate third-party interference and ensure that spills are detected and responded to as quickly as possible.\n\nThere are also daily overflights of the most vulnerable segments of the pipeline network to identify any new spills or illegal activity. SPDC has also introduced anti-theft protection mechanisms for key infrastructure such as wellheads and manifolds. The programme to protect wellheads with steel cages continues to help deter theft.\n\nBy the end of 2020, 364 cages had been installed. including 73 cages upgraded with CCTV. Only 15 breaches were successful out of 1,706 registered attempts.\n\n## Faster response and remediation\n\nIrrespective of the cause, SPDC works to clean up and remediate areas affected by spills originating from its facilities. SPDC reduced the average time to complete recovery of free-phase oil - oil that forms a separate layer and is not mixed with water or soil - from about 13 days in 2016 to about one week in 2020. This is the average time it takes to safely access a damaged site to start joint investigation visits (JIV) with regulators, impacted communities, and in some cases with non-governmental organisations, to clean up oil not mixed with water or soil.\n\nClean-up activities include bio-remediation which stimulates microorganisms that naturally break down and use carbon-rich oil as a source of food and energy, effectively removing it. Once clean-up and remediation operations are completed, the work is inspected and, if satisfactory, approved and certified by the Nigerian regulators. With operational spills,/uni00A0SPDC also pays compensation to affected people and communities.\n\nSPDC has been working with the International Union for Conservation of/uni00A0Nature (IUCN) since 2012 to enhance remediation techniques and protect biodiversity at sites affected by oil spills in SPDC's areas of operation in the Niger Delta. Based on this collaboration, SPDC has launched further initiatives to help strengthen its remediation and restoration efforts. In 2020, SPDC, IUCN, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation and Wetlands International worked together on the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group, which continues to monitor/uni00A0biodiversity recovery at remediated sites.\n\nSPDC also works with a range of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to build/uni00A0greater trust in spill response and clean-up processes. Local communities participate in remediation work for operational spills. Due/uni00A0to/uni00A0the restrictions of COVID-19 there were fewer opportunities to collaborate but the engagement and partnership with communities continued. Various NGOs have sometimes gone on joint investigation visits with SPDC, government regulators and members of affected communities to establish the cause and volume of oil spilled.\n\nSPDC has also implemented several programmes to raise awareness of/uni00A0the negative effects of crude oil theft and illegal oil refining. Examples include community-based pipeline surveillance, and promoting of alternative livelihoods through Shell's flagship youth entrepreneurship programme, Shell LiveWIRE.",

        "page_content": "## Bodo clean-up process\n\nIn 2015, SPDC, on behalf of the SPDC joint venture and the Bodo community, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) granting SPDC access to begin cleaning up areas affected by two operational spills that occurred in 2008. The MOU also provided for the selection of two international contractors to conduct the clean-up under the oversight of an/uni00A0independent project director. The clean-up project was delayed in 2016 and for most of 2017 because of access challenges from the community. Engagement with the Bodo community and other stakeholders began in September 2015 and was managed by the Bodo Mediation Initiative.\n\nAfter two years of engagement, in September 2017, it was possible to start the first phase of clean-up and remediation activities. The clean-up consists of three phases:\n\n- 2) remediation of soil; and\n- 1) removal of oil floating on water surfaces;\n- 3) planting of mangroves and monitoring.\n\nThe first phase was completed in August 2018. The contract procurement process for phase two was completed in 2019. Remediation activities in the field started in November 2019. During 2020, work had to be put on hold because of COVID-19 restrictions. Currently, we expect to finalise the activities by about May 2023./uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group assessed the initial field reports from two pilot sites containing freshwater and swamp forests. The advisory group set out its aims and timeline for work/uni00A0at/uni00A0both sites. Field visits to these remote locations were disrupted by/uni00A0COVID-19 restrictions. The advisory group is also analysing other potential/uni00A0pilot sites identified by SPDC, and planning an engagement session with regulatory agencies in Nigeria.\n\n## Ogoniland: commitment to the United Nations Environment Programme\n\nSPDC remains committed to the implementation of the 2011 United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Report on Ogoniland which/uni00A0assessed contamination from oil operations in the region and recommended actions to clean it up. Over the last nine years, SPDC has acted on all and completed most of the UNEP recommendations that were specifically addressed to it as the operator of the joint venture.\n\nThe clean-up efforts are led by the Hydrocarbon Pollution and Remediation Project (HYPREP), an agency established by the federal government. In 2018, HYPREP awarded contracts for the first set of remediation projects. In/uni00A02019, 21 contractors started operations on 21 lots which add up to 12 of/uni00A0the 67 polluted sites recorded in the UNEP report. Of those 67 sites, two are waste sites without hydrocarbon pollution. In January 2020, HYPREP awarded a further 29 contracts for remediation on 29 lots covering eight polluted sites. The contractors took up remediation activities in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although remediation works continue to make progress, challenges remain. These include re-pollution, lack of contractor funding, land disputes and security issues in Ogoniland.\n\nThe UNEP report recommended creating an Ogoni Trust Fund (OTF) with $1 billion capital, to be co-funded by the Nigerian government, the SPDC joint venture and other operators in the area. The SPDC joint venture remains fully committed to contributing $900 million to the fund as its share over five years. SPDC JV partners contributed the first instalment of/uni00A0$180 million for the clean-up by July 2018 and released the second instalment of $180 million in 2019. HYPREP did not request the release of/uni00A0any funds in 2020. The UNEP continues to monitor the progress of the clean-up exercise via its observer status at both the HYPREP's Governing Council and the Ogoni Trust Fund. Its agencies such as UNDP, UNITAR and UNOPS provide services to HYPREP in the areas of livelihood programmes, training and project services.\n\n## HYDRAULIC FRACTURING\n\nShale oil and gas resources remain a critical part of a modern energy system as we move towards renewable sources. Shale resources are abundant and offer a relatively affordable source of energy. According to/uni00A0US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, there are 7,576.6 trillion cubic feet of unproven technically recoverable wet shale/uni00A0gas resources and 418.9 billion barrels of unproven technically recoverable tight oil resources spread across 46 countries. We believe that developing these resources is critical for meeting the energy needs of/uni00A0growing societies around the world./uni00A0\n\nThe oil and gas industry has used hydraulic fracturing to unlock tight/shale oil and gas resources in vertical wells for decades. In the past 20 years, hydraulic fracturing has also been used in horizontal wells to recover natural gas and oil. The technology has opened up vast resources that were previously thought to be unrecoverable. Hydraulic fracturing has been used by the industry in more than 2.5 million oil and gas wells, many of them in the USA. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid that is typically 99.9% water and sand and around 0.1% chemical additives into tight sand or shale rock at high pressure. This creates threadlike fissures typically the diameter of a human hair - in the rock, making space through which the hydrocarbons can flow more easily./uni00A0\n\nAt Shell, we believe we can explore, develop and produce tight/shale oil/uni00A0and gas resources safely and responsibly. Our operations are underpinned by our Principles for Producing Tight/Shale Oil and Gas (known as Onshore Operating Principles). These provide a framework for/uni00A0protecting the environment and the communities in which we operate. These operating principles cover safety, air quality, water protection and usage, land use and engagement with local communities. We review the/uni00A0Onshore Operating Principles annually and update them as new technologies, challenges and regulatory requirements emerge. We also/uni00A0support appropriate and fit-for-purpose regulations./uni00A0\n\nWe work to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our oil and gas development and production. Shell's shale assets implement GHG management plans and have a robust Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programme. We are working on multiple fronts to develop cutting-edge technologies that enhance our LDAR programme and enable earlier detection and repair of leaks. As per the Onshore Operating Principles, we seek to minimise routine gas flaring at shale assets. See our website shell.com for more information about the GHG management practices, such as the \"Onshore Operating Principles in Action: Methane Fact Sheet\".\n\n## See also \"Climate change and energy transition\" on page 106.\n\nThe availability and quality of water, local environmental conditions and regulatory requirements vary from basin to basin. Therefore, each shale asset develops a tailor-made water management strategy, identifying short- and long-term water needs, options for water sourcing, recycling and sharing, options for treatment and disposal, and options for transportation and storage. The people operating our shale assets aim to minimise the use of water. Depending on local hydro-geologic conditions, they typically use a combination of fresh water, brackish groundwater, produced water and waste water. They actively strive to reduce and ideally eliminate freshwater intake for drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations, by increasing recycling capacity and using municipal water./uni00A0\n\nPotable groundwater aquifers are isolated from the hydrocarbonproducing shale formations by hundreds of metres of impermeable rock. We often need to drill through potable groundwater aquifers to reach shale formations. We therefore design our drilling, hydraulic fracturing and production activities in ways that aim to maintain isolation from potable groundwater aquifers. Before drilling a well, we conduct a hazard\n\nt",

When we drill, we have at least two physical barriers, consisting of steel casing and cement, between the wellbore and potable groundwater aquifers. We continuously monitor wellbore integrity before, during and after hydraulic fracturing and during production activities./uni00A0\n\nChemical additives are needed in hydraulic fracturing fluid to carry sand,/uni00A0reduce friction and prevent the growth of bacteria. We have been working to optimise the composition of our hydraulic fracturing fluids since 2015. As a result, we have reduced chemical additive volumes by around 50-60% compared with 2015. Currently, on a volume basis, around 0.1%/uni00A0of our hydraulic-fracturing fluid is chemical additives. We support disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic-fracturing fluids for/uni00A0Shell-operated wells. See our website shell.com for more information about our water management practices, such as the \"Onshore Operating Principles in Action: Water Fact Sheet\"./uni00A0\n\n## SEISMICITY\n\nAs oil and gas fields mature, seismic activity may occur, depending on the unique geology of individual fields. An example is the Groningen onshore gas field in the Netherlands, where induced earthquakes have occurred since the 1990s. Some of these earthquakes have damaged houses and other structures in the region, resulting in complaints, claims and lawsuits from local home-owners and residents. Actions have been taken to improve safety, liveability and economic prospects in the region. Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM, Shell interest 50%) operates the gas field. The Dutch government has taken over policy setting and execution of these mitigating actions and the \"duty of care\" from NAM. NAM continues to carry the costs. The government is also currently instructing NAM on production levels. Production from the onshore Groningen gas field in the Netherlands is expected to stop by/uni00A02022 or shortly thereafter./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See \"Upstream\" on page 55.\n\nOverall, we believe it is relatively unlikely that hydraulic fracturing or well operations for disposing of produced water will induce seismicity that is felt on the surface. Despite this, Shell still takes precautionary measures around induced seismicity, and proactively manages the risk in accordance with, and sometimes beyond, regulatory requirements. We have added precautionary measures around induced seismicity to our Onshore Operating Principles and developed internal guidelines that we/uni00A0apply to our shale assets. They outline a risk assessment process and/uni00A0provide a framework for risk management. Subsurface and surface conditions vary from basin to basin, which means that management practices need to reflect the risk profile of each basin and provide customised responses to the risks. We support fit-for-purpose, sciencebased state and provincial regulations. See our website shell.com for more/uni00A0information about our induced seismicity management practices, such as the \"Onshore Operating Principles in Action: Induced Seismicity/uni00A0Fact Sheet\"./uni00A0\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS\n\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws, regulations and reporting requirements in the countries where we operate. Infringing any of these laws, regulations and requirements could harm our reputation and ability to do business, and result in significant costs, including clean-up/uni00A0costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims./uni00A0\n\nOngoing operating expenses include the costs of preventing unauthorised discharges into the air and water, and the safe disposal and handling of/uni00A0waste./uni00A0\n\nWe place a premium on developing effective technologies that are also/uni00A0safe for the environment. But when operating at the forefront of technology, there is always the possibility that a new technology has environmental impacts that were not assessed, foreseen or determined to/uni00A0be harmful when originally implemented. While we believe we take/uni00A0reasonable precautions to limit these risks, we could be subject to/uni00A0additional remedial, environmental and litigation costs as a result of/uni00A0operations' unknown and unforeseen impacts on the environment. Although these costs have so far not been material to us, no assurance can be given that this will always be the case./uni00A0\n\n## SECURITY\n\nOur operations expose us to criminality, civil unrest, activism, terrorism, cyber-disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse effect on our business (see 'Risk factors' on pages 28-37). We seek to obtain the/uni00A0best possible information to enable us to assess threats and risks. This/uni00A0includes building strong and open relationships with government security agencies. Risk mitigation includes strengthening the security of/uni00A0sites, reducing our exposure as appropriate, journey management, information risk management, crisis management and business continuity measures. We conduct training and awareness campaigns for staff, and provide them with travel advice and access to 24/7 assistance while travelling. We consistently verify the identity of our employees and contract staff, and control their access to our sites and activities, both physical and/uni00A0logistical. We manage and exercise crisis response and management/uni00A0plans./uni00A0\n\n## CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY/uni00A0\n\nShell's businesses are part of society and contribute to it by buying and selling goods and services across economies in various countries and jurisdictions. Our employees, suppliers and contractors are part of the local communities where Shell operates.\n\nIn 2020, Shell paid $47.3 billion to governments (2019: $61.3 billion). We/uni00A0paid $3.4 billion in corporate income taxes and $3.5 billion in government royalties, and collected $40.4 billion in excise duties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments. In 2020, Shell spent $39.3 billion (2019: $44.9 billion) on goods and services from more than 29,000 suppliers globally. For more information about our approach to tax and transparency, see Shell's Tax/uni00A0Contribution Report, available via our website shell.com./uni00A0\n\n## Supply chain engagement\n\nOur suppliers are critical to our ability to run our businesses. They are involved in almost every step of our operations - and are often key to having a positive impact on local communities and achieving successful business outcomes. Shell aims to work with suppliers, including contractors, that behave in an economically, environmentally and socially/uni00A0responsible manner, as set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles.\n\nThe way we engage with our contractors and suppliers is based on our Shell Supplier Principles which are embedded in contracts. They require contractors and suppliers:\n\n- \u25a0 to use energy and natural resources efficiently; and\n- \u25a0 to commit to protect the environment in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations;/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 to continually look for ways to minimise waste, emissions and discharge of their operations, products and services./uni00A0\n\nMore information about how we engage with contractors and suppliers is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.",

        "page_content": "## NEIGHBOURING COMMUNITIES\n\nEngaging with communities is part of our approach to managing human rights and providing access to remedy. Our global requirements for social performance aim to ensure that we operate responsibly by avoiding or minimising the negative social effects of our operations. The requirements also help us to maximise the benefits of our activities, such as employment and contractual opportunities that can support local economies./uni00A0\n\nThe requirements set clear rules and expectations for how we engage with/uni00A0and respect communities that may be affected by our operations. We require major projects and facilities operated by Shell to have a social/uni00A0performance plan that defines actions for managing potential negative and positive effects on communities. A key part of these plans is/uni00A0identifying the social environment and stakeholders who may be vulnerable to our operations. Another key component is an appropriate community feedback mechanism for listening to queries and responding to/uni00A0them, or resolving complaints in a timely manner. We have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or mitigate potential impacts on the traditional lifestyles and cultural heritage of indigenous people. or We/uni00A0also have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or mitigate their/uni00A0involuntary resettlement.\n\nEarly in 2020, we launched a new global community feedback tool (CFT). This enables us to globally track and respond to all queries, complaints and positive and negative feedback that we receive. It allows our network of about 100 community liaison officers (CLO) to document all types of feedback. It is accessible via a mobile app and can be used to send feedback received in the field to those who can act to resolve issues. Asset/uni00A0managers can generate reports to help them analyse trends, detect/uni00A0underlying causes, and decide appropriate action./uni00A0\n\nThe CLOs continue to act as a bridge between local communities and our/uni00A0businesses. The CLOs are in our community centres on workdays, receiving visitors and listening to questions or complaints. Members of the community can also contact CLOs via dedicated telephone lines. It is the job of CLOs to take any concerns back to the Shell facility and involve people who are best placed to take action.\n\nWe are using a tool based on the United Nations Guiding Principles' criteria to measure the effectiveness of our mechanisms for managing community feedback on our operations.\n\nIn 2019, we had assessed the community feedback mechanisms (CFMs) of/uni00A032 sites, and in 2020, we helped 14 of these sites to improve their CFMs. The improvement measures involved included:\n\n- \u25a0 improving written procedures so they are better aligned with global/uni00A0good practice and more reflective of local circumstances;\n- \u25a0 promoting public access to and transparency of the sites' CFMs;\n- \u25a0 providing clear steps for recognising alternative options for communities to seek remedy; and\n- \u25a0 respecting people's anonymity and data privacy.\n\nIn 2020, we also developed a guide to help sites make their CFMs effective and address local needs. In 2021, we plan to further improve the/uni00A0quality of sites' CFMs.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about our work with communities.\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nHuman rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded in our Shell General Business Principles and in our Code of Conduct. Our approach is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights./uni00A0\n\nWe work closely with other companies and non-governmental organisations to improve how we apply these principles. We focus on four priority areas where respect for human rights is critical to how we operate: communities, security, labour rights, and supply chain. For each of these areas, we have systems to identify potential impacts and to avoid and mitigate them. For example, our HSSE & SP Control Framework (CF) contains our mandatory standards and manuals that set out how we identify, assess, and manage our impacts on communities where we operate, including any impact on human rights. We require all our companies and contractors to respect the human rights of our workforce and neighbouring communities. Our joint-venture partners are expected to/uni00A0implement our CF or an equivalent.\n\nAn internal Human Rights Working Group consisting of experts from different/uni00A0functions advises on and supports the businesses with the implementation and review of our approach to human rights. The group includes an external adviser. A steering committee composed of senior executives provides steer and support to the work of the Human Rights Working Group.\n\nOur approach to due diligence is informed by the/uni00A0United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Due diligence in each focus area, including human rights, is typically exercised in countries where there may be a risk of an impact on people's human rights. It is supported by experts working within the applicable functions in Shell. We recognise how due diligence helps us to act on our commitment to respect human rights. For example, in our supply chains, where contractors and suppliers are considered to be at risk of having issues with labour rights, we engage with them to assess their management systems, before deciding whether to award a contract. Results of these supplier assessments are evaluated, and where gaps are found, we may work with suppliers and contractors to/uni00A0help them implement corrective action. We may also conduct on-site audits or consider terminating contracts if serious or persistent shortcomings are found.\n\nThe most common shortcomings found during our supplier assessments typically relate to policy rather than performance gaps in the following/uni00A0areas:\n\n- \u25a0 child labour avoidance;\n- \u25a0 freely chosen employment;\n- \u25a0 working hours, wages and benefits;\n- \u25a0 humane treatment, equal opportunities and freedom of association;/uni00A0and\n- \u25a0 dormitory, housing and working conditions;\n- \u25a0 supply chain and performance management.\n\nThe Shell Supplier Principles include specific labour and human rights expectations for contractors and suppliers. Shell companies use a joint industry supplier capability assessment that is delivered in collaboration with other operators. This sharing mechanism is intended to support the improvement of working conditions in the participating companies' supply/uni00A0chains.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about our approach to/uni00A0human rights.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION/uni00A0\n\nShell has long recognised that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use of hydrocarbon-based energy are contributing to the warming of the climate system. In December 2015, 195 nations adopted the Paris Agreement. We welcomed the efforts made to reach this global climate agreement, which came into force in November 2016. We fully support the Paris Agreement's goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In pursuit of this goal, we also support the vision of a transition towards a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell agrees with the statement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report, Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C that says that in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the world economy would need to transform in complex and/uni00A0interconnected ways. Meeting this challenge would require an even more rapid escalation in the scale and pace of change in the coming decades/uni00A0than was foreseen in the Paris Agreement.\n\nSociety faces a dual challenge: it must transition to a low-carbon energy future to manage the risks of climate change, while also extending the economic and social benefits of energy to everyone on the planet. This requires, among other things, reducing emissions while also changing how energy is produced, stored, used and made accessible to more people.\n\nShell recognises that society's attitude towards climate change is shifting rapidly and that it is different in different locations. Regulators in some advanced economies such as the EU and the UK have already started pushing for net-zero emissions by 2050 in an effort to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius stretched goal of the Paris Agreement. Potential similar developments in other key locations might lead to similar or more stringent/uni00A0regulatory conditions on Shell's operations and products.\n\nOn February 11, 2021, we announced Powering Progress, our new strategy. Powering Progress is our strategy to accelerate progress to net-zero emissions, purposefully and profitably. One of the pillars of this strategy is for Shell to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We believe our net-zero target supports the most ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This will require us to transform our business, working with our customers and others, in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise. This includes aviation, shipping, road freight and heavy industries. We also believe that our total oil production peaked in 2019 and our total emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) peaked in 2018 at around 1.73 gigatonnes per annum./uni00A0\n\nShell's target is to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. This means net-zero emissions from our operations - our Scope 1 and 2 emissions - and also net zero from the end use of our products that we sell - our Scope 3 emissions. Our Scope 3 emissions include our customers' emissions from the energy products we produce and sell as well as the life-cycle emissions of the energy products produced by other companies that/uni00A0we resell to our customers. This means that our target covers all the energy/uni00A0we sell, not just the oil and gas we produce and refine ourselves./uni00A0\n\nBut Shell cannot get to net zero without society also being net zero. While/uni00A0we aim to transition slightly ahead of society, where we expect to see higher margins for our low-carbon and renewable energy products, we cannot transition too quickly or we will be trying to sell products that/uni00A0our customers do not want. Accordingly, other than our short-term remuneration targets, all targets are conditional on being in step with society. If society is not on the path to net zero for 2050, it is unlikely that/uni00A0Shell will meet its emissions targets.\n\nWe believe it is important for the Board and the management to understand what our shareholders think. Accordingly, in 2021, Shell intends to submit its energy transition strategy to shareholders for an advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting. We will submit our energy transition strategy to such an advisory vote every three years. We will also\n\nseek an advisory vote on the progress we make each year, as disclosed in/uni00A0our Annual Report, starting in 2022.\n\n## SHELL'S ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS AND CARBON INTENSITY/uni00A0TARGETS\n\nOur target is to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step/uni00A0with society.\n\n## Shell's 2050 absolute emissions targets\n\n- \u25a0 net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations by 2050;/uni00A0and\n\nWe aim to achieve these targets in step with society. They are:\n\n- \u25a0 net-zero Scope 3 emissions from the energy products we sell by 2050.\n\n## Shell's net carbon intensity targets\n\n- \u25a0 2030 NCF reduced by 20% from 2016 NCF;\n\nWe aim to achieve these targets in step with society. They are measured/uni00A0by our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) metric, and are:\n\n- \u25a0 2035 NCF reduced by 45% from 2016 NCF; and\n- \u25a0 2050 NCF reduced by 100% from 2016 NCF.\n\nThe updated 2035 and 2050 targets reflect that we will start to include all actions taken to reduce emissions when we calculate our net carbon intensity. This includes the actions we take ourselves and actions taken by/uni00A0the users of the energy products we sell./uni00A0\n\nWe will work with our customers to address the emissions created when they use products bought from us (Scope 3) and help them find ways to reduce their emissions and overall carbon footprint to net zero by 2050.\n\n## Remuneration targets\n\n- \u25a0 2021 NCF reduced by 2-3% from 2016 NCF;\n\nWe have set specific carbon intensity targets for the following years:\n\n- \u25a0 2022 NCF reduced by 4-6% from 2016 NCF; and\n- \u25a0 2023 NCF reduced by 6-8% from 2016 NCF.\n\nSee below, in this section, for more detail on:\n\n- \u25a0 Our climate target;\n- \u25a0 How we plan to deliver;\n- \u25a0 Our net carbon intensity targets; and\n- \u25a0 Our performance.\n\n## See also the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 153-156.\n\n## Business milestones\n\n- We believe our annual oil production peaked in 2019, and we\n\nWe are taking steps to cut emissions from our existing oil and gas/uni00A0operations, and to avoid generating more in the future.\n\n- \u25a0 expect/uni00A0our total oil production to decline by 1-2% a year until 2030.\n- \u25a0 Natural gas is the least polluting hydrocarbon. We expect the percentage of total gas production in our portfolio to gradually rise/uni00A0to/uni00A055% or more by 2030.\n- \u25a0 We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025.\n- \u25a0 By 2030, we will end routine flaring of gas, which generates carbon emissions, from the assets we operate.\n- \u25a0 By 2025, we expect to have kept the methane emissions intensity of/uni00A0Shell-operated assets to below 0.2%.\n\n## HOW WE PLAN TO DELIVER\n\nGetting the energy system on a path to net zero will require co-ordinated action between energy providers, energy users and governments. They will need to work together over the coming decades to define rapid, realistic decarbonisation pathways, sector by sector.\n\nWe will work with our customers to address the emissions created when they use products bought from us (Scope 3) and help them find ways to reduce their emissions and overall carbon footprint to net zero by 2050.",

        "page_content": "We are already taking steps to cut emissions from our existing oil and gas operations, and to avoid generating more in the future. We aim to reduce the GHG intensity of our portfolio and we continue to work on improving the energy efficiency of our existing operations. One element of our target is to achieve net-zero emissions from all our operations, as well as from the energy we need to power them.\n\nShell believes that society must accelerate and increase the scale of all forms of GHG reduction. We are increasing the proportion of lowercarbon products such as natural gas, biofuels, electricity and hydrogen in/uni00A0the mix of products we sell. For example, Amazon Air has secured up to six million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel - made partly from biomass and waste - supplied by Shell Aviation and produced by World Energy. Similarly, we have formed an alliance with Microsoft which includes supply of renewable energy to help them meet their commitment of 100%/uni00A0renewable energy consumption by 2025.\n\nOur shift to energy and chemicals parks means we will reduce our production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 100 mtpa to 45 mtpa. We plan to build on Shell's leading position in hydrogen by developing integrated hydrogen hubs to serve industry and heavy-duty transport, aiming to achieve double-digit share of global clean hydrogen/uni00A0sales.\n\nIt is not enough for Shell to take action on its own. We can only meet our net-zero target as part of a world that is also heading to net zero. That will require a reduction in the global supply of carbon-based energy, which can only happen if demand for carbon-based energy also reduces. So Shell, as a supplier, must work with customers on a sector-by-sector basis, to develop the right pathways to transition each sector from carbon-based energy to low-carbon solutions.\n\nShell's marketing business is being restructured on a sectoral basis. This/uni00A0in/uni00A0turn will help us to make progress in working with customers on/uni00A0a/uni00A0sector-by-sector basis.\n\nOur mission is to help the millions of brand-loyal customers whom we serve/uni00A0every day - from individual energy consumers to large businesses - to decarbonise. We have the scale and the competitive advantage to/uni00A0generate profit from this shared ambition.\n\nOur marketing platform is one of the best in the energy industry. Spanning 160 markets, every day we serve more than 30 million customers at our retail sites; and one million businesses.\n\nOur customer access gives us first-hand insights, helping us to deliver what our customers want rather than offering what others think they need.\n\nThis will help us to grow our existing marketing platforms profitably, while also increasing the decarbonisation choices across sectors and countries.\n\nOur global ambition is that by 2025 we are operating more than half a million electric-vehicle charging points for businesses, fleets and customers, at our retail sites and people's homes. This number is expected to rise to 2.5 million charging points operated by Shell by 2030. For drivers who are unable to switch to an electric vehicle immediately, we also offer carbon-neutral driving using nature-based carbon offsets, in seven countries including the UK.\n\nWe are positioning ourselves to profitably deliver integrated offers by cross-selling to motorists and home energy customers. Our integrated solutions will help our business customers to navigate the challenges and/uni00A0opportunities of decarbonisation.\n\nOne such customer is Penske Corporation in the USA. We work closely with this customer across truck leasing, logistics and automotive retail. We/uni00A0provide Penske Corporation with products and services ranging from fuels and lubricants, to electric-vehicle charging and renewable power.\n\nOur approach to commercial road transport is similar to how we work with other hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping and aviation. We/uni00A0are working with transport companies, truck manufacturers and policymakers to identify profitable pathways to decarbonisation.\n\nWe are already one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels, and we will continue to invest in and increase the production of/uni00A0these low-carbon fuels. Over the next decade, we will help customers in/uni00A0Europe, China and on the US West Coast to transition to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biogas.\n\nHydrogen also offers a route to lowering emissions. We are part of the H2Accelerate consortium, which looks at ways to create infrastructure for/uni00A0generating and supplying hydrogen across Europe.\n\nIn Power, we are working with our customers in different markets, finding commercial ways to meet their specific needs. Our scale, reach, brand strength and trading capability set us up to succeed. An example is our/uni00A0deal to supply Amazon with renewable power, which is helping it/uni00A0to/uni00A0fulfil its climate pledges.\n\nWe are also supporting infrastructure development through our investments in Silicon Ranch and Cleantech Solar. Combined, these two companies have over 350 solar farms in the USA and South-east Asia. In/uni00A0Australia and in Oman, Shell is building its first large-scale solar farms.\n\nShell's infrastructure, systems integration, experience and people put us in/uni00A0a strong position to profitably meet the current and future needs of our customers, helping them and society to decarbonise for a net-zero emissions future.\n\nWe are restructuring so that we have marketing teams facing individual sectors. We are also developing a carbon management framework to guide decision-making on investments in assets and businesses that align/uni00A0with our climate target. We intend to have carbon budgets for/uni00A0customer-facing businesses to motivate them to find value growth by/uni00A0switching from high-carbon income to low-carbon income.\n\nShell believes that the need to reduce GHG emissions will continue to be/uni00A0an important driver in transforming the energy system in this century. This transformation will generate both challenges and opportunities for/uni00A0our existing and future portfolio.\n\n## TRANSPARENCY AND COLLABORATION/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 We continue to support the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and apply them to our reporting. We aim to address the recommendations with this Report and other Shell publications such as the 2020 Sustainability Report and 2020 Industry Associations Climate Review update (both due to be published in April 2021), and our latest scenarios Islands, Waves, and Sky 1.5./uni00A0\n\nWe support efforts to increase transparency and investors' understanding of companies' strategies for responding to the risks and opportunities of climate change. We do this through engagement with external stakeholders such as/uni00A0industry associations beyond the energy industry, standard setters, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), investors, and initiatives on different topics including climate change. With publications such as our 2020 Sustainability Report and our 2020 Industry Associations Climate Review update (both planned to be published in April 2021) we aim to provide additional information to that in this Report to address requests and recommendations from different reporting frameworks and standards. Some examples of those frameworks and engagements are described below./uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 As a member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) we are one of a group of 12 national and international energy companies that focus on action that has real impact now and delivers on decarbonisation in/uni00A0the coming decades (see Methane initiatives and collaborations, page 102).\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In December 2020, eight leading energy companies including Shell announced that they had jointly developed and agreed to apply six/uni00A0Energy Transition Principles. These principles aim to support the collective industry acceleration to contribute to the Paris Agreement objectives by delivering progress on reducing GHG emissions, the role of carbon sinks, and the importance of transparency and alignment on climate change with trade associations. The companies are building further on this collaboration to drive more consistency and transparency in greenhouse gas reporting, and in measurement of the/uni00A0emissions which may occur at different points in the value chain./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Some governments have introduced carbon pricing mechanisms, which we believe can be an effective way to reduce GHG emissions across the economy at the lowest overall cost to society. We expect more governments to follow. Shell is encouraging carbon pricing mechanisms so that businesses and consumers are further incentivised to improve energy efficiency, provide and switch to lower-carbon options, and reduce carbon emissions. Such mechanisms can also help encourage projects such as CCS facilities and nature-based solutions like the planting of forests. Shell continues to work with governments to produce effective transition plans and policies.\n- \u25a0 We continue to engage with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and we are a member of its Technical Working Group that is currently working to define the methodology for the oil, gas and integrated energy sector.\n\n## OUR GOVERNANCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nClimate change and risks resulting from GHG emissions are a significant risk factor for Shell. They are managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and the Executive Committee./uni00A0\n\n## See/uni00A0'Other regulatory and statutory information' on pages 182-189./uni00A0\n\nShell's climate change risk management structure includes the work of the Board. In 2020, the Board discussed a variety of energy transition and climate change-related subjects. These included environmental topics ahead of Responsible Investment Day and Shell's announcement of its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Directors received information on opportunities and priorities in the New Energies area. Throughout the year, Directors were also informed about topics of interest among investors and other stakeholder groups. These included sustainability, governance and the energy transition. During the annual strategy meeting, in virtual format, the Board discussed various topics including the energy transition and its implications.\n\n## For more information on the activities of the Board see 'Board/uni00A0activities/uni00A0and evaluation' on pages 130-133./uni00A0\n\nThe Board committees play an important role in assisting the Board with regard to governance and oversight of management of climate change risks and opportunities, as described in \"Governance\" on page 128./uni00A0\n\nThe Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) assists the Board in reviewing the practices and the performance of the Shell Group of companies, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate change, and sustainability. When reviewing these areas and deciding how to advise the Board, SESCo takes into account Shell's General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, and HSSE & SP Control Framework. SESCo's duties include reviewing Shell's progress towards meeting our climate targets and the energy transition. SESCo also advises the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy transition.\n\n## For more information about SESCo's activities around climate change and energy transition see page 143.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee (REMCO) is responsible for determining the Directors' Remuneration Policy, in alignment with our business strategy.\n\n## Annual scorecard\n\nStarting in 2021, we are increasing the weight associated with GHG emissions management. The GHG emissions intensity metric and its weight (10%) will remain unaltered, but we will add a new metric that measures the execution of GHG-abatement projects with a weight of 5% (see page 170 for more information).\n\n## Performance Share Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nFor 2021 awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the weighting of the energy transition condition has doubled from 5% to 10%. For 2021, the weighting of the energy transition condition in the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will also double from 10% to 20%. The target range is a 6-8% reduction in net carbon intensity against the 2016 baseline NCF of 79 grams of carbon dioxide (CO/uni2082) equivalent per megajoule. The other targets linked to our strategic ambitions will also evolve, with the metric connected to commercialising advanced biofuel technology broadening to a measure of growing new cleaner energy product offerings. The targets for the leading energy transition measures are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed retrospectively.\n\nThe energy transition condition was included again in the 2020 LTIP awards for Executive Directors and senior executives and was also incorporated into the Performance Share Plan awards made to around 16,500 employees globally.\n\nSee 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on pages 153-156 for further information. An update on progress on the 2019 and 2020 awards is provided on pages 165./uni00A0\n\nThe Audit Committee has key responsibilities in helping the Board to maintain oversight of areas such as the effectiveness of risk management and internal control. For more information on the work of the Audit Committee see page 145./uni00A0\n\nThe CEO is the most senior individual with accountability for climate change risk. Shell has established specialist forums at different levels of/uni00A0the/uni00A0organisation where climate change and GHG-related matters are/uni00A0addressed, monitored and reviewed. Each Shell entity and each Shell-operated venture is responsible for implementing climate change/uni00A0policies and strategies./uni00A0\n\nThe Executive Vice President (EVP) Safety and Environment, a senior manager who reports directly to the Projects & Technology Director, is accountable for the oversight of GHG issues. This manager's department includes the Group Carbon team and the HSSE & SP Assurance and Reporting team./uni00A0\n\nGroup Carbon is accountable for monitoring and examining the strategic implications of climate change for Shell. Group Carbon also reviews the effects of governmental policy and regulation. It proposes policy positions based on analysis by Shell and external organisations. The team also advises Shell companies to ensure that they are consistent in how they apply our core principles and policies when interacting with policymakers.\n\nGroup Carbon also has oversight of Shell's GHG management programme. It helps our lines of business to adopt strategies for managing greenhouse gases. The team includes managers who advise projects on the risks and opportunities of GHG-related issues./uni00A0\n\nThe HSSE & SP Assurance and Reporting team is accountable for the/uni00A0delivery of Shell's non-financial reporting. It is also responsible for/uni00A0auditing the performance of Shell businesses with regards to our HSSE/uni00A0&/uni00A0SP Control Framework requirements, which include climate change risk management.",

We call this project Reshape. The governance of topics around sustainability, including climate/uni00A0change, will not change at the most senior levels of Shell. We are introducing changes at specific levels of the organisation to better address the effects of the strategy update. We expect to adjust the initial structure as we go through the process. Currently, we are working towards going live with the revised organisational structure in the second half of 2021.\n\n- For more information, see Strategy and outlook on page 18, and Our/uni00A0people on page 108.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe framework for managing the climate change and GHG emissions risk/uni00A0is underpinned by Shell's Control Framework and Statement on Risk/uni00A0Management, which are described on pages 186 of the 'Other regulatory and statutory information' section of this Report.\n\nFor the climate change and GHG emissions risk, several global teams support our businesses in GHG and energy management, comprising a/uni00A0network of experts in subjects related to GHG and risk management. They work globally across our lines of business and assist in:\n\n- \u25a0 planning and implementing responses;/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 identifying and assessing risks;/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 sharing best practices; and\n- \u25a0 monitoring, improving and completing action that affects the objectives/uni00A0and performance of projects and assets.\n\nThese teams have created a set of mandatory manuals and complementary guidance documents that are updated periodically and/uni00A0are ultimately based on our HSSE & SP Control Framework (CF). These manuals and documents provide guidance on how to monitor, communicate and report changes in the risk environment, and how to/uni00A0review the effectiveness of actions taken to manage identified risks,/uni00A0including ways to:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 clarify expectations for risk management and reporting, including roles/uni00A0and responsibilities of the risk owners;\n- \u25a0 ensure consistent assessment of climate risk across Shell;\n- \u25a0 clarify types of assurance activities that may be applicable;/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 enable integration of Shell's reporting./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 strengthen decision-making by ensuring that businesses have better awareness and understanding of climate risks (including their likelihood/uni00A0and potential impact) and mitigation plans; and/uni00A0\n\nFor more detail on our definition of risk categories and their relationship to/uni00A0different time horizons, see page 98./uni00A0\n\nThe GHG and Energy Management Manual is one of the mandatory manuals of our HSSE & SP Control Framework. It requires that effective steps are taken to track the GHG emissions from Shell's operated and non-operated facilities and the life-cycle emissions of its energy products. The manual also focuses on the efficient operation of existing equipment. This means, for example, using monitoring systems to get real-time information that we can use to make energy-saving changes and identify opportunities for energy-saving investments in the medium term. Shell's scorecard includes GHG measures that create additional incentives for our employees to reduce GHG emissions in our portfolio.\n\n## See 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on page 153.\n\nThe global teams mentioned above support the businesses in monitoring and addressing certain physical risks of climate change. This support includes the input of specialist teams who provide direct technical assistance to facilities, based on their analysis of the potential impacts of/uni00A0climate change in different operating environments. For example, the/uni00A0specialist teams support facilities on an ad hoc basis to address potential operational issues such as flooding of a site that may affect its/uni00A0drainage system.\n\nThe teams also provide expertise on how to include considerations of certain potential physical climate change risks in the internal Design and Engineering Practice (DEP) requirements for new projects. The DEPs for new projects are reviewed periodically to take account of changes in the/uni00A0risk environment, including emerging weather and climate factors.\n\nWe review our portfolio annually to identify emerging risks from changes in GHG emissions regulations and changing physical conditions. Shell's Group Carbon team provides management with strategic insights on Shell's exposures, risks and opportunities, and recommends actions for Shell to take. Each of Shell's businesses and functions has an assurance committee that considers this risk on a regular basis and coordinates the/uni00A0applicable assurance activities.\n\nAt the Group level, the climate change and GHG emissions risk has been identified as a significant risk factor for Shell - see 'Risk factors' on page 29. The Executive Committee and Board regularly review this risk in the same way that they do for other significant Group risk factors. Potential impacts and likelihoods are considered and discussed bi-annually. Similarly, the effectiveness of risk responses is also considered and discussed on a regular basis. Where necessary, these reviews are further/uni00A0supplemented by additional in-depth reviews with the relevant management teams. These reviews help to guide operational decisions,/uni00A0maintenance schedules and response planning.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION/uni00A0\n\n## Climate change risk management at project level\n\nShell requires that the GHG emissions of certain assets and projects are addressed in specific ways. This is described in our internal, mandatory GHG and Energy Management Manual which is part of our HSSE & SP Control Framework (see Environment and society, page 86). This manual specifies the requirements for managing the risks associated with GHGs and energy use, and is owned and signed off by the Vice President Group Carbon. It states that projects with a material GHG footprint must get their targets approved by the Executive Vice President Safety and Environment at certain defined stages. The project's GHG-abatement plan helps to determine the nature of these targets.\n\nProjects under development that are expected to have a material GHG footprint must meet our internal carbon performance standards or industry benchmarks. This indicates that they will be able to compete and prosper in a future where society aims to limit overall GHG emissions.\n\nThe performance standards are used as our screening criteria for measuring projects' average lifetime GHG intensity or energy efficiency per asset type. We are working to develop a complete set of standards for/uni00A0our businesses. Performance Standards for the Upstream and Transition pillars are in place, while those for the Growth pillar are under/uni00A0development. The complete set is expected to continue to evolve to/uni00A0incorporate new types of projects that support Shell's portfolio changes in alignment with our NZE energy business target. Our current standards are reviewed and updated annually, based on changes to legislation and/uni00A0external and/or internal benchmarking. The latest update was in 2020. The performance standards were signed off by the Executive Vice President (EVP) accountable for implementation in the relevant businesses, and by the EVP Safety and Environment, who represented the view of a risk owner from outside the relevant business.\n\nWe estimate the GHG emissions of facilities in two ways. We apply the/uni00A0performance standards, and we consider the GHG emissions from/uni00A0the/uni00A0use/uni00A0of the products that are manufactured. We assess GHG emissions'/uni00A0impacts alongside economic and technical design factors. These assessments can lead to projects being stopped or designs being/uni00A0changed.\n\nDuring project development, we consider ways to reduce GHG emissions and whether to include them in the design. Measures considered and adopted have included:\n\n- \u25a0 carbon capture and storage (CCS) capabilities;\n- \u25a0 flaring reduction;\n- \u25a0 exclusion of high-intensity process equipment;\n- \u25a0 electrification.\n- \u25a0 using renewable energy; and\n\nOur approach continues to evolve as we increase our understanding of/uni00A0the shifting policy landscape and the differing paces of energy transitions in different regions.\n\nWe continue to develop our project managers' and practitioners' competencies for effective GHG emissions management in projects. The/uni00A0Shell Project Academy has been set up to provide competence development programmes that include different ways of learning, such as/uni00A0courses on specific topics and on-the-job training. These courses also aim to ensure sharing of good practice and to encourage collaboration across businesses.\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n- \u25a0 Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial projections and use them to manage performance and expectations on/uni00A0a three-year cycle./uni00A0\n\nOur approach for assessing and managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change includes considering different time horizons. The time horizons and their relevance to risks, opportunities and/uni00A0business planning are as follows:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Medium term (generally three to 10 years): most of our expected production and earnings in this period come from our existing assets.\n- \u25a0 Long term (generally beyond 10 years): for this period, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making and risk identification on the thematic structure of the future portfolio are guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards/uni00A0the goals of the Paris Agreement./uni00A0\n\nThe overall climate change risk consists of four components, based on the/uni00A0nature of our exposure and the options for our mitigation responses. The four components are regulatory risks, commercial risks, physical risks and societal risks:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Commercial risks (time horizon: medium to long term) include lower sales volumes and/or margins because of generally reduced or eliminated demand; the possibility of underutilised or stranded oil and gas assets; changing preferences of investors and financial institutions; and additional costs for decarbonisation of operations./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Regulatory risks (time horizon: short term) include increased compliance costs for assets and/or products such as carbon costs; restrictions on the use of fossil fuels; and lack of net-zero-aligned global/uni00A0and national policy and frameworks./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Physical risks (time horizon ranging from short to long term) include structural damage to assets and downtime caused by acute events; reduced efficiency because of changing ambient conditions; increased operations and maintenance costs; and value-chain disruptions./uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Societal risks (time horizon: continuous) include the potential for a deteriorating relationship with the public, other companies, and governments in countries where Shell operates; class action lawsuits or similar litigation; potential stakeholder criticism related to transparency and clarity around plans and actions to achieve climate targets; and decline in reputation, brand value and competitive advantage./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See \"Risk Factors\" on page 29.\n\nClimate change and the energy transition have also created some business opportunities for Shell. See also \"Our portfolio and climate change\" on page 101.\n\n## Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on/uni00A0strategy, planning and business decisions\n\nFor Powering Progress, we must evolve our portfolio of assets and the mix of energy that we sell, so we can meet the cleaner energy needs of our customers in the coming decades. We aim to achieve this by repositioning our traditional businesses for resilience and taking advantage of the growth opportunities created by emerging customer needs.\n\nWe assess our portfolio decisions, including investments and divestments, against the potential impacts of the energy transition to the use of lower-carbon energy. These include higher regulatory costs linked to carbon emissions and lower demand for oil and gas. We continue to transform our organisation, ensuring that our portfolio is well positioned for the future of energy. In February 2021, we announced our updated strategy (see Strategy and outlook, page 18).",

It acknowledges that emissions might/uni00A0even increase in some parts of the world. What is important is/uni00A0that/uni00A0overall emissions fall.\n\nThe transition to lower-carbon energy requires major changes to industrial, commercial and residential infrastructure. This takes time and substantial investment. Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim/uni00A0to ensure that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses/uni00A0are appropriate in the context of an uncertain and changing/uni00A0external environment./uni00A0\n\nThe annual business plan is our way of putting the strategy into effect. A/uni00A0business plan is created, which is then approved by the Board. The plan/uni00A0contains forecasts of Shell's cash flows, and seeks to ensure that we/uni00A0can service financing requirements, pay dividends and fund investment/uni00A0activities.\n\nShell's business plan includes assumptions about internal and external parameters. Some of the key assumptions relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 production levels and product demand;\n- \u25a0 commodity prices;\n- \u25a0 exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 the schedules of growth programmes; and\n- \u25a0 future carbon costs;\n- \u25a0 risks and opportunities that may have material impacts on free cash/uni00A0flow.\n\nShell's strategy recognises that the world is transitioning to a lower-carbon energy system, but acknowledges that the pace and specific path forward remain uncertain and may differ across regions and countries. This means that Shell will need to make agile business decisions in step with society.\n\nScenario planning is a well-established process for exploring possible future outcomes. Many factors and variables are considered in this exercise. These include the future size and cost of resource bases and macroeconomic, geopolitical, social, technological and regulatory developments. Our portfolio and strategy have been assessed against a/uni00A0wide range of outlooks. These include the potential impacts of various possible energy transition pathways, and changes in societal expectations around climate change. Our latest set of Shell scenarios was one of the/uni00A0many variables used in guiding the updated strategy which we announced in February 2021. One of the key aspects that underpin Shell's/uni00A0financial statements are the oil and gas price and refining margin assumptions. These price assumptions are developed with input from our/uni00A0scenarios and other factors.\n\nGHG elements in the business plans consist of a GHG-emissions forecast, GHG-abatement plan and GHG costs. To assess the resilience of new projects, we consider the potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions. We have developed country-specific short-, mediumand/uni00A0long-term estimates of future carbon costs which are reviewed and updated annually. By 2050, our real-terms carbon cost estimates for all/uni00A0countries are expected to increase to at least $100 per tonne of GHG/uni00A0emissions.\n\nThe process for developing our cost of carbon estimates uses short-term policy outlooks and long-term scenario forecasts, both of which reflect the current nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted by countries as part of the Paris Agreement and evolving national policy developments. NDCs under the Paris Agreement are subject to revisions every five years. The United Nations estimate that the current NDCs are consistent with limiting the rise in global average temperature to around three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In the coming decades, we expect countries to tighten their NDCs to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. We expect to update our estimates as countries update their NDCs and climate policies. Accordingly, we believe our estimates appropriately reflect society's current implementation of the Paris Agreement. We continue to test the robustness of our projects with a material GHG footprint by using long-term carbon cost estimates that are consistent with/uni00A0limiting the rise in global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius.\n\nShell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. This expected increase is based on forecasts of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets, and real-terms carbon cost estimates which range from $5 to $110 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of free allowances as relevant to assets based on their location. The regulatory carbon cost estimate is refreshed on an annual basis as part of the development of our business/uni00A0plan./uni00A0\n\n## OUR CLIMATE TARGET\n\nAs indicated at the beginning of this section, our long-term climate target is to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards achieving the goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change. This target supports the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit the global temperature rise to/uni00A01.5 degrees Celsius. We referred to the database developed for the IPCC special report Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C while setting this target. We started with all the 1.5 degrees Celsius scenarios and then selected the scenarios which focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on/uni00A0the use of carbon sinks to produce the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway we/uni00A0have used for target setting.\n\nt",

This is tracked, measured and reported using the Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) metric and methodology. Our NCF calculation includes the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell that is used by our customers. This includes the emissions associated with the production, processing, transport and end use of these products. Also included are emissions from other elements of this life cycle not owned or controlled by Shell, such as\n\noil and gas that we process but do not produce, or emissions from oil products and electricity marketed by Shell that have not been processed or generated at a Shell facility. The calculation also subtracts emissions for those that are stored by using carbon capture and storage (CCS) or are offset using natural carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands. Chemicals and lubricants products, which are not used to produce energy, are excluded from the scope of this metric. The carbon intensity of the energy products we sell is expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per megajoule consumed.\n\n## Scope of our Net Carbon Footprint\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Impact of physical risks and adaptation measures\n\nThe physical effects of climate change may increase Shell's exposure to hazards that could potentially include, for example, higher air and sea temperatures, rising sea levels, an increased chance of flooding and droughts, wildfires and more severe tropical storms. They could potentially impact our operations and supply chains. There could also be potential financial implications, such as increased operating costs and lower revenue because of decreased efficiency.\n\nThe potential impacts of physical risks to Shell facilities, where processes, equipment and safety could be affected, are reasonably understood in Shell's oil and gas businesses. For example, rising temperatures could potentially impact the efficiency of our plants, increase equipment corrosion and decrease gas pipeline capacity. Rising sea levels could potentially impact our coastal facilities through increased coastal erosion/uni00A0and flooding, damage to jetties, and salt-water intrusion in/uni00A0freshwater intake.\n\nThe potential impacts of physical risks to the wider environment and their indirect effect on our facilities is an area that we continue to monitor and evaluate within the local context. Such risks could potentially disrupt our/uni00A0operations by affecting people, infrastructure or supply chains. For/uni00A0example, wildfires and droughts could disrupt feedstock supply for biofuels or make it difficult to access assets, including areas that support our nature-based solutions programme. Floods, meanwhile, could affect staff and communities in low-lying areas.\n\nMeasures to adapt to climate change could help reduce the impact of some of these physical climate change risks. These measures can range from local actions for a specific facility, to more general changes, such as adjustments to engineering design codes and alterations to the set limits and conditions within which facilities are deemed safe to operate. For example, Shell has already completed or started to implement solutions like pumping sand on beaches in to order to stabilise them, dredging works, and using a hovercraft for transport between islands.\n\n## OUR PORTFOLIO AND CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nWe aim to grow our business in areas that will be essential in the energy transition, and where we see growth in demand over the next decade.\n\nWe are seeking cost-effective ways of managing GHG emissions in line with our NCF ambition. We also intend to help customers choose options with lower carbon intensity by bringing to market products with lower carbon intensity, in line with demand. We seek to help reduce global GHG emissions by:\n\n- \u25a0 developing carbon capture and storage (CCS);\n- \u25a0 supplying more natural gas to replace coal for power generation;\n- \u25a0 implementing energy-efficiency measures in our operations where reasonably practicable;\n- \u25a0 maintaining a focus on using natural gas and renewable electricity to/uni00A0generate power; and\n- \u25a0 developing new fuels for transport such as advanced biofuels and hydrogen;\n- \u25a0 working with nature-based solutions.\n- See further information on portfolio decisions in 'Integrated Gas' on/uni00A0page 47, 'Upstream' on page 54, 'Oil Products' on page 72, and/uni00A0'Chemicals' on page 78.\n\n## NATURAL GAS\n\nNatural gas is the least polluting hydrocarbon. It produces less than one-tenth of the air pollution that coal does when burned to generate electricity. Increasing the role that gas plays in the energy mix is one way/uni00A0countries can take action as the world moves to a net-zero emissions/uni00A0future./uni00A0\n\nNatural gas is an abundant, secure and readily available source of energy, one of the few that can be used across power generation, industry, the built environment and transport. Gas has significant advantages when used to generate power alongside renewables: it/uni00A0can/uni00A0quickly compensate for dips in supply from solar or wind generation, and can rapidly respond to surges in demand.\n\nIn 2020, gas accounted for around 47% of Shell's total production. We/uni00A0are a leading producer, marketer and trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids (GTL) products. In our new strategy, launched in February 2021, one of the energy transition milestones by 2030 is that we expect the percentage of total gas production in our portfolio to gradually rise to around 55% or more.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Integrated Gas' part on page 46.\n\n## Methane emissions\n\nNatural gas consists mainly of methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and has a much higher global warming impact than CO2. Efforts to address climate change therefore require the industry to reduce both deliberate and unintended methane emissions.\n\nThe IEA estimates that natural gas operations have an average methane leakage rate of 1.7%. At this rate, natural gas emits between 45% and 55% less GHG than coal when burned at a power plant. Higher levels of/uni00A0methane emissions reduce this benefit.\n\nIn 2018, Shell announced an industry-leading target of keeping its methane emissions intensity below 0.2% by 2025. This target covers all the Shell-operated oil and gas facilities in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. The baseline and target intensities are expressed as percentage figures, representing estimated methane emissions from Shell-operated oil and gas facilities as a percentage of the total amount of/uni00A0gas marketed, or the quantity of marketed oil and condensate where facilities have no marketed gas (for example, those that re-inject produced gas). Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example, in flares and turbines.\n\nThe largest contributor to our reported methane emissions in 2020 was/uni00A0the flaring and venting of gas (including equipment venting) in our upstream oil and gas operations. We are working to reduce methane emissions from these sources by reducing the overall level of flaring and venting. We also continue to implement programmes across our sites to identify and stop unintended leaks and to replace or repair high-emission equipment, such as high-bleed pneumatic devices. We continue to work on confirming that we have identified all potential methane sources and reported our emissions from these sources in line with regulations and industry standards.\n\nt",

In 2020, we signed a contract with Avitas, a GE Venture, to/uni00A0expand the use of drones to enhance our existing leak detection and repair programme in the Permian Basin. As a result, we started the drone programme on one of our shales businesses, across sites that have the potential to emit methane./uni00A0\n\nWe played an active role in the advisory committee of The University of Texas at Austin's Project Astra which plans to establish a proof-of-concept network of methane detection sensors in the Permian Basin for highfrequency monitoring.\n\nWe have also tested fixed-based methane detection sensors in our Rocky/uni00A0Mountain House (Canada) asset.\n\nAt our Shell ONEgas facilities in the North Sea, we have reduced methane emissions by around 55%, (around 2,000 tonnes) since 2017. We have done this through improvements that reduce gas venting, such as/uni00A0minimising valve leakage and substituting nitrogen for natural gas when/uni00A0purging potentially explosive oxygen from equipment. ONEgas also continues efforts to improve the accuracy of its measurement of methane emissions. It is planning a trial of drone-mounted sensors in 2021,/uni00A0to see whether they provide a better way of quantifying emissions/uni00A0from platforms.\n\n## Methane initiatives and collaborations\n\nWe participate in a number of voluntary initiatives to encourage industry-wide action to reduce methane emissions.\n\nIn 2017, we joined the Climate and Clean Air Coalition Oil and Gas Methane Partnership. This brings together industry, governments and NGOs to improve the quantification of methane emissions globally and/uni00A0to/uni00A0work on reducing them.\n\nAlso in 2017, Shell formed an industry coalition, supported by organisations such as the Environmental Defense Fund, the UN Environment Programme and the World Bank, to develop a set of/uni00A0Methane Guiding Principles. These principles focus on:\n\n- \u25a0 advancing strong performance across gas value chains;\n- \u25a0 continually reducing methane emissions;\n- \u25a0 improving the accuracy of methane emissions data;\n- \u25a0 increasing transparency.\n- \u25a0 advocating sound policies and regulations on methane emissions; and\n\nShell has been involved in developing all actions associated with the Methane Guiding Principles, including the establishment of a major global/uni00A0outreach programme. This programme seeks to address gaps in knowledge about managing methane emissions. It provides high-quality educational material and courses covering methane science, methane reduction strategies and planning, measurement techniques, technology, policy, and where to get guidance and support. The publicly accessible programme consists of two courses: an executive course for senior managers and executives, and masterclasses for managers of frontline staff. By the end of 2020, the Methane Guiding Principles had been signed by 23 companies.\n\nIn 2020, we became a founding signatory to the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, the new gold-standard reporting framework that is/uni00A0designed to enhance reporting accuracy and transparency on methane/uni00A0emissions in the oil and gas sector.\n\n## The Methane Guiding Principles\n\nThe Methane Guiding Principles focus on reducing methane emissions across the natural gas supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Continually reduce methane emissions\n- 2. Advance strong performance across the gas supply chain\n- 3. Improve accuracy of methane emissions data\n- 4. Advocate sound policy and regulations on methane emissions\n- 5. Increase transparency\n\nShell is a member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a CEO-led effort to lead the industry's response to climate change. One of OGCI's focus areas is methane management. In 2018, OGCI announced a target of reducing the collective average methane intensity of its members' aggregated upstream gas and oil operations by one-fifth, to below 0.25%/uni00A0by 2025, with an ambition to achieve 0.2%, which would be a/uni00A0reduction of one-third./uni00A0\n\n## Methane emissions performance\n\nIn 2020, our overall methane intensity was 0.06% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.01% for facilities without marketed gas. Intensities at facility level ranged from below 0.01% to 0.6%. We believe our methane emissions are calculated using the best methods currently available: a combination of industry-standard emission factors (established emission rates per throughput or per piece of equipment), engineering calculations and some actual measurements. There are still uncertainties associated with quantifying methane emissions with the available methodologies. To reduce these uncertainties, our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses are rolling out methane improvement programmes to further improve data quality and reporting. The improvement programmes will also continue leak detection and repair initiatives, and make use of methane abatement opportunities. By 2025, all Shell-operated facilities are expected to have implemented more robust quantification methodologies. Externally, we continue to work on new technologies and improved quantification methods through partnerships and other initiatives such as the OGCI.\n\nDetailed information on our approach to managing methane emissions and performance is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.",

These include Shell's activities in integrated power, hydrogen, nature-based solutions (NBS) and carbon capture and storage (CCS). We want to find ways of helping customers - be they households or businesses - to switch to low-carbon and renewable electricity. That is why we are also developing digitally-enabled platforms that will provide customers with services that make it easier for them to/uni00A0decarbonise and accelerate their progress in this area. We could invest/uni00A0on/uni00A0average $2-3 billion each year in our Renewables and Energy/uni00A0Solutions business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Integrated Gas' on page 50.\n\n## Power\n\nElectricity is the fastest-growing part of the energy system and when generated from renewable sources has a major role to play in reducing GHG emissions. Shell is building an interconnected power business that is designed to be sustainable and offer long-term opportunities. We aim to sell some 560 terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, which is twice as much electricity as we sell today. Our integrated power strategy will help Shell in its broader aim to accelerate its transformation into a provider of net-zero emissions energy products and services./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Integrated Gas' on page 50.\n\n## Low-carbon fuels\n\nShell believes that low-carbon fuels will play a valuable role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the transport sector in the coming decades. Low-carbon fuels projects and operations around the world form/uni00A0part of a wider commitment to provide a range of energy choices for/uni00A0customers.\n\nIn 2020, around 9.5 billion litres of biofuels went into Shell's petrol and diesel worldwide. This helped us to make progress towards achieving our climate ambition while complying with applicable mandates and targets in the markets where we operate. Through our own long-established sustainability clauses in supply contracts, we request that all biofuels we/uni00A0buy are produced in ways that are environmentally and socially responsible throughout the production chain. Currently, most available biofuels are produced from cereals, vegetable oils and sugar cane. From cultivation to use, biofuels can emit significantly less CO2 compared with conventional gasoline. This depends on several factors, such as how the/uni00A0feedstock is cultivated and the way the biofuels are produced. Other challenges include concerns over labour rights, the amount of water used in the production process, and competition for land use between biofuels and food crops./uni00A0\n\nOver three-quarters of the biofuels we buy are from North American or/uni00A0European feedstock producers. Both regions have regulations for agricultural practices including in relation to sustainability.\n\nWe continue to support the adoption of international sustainability standards, including those of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS), the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Bonsucro, an organisation for the certification of sugar cane. We also support the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme for feedstocks. We/uni00A0aim to increase the percentage of volumes that are certified according to these robust multi-stakeholder standards.\n\nCurrently, more than 97% of our purchased volumes of biofuels are either covered by our supplier-agreed contract sustainability clauses or certified as sustainable by an independent auditor. We aim to increase the percentage of volumes that are certified according to robust multistakeholder standards.\n\nThe Ra\u00edzen joint venture (Shell interest 50%, not operated by Shell) in Brazil has produced low-carbon biofuel from sugar cane since 2011. Through Ra\u00edzen, Shell is a significant biofuels producer. Ra\u00edzen hosts the/uni00A0first commercial advanced bioethanol facility and the fourth largest/uni00A0renewable natural gas (RNG) facility in the world.\n\nAs part of our target to be a net-zero energy business by 2050, in step with society, we seek to reduce the carbon intensity of the products we sell. This means transforming our refining footprint, keeping sites in key locations but manufacturing low-carbon fuels suitable for use as aviation, road transport and shipping fuels or as a chemical feedstock (for liquid crackers). In 2020, our Rheinland refinery in Germany produced nearly 100 million litres of renewable diesel, produced from sustainably sourced vegetable fats and oils Our production strategy is anchored around access to competitive feedstock, commercialisation of advanced technology, supportive government policy, and building internal capability.\n\nWe are also investing in new facilities that are able to produce sustainable low-carbon fuel suitable for use as aviation, road transport and shipping fuels or chemical feedstock for liquid crackers. Shell's hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology yields up to 65% low-carbon fuels compared to fossil diesel and aviation equivalent. If HEFA technology is used with green hydrogen - produced by using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis it/uni00A0can increase the energy content and further reduce the carbon content of the fuels produced.\n\nWe are working on a project to add a HEFA facility at our Pernis refinery in the Netherlands. If this project went ahead, production would start in/uni00A0around three to four years. The proposed facility could convert waste fats and oils and other sources into sustainable low carbon vehicle and/uni00A0aviation fuels. A final investment decision has not yet been taken.\n\nt",

This plant, a joint venture with/uni00A0Enerkem, Proman, Suncor and Invest Quebec (Shell interest 40%), will produce biofuels and renewable chemical products using nonrecyclable waste from the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors,/uni00A0from construction, renovation and demolition debris and from/uni00A0residual forest biomass./uni00A0\n\nIn line with our strategy of developing more sustainable feedstocks for transport, we are investing in renewable natural gas (RNG) for use in natural-gas-fuelled vehicles in the USA and Europe. RNG is produced from biogas collected from landfill sites, or via the anaerobic digestion of food waste or manure. It is then processed until it is fully interchangeable with conventional natural gas. The use of RNG in natural-gas vehicles, either in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) or LNG, offers customers a way to lower their carbon footprint.\n\nThe heavy-duty road transport sector is starting to use RNG in its efforts to/uni00A0decarbonise. Shell recently won tenders to supply RNG to fuel around 300/uni00A0of the Los Angeles (LA) bus fleet and vehicles of the West LA waste haulers fleet./uni00A0\n\nShell has taken a final investment decision (FID) to construct, own and operate its first renewable compressed natural gas (R-CNG) fuelling site in the USA. This will be at Shell's products distribution complex in Carson, California. The R-CNG will be sourced from Shell's renewable natural gas projects in the USA, which are currently Shell Junction City in Oregon and Shell Galloway in Plains, Kansas. These convert wastes, such as dairy cow manure and agricultural residues, into pipeline-quality natural gas. Shell will be able to substantially decarbonise the transport of its products from the Carson complex by providing 100% R-CNG to its haulage partners, who are equipped with ultra-low nitrogen oxide natural gas vehicles.\n\n## CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE\n\nCCS is a technology used for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) before it is/uni00A0emitted into the atmosphere, then transporting it, and injecting it into a deep geological formation for permanent storage. The majority of climate change scenarios produced by organisations such as IEA, IPCC and Shell require a large component of CCS in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. We recognise the scale of the challenge in developing CCS globally as quickly as is required.\n\nIn 2020, we refreshed our CCS strategy. We placed greater emphasis on/uni00A0how CCS could enable the energy transition for low-carbon fuels and power, and for industrial hub developments where CO2 from different industrial sources is routed to a single storage location. We seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year CCS capacity by 2035.\n\nIn 2020, Shell invested around $70 million in CCS. This included progressing opportunities and operating costs for CCS assets in which/uni00A0Shell has an interest.\n\nBy the end of 2020, our Quest CCS project in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 since it began operating in 2015. Quest CCS was designed to capture about 1 million tonnes of CO2 each year. The storage reservoir proved to have a significant capacity for CO2 injection and strong capture reliability with less than 1% downtime annually. This means the facility could exceed its target and reduce estimated costs.\n\nThe Gorgon CCS project in Australia (Shell interest 25%, operated by/uni00A0Chevron) started operating in August 2019. It had stored more than/uni00A04/uni00A0million tonnes of CO2 by the end of 2020.\n\nIn Norway, Shell, our project partners and the Norwegian government took the final investment decision (FID) on the Northern Lights CCS project in 2020. This project aims to become the first carbon storage facility with capacity to transport and store CO2 from industrial facilities in Norway and potentially from across Europe.\n\nShell is also involved in the Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM), in Norway. TCM is a centre for testing and improving carbon capture technology.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we have signed a joint-development agreement to/uni00A0assess the potential to export CO2 from our Pernis refinery to a Rotterdam-based CO2 transport and storage provider.\n\nIn the UK, we are collaborating with other companies to further understand the potential of CCS. Projects include how to decarbonise our/uni00A0own facilities, to deliver gas power and low-carbon hydrogen.\n\nIn other regions, we are pursuing opportunities which are currently in early/uni00A0development phases.\n\nShell recognises the role of policy as a key enabler for implementing CCS. We are a member of several industry organisations that actively advocate CCS, such as the Zero Emissions Platform in the EU, the American Petroleum Institute in the USA, and the Carbon Capture and Storage Association in the UK. Shell makes representations and contributes to technical and policy papers through these organisations. In 2020, Shell submitted responses to a number of consultations on aspects of CCS, individually and through industry associations, in the EU, USA, UK and other jurisdictions.\n\nShell is participating in the OGCI's KickStarter initiative to unlock large-scale investment in CCS./uni00A0The initiative is designed to help decarbonise industrial hubs around the world and started with hubs including North America, North-west Europe and China.\n\n## NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS\n\nWe believe that nature will play an important role in the transition to a low-carbon world. Using nature to absorb carbon dioxide helps to limit the overall stock of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere. This can serve as a temporary solution until other low-carbon alternatives are deployed at scale, or it can compensate for emissions that are unavoidable./uni00A0\n\nAs customers' and society's demand for the use of low-carbon products and services grows, nature-based solutions are becoming an increasingly attractive option for emissions offsetting for a range of industries and/uni00A0operators.\n\nNature-based projects typically involve protecting or redeveloping natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands, so they can capture and store more carbon. These projects generate carbon emission rights that can be/uni00A0bought by energy consumers around the world. They also support conservation of biodiversity and offer alternative sources of income to/uni00A0local communities.",

In 2020, Shell invested around $90 million in nature-based projects that reduce or avoid emissions and can also benefit ecosystems by improving biodiversity, water quality and flood protection. This in turn can improve the livelihoods of people in local/uni00A0communities.\n\nOur ambition is to invest around $100 million per year in nature-based projects that reduce or avoid CO2 emissions and offer other valuable ecosystem benefits. We aim to use nature-based solutions, in line with the philosophy of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate, to offset emissions of around 120 million tonnes a year by 2030, through projects of the highest independently verified quality.\n\nIn 2020, we developed a screening process with clear criteria to help ensure that we invest in nature-based solutions projects that are of high quality and integrity. The criteria include but are not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 selecting projects that deliver wider environmental and social benefits;\n- \u25a0 selecting only projects that are certified under credible, high-quality and independent carbon-credit standards;\n- \u25a0 working to ensure project developers maintain appropriate health, safety, security and social governance standards; and\n- \u25a0 having an independent third party audit our internal nature-based project screening review and management processes.\n\nIn 2019, we started offering what we called 'carbon-neutral driving' to/uni00A0our retail customers. We offered service-station customers in the Netherlands and the UK nature-based carbon credits to offset the CO2 emissions generated by the extraction, refining, distribution and use of the/uni00A0Shell fuel they buy. By the end of 2020, around 18% of Shell's retail customers in the Netherlands and around 15% of our UK service-station customers were driving carbon neutral. So too were more than 200 fleet/uni00A0customers in 12 countries who took advantage of similar offers for/uni00A0businesses.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to roll out our carbon-neutral retail offer in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Canada, and via a third-party reseller/uni00A0agreement in Denmark. We also offer a growing range of products with nature-based carbon credits, including home energy in the/uni00A0UK, LNG in Asia, bitumen in Europe, and selected lubricants.\n\nIn 2020, we took another step to scale up our activities in natural ecosystems by acquiring Select Carbon, a specialist company that partners with farmers, pastoralists and other landowners in Australia to/uni00A0develop carbon farming projects, where plants are grown and soil/uni00A0managed to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nFor more information, see the Shell Sustainability Report, due to be published in April 2021.\n\n## OUR PERFORMANCE Shell's carbon intensity\n\nShell's carbon intensity provides an annual measure of the life-cycle emissions intensity of the portfolio of energy products sold. Specifically, we calculate the carbon intensity (gCO2e/MJ) in terms of the grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e) per unit of energy (MJ) sold. This is measured, tracked and reported using the Net carbon Footprint (NCF) metric and methodology.\n\nShell's NCF is not calculated by simply dividing total emissions by total energy, nor is it an inventory of absolute emissions. Instead, Shell calculates the life-cycle carbon intensity of each of the different energy products it sells. Once we have calculated the carbon intensity for each individual energy product, we then calculate the overall carbon intensity by taking a weighted average of the individual product intensities, with the/uni00A0weighting based on their sales volumes. This approach enables like-for-like comparisons across a range of energy products and allows us/uni00A0to establish the average carbon intensity for all the energy products we/uni00A0sell, including renewables.\n\nFinally, we deduct, or \"net off\", any emissions that are stored in carbon sinks. For example, we subtract emissions that are stored using carbon capture and storage in our own operations. We also subtract any carbon/uni00A0dioxide emissions that are removed from the atmosphere and stored using natural carbon sinks created using nature-based solutions, such as reforestation.\n\nWhile Shell's NCF is an intensity measure and not an inventory of absolute emissions, a notional estimate of the amount of CO2e emissions covered by the scope of the Net Carbon Footprint calculation can be derived from/uni00A0the final Net Carbon Footprint value for any year.\n\n## Net carbon intensity performance Our NCF performance\n\n|                                                          | NCF in the reference year (2016) = 79 gCO2e/MJ   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| NCF                                                      | gCO2e/ MJ                                        | 79     | 78     | 75     |\n| Estimated total energy  delivered by Shell [A]           | trillion (10^12) MJ                              | 22     | 21.05  | 18.4   |\n| Estimated total GHG  emissions included in  NCF [B], [C] | million tonnes CO2e                              | 1,731  | 1,646  | 1,384  |\n\nWe have received third-party limited assurance on our carbon intensity, measured and reported using the Net Carbon Footprint, for the years from 2016 to 2020. Shell's NCF in 2020 was 75 gCO2e/MJ, a 4% reduction from the previous year and a 5% reduction from the 2016 reference year. One of the major causes of this larger than expected reduction in 2020 was lower demand for energy, especially for oil and gas. Demand for oil products experienced the most significant reduction, followed by natural gas and LNG. Another important factor contributing to the reduction of the NCF was the increase in our power sales in absolute terms as well as their share of the energy mix sold by Shell. The/uni00A0power we sold also had a lower average emissions intensity than in/uni00A0previous years, which further contributed to the overall NCF reduction.\n\nt",

Our NCF is calculated by taking a/uni00A0weighted average of these individual carbon intensities, with the weighting based on their sales volumes.\n\n## Carbon intensity of Shell's energy product types [A] (gCO2e/MJ)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A] Emissions included in carbon intensity of power have been calculated using the market-based method in 2020\n\nFor hydrocarbon fuels, emissions from end use by customers are by far the biggest contributors to the carbon intensity of the product. As a result, the emissions intensity of hydrocarbon fuels is expected to stay relatively unchanged over time.\n\nThis contrasts with the emissions intensity of power, which can be highly variable depending on how it has been generated. To a lesser extent, there is also a contrast between hydrocarbon fuels and biofuels, which can vary significantly in intensity depending on the feedstock and production process used.\n\nThe proportion of our renewable power sales and countries where we sell power to the market both affect Shell's overall power mix and its resulting emissions intensity. The carbon intensity of biofuels provided in the graph 'Carbon intensity of Shell's energy product types' reflects the global average for biofuels sold by Shell.\n\nOur strategy is to reduce our Net Carbon Footprint, mainly by increasing the proportion of lower-carbon products such as natural gas, biofuels, electricity and hydrogen in the mix of products that we sell to our customers.\n\n## GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nData in this section are reported on a 100% basis in respect of activities where we are the operator. Reporting on this operational control basis/uni00A0differs from that applied for financial reporting purposes in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 216-264. Detailed data and information on our 2020 environmental and social performance are expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021./uni00A0\n\n## GHG Performance\n\nOur direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) decreased from 70 million tonnes of CO/uni2082 equivalent in 2019 to 63 million tonnes of CO/uni2082 equivalent in 2020. The main contributors to this decrease were divestments, (for example, in/uni00A0Canada and the USA), and reduced utilisation at a number of assets caused by lower demand driven by COVID-19. The level of flaring in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses combined decreased by around 35% compared with 2019. In 2019, our Prelude floating LNG facility in Australia had experienced an unanticipated spike in flaring during its start-up. In February 2020, we had to shut down Prelude which resulted in/uni00A0a decrease of its GHG emissions by around 80% compared with 2019./uni00A0\n\nIn 2015, we signed up to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. This seeks to ensure that all stakeholders, including governments and companies, work together to address routine flaring. Flaring, or burning off, of gas in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses contributed around 6% of our overall direct GHG emissions in 2020. Around 35% of this flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas produced with oil, known as associated/uni00A0gas.\n\nAround 45% of flaring in our Upstream and Integrated Gas facilities in 2020 occurred in assets operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). Flaring from SPDC-operated facilities decreased by around 15% in 2020 compared with 2019. SPDC, in close collaboration with its joint-venture partners and the Federal Government of Nigeria, continues to make progress towards the objective of ending the continuous flaring of associated gas. Two new gas-gathering projects (Adibawa and Otumara) came on stream at the end of 2017, followed by two more (the Forcados Yokri Integrated Project and Southern Swamp Associated Gas Gathering Solutions) in 2019./uni00A0\n\nOur indirect GHG emissions associated with imported energy (Scope 2) were 9 million tonnes in 2020 (using market-based method), down from 10/uni00A0million in 2019, in part driven by divestments (for example in Canada) and lower demand for imported electricity due to reduced utilisation.\n\n## Our GHG emissions\n\n| Scope 1 [A]   | million tonnes CO/uni2082   | 71    | 70    | 63    |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Scope 2 [B]   | million tonnes CO/uni2082   | 11    | 10    | 9     |\n| Scope 3 [C]   | million tonnes CO/uni2082   | 1,637 | 1,551 | 1,305 |\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n- [A]  total direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions from assets and activities under operational control boundary [B]  total indirect GHG emissions from imported energy (Scope 2) from assets and activities under operational control boundary\n- [C] indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) based on the energy product sales included in the NCF boundary.

This was partly because of/uni00A0our Prelude FLNG asset being shut down in February 2020.\n\nThe Refining GHG intensity - measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent per Solomon's Utilised Equivalent Distillation Capacity (UEDC\u2122) - decreased from 1.06 in 2019 to 1.05 in 2020. This was mainly driven by divestment of/uni00A0our Martinez refinery in the USA.\n\nThe Chemicals GHG intensity - measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent per/uni00A0tonne of high value chemicals - decreased from 1.04 in 2019 to 0.98/uni00A0in 2020. This was mainly because of increased utilisation following turnarounds on three of our sites in 2019.\n\nGHG emissions and energy consumption data and information in accordance with UK regulations.\n\nGHG emissions comprise CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. The data are calculated using locally regulated methods where they exist. Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2009 American Petroleum Institute (API) Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies, which is the/uni00A0recognised industry standard under the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry guidelines (API/International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP)/IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance) indicate that a number of sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| Emissions (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent)   |      |      |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Total global direct (Scope 1) [A]              | 63   | 70   |\n| UK including offshore area [B]                 | 2.0  | 2.1  |\n| Total global energy indirect (Scope 2) [C]     | 9    | 10   |\n| UK including offshore area [D]                 | 0.0  | 0.0  |\n| Intensity ratio (tonne/tonne)                  |      |      |\n| All facilities [E]                             | 0.25 | 0.24 |\n\nThe energy consumption data provided below comprise own energy, generated and consumed by our facilities, and supplied energy (electricity, steam and heat) purchased by our facilities for our own use.\n\nEnergy consumption data reflect primary (thermal) energy (e.g. the energy content of fuels used to generate electricity, steam, heat, mechanical energy etc.). This includes energy from renewable and non-renewable sources. Own energy generated was calculated by multiplying the volumes of fuels consumed for energy purposes by their respective lower heating values. Own energy generated that was exported to third-party assets or to the power grid is excluded. Thermal energy for purchased and consumed electricity was calculated using actual electricity purchased multiplied by country-specific electricity generation efficiency factors (from IEA statistics). Thermal energy for purchased and consumed steam and heat was calculated from actual steam/heat purchased multiplied by a supplier-specific conversion efficiency, or generic efficiency factor where supplier-specific data were not available.\n\n## Energy consumption (billion kilowatt-hours)\n\n|                                     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Own energy generated and consumed   |        |        |\n| Total energy generated and consumed | 202    | 220    |\n| UK including offshore area          | 7. 6   | 7. 6   |\n| Purchased and consumed energy       |        |        |\n| Total purchased and consumed energy | 38     | 44     |\n| UK including offshore area          | 0.2    | 0.2    |\n| Energy consumption                  |        |        |\n| Total energy consumed               | 240    | 264    |\n| UK including offshore area          | 7. 8   | 7. 8   |\n\nIn 2020, we implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy use/uni00A0and increase the energy efficiency of our operations. Examples of/uni00A0some of/uni00A0the principal measures taken are listed below:\n\n- \u25a0 At our Bukom facility in Singapore, we completed two projects to minimise energy loss from steam.\n- \u25a0 At our Clipper facility in the UK, we completed a project to optimise the/uni00A0use of compressors.\n- \u25a0 At our Scotford upgrader facility in Canada, we completed several projects to minimise energy use and improve efficiency, for example by/uni00A0removing equipment from service or replacing it with more efficient/uni00A0equipment.\n- \u25a0 At our Mobile facility in the USA, we installed new equipment to increase heat transfer between heat exchangers in order to improve the energy efficiency of the units.\n- \u25a0 At our Geismar facility in the USA, we improved flare staging and/uni00A0temperature control which resulted in lower levels of natural gas/uni00A0consumption.\n- \u25a0 At our GTL facility in Qatar, we completed several projects to reduce energy use and improve efficiency, for example by minimising the generation of excess steam and converting excess energy into electricity for export to the public grid.\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, we reduced fuel usage of vessels by optimising how they operate in dynamic position, stand-by and navigation modes.\n\nDetailed information on our 2020 GHG emissions and energy use is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021 and on our website./uni00A0\n\nThe statements in this 'Climate change and energy transition' section, including those relating to the Net Carbon Footprint targets, are forward-looking statements based on management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to/uni00A0differ materially from those expressed or implied herein./uni00A0\n\n- See 'About this Report' on pages iii-iv and 'Risk factors' on pages/uni00A028-37.\n\nt",

This/uni00A0total consisted of employees in Shell and employees in certain Upstream, Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions (formerly New Energies) companies that operate more autonomously than other Shell subsidiaries and maintain their own HR systems./uni00A0\n\nThe total of 87,000 employees at December 31, 2020 was the same as at/uni00A0December 31, 2019.\n\nThere were 81,000 employees in Shell, excluding those in companies with/uni00A0their own HR systems, at December 31, 2018.\n\nAs part of Reshape initiative, Shell expects to reduce between 7,000 and/uni00A09,000 jobs by the end of 2022, as it seeks to reduce costs and restructures with the aim of becoming a more streamlined, more competitive organisation that is nimbler and better able to respond to customers. The job reductions will include around 1,500 people who have already decided to take voluntary redundancy in 2020, but will exclude anybody who may leave Shell because of divestments. Shell will conduct the job reductions process in accordance with our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. We will seek at all times to show care for anyone who loses their role. Job and cost reductions are in comparison with December 31, 2019.\n\nThe table below shows actual employee numbers by geographical area.

        "page_content": "## EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION AND INVOLVEMENT\n\nWe strive to maintain a healthy employee and industrial relations environment. We seek to ensure that our work practices involve dialogue between management and employees - both directly and, where appropriate, through employee representative bodies. Management regularly engages with our employees through a range of formal and informal channels. These include webcasts and all-staff messages from our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden, senior leader webcasts, town halls, team meetings, virtual coffee/chai connects, interviews with Senior Management and online publications via our intranet. For further information on stakeholder engagement, see the \"Governance\" section on/uni00A0pages 138-139./uni00A0\n\nWe promote safe reporting of views about our processes and practices. In/uni00A0addition to local channels, the Shell Global Helpline enables our people and third parties to report potential breaches of the Shell General/uni00A0Business Principles and Shell Code of Conduct, confidentially and anonymously, in a variety of languages. In 2020, 1,425 cases were reported via the Shell Global Helpline: 1,153 allegations and 272 inquiries. In 2019, 1,686 cases were reported via the Shell Global Helpline: 1,278 allegations and 408 inquiries. Shell Internal Audit (SIA) is the custodian of the Shell Global Helpline process, which is managed by an independent third party. SIA is accountable for ensuring that the Shell Global Helpline functions as intended and that all allegations of Code of Conduct breaches (including bribery and corruption) are investigated and followed up appropriately. The Board has formally delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility for reviewing the functioning of the Shell Global Helpline and the reports arising from its operation. The Audit Committee is also authorised to establish and monitor the implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, proportionate and independent investigation and follow-up action of reported matters.\n\nStrong employee engagement is especially important in maintaining strong business delivery in times of change. The Shell People Survey is/uni00A0one/uni00A0of the principal tools used to measure employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to Shell. It provides insights into employees' views and has had a consistently high response rate. In 2020, the response rate was 86.1%, our highest ever level and an increase of 0.6/uni00A0percentage points compared with 2019. The average employee engagement score was 78/uni00A0points out of 100, the same as in 2019. This result gives Shell one of the leading employee engagement scores across/uni00A0a range of industries.\n\nIn 2020, we faced the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In response, we strengthened the country chair network so we could respond locally to the/uni00A0challenges of the pandemic as experienced by our staff, businesses, suppliers and customers. We also provided global support on health. We offered a home-working ergonomics programme, which involved more than 50,000 staff having a health-based risk assessment, receiving advice and if necessary receiving support to buy office and IT equipment. We established a Care for Self programme to encourage staff to pay attention to their physical and mental well-being, and to support them as they did so. This was considered particularly important, given the stresses placed on staff by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns./uni00A0\n\n## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION\n\nOur diversity and inclusion approach focuses on hiring, developing and retaining the best people.\n\nEmbedding the principles of diversity and inclusion in the way we do business improves our understanding of the needs of our people, partners, suppliers and customers. A diverse workforce, and an inclusive, caring environment that respects and nurtures diverse people, help us to improve our safety and business performance.\n\nWe continue to focus on recruiting, developing and promoting more women, and we are supporting initiatives that encourage girls to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). We also do/uni00A0this by creating a culture of respect and inclusion. Our CEO Ben van Beurden joined the Catalyst CEO Champions for Change, a group of more than 50 CEOs who pledge to support women's advancement at all levels of leadership. Our CEO actively supports the Shell global gender gap campaign, which seeks to close the gender gap in STEM roles.\n\nIn 2020, 49% of our graduate recruits were female, compared with 48% in 2019. At the end of 2020, the proportion of women in senior leadership positions was 27.8 %, an increase of 1.4 percentage points compared with the end of 2019. 'Senior leadership positions' is a Shell measure based on salary group levels and is distinct from the term 'senior manager' in the statutory disclosures set out below.\n\n## Gender diversity data (at December 31, 2020)\n\nNumber\n\n|                          |   Men | Men   |   Women | Women   |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Directors of the Company |     8 | 62%   |       5 | 38%     |\n| Senior managers [A]      |   632 | 71%   |     258 | 29%     |\n| Employees (thousand)     |    59 | 68%   |      28 | 32%     |\n\nWe are creating an environment where people with disabilities can excel. We will provide support and can make adjustments for people with disabilities through the recruitment process and throughout their careers with/uni00A0Shell, including equal access to valuable educational resources, training programmes, and emphasis on personal and professional development.\n\nOur workplace accessibility service currently serves 83 locations globally. The service is designed to ensure that all employees have access to reasonable physical workplace or other adjustments so that they can/uni00A0work/uni00A0effectively and productively.\n\nTo further support our employees with disabilities, we have created internal employee networks, including the enABLE networks that support and highlight the work of disabled employees in Shell. First launched in the/uni00A0UK in 2005, we now have 13 enABLE networks in countries including Brazil, Canada, France, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. The disability and enablement focus area is sponsored by Harry Brekelmans, Executive Director for Projects & Technology and Huibert Vigeveno, Executive Director for Downstream.\n\nShell is a member of the disability campaign The Valuable 500, which seeks to eliminate the exclusion of disabled people worldwide and ensure disability remains a priority for global business leaders. We are also members of Business Disability Forum, a membership organisation that exists to create a disability smart world by linking businesses, disabled people, and government, and Purplespace, a networking and professional development hub for disabled employees, employee network leads and allies from all sectors and trades./uni00A0\n\nAt Shell, we support and enable remarkable people from every background, and strive to be a leader in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) inclusion in the workplace. We have pledged support for the UN LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business. We benchmark ourselves externally, with consistent top-tier results. For example, in 2020, in the USA we earned a 100% score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, a recognition we have earned annually since 2016. In 2020, Shell has again been benchmarked as a top employer in the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark inclusive workplace survey, scoring 94.2% compared with a median score of 50-60%.\n\nt",

The forum is taking action in a number of areas, for example,/uni00A0strengthening our approach to talent development and industry/uni00A0collaborations, including with non-governmental organisations.\n\nShell has established a global D&I Council for Race, sponsored by our/uni00A0CEO Ben van Beurden.

The programme is underpinned by our commitment to prohibit bribery, money laundering and tax evasion, and/uni00A0to/uni00A0conduct business in line with our Shell General Business Principles/uni00A0and Code of Conduct./uni00A0\n\nWe do not tolerate the direct or indirect offer, payment, solicitation or/uni00A0acceptance of bribes in any form. Facilitation payments are also prohibited. The Shell Code of Conduct includes specific guidance for/uni00A0Shell/uni00A0staff, (which comprises employees and contract staff), on requirements to avoid or declare actual, potential or perceived conflicts/uni00A0of/uni00A0interest, and on offering or accepting gifts and hospitality./uni00A0\n\nCommunications from our leaders emphasise the importance of these commitments and compliance with requirements. These are reinforced with both global and targeted communications to ensure that Shell staff are frequently reminded of their obligations. To support the Code of Conduct, we have mandatory risk-based procedures and controls that address a range of compliance risks and ensure that we focus resources, reporting and attention appropriately. By making a commitment to our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people, and by following the Code of Conduct, we protect Shell's reputation.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought additional focus on conduct risk. Our core values are undermined if decisions are taken which fall short of the expected standards of ethical behaviour and compliance. Conduct risk arises from human behaviour and is influenced by factors in the external environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted individuals\n\nand businesses globally, resulting in a human health crisis, widespread lockdowns and a severe economic recession. As a general position, our response to the pandemic has been to reiterate and emphasise that adherence to Shell's compliance rules (including the Code of Conduct) remains essential to protect our business and to help us make the right decisions for the future. While maintaining this basic position, pragmatic, risk-based mitigations have been implemented where appropriate to increase response speed and efficiency without undermining the intended/uni00A0purpose of our controls.\n\nOur ethics and compliance requirements are articulated through our policies, standards and procedures. They are communicated to Shell employees and contract staff and, where necessary and appropriate, to/uni00A0agents and business partners. We monitor and report internally on adherence with select ethics and compliance requirements, such as mandatory training completion and due diligence screening. We pay particular attention to our due diligence procedures when dealing with third parties. We also make our requirements clear to third parties through a variety of measures such as standard contract clauses. We publish our Ethics and Compliance Manual on shell.com to demonstrate our commitment in this area./uni00A0\n\nThe Shell Ethics and Compliance Office helps the businesses and functions to implement the ABC/AML and other programmes, and monitors and reports on progress. Legal counsel provides legal advice globally and supports the implementation of programmes. The Shell Ethics and Compliance Office regularly reviews and revises all ethics and compliance programmes to ensure they remain up to date with applicable laws, regulations and best practices. This includes incorporating results from relevant internal audits, reviews and investigations, and periodically commissioning external reviews and benchmarking./uni00A0\n\nA structured framework for ethical decision-making, expanding on the formulation 'Is it legal, is it ethical, is it wise?', was developed and tested during the course of 2020 and subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party panel. The framework will be implemented broadly across Shell from 2021. It will support decision-making by requiring Shell staff to/uni00A0think through, in a structured manner, the legal, ethical and external dimensions of the various opportunities and decisions they face in their/uni00A0daily work.\n\nWe investigate all good-faith allegations of breaches of the Code of Conduct, however they are raised. We are committed to ensuring all such/uni00A0incidents are investigated by specialists in accordance with our Investigation Principles. Allegations may be raised confidentially and anonymously through several channels, including a Shell Global Helpline/uni00A0operated by an independent provider./uni00A0\n\nViolation of the Code of Conduct or its policies can result in disciplinary action, up to and including contract termination or dismissal. In some cases, we may report a violation to the relevant authorities, which could/uni00A0lead to legal action, fines or imprisonment.\n\nInternal investigations confirmed 252 substantiated breaches of the Code of Conduct in 2020. As a result, we dismissed or terminated the contracts of a total of 54 employees and contract staff./uni00A0\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS\n\nWe have a number of share plans designed to align employees' interests with our performance through share ownership. For information on the share-based compensation plans for Executive Directors, see the 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on pages 153-156./uni00A0",

The remaining 67.5% is linked to the comparative performance condition mentioned above. From 2021, 20% of the award is linked to the FCF measure and 20% is linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 60% is linked to the comparative performance condition.\n\nSeparately, following the BG acquisition, certain employee share awards made in 2015 under BG's Long-term Incentive Plan were automatically exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the Company.

All shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the award date to the vesting date. In certain circumstances, awards may be/uni00A0adjusted before delivery or subject to clawback after delivery./uni00A0\n\n## GLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN\n\nEligible employees in participating countries may participate in the Global/uni00A0Employee Share Purchase Plan. This plan enables them to make contributions from net pay towards the purchase of the Company's shares at a 15% discount to the market price, either at the start or at the end of an/uni00A0annual cycle, whichever date offers the lower market price./uni00A0\n\n## UK SHELL ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN\n\nEligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK may participate in the Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan, under which monthly contributions from gross pay are made towards the purchase of the Company's shares. For every six shares purchased by the employee, one matching share is provided at no cost to the employee./uni00A0\n\n## UK SHARESAVE SCHEME\n\nEligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK have been able to participate in the UK Sharesave Scheme. Options have been granted over the Company's shares at market value on the invitation date. These options are normally exercisable after completion of a three-year or/uni00A0five-year contractual savings period. From 2017 no further grants were made under this plan./uni00A0\n\nSeparately, following the acquisition of BG, certain participants in the BG/uni00A0Sharesave Scheme chose to roll over their outstanding BG share options into options over the Company's shares. The BG option price (at/uni00A0a/uni00A0discount of 20% to market value) was converted into an equivalent Company option price at a ratio agreed with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

        "page_content": "## INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CHAD HOLLIDAY\n\nChair\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this Report, I will be vacating my role as Chair of the Board after the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM). I very much hope that we will be able to revert back to a more normal AGM, with shareholders physically present at our meeting. We will, though, need to assess whether this is possible, alongside government guidance, closer to the time of the meeting.\n\nIt has been a great honour to serve Shell over the last 10 years, and I thank our shareholders for granting me that privilege. As I look back on my time with Shell, 2020 is by far the most memorable year, for many reasons. We came into 2020 off the back of what had already been a difficult 2019 for our industry, with tough macroeconomic conditions, lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices and weaker realised refining margins. In the Governance section of the 2019 Annual Report, when I looked forward to the coming year, I highlighted the continuing risk from trade conflicts with difficult-to-predict outcomes, regional geopolitical tensions and the uncertainties of Brexit. Yet we still looked forward with/uni00A0optimism.\n\nIn other areas of the 2019 Report we noted the early impact that we were/uni00A0seeing from COVID-19 and the ensuing macroeconomic uncertainty around prices and demand for oil, gas and products. The Risk factors section of the 2019 Report highlighted the potential for COVID-19 to have a material adverse effect on our operations. The months that followed put our words 'potential' and 'material' into perspective. Economies across the world were decimated. Life and the many freedoms we associated with it changed in ways that are likely to impact people and broader society for/uni00A0many years to come.\n\nAs I reflect on how our organisation navigated this environment, what stands out for me is our people. I am immensely proud of them. I was struck by how our people stepped up and continued to deliver in this challenging environment. They continued to work on platforms and refineries, away from their families for extended periods of time, to ensure Shell delivered on its commitments. They worked in retail fuel stations, face-to-face with the public. They went into our offices when they could not do their job from home. The list of what our people did for this organisation is extensive, and in some instances quite humbling. Yet what stands out the most is their care for one another, and the efforts they made to support their colleagues. It is this enduring care for one another that will be my strongest memory over the past decade I have served Shell. It is what defines the culture and heart of this Company.\n\nThe rapid changes in response to COVID-19 have prompted positive action in many areas of society. The pandemic has challenged us to look at how we live, what we value, and how we see the future. Our scenarios team has updated its thinking and issued a number of publications which can be found on the Shell website. Governments have stepped up their environmental ambitions. Growth after the virus is expected to be greener. Shell is evolving its strategy to remain aligned with a greener future and to/uni00A0encourage society to choose lower-carbon options. It is our target to be/uni00A0a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050, in step with society. We still believe, though, that society will continue to need oil and gas for many years to come. Oil and gas will continue to be the cash generators that/uni00A0support our investments through the energy transition. They will underpin Shell's delivery of its targets that are aligned/uni00A0with the goals of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Paris Agreement.\n\n## BOARD LEADERSHIP AND SHELL'S PURPOSE\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') provides that the Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of Shell, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. The Board believes that Shell's efforts give it an effective framework to play its part in/uni00A0the energy transition as a growing, successful, commercial organisation. In/uni00A0the Board's view, this framework will allow Shell to provide the energy solutions that consumers will want and buy through this period of uncertain change. The Board also thinks that Shell will be able to reduce/uni00A0the carbon intensity of the energy products it supplies and deliver/uni00A0against its recently published targets.\n\nThe purpose of Shell is set out in the early pages of this Annual Report. We/uni00A0will continue with the theme of communicating purpose throughout this report, focusing on how our governance operates in practice, and why/uni00A0we believe this is the best approach for Shell.\n\nThe Governance report is structured around the key themes of the Code. Our narrative is articulated to provide genuine understanding of how governance supports and protects Shell and our stakeholders.\n\nAlthough Shell applies the Principles and the spirit of the Code, there are instances where we adopt an approach that is slightly different from that suggested by some of the Code's provisions and we explain these on page 126. In these instances, our governance processes are considered appropriate, given the specific circumstances and a range of factors that are particular to Shell, such as its global nature, size, complexity and history. More detail on Shell's compliance with the Code can be found on/uni00A0pages 126 to 127.\n\nLast year I highlighted the importance of our stakeholders and the greater level of external focus on these groups. We expressed our enthusiasm to build on our engagement with our stakeholder groups in 2020. Sadly, the face-to-face interaction we had hoped for was often made impossible by restrictions on social interaction and travel during the pandemic. Instead, greater use of technology has facilitated online, virtual engagement. The Board was able to visit some of our sites virtually, and engaged in virtual meetings with our broader stakeholders and our people. The Board's discharge of its duty in relation to key stakeholder interests, including those of our workforce, and an explanation of how it considered these when making principal decisions are set out on page 22. On page 130 we provide information about our Board activities and highlight which stakeholders we considered.",

        "page_content": "Our workforce engagement methods remain unchanged from those previously disclosed. As we implement the proposals from our Reshape reorganisation, we anticipate an enhanced level of workforce engagement, within the parameters of COVID-19 restrictions. We continue to believe that constructive relationships built on mutual respect and transparency help Shell attract and retain employees while supporting greater productivity and operational safety and efficiency. Ensuring that the employee voice is heard in the boardroom in practical ways is key to/uni00A0understanding the broader impact of business decisions, including with/uni00A0respect to organisational culture.\n\nThe Board clearly recognises the importance of culture and its link to delivering Shell's purpose and strategy. Given our culture's importance, it/uni00A0requires long-term commitment. The Board believes that our people and/uni00A0safety culture is strong, and takes pride in having such a culture./uni00A0\n\nOur culture reflects the values of the organisation - honesty, integrity and respect for people. These underpin all the work we do and are embedded in our Strategy and Purpose. The 2020 Board evaluation highlighted that although the Board uses various reports and engagements to assess our culture, a considerable part of this assessment is based on the outcome of/uni00A0the annual employee survey. Although this survey provides informed insight, the Board recognises that this data can have its limitations. For/uni00A0this/uni00A0reason, the Board will undertake a deeper analysis of Shell's culture in/uni00A02021.\n\n## DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nMore information on how the Board and its Committees support business operations is provided on page 128. Further detail is contained within the Terms of Reference for each Committee, which are provided on our website. Each year the Board committees' Terms of Reference are reviewed and updated, as required.\n\nMaintaining independent judgement on the Board is a fundamental governance principle and one supported by the Board. The Code provides circumstances that it considers are likely to impair, or could appear to impair, a Non-executive Director's independence. One of these is tenure. In the 2019 Annual Report we shared information on Directors that exceeded guidance outlined in the Code with regard to tenure. We also explained when these Directors' tenure was expected to end, and the assessments of their independence that the Nomination and Succession Committee made on behalf of the Board. Some of this information can be found within our Statement of Compliance with the Code, on page 126. A/uni00A0deeper analysis can be found on page 115 of the 2019 Annual Report.\n\n## COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION\n\nThe Director biographies in this Governance report provide insight into our/uni00A0Directors' careers, skills and experience. Our Board diversity reporting also extends beyond gender and nationality, and outlines the varying sector experience across the Board.\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, shareholders appointed Dick Boer, Martina HundMejean and Sir Andrew Mackenzie to the Board. In September, Bram Schot was appointed by the Board. After joining the Board, each new member was appointed to one of the Board committees, refreshing the committee's composition. Each Director's biography contains information on their committee memberships. An overview of the new Directors' induction programme can be found on page 142. After the 2020 AGM, Gerard Kleisterlee, Linda Stuntz and Roberto Setubal retired from the Board. The Board is grateful for their years of service.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, as announced on March 11, 2021, Sir Nigel Sheinwald will retire from the Board following nine years of service. He leaves behind a strong leadership track record and the Board is deeply grateful for his many years of dedicated commitment to the business.\n\nThe 2021 AGM will also be my last day with Shell. After the meeting, Sir Andrew Mackenzie will succeed me as Chair of the Board. I am delighted to welcome him as my successor. His appointment follows a rigorous search process led by the Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director. An overview of the Chair succession process can be found on page 142. In addition, as announced on March 11, 2021, the Board intends to propose to the 2021 Annual General Meeting that Jane Lute be appointed a Non-executive Director of the Company with effect from May 19, 2021. If shareholders are supportive of her appointment, we will/uni00A0have achieved gender parity on the Board.\n\n## AUDIT, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control and oversight over Shell's financial reporting. A variety of standing matters and more specific topics are discussed by the Audit Committee throughout the year. As part of the year-end reporting process, the Audit Committee advises the Board on the adequacy of the system of risk management and internal control in place, the appropriateness of the viability statement and going concern basis of accounting. The Audit Committee also advises on whether this Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the/uni00A0information necessary for stakeholders to assess Shell's position and/uni00A0performance, business model and strategy. More information on the/uni00A0Audit Committee's activities, highlights and priorities can be found in/uni00A0its report on page 145.\n\nShell is at a point where it must transform itself while facing intense public scrutiny and operating in a rapidly changing, disruptive environment. It must frame and implement its strategy with courage and commitment, but/uni00A0also with the humility to listen, learn and adapt. Shell's Board and leadership must be steadfast, agile and sensitive to the opportunities, risks/uni00A0and rewards confronting the business. I remain confident that all are/uni00A0up to the tasks.\n\nFinally, we hope that this document provides clear reporting and enhances our stakeholders' understanding of/uni00A0our governance processes. I/uni00A0would also like to thank again my fellow Directors, our colleagues and our workforce around the world for their continued and considerable efforts towards the success of the Company.\n\n## CHAD HOLLIDAY\n\nMarch/uni00A010, 2021\n\nChair",

        "page_content": "## STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nThe Board confirms that, throughout the year, the Company has applied the Principles, both in spirit and in form, and complied with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018 (the 'Code'), with the exception of those provisions noted below. A copy of the Code can be found on the FRC's website: www.frc.org.uk.\n\nShell's governance arrangements have been considered alongside the Code. The information set out in the Directors' report, including the Board/uni00A0committee reports on (pages 140-156) is intended to provide an/uni00A0explanation of how the Code's Principles were applied practically throughout the year. We have also provided clear and meaningful explanation below where we believe stakeholders may benefit from more/uni00A0specific information on particular Code provisions.\n\n## Chair tenure (Provision 19)\n\nNote: The text relating to Chair tenure is provided by Euleen Goh, Senior Independent Director. Charles O. Holliday (Chad) was appointed as Chair in 2015 after four and a half years on the Board as a Non-executive Director. In September 2019, he reached a tenure of nine years. Chad will be standing down from the Board at the 2021 AGM.\n\nThe provisions of the Code address Chair tenure and set a limit of nine years from the date of first appointment to the Board. However, the Code pragmatically acknowledges that this period can be extended for a/uni00A0limited time to facilitate orderly, effective succession planning and the development of a diverse board. In the 2018 Annual Report and Form 20-F, we highlighted that Chad's tenure had been discussed at numerous shareholder engagements. It was disclosed that shareholders were supportive of the extension of his tenure to the 2021 AGM. This meets the/uni00A0Code's limited exception, particularly as the Chair was an existing Non-executive Director on appointment. The Board also takes comfort from the support for Chad's re-election at the 2019 and 2020 AGMs (96%/uni00A0and 95%, respectively, votes in favour) and ongoing support from/uni00A0shareholders.\n\nRetaining Chad on the Board and in the position of Chair until the 2021/uni00A0AGM was right for the business. Doing so has facilitated a more effective phasing of his succession, particularly given the existing slate of/uni00A0Director tenure at the time of the Code's issuance with three Directors nearing their/uni00A0ninth year of service. Earlier departure would have been disruptive and could have left a significant deficiency in the Board's corporate knowledge.\n\nThe 2019 independent Board evaluation strongly recognised Chad as an/uni00A0effective Chair. This was again reflected in the findings of the 2020 internal Board evaluation (see pages 132-133). Throughout 2020, Chad continued to exercise objective judgement, despite his tenure exceeding nine years. The Board found that the continuity of his Shell corporate knowledge and experience supported the induction of the new Directors,/uni00A0and that Chad provided continuity and sound leadership of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board through one of the most challenging years that the business/uni00A0has experienced.\n\nChad's innate understanding and knowledge of the Shell Group, coupled with the strong Shell relationships he has established, proved invaluable in 2020. His skills enabled him to balance his challenge of management with pragmatic perspectives of the external pressures upon the business. He has done this while coaching other, particularly new, Non-executive Directors on the intricacies and nuances of the business, so they were/uni00A0better able to challenge management effectively and enhance/uni00A0overall governance.\n\n## Workforce engagement (Provision 5)\n\nOur people are essential to the successful delivery of the Shell strategy, and the Board recognises the importance of understanding their views through engagement. However, the size and diversity of our employee base and of our wider workforce complicate the feasibility of implementing any of the three specific workforce engagement methods recommended in the Code. Given the required coverage needed for a/uni00A0global organisation such as ours, the Board believes that its current approach to workforce engagement continues to be pragmatic and/uni00A0effective.\n\nIn the 2019 Annual Report, we communicated that the Board had decided that in 2020 it would increase its direct engagements, when the Board, committees and individual Directors visit our sites across the world. We/uni00A0communicated that the Board would also increase its indirect engagements through enhanced stakeholder engagement information being included in relevant management reports. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions, the direct engagements did not progress as we had hoped. That said, in line with the/uni00A0spirit of this ambition, a number of virtual engagements have been undertaken. Information on stakeholder engagement has also been enhanced in management reporting. The Board also intends to keep under review the effectiveness of the engagements. More information on the current approach and a description of the channels used by the Board, its committees, and the Executive Committee are outlined in 'Workforce engagement' on pages 138-139.\n\n## Director independence (Provision 10)\n\nIn the 2019 Annual Report, we noted that Gerard Kleisterlee had served on/uni00A0the Board for more than nine years, having joined in November 2010. Gerard stepped down from the Board at the 2020 AGM. Therefore, although not currently a Board member, he was a Director for part of/uni00A0the/uni00A0year.\n\nIn the 2019 Annual Report, published in March 2020, the Board acknowledged the potential impairment of his independence owing to his length of tenure, as outlined in a Code provision. In the Board's view, there had been no notable negative change in Gerard's performance as a Director and in his various Board roles in recent years. The Board continued to regard him as an independent Non-executive Director and undertook a rigorous evaluation to reach this conclusion. Gerard did not participate in his own assessment. A detailed overview of the assessment can be found on page 119 of the 2019 Annual Report.",

As we approached the end of Gerard's tenure, Remuneration Committee members had served on this committee for periods ranging from less than a year to just over five years. As announced on January 29, 2020, Neil Carson succeeded Gerard in the role of Committee Chair after the 2020 AGM. Neil has been a member of this committee since June 1, 2019 and has previously served on a remuneration committee before joining the Shell Board. Having Gerard remain as Committee Chair beyond his nine-year tenure to the natural conclusion of his tenure at the 2020 AGM was a practical step promoting/uni00A0smooth succession. Further details on the composition of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Remuneration Committee are provided on page 153 of the Remuneration Committee Report.\n\n## Corporate governance requirements outside the UK\n\nIn addition to complying with applicable corporate governance requirements in the UK, the Company complies with the rules of Euronext Amsterdam as well as Dutch securities laws because of its listing on that exchange. The Company likewise adheres to US securities laws and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations because its securities are registered in the USA and listed on the NYSE.",

Forthcoming Board agenda items are categorised as: Strategy & Portfolio, Delivery & Performance, External Environment, Corporate & Miscellaneous or Standard items. Of the standard items, Board agendas regularly include reports from the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, other Executive Committee members and from each Board committee. 'Core values' moments also feature regularly led by a Director or Executive Committee member. In 2020, 'Shell Heroes' vignettes were added to highlight extraordinary staff actions including those exemplifying care for people, society and/or the environment. Updates are also provided from the various businesses and key functions, including Investor Relations; Health and Safety, Security and Environment; Human Resources; and Legal, as well as the Company Secretary. The Board also considers and/uni00A0approves the quarterly, half-year and full-year financial results, shareholder distributions and the associated announcements, and, at most meetings, considers investment, divestment and/or financing proposals. To enable purposeful debates and/or focus on particular aspects of agenda topics, including the impact on key stakeholders, Directors have an opportunity to specify information they require to be provided in advance/uni00A0of Board meetings.\n\nAs in previous years and despite COVID-19 travel restrictions, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors conducted site visits of various Shell operations and overseas offices - albeit virtually in 2020. These virtual visits were designed to provide Directors with first-hand insights into certain businesses, including into key projects and energy transition initiatives. Directors also held various virtual workforce engagements, as well as virtual external stakeholder engagements. More detail on these can be found in the table below and on pages 134-139.\n\nSome of the activities and areas of Board focus over the year are summarised in the table below. The information below is not exhaustive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation on other topics discussed by the Board and details of the resulting decisions are covered elsewhere, primarily in the Section 172 Statement contained in the Strategic Report on page 22. In some cases, a/uni00A0brief outline has been provided below and reference given to where additional and more comprehensive information can be found.\n\n## June strategy days\n\nIn lieu of the traditional physical June Strategy off-site meetings or Board's Strategy Day, virtual meetings were held over the course of three days. As these meetings are usually an opportunity for the Board, and particularly new Directors, to strengthen collegial relationships among Directors and with the Executive Committee, considerable efforts were invested into making these meetings as innovative and engaging as possible. This included incorporating break-out sessions, staff engagements and an external engagement. The Board members were also asked to share light-hearted insights about themselves in advance of the meetings which/uni00A0were woven into informal quizzes. Virtual social events rounded out/uni00A0the end of each day's programme.\n\nThe Board Strategy Days included discussions on various topics including the proposed direction for Shell, with strategic alternatives. Topics covered at the sessions included:\n\n- \u25a0 Project Reshape (Shell's reorganisation);\n- \u25a0 2020-2022 outlook and responses;\n- \u25a0 strategic pathway and underlying strategic premises;\n- \u25a0 implications of energy transition strategy;\n- \u25a0 energy transition strategy;\n- \u25a0 exploring alternative strategies;\n- \u25a0 strategic alignment next steps;\n- \u25a0 financial framework;\n- \u25a0 staff engagements; and\n- \u25a0 external engagement with a significant customer/supplier.\n\nStakeholders\n\n| Topic                                | Discussion/activity/updates included                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Examples of outcome/progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | considered   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Board leadership and company purpose | Board leadership and company purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |              |\n| External business  environment       | \u25a0 Received updates on and discussed regional  geopolitical/uni00A0issues. \u25a0 Discussions on spread of COVID-19, including global  public/uni00A0health response, economic policy response,  recession and recovery, oil demand, gas markets  outlook. | \u25a0 Considered feedback from investor community on expected  financial performance and related risks.  \u25a0 Considered how COVID-19 impacts on the business were  being managed.

performance indicators, including with regard  to/uni00A0safety; how the survey could be used to strengthen  organisational values and culture even more; and whether  learnings were being taken from

People Survey. Discussion  was immediately preceded by the Board's virtual  engagement with a cross-section of staff from Brazil,  the/uni00A0USA, the UK, Nigeria and India (see entry under  'staff engagements' below for more detail).  Through analysis and questioning, the Board gained  insights on survey topics including: collaboration;  working conditions; views on one's job; job security;  people development; reputation; total rewards and  benefits; diversity and inclusion; operational excellence;  and internal perspectives on Shell's responsible  business aspects. \u25a0 The Board held a number of virtual staff engagements  (both at the June Strategy Days and in connection with  the 2020 Shell People Survey review). Engagements  deliberately included a cross-section of staff (at  different levels, from different countries, within different  businesses and functions) and included engagements  both with and without management. Topics included  the working/professional and personal impact of  COVID-19, the Reshape reorganisation and the  future/uni00A0of Shell. \u25a0 | The preceding virtual staff engagement complemented the  quantitative survey results by providing a qualitative  'barometer' of staff views on numerous topics including  aspects of corporate culture. The Board queried management  on: retention and motivation of key talent; providing reskilling  and upskilling opportunities; finding ways to show staff value  given the remuneration measures taken in 2020; and job  security challenges and Reshape fatigue. The interactive  session helped the Board to monitor Shell's culture and staff  engagement in an unprecedented year. The Chair also  reminded the Board to retain the context of the engagement  and survey feedback as a backdrop reference on the strategic,  operational and risk-related topics on the Board's agenda. \u25a0 Gained direct feedback and first-hand insight into the views of  staff on COVID-19 impacts (from the perspective of working  from home and from the perspective of continuing to work at  assets). Positive reflections on flexibility, ergonomic support,  more time spent with families (for those working from home),  and pride in achieving work. Negative reflections on missing  interaction with colleagues, family (for asset workers) and  increased workloads due to unprecedented times.  The Board also gained insights into staff perspectives on  Reshape regarding communications, general views on it, |              |\n| Audit, risk and internal control                               | Audit, risk and internal control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |              |\n| Safety and  Environment \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0                                  | Received regular updates from management on safety  and environment performance.

        "page_content": "## Insight\n\nThe feedback from Board Directors was positive throughout their responses to the evaluation.\n\nBoard dynamics - the Non-executive Directors' support and challenge of management was rated very highly, with the quality of the interaction and the openness of the leadership team being commended./uni00A0\n\nBoard oversight - the Board's effectiveness in adjusting its focus and priorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was rated very highly. Board oversight of various specific aspects of risk was also rated highly overall, with retention of focus on risk appetite continuing to be a priority. The Board's oversight of the Company's processes for managing and developing senior executive talent, including with regard to diversity, was/uni00A0rated very highly, and will be a continued area of focus.\n\nManagement and focus of meetings - themes included: shortening and simplifying Board papers further, and a desire for returning to physical meetings when circumstances permit. The measures implemented to facilitate virtual meetings, induction/onboarding, and ongoing training were rated highly and viewed as very effective.\n\nStakeholder oversight - the mechanisms by which the Board obtains the views and needs of major investors and employees were highly rated, while noting that the mechanisms for obtaining the views of customers, private/retail investors, communities and suppliers could be enhanced, as/uni00A0feasible and relevant. The Board's effectiveness in monitoring and assessing culture throughout the organisation was rated positively overall.\n\n## Delivery against the 2020 ambitions\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drove unprecedented change throughout 2020, impacting both the short- and longer-term business outlook. Through the use of additional meetings, the Board balanced its focus on short-term operational matters and long-term strategy. Principal decisions made in 2020 were bold and decisive and, where possible, discussions were initiated well in advance of final Board decisions. Acquisitions/divestments and critical strategy shifts were all key agenda items for 2020, and these aligned with the Board ambitions set at the start of the year.\n\nThe Board's ambitions on succession were tested during 2020 with the/uni00A0appointment and induction of four Non-executive Directors and the retirement of three Non-executive Directors - all in the context of a virtual environment. Planned improvements to the Director onboarding process were implemented despite the COVID-19 crisis. Simultaneous adaptations were made to ensure there was as much dynamism as feasible within the constraints of having to work virtually. The development of a Board travel calendar was inevitably put on hold. The intention to share details of other induction sessions and committee trips was put into effect, albeit virtually.\n\nOn our Board papers ambition, efforts were made to focus information provided to the Board (for example, through optional briefing sessions, one-on-one engagements and advance 'polling' of questions/information needs) to enable decision-making on key topics.\n\n## Planned enhancements for 2021\n\nThe 2020 Board evaluation findings provided areas of focus or priorities for 2021.\n\n## Monitoring execution and strategic implementation\n\nThis is an area of undeniable importance for the years ahead. The Board will continue to monitor strategic execution with support to Management, enabled by a/uni00A0performance tracking approach.\n\n## Company culture and Project Reshape\n\nThe Board will continue to monitor the Reshape transformation, enabled by the performance-tracking approach referenced above. It will strengthen its emphasis on culture and workforce engagement (particularly after COVID-19).\n\n## Completion of improvement items already in progress\n\nEnsuring smooth Chair succession, oversight of ongoing litigation and potential further optimisation of the induction processes for Non-executive Directors once travel is safely resumed. Likewise, sharing other Director induction sessions, committee trips and Chair visits will continue.\n\n## Chair\n\nOngoing performance evaluation - the Board was very appreciative of/uni00A0the Chair's strong leadership (both of the full Board and individual Directors) during an extremely difficult year. He ensured thoughtful and interactive agendas (despite the required virtual format). It was also considered that he invested purposeful time with all, particularly with new/uni00A0Non-executive Directors, and continued to facilitate strong Board engagement and strong relationships with management. The Directors considered the Board very fortunate to have a Chair functioning at his peak. Board members added that the careful and thorough way in which all decisions this year have been framed, debated and made owes a great deal to the Chair's experience and care, and his relationships with the CEO and Non-executive Directors.\n\nThe Chair's focus on strengthening individual Director performance through coaching and feedback continues to be rated highly. His regular contact with Directors between meetings provides continued real-time feedback and reflection. This way of working continues to be regarded as/uni00A0an outstanding aspect of his leadership.\n\nThe Deputy Chair communicated the feedback to the Chair, along with/uni00A0requests to:\n\n- \u25a0 continue to carefully balance the airing of divergent views with the/uni00A0need to appropriately converge on Board decisions.\n- \u25a0 ensure knowledge transfer of the Chair's insights and learnings to/uni00A0his/uni00A0successor; and\n\nThe Chair fully accepted the feedback and agreed to reflect and act/uni00A0upon/uni00A0it.",

        "page_content": "## UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\nCo-operating with our stakeholders and taking the time to understand their different views have always been of high value and importance to the Board. Our commitment to stakeholder engagement is built upon the understanding that knowledge-sharing, widening of experiences and adopting a learner mindset will help us achieve our commercial, environmental and social objectives.\n\nThe Board and Shell take their commitment to public collaboration and stakeholder engagement very seriously. In the past this has been easily demonstrated through both virtual and physical events which have served as opportunities to hear directly about stakeholder issues and priorities. This has been harder to navigate in the context of the continuing impact of/uni00A0COVID-19. Our focus on supporting and caring for/uni00A0our colleagues, customers and the communities in which we work has/uni00A0not changed through these unprecedented times.\n\n- \u25a0 We have endeavoured to continue to engage with stakeholders, seeking alternative virtually focused opportunities.\n- \u25a0 We have put the safety and health of our people, customers and other stakeholders first, along with the safe operations of our businesses.\n- \u25a0 We have endeavoured to engage in a way which is as effective and/uni00A0as/uni00A0safe as possible.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 and subsequent restrictions on travel and public gatherings have inevitably limited the engagements we planned for 2020. Our events have been cancelled, postponed or held in a way that was vastly different from previous years. We have had to think more creatively about engagement, and all of this was done with public health and safety and the advice/law of local governments in mind. The Board was disappointed that there have been fewer possibilities to engage in person./uni00A0Nonetheless, we remain grateful for the continued support of our/uni00A0stakeholders and look forward to future engagements in the year ahead, when it is safe and appropriate to hold them.\n\nThe Directors have continued to consider stakeholders' views in Board discussions and decision-making, as described on page 128. Here, we have/uni00A0categorised our key stakeholders into seven groups and where appropriate, each group is deemed to include both current and potential/uni00A0stakeholders. The stakeholder groups are:\n\n- \u25a0 employees/workforce/pensioners;\n- \u25a0 investor community;\n- \u25a0 regulators/governments;\n- \u25a0 communities;\n- \u25a0 NGOs/civil society stakeholders/academia/think-tanks;\n- \u25a0 customers; and\n- \u25a0 suppliers/strategic partners.\n\nEngagement with our stakeholders goes beyond the Board and is continual. The broader business regularly engages with stakeholders throughout the year, and in the build-up to or during many Shell projects or activities. This engagement is often governed by formulated policies, control frameworks, regulation and legislation. It may differ by region.\n\n## Site visits\n\n- \u25a0 first-hand insights into portfolio positions; and\n\nVarious Shell operations and overseas offices are traditionally visited by the Chair, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors. The visits are designed to provide Directors with:\n\n- \u25a0 opportunities to engage directly with stakeholders including employees, partners, communities and NGOs.\n\nDirectors were disappointed that site visits were reduced and converted to virtual only as a result of COVID-19. In previous years, and as part of the Board evaluation process, the Directors have reflected on the use of site visits for improving the Board's oversight of risk and concluded that the best way to determine if risks are being properly managed is to visit sites and talk to local management. Similarly, some Directors have used site visits as a way to monitor and assess culture first-hand and have commented on the difficulty of doing that this year. Further observations referenced how visits to key sites played an important part of the induction process for new Board members and provided good opportunities for Board members to get to know each other better.\n\nAs noted, alternative arrangements were made where feasible and details of these are described below. Resuming site visits as soon as practically possible was identified as a priority in the 2020 Board evaluation. Further/uni00A0details are provided on page 133.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of two-way communication with the/uni00A0Company's shareholders. The Chair, the Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President Investor Relations each meet regularly with major shareholders and report the views of such shareholders to the Board. Committee chairs also seek engagement with shareholders on significant matters related to their areas of responsibility. Over the year, the Chair met with 51 major shareholders, including at roadshows. The Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director and the Remuneration Committee Chair met with 52 shareholders over the course of the year. A variety of topics were discussed.\n\nShareholders can also contact Shell directly via the recently updated \"Contact us\" section of the Shell website. The recent enhancements replace the shareholder email address and allow investors' questions to/uni00A0be/uni00A0properly directed to the Shell team that can assist.\n\nWe have also introduced an automated question response tool to assist with the most common questions that we receive. We have reviewed and updated the 'Frequently asked questions' section of the Shell website to/uni00A0help investors access information in a time-efficient manner.\n\nFurthermore, other contact details are also provided in the same area be it/uni00A0our registrar, Equiniti, for shareholder queries, our media team, requests for copies of the Annual Report or for general customer enquiries.\n\nThe Company's registrar operates an internet access facility for registered shareholders, providing details of their shareholdings. Facilities are also provided for shareholders to lodge proxy appointments electronically. The/uni00A0Corporate Nominee service, facilitated by Equiniti, provides a facility for investors to hold their shares in the Company in paperless form.\n\n## Shareholder advisory vote\n\nAs announced in February 2021, an advisory shareholder vote will be sought every three years from the 2021 AGM onwards on Shell's energy transition strategy. The Board believes this provides shareholders with an opportunity to exercise a governance role related to climate change.\n\n## Board governance event\n\nIn the past, the Board has held a biennial governance event, Board Engagement Day, that is attended by Directors including the Chair, Senior Independent Director, Audit Committee Chair and Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee Chair. It is seen as an opportunity to provide investors with an overview of the Board's roles, activities and its key focus areas including stakeholder engagement.",

This was not possible because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board understands the value of stakeholder engagements, including this event, to Shell and its stakeholders. The risk/uni00A0of/uni00A0missing important perspectives and insight has been mitigated as much as practically possible over the course of the year by alternative arrangements which are described below. Topics such as stakeholder engagement expectations, Chair tenure, Board succession planning, diversity and inclusion and the Senior Management pipeline have been covered at other events during 2020. The Board is proposing to hold the/uni00A0next event in October 2021 if circumstances permit.\n\n## Engagements in 2020\n\nA summary of the main ways in which the Board sought to obtain feedback and understand the views of key stakeholders during 2020 is/uni00A0shown below. Information on engagement with other stakeholders including the workforce is provided on page 138. The way in which stakeholder interests were considered in principal decision-making by the Board in 2020 (Section 172 statement) can be found on pages 22-27.

        "page_content": "## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe Board recognises merit in the Code's three mechanisms for engaging with the workforce. As with all the Code's provisions, boards must consider the size and structure of their business, including its international scope, and select an approach that most practically delivers the underlying spirit and ambition of the Code, even if the chosen approach differs from what the Code outlines. The Code does note that alternative methods for workforce engagement are supported where an explanation is provided.\n\nThe Code states that its use of the term 'workforce' is not meant to align with legal definitions of workforce, employee, worker or similar terms. But for a global organisation bound by the laws of more than 70 countries, blurring the clearly prescribed legal definitions that affect complex issues/uni00A0(such as local HSSE requirements, work contract terms, legal accountability, employment rights) or merging two definitions of the same term could have a notable impact on the business, its operations and its/uni00A0stakeholder relationships (including with suppliers). Therefore, Shell considers its workforce to be employees of companies in the Shell Group. The Board also engages with others outside this group (for example, on site visits), and some of this engagement is shared on page 134.\n\nAlthough our reporting and formal engagement focuses predominantly on/uni00A0our employees, all individuals working on Shell sites (including Shell offices) are required to undertake certain Shell training (for example, HSSE and Code of Conduct-related training). Adhering to the Life Saving Rules (HSSE) and the Code of Conduct compliance obligations is included within our contracts with suppliers, and the Shell Global Helpline is available for all workers to report matters of concern.\n\nFor many years Shell has recognised the importance of engaging with its/uni00A0workforce. Engagement is especially important in maintaining strong business delivery in volatile times of change. We therefore strive to maintain a dialogue between management and our workforce - both directly and where appropriate, through representative bodies. Management regularly engages with the workforce through a range of formal and informal channels, including via webcasts and emails from the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives, webcasts, townhalls, team meetings, face-to-face gatherings (pre-COVID-19), interviews with Senior Management and online publications via our intranet.\n\nThe Board considers effective engagement a key element of its understanding of the Company's ability to create value as it recognises that our people are our greatest asset. Workforce views can help inform the Board on matters such as operational effectiveness, Shell culture, risk identification and strategy development and delivery.\n\nThroughout 2020 the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted how the Board engages with the workforce and it was impossible to implement the enhancements to physical engagement discussed and planned at the start of the year. The Board did undertake a number of virtual engagements, often around the time of scheduled Board discussion. Feedback from these/uni00A0video calls was shared with and discussed by the wider Board. Management also continued to engage extensively throughout the year, implementing a number of focused events to better understand how people were coping with the working environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, their mental well-being and what the business could/uni00A0do to better support them. Information from these discussions was/uni00A0provided to/uni00A0the Board via bi-weekly updates.\n\nThe Board considers the current workforce engagement approach effective. The information provided in the following table gives examples of/uni00A0various methods of Board engagement.\n\n## Board's direct engagements with the workforce\n\n(Because/uni00A0of/uni00A0COVID-19 restrictions in various countries, the/uni00A0engagement/uni00A0activities/uni00A0have mostly been held virtually)\n\n## Informal engagement\n\nChair lunches, prior to the COVID-19 restrictions, were held from time to time with a select cross-section of employees in various regions. Virtual staff engagements have been held by the Board with a select cross-section of employees (diverse by gender, nationality, business or function, profession and level) in various regions and countries. Nomination and Succession Committee members meet with various senior leaders and high-potential individuals throughout the year.\n\nThe Chair commented: 'I never cease to be impressed by the quality of talent, professionalism, humility and authenticity evident in the individuals with whom our Committee engages. Their diverse backgrounds, capabilities and experience enrich our pipeline in ways that transcend paper credentials. The Nomination and Succession Committee takes its duty of identifying leaders with the 'full' package required to deliver our Company's purpose very personally, and we derive confidence from the equivalent personal drive and commitment we see reflected in/uni00A0the talent we meet.' In addition, the Nomination and Succession Committee received a detailed briefing alongside that given to the full Board on the results of/uni00A0the annual Shell People Survey, which was completed by more than 86% of/uni00A0employees.\n\n## Virtual informal engagement - Board\n\nThe Board participated in a number of virtual employee engagements this year in which they had the opportunity to speak to staff in smaller groups, with between two and three Board members in each group. One such event involved staff from various geographical locations at various levels in Shell.\n\nThe purpose was for the Board to discuss with staff the challenges they have been facing in the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff were asked to describe: how things have changed for them and their families since the onset of COVID-19; how the current situation has changed the dynamics or culture of their team; and how they felt about/uni00A0the future and what was most on their minds.\n\nAnother engagement was towards the end of the year, after the company-wide communications on Reshape's impact on jobs. It focused on people's personal experiences working for Shell, including ways of working, views on the future direction of Shell and perceptions around Reshape. The session was arranged geographically to ensure an international scope and included mid-level employees/uni00A0from Brazil, the USA, the UK, Nigeria and India.\n\nDuring these engagements Shell people were asked to validate whether the communication, care and support offered by the business was sufficient, and if/uni00A0more/uni00A0was needed. The outcomes of these Board engagements have been discussed in Board meetings and have been incorporated in future communication/uni00A0and support to our people.\n\n## Off-site visits\n\nBecause of COVID-19 restrictions, site visits were limited to the beginning of the year. Although in some instances we were able to organise virtual visits and meetings, priority was given to running the business operations.\n\nPeople engagements during Board and/or meetings off-sites.\n\nMeeting talent/leadership teams\n\nCompany Chair engaging with various individuals.\n\nThe Board attended a virtual site visit to the Pennsylvania Chemicals plant in the USA. This gave Board members an opportunity to speak with another group of Shell's people in the context of a specific, large-scale project which has had to manage multiple staff safety issues, particularly in relation to COVID-19. The Pennsylvania Chemicals site has also required significant management of HSSE and/uni00A0community stakeholder matters. The engagement included an overview of COVID-19 management with a focus on recent preparations for a third wave and a/uni00A0specific discussion of engagement with external stakeholders and management of/uni00A0non-COVID-related risks.\n\nThe Board raised numerous questions and challenges in the context of key business decisions which will affect employees, such as refinery closures, the impact on employees and the possibility of retraining and redeployment. They also shared their/uni00A0own experiences of dealing with stakeholders and staff representatives.",

        "page_content": "Through these more formal engagements, the Chair and other Non-executive Directors (either individually or with their committees) are able to deepen their understanding of how the Company's purpose, strategy and values are embedded in particular businesses, sites and countries. This gives insight into progress made, risks and opportunities. The benefits are mutual. The Board obtains direct insight into/uni00A0local business operations and projects, and local strengths and challenges while our people have an opportunity to better understand the Board and to provide direct feedback on topics of importance to them, their business or function/uni00A0and/or their location.\n\n## Employee network and related sessions\n\nConducted by Directors with, for example, Directors engaging with Shell women's networks activities.\n\nIn 2020, panel discussions took place on International Women's Day. Various members of the Board joined these discussions.\n\nDirectors involved in these engagements note the opportunity to enrich their understanding of the female perspective within Shell, getting better insights on gender balance and the employee experience in this area.\n\n## Formal reports and information updates to the Board\n\n## Shell People Survey (anonymous survey facilitated externally)\n\nAnnual Board discussion to keep it fully aware of employee engagement levels and quality of leadership across Shell's workforce, and informed on a broad range of subjects including collaboration, working conditions, the job, people development, reputation, benefits and rewards, diversity and inclusion, operational excellence, and responsible business.\n\nThe Board considers the Shell People Survey to be one of its principal tools for measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to Shell. It/uni00A0provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high response rate. In/uni00A02020 the response rate was 86%, which was the highest ever. The average employee engagement score was maintained at 78 points out of 100, despite the challenging year and remained top quartile compared with external benchmarks.\n\nThe Board also considers this engagement to understand, for example, how Shell is/uni00A0using the survey outcomes in: i) data analytics, for example, to identify potential correlative relationships between employee engagement and safety or ethics and/uni00A0compliance incidents; and ii) strengthening Company culture and values.\n\n## Senior Succession and Resourcing Review\n\nThe annual Senior Succession and Resourcing Review focused on the strength of senior leadership and plans for its development and succession, while highlighting the breadth, depth and diversity of its pipeline, the developing profile of the leadership cadre, and recruitment and attrition levels.\n\nThe Nomination and Succession Committee noted the effectiveness of succession planning, the impact of its associated execution, and the professional, data-driven, integrated approach to leadership and leadership development. It welcomed the continued focus on performance management, proactive management of Shell's talent pipeline, and the focus on advancing Shell's diversity agenda with increased attention on race. Overall this year's insights provided a deeper understanding of/uni00A0the interplay between culture, identity, leadership talent and employee engagement across Shell.\n\n## Assessment of key trends and material incidents\n\nPresented by Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer. This is based on the established channels for staff and others to file complaints or report on suspected breaches in relation to the Shell General Business Principles (SGBP), the Code of Conduct or any breaches of law or regulations, including accounting control and auditing concerns.\n\nThe update covers Shell employees and our wider stakeholder base. The Board (also via the Audit Committee and SESCo) obtains insight into incidents and reporting levels and remediation which provide indicators of conduct risks and, together with the related Board reports noted below, of the strength of embedding and awareness of the Code of Conduct and SGBP obligations and employees' comfort levels in raising incidents.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe Board reviews reports on strategic and conduct and culture risks annually, and considers reports on operational risks twice a year. These reports assess current business activities against risk appetite.\n\n## Organisational culture\n\nAs part of the Reshape restructuring, the Board has been discussing the people strategy, new leadership framework, and safety refresh. Discussions on diversity and/uni00A0inclusion issues such as race also took place to further improve the organisational culture.\n\nThe Board also reviewed the Conduct and Culture Risk Report, which included a/uni00A0refreshed dashboard of risk appetite measures aligned with Shell's core values -/uni00A0honesty, integrity and respect for people. Elements measured by the dashboard include: the number of terminations as a result of formally investigated Code of Conduct violations; the number of overdues on mandatory Ethics and Compliance training; anonymous reporting rates on our global helpline; and a selection of Shell People Survey scores. Qualitative assessments of insider threats and our approach to caring for our people were also covered.\n\n## Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Report\n\nData and insights include information from the Global Helpline, Shell Ethics and Compliance organisation and the Shell People Survey. SESCo continues to strongly support the work of the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, including the efforts to ensure a safe working environment where staff feel confident to raise any concerns in good faith.\n\nThe Audit Committee is kept updated when matters highlighted through the Global Helpline are investigated, and on the associated remediation. For more information see page 148 of the Audit Committee report.\n\n## Assurance activities\n\nAssurance activities, including items raised by businesses and functions (through the/uni00A0Group Assurance Letters process) and independent assurance (from Internal Audit, HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, Reserves Assurance and Reporting), provide additional evident to the Board of the commitment to high standards of risk management and internal control. The assurance activities ensure that work can/uni00A0be/uni00A0done safely, within regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe information provided within these reports further supports the Board's annual/uni00A0review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and/uni00A0internal control and feeds into the Group scorecard, against which staff bonuses are calculated.\n\n## The Shell Control Framework\n\nSignificant HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, and more broadly, business control incidents are brought to the attention of Senior Management and the Board through/uni00A0regular reporting.\n\nThe Board discussed how the organisation could learn more from incidents and/uni00A0how/uni00A0the business could drive safety performance. The Board shared and discussed examples based on personal experience of how to promote a strong safety culture.",

Further, it reviews the Company's policy and strategy on diversity and inclusion, and monitors the effectiveness of diversity initiatives. It makes recommendations to the Board on corporate governance guidelines, as referred to in the Chair's statement. [A] \"Senior Management' refers to the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary.\n\n## TALENT MANAGEMENT AND SUCCESSION\n\nThe Committee is fully engaged with the end-to-end talent management and senior succession planning approach that is deployed within Shell. It plays a/uni00A0key role in senior succession and resourcing and retaining in-depth knowledge of the individuals within the talent pipeline is a Committee priority. In fact, the Committee makes time to personally meet and engage with numerous individuals within the pipeline. The Committee's oversight and/uni00A0input extend from recruitment to leadership identification and from leadership development to leadership appointment, all of which are underpinned by clearly articulated talent priorities and a commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion across Shell.\n\nThe Committee manages Board and Senior Management succession under a structured, proactive methodology. The processes have clear and agreed selection principles for short-, medium- and long-term succession and are aligned with Shell's strategic priorities.\n\nFor Non-executive Director succession, the Committee also follows its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board. These principles function much like a policy and include both quantitative and qualitative principles, considering: (i) the overall aspired Board composition and diversity of gender, race and ethnicity, nationality, background, experience and desired skillsets that align with the Company's strategy and purpose; and (ii) the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected of Directors.\n\nFor Senior Management succession, the selection principles include process-specific elements, such as a clear and proactive approach to identifying and developing succession candidates. The principles also outline the long-term structured nature of the succession planning process. There is also great focus on ensuring that the principles reflect the leadership qualities required for future business success and that they advance the progress of diversity in all its forms.\n\nSenior Management principles feature in the Committee's review of the succession plans which occurs in every Committee meeting. Utilising the principles, the Committee executes changes through a well-defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The Committee agrees candidate profiles and meets prospective candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. Consequently, some of the leaders whom the Committee and Board have engaged with extensively in the past are now/uni00A0members of the Board or the Executive Committee.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, the Committee undertook its annual in-depth look at the succession plans for Senior Management across Shell and reviewed the talent pipeline in line with the business outlook. The engagement focused on the depth and breadth of the leadership pipeline, the skills and behaviours required for future success and progress against diversity aspirations and policies. Following the Committee's review, the findings were reported to the Board.\n\n## DIVERSITY OF LEADERSHIP\n\nThe Committee recognises that continuing to improve all types of diversity at each level of the Shell Group is crucial. Shell aims to be an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected and has a strong sense of belonging. The Committee's review of diversity objectives and strategies for the Shell Group as a whole also monitors the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nIn February 2021 Shell published its diversity aspirations as part of its strategic update. Gender and nationality diversity is increasing, and focus is broadening and deepening in other areas such as race and ethnicity, enablement and LGBT+. When looking at our progress against our ambitions, female representation has steadily improved in recent years. Among experienced recruitment in 2020, Shell companies recruited 31% females, and among graduates 49%. Female representation in the top 1,400 roles ('Senior Leadership' positions) has strengthened by 1.4 percentage points during 2020 to 27.8%, and further improvement is actively pursued. Nationality diversity, such as Asian and American talent, continues to advance in a manner reflective of the business outlook and we have a strong focus on progressing race and ethnic minority representation. The representation of people of colour among Shell's senior leaders in the USA has been actively tracked for many years. It stood at 26.4% at the end 2020, compared with 17.3% in 2016. In in the UK, BAME representation among senior leaders was 10.6%, an advance from 7% in 2018.\n\nSenior Leadership is a Shell measure and different from that which we are required to report under the Code, being female representation in Senior Management and their direct reports, where the percentage is 29.5%.\n\nAlthough the Committee monitors Shell's organisational diversity and inclusion strategies and initiatives, it also holds itself accountable for the Board's own diversity and inclusion. By the end of 2020, the Board's diverse composition clearly met both the Hampton Alexander and Parker Reviews' objectives by reflecting 38.46% female representation with one person meeting BAME criteria. Gender representation was down slightly from May 2020 (when the Board's composition included 42% female representation) as a result of the departure of three Non-executive Directors (one female, two males) and the appointment later in the year of four new Non-executive Directors (one female, three males). But following the 2021 AGM, subject to shareholder approval and for the first time in Shell's history, the Board is expected to reach gender parity with 50% female representation (after the departure of two males and the expected/uni00A0appointment of one female).\n\n- More information on diversity in Shell is provided in the Our people section on/uni00A0page 108.\n\n## The People Strategy and culture and identity\n\nIn 2020, the Committee conducted an in-depth examination of the Royal Dutch Shell People Strategy, with a particular emphasis on our aspired culture and identity. Leaders are key to delivering the Company's strategic ambitions and animating our aspired identity and culture. Given the critical importance of this issue for the Company's transformation under our Powering Progress strategy, the Committee will conduct further engagements in 2021 to maintain proactive oversight over the issue of/uni00A0leadership and aspired identity and culture.\n\n## Committee Activity\n\nIn addition to its considerations regarding succession, the Committee made recommendations on corporate governance guidelines, monitored compliance with corporate governance requirements and made recommendations on corporate governance-related disclosures. The Committee continues to monitor and review this area, considering whether and how current Company governance matters should be strengthened. Further insight on some of the Committee's areas of consideration in 2020/uni00A0is provided below.\n\n| Succession [A]       | Topic of discussion/Example of Board activity                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Recommendation       | \u25a0 Appointment of Dick Boer, Martina Hund-Mejean,  Sir Andrew Mackenzie and Abraham (Bram)  Schot to the Board.  \u25a0 Changes to the composition of the Board  committees. |\n| Review and oversight | \u25a0 Royal Dutch Shell Senior Succession and  Resourcing Review.                                                                                                          |\n| Oversight            | \u25a0 Royal Dutch Shell People Strategy including  culture and identity. \u25a0 End-to-end talent management in Royal Dutch/uni00A0Shell.                                       |\n| Engagement           | \u25a0 Talent engagements                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n| Governance                                                             | Topic of discussion/Example of Board activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governing the Board  and its committees                                | \u25a0 Reviewed its Principles for the Strategic  Composition of the Board. \u25a0 Reviewed its Terms of Reference, and the terms of  Reference for other Board committees and the  matters reserved to the Board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Regulation, legislation  and/uni00A0other governance- related guidance | \u25a0 Key governance matters affecting the Company's  external reporting. \u25a0 Other governance and regulatory changes agreed  or proposed and their impact or potential impact  on the Company, its processes and its reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| RDS matters                                                            | \u25a0 Considered any potential conflicts of interest and  the independence of the Non-executive Directors. \u25a0 Review of additional external appointments  requested by Directors, with specific focus on the  time allocated to all commitments.

        "page_content": "## NOMINATION AND SUCCESSION COMMITTEE\n\n## Director Induction and Training\n\nAfter being appointed to the Board, Directors receive a comprehensive induction tailored to their individual needs. This normally includes site visits and meetings with Senior Management to enable them to build up a detailed understanding of Shell's business and strategy, and the key risks and issues that Shell faces. Existing Directors are also able to join these visits to keep abreast of business developments and progress. With the abnormal COVID-19 circumstances in 2020, the induction programme was quickly adapted to a completely virtual induction.\n\nAlthough the programme had received praise from new Non-executive Directors over the past several years, enhancements were nonetheless implemented in 2020 despite the required fully virtual implementation.\n\nThe enhancements ensured that all onboarding was phased and prioritised based on forthcoming Board agenda items to help ensure the new Non-executive Director 'hit the ground running'. The enhancements included digital onboarding books for each new Non-executive Director. These onboarding books complemented the existing digital Directors' Handbook and featured:\n\n## CHAIR SUCCESSION Message from Euleen Goh\n\nIn early 2018, the process of selecting the next Chair of the Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc began in response to the proposed limit on Chair tenure, outlined in the draft version of the Code. The Nomination and Succession Committee (NOMCo) created a subcommittee, drew up a/uni00A0potential succession timeline, and initiated an internal and external search process. Hans Wijers, the Senior Independent Director at the time, led the subcommittee and the search process. Chad Holliday, the/uni00A0current Chair, was not a member of the subcommittee.\n\nMy predecessor Gerard Kleisterlee took over from Hans in May 2018 and refined the selection criteria and succession timeline. The subcommittee agreed what qualities the successful candidate should have, and determined the functional focus elements of the new Chair's role. Accordingly, the subcommittee considered and interviewed multiple candidates.\n\nI assumed leadership of the subcommittee after Gerard retired from the Board at the 2020 AGM. The NOMCo subcommittee further reviewed the required qualities and functional focus elements of the role in the context of the current environment. The subcommittee also examined the main trends and factors affecting the long-term success and future viability of Shell, and the organisation's strategic priorities, consulting on these with the wider Board. One-on-one discussions were held with each Board member. The review and the discussions helped us to refine our search process with a clear and updated understanding of the qualities, skills and attributes that the future Chair should possess.\n\nWe engaged with some of our larger investors, as appropriate, seeking/uni00A0input on the skills, attributes and sector knowledge that they considered important for the Chair candidate profile. These discussions were very valuable. They helped inform our search and selection of the/uni00A0most appropriate individual for the role.\n\n- \u25a0 overviews of scheduled briefing meetings customised to the Non-executive Director's needs;\n- \u25a0 lists of common Shell acronyms;\n- \u25a0 hyperlinks to key Shell publications (external and internal);\n- \u25a0 key current materials on:\n- - Board governance;\n- - Shell's safety and core values;\n- - Group strategy and portfolio; and\n- \u25a0 biographies of key executives\n- - key businesses and functions.\n- \u25a0 Other enhancements of the onboarding programme for Non-executive Directors included:\n- - where feasible, pairing up new Non-executive Directors in onboarding briefings to optimise learning while also providing opportunities for collegial relationship-building and increasing efficiencies for the executives; and\n- - arranging briefing meetings with key executives (both business and/uni00A0functional) customised to Non-executive Directors' needs;\n- - where possible, arranging virtual site visits (either specifically for onboarding or by inviting the new Directors to committees' virtual site/uni00A0visits).\n\nAfter this thorough and robust search process, the Board agreed unanimously at its March 2021 meeting that Sir Andrew Mackenzie should be appointed Chair of the Board with effect from the conclusion of Shell's 2021 Annual General Meeting, scheduled for May 18, 2021.\n\nWhen reviewing candidates, our preferred qualities and functional focus elements included a strong requirement for a candidate who has experience in leading large, complex, international organisations. The candidate would have had significant experience in capital discipline. He/she should have an ability to balance the transformational changes that Shell needs to make against the timing of these changes as it navigates the energy transition. The successful candidate should have demonstrated sustainable actions with respect to the climate change agenda. An understanding of the energy market was essential, without it being necessary for the candidate to have spent their entire career working in the oil and gas sector.\n\nIn Andrew we believe that we have found the required qualities and more. Andrew is a lifelong learner with a collaborative, agile mindset and he is a champion of good governance. His strategic vision has helped operations and companies under his leadership to transform. His leadership performance in the areas of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and climate action are outstanding. He was recently knighted by the Queen of the United Kingdom for his services to business, science and technology. Andrew firmly believes that business can be a force for good, for shareholders and society alike.\n\nAndrew joined the Board in October 2020 and has dedicated significant time to familiarising himself with the business, the people, and the Powering Progress strategy which he and the Board fully support and are committed to delivering together with management.\n\nHis broad experience, strategic vision, scientific curiosity and commercial acumen make him the ideal candidate to lead the Board of/uni00A0Royal Dutch Shell plc.",

We/uni00A0monitored closely and welcomed Shell's much improved safety performance, and contributed actively to the energy transition pathway and new carbon targets developed.'\n\nSIR NIGEL SHEINWALD GCMG\n\n## PURPOSE\n\nThe Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) assists the/uni00A0Board in reviewing the practices and performance of Shell, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate change, and broader/uni00A0sustainability.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Committee meets regularly to review and discuss a wide range of important topics. These include the safe and responsible operation of Shell's facilities, environmental protection and greenhouse gas emissions, significant incidents that impact safety and environmental performance, progress towards Shell's climate targets, and energy transition. The Committee also endorses the Shell annual HSSE & SP assurance plan, reviewing the execution of the plan and audit outcomes.\n\nThe Committee assesses Shell's overall sustainability performance and provides input to Shell's annual reporting and disclosures on sustainability. It also advises the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy transition that apply to the Executive/uni00A0Committee annual scorecard and long-term incentive plan.\n\nThe Committee reviews and considers external stakeholder perspectives in relation to Shell's business, as well as how Shell addresses issues of public concern that could affect its reputation and licence to operate. Examples include plastic waste, methane emissions, human rights, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and access to energy in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn line with the strategic importance of the Committee's agenda, the Chair and the Chief Executive Officer regularly attend the Committee meetings for discussions on specific topics.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc's Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee hold overall accountability for sustainability within Shell, supported by the Executive Vice President for Safety & Environment and/uni00A0other senior managers.\n\n## ACTIVITIES\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee focused on the areas of greatest strategic importance to Shell, in line with its updated Terms of Reference. This allowed the Committee to oversee effectively and thoroughly the practices and performance of the Company with respect to safety, environment including climate change, and broader sustainability.\n\nThe Committee was pleased that there were no fatalities in 2020 at Shell-operated ventures, the first year this has been achieved and a testament to Shell's relentless focus on safety. The Committee welcomed Shell's refreshed approach to safety announced in 2020, with its emphasis on the human dimension of safety performance.\n\nThe topics discussed in particular depth by the Committee included personal and process safety, Shell's climate targets and the energy transition, and remuneration metrics and targets. The Committee also reviewed Shell companies' operations and the challenges faced in Nigeria and Brazil.\n\nTogether with the Audit Committee and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, the Committee reviewed the controls and procedures for managing changes to Shell's portfolio. The Committee Chair also held several meetings with senior leaders to discuss specific topics including new fuels, carbon emissions reduction and decommissioning.",

The Committee believe this again demonstrates Shell's determination to play its full role in the energy transition. The Committee has had in-depth discussions with management about how Shell's climate ambitions are being put into operation through portfolio changes, the use of nature-based solutions, the development of carbon capture utilisation and storage, and carbon abatement programmes at operated facilities.\n\nFollowing the Committee's review of remuneration with management, new/uni00A0safety and environment metrics will be introduced for 2021 along with increased weighting for these metrics and energy transition metrics, which/uni00A0should drive further performance improvements.\n\nThe Committee closely monitored and strongly supported Shell's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of care for staff and the safe management of operations. The Committee appreciated Shell's rapid deployment of virtual working technology from the start of the pandemic to enable business continuity and support continued HSSE & SP assurance activities across Shell.\n\nActivities performed\n\nFrequency\n\nThe Committee continued to address wider questions of public concern such as plastic waste, methane emissions and human rights. It looks forward to resuming direct engagement with stakeholders once the COVID-19 restrictions come to an end.\n\n- For further details on SESCo and how Shell manages sustainability see/uni00A0www.shell.com\n\n## SITE VISITS\n\nThe Committee postponed its site visits of the Rheinland refinery in Germany and LNG Canada project in British Columbia due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee instead conducted a virtual site visit/uni00A0of Rheinland via videoconference. The visit focused on safety and environmental performance and the planned transformation of the Rheinland site into an energy and chemicals park. It also included a/uni00A0meeting with a minister of the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n| Review Shell's practices and performance relating to Safety, including in particular the safe condition and responsible operation of Shell's assets   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Review Shell's practices and performance relating to environment, including in particular environmental protection and greenhouse gas emissions       |\n| Review any major incidents that impact Shell's safety and environmental performance                                                                   |\n| Review progress towards meeting Shell's climate targets                                                                                               |\n| Endorse Shell's annual Health, Security, Safety, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) assurance plan                                        |\n| Review execution of Shell's HSSE & SP assurance plan and audit outcomes, and review relevant findings from Shell's broader internal audit programme   |\n| Assess Shell's overall sustainability performance and provide input to Shell's annual reporting and disclosures regarding sustainability              |\n| Review how Shell addresses other major issues of public concern that could affect Shell's reputation and licence to operate                           |\n| Review and consider external stakeholder perspectives in relation to Shell's business                                                                 |\n| Advise the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to Sustainable Development and Energy Transition.                                               |\n\nCommittee Activity Key:\n\nAnnually\n\nPeriodically\n\nMost meetings\n\nEvery meeting\n\nAs necessary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gerrit and I/uni00A0were delighted to be joined by new committee members Martina Hund-Mejean and Dick Boer. Their respective expertise and insights are/uni00A0a/uni00A0valuable addition to the AC./uni00A0\n\nThe primary role of the AC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of the risk management framework and system of internal controls as well as consideration of ethics and compliance matters. We are also responsible for assessing the quality of the audit performed by, and the independence and objectivity of, the external auditor. The AC also makes a recommendation to the Board on the appointment or reappointment of the external auditor. In addition, we oversee the/uni00A0work/uni00A0and quality of the internal audit function.\n\nOver the course of a year, the AC has a rolling agenda covering a variety of standing matters such as the control framework for the reporting of Shell's oil and gas reserves; information risk management; tax matters; briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor on the effectiveness of Shell's risk management and internal control system and on the outcomes of significant audits and notable control matters, and briefings from the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Specific attention is given to topics that we consider particularly significant, including key areas of judgement relating to Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements, as discussed in more detail later in this report. In 2020, in addition to standing matters, the AC addressed a variety of special focus areas including: the impacts of the/uni00A0COVID-19 pandemic on the controls and assurance environment; the/uni00A0impacts of the macroeconomic conditions on the outlook for commodity prices and refining margin assumptions; the effectiveness of decommissioning and restoration activities; a review of the integrated risk management landscape across Shell; an in-depth look at Shell's treasury operations; and a review of Trading and Supply's risk management strategy and platform, data and systems update. The AC carried out virtual site visits to Shell's operations in Singapore, Krakow, and Kuala Lumpur. In addition, in March prior to a travel ban prompted by COVID-19, I spent three days in Houston visiting all of Shell's operations. These site visits contribute to the AC's understanding of the risks and opportunities arising in key markets and where important functions are carried out. The visits also provide the opportunity for the AC to engage with a diverse range of Shell staff in each location and to hear directly from them.\n\nAs climate change and energy transition gained further prominence and to help the AC keep abreast of the Company's efforts and strategies to manage potential impacts on Shell's assets, I became a member of the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee in 2020. In addition, the AC requested Ernst and Young LLP (EY), our external auditor, and the Chief Internal Auditor to specify in their respective quarterly reports to the AC what specific steps they have taken to incorporate climate change considerations into all facets of their work.\n\nOn a final note, the AC congratulates Shell's Annual Report team on winning the FD Henri Sijthoff Prize for the best 2019 annual report in the 'listed companies' category in the Netherlands. The award recognises Shell's pursuit of continual transparency improvements in its communications with external stakeholders.\n\n## ANN GODBEHERE\n\nChair of the Audit Committee March/uni00A010, 2021/uni00A0",

In respect of the year ended December 31, 2020, for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Ann Godbehere and Martina Hund-Mejean with effect from her appointment to the Board and AC on May 20, 2020, both qualify as: a person with 'recent and relevant financial experience' and competence in accounting, and, for the purposes of US securities laws, an 'audit committee financial expert'.\n\nThe experience of the AC members outlined on pages 114-121 demonstrates that the AC as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which Shell operates, and the necessary commercial, regulatory, financial and audit expertise required to fulfil its responsibilities. The AC members have gained further knowledge and experience of the sector as a result of their Board membership and through various in-person and virtual site visits since their respective appointments.\n\nThe AC invites the Chief Financial Officer, the Legal Director, the Chief Internal Auditor, the Executive Vice President Taxation and Controller, the Vice President Group Reporting and the external auditor to attend each meeting. The Chief Executive Officer attends each meeting where the quarterly, half-yearly and year-end results are discussed. The Chair of the Board also regularly attends AC meetings. Other members of management attend when requested on specific topics or to provide input on more detailed technical matters that may arise. The AC regularly holds private sessions separately with the Chief Internal Auditor and the external auditor without members of management, except for the Legal Director, being present. Outside of the formal AC meetings the AC Chair meets regularly with each of the Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President (EVP) Taxation and Controller, the Chief Internal Auditor, the external auditor, and the Chief Information Officer.\n\n## AC REMIT\n\n- \u25a0 evaluating the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control;\n\nThe roles and responsibilities of the AC, as set out in its Terms of Reference are reviewed annually, taking into account relevant regulatory changes and recommended best practice. The key responsibilities of the AC include, but are not limited to:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, including annual reports, half-year reports, and quarterly financial statements;\n- \u25a0 advising the Board whether, in the AC's view, the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25a0 reviewing and discussing with management the appropriateness of judgements involving the application of accounting principles and disclosure rules;\n- \u25a0 reviewing the functioning of the Shell Global Helpline and reports arising from its operation;\n\n- \u25a0 overseeing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance risks;\n- \u25a0 assessing the internal and external auditors' performance and effectiveness each year and approving related remuneration for/uni00A0the/uni00A0external auditor; and\n- \u25a0 monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence of the internal audit function and the external auditor;\n- \u25a0 recommending to the Board for it to put to the Company's Shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to/uni00A0appoint, reappoint, or remove the external auditor.\n\nThese responsibilities form the basis of the AC's annual work plan which is adjusted throughout the year as necessary. The AC is authorised to seek any information it requires from management and external parties and to investigate issues or concerns as it deems appropriate. The AC may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense. No such independent advice was required in 2020.\n\nThe AC keeps the Board informed of its activities and recommendations, and the Chair of the AC provides an update to the Board after every AC/uni00A0meeting. The AC discusses with the Board if it is not satisfied with or believes that action or improvement is required concerning any aspect of/uni00A0financial reporting, risk management and internal control, compliance or audit-related activities.\n\nA copy of the AC's Terms of Reference, which was updated in 2020 to reflect references affected by the separation of the Annual Report and Form 20-F, can be found at www.shell.com.\n\n## AC TOPIC COVERAGE IN 2020\n\nThe pie chart below shows the percentage of time the AC spent on various activities during 2020.\n\n## 2020 AC topic coverage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk management and internal controls\n\nFinancial reporting\n\nCompliance and governance\n\nInternal audit\n\nExternal audit\n\n- 2020 focus areas\n\n## FOCUS AREAS FOR 2020\n\nThe AC was briefed by senior leaders from various business and function areas on the adequacy, design and operating effectiveness of risk management and controls related to the critical activities carried out by their respective business or function.

These discussions also covered monitoring activities around risks, and steps being taken to address identified gaps and emerging risk areas. In addition to the significant accounting and reporting areas discussed on page 150, the business and/uni00A0function areas reviewed by the AC in 2020 included the following:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Integrated risk management - To provide the AC with further insights into Shell's integrated risk management framework across the organisation, the AC received an overview of the approach to risks, controls and assurance in two business areas: information risk management and Shell aircraft. The AC noted the improvement measures and best practices management has embedded within these two areas.\n- \u25a0 Decommissioning and commissioning and restoration (D&R) - The AC was briefed on the different aspects of the D&R management process in Shell and the key risks and opportunities in D&R. The AC discussed the approach to D&R provisions and the controls in place to/uni00A0enable effective governance of D&R.\n- \u25a0 Treasury operations - Senior Treasury leaders provided the AC with an/uni00A0overview of Shell's centralised treasury operations, which include central debt and capital market activities, liquidity and foreign exchange, cash management and treasury functions. The AC reviewed the overall governance, controls and assurance activities. The AC gained a deeper understanding of how risks, including regulatory and/uni00A0fiscal compliance, are managed. As part of this review, the AC discussed future challenges and opportunities in this area.\n- \u25a0 Trading and Supply's control framework - Reflecting the growth in this area in recent years and increasing regulatory demands, the AC continued to focus on key control and compliance matters in Trading and Supply. Management updated the AC on the improvements being made within Trading and Supply to strengthen controls and modernise processes, data and systems and on the new hires in the areas of compliance and risk management.\n\nIn 2020, the AC carried out three site visits that were conducted virtually because of the travel restrictions in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The AC visited: Singapore in October 2020; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia in November and December 2020; and Poland in November 2020 and January 2021. These visits provided the opportunity for the AC to gain a deeper understanding of the various businesses and functions at each location, the local external environment within which those activities take place and how they contribute to Shell achieving its strategic ambitions. In/uni00A0addition to in-depth examinations of specific business areas, topics discussed during the site visits included: an overview of ethics and compliance matters, the challenges of operating during the COVID-19 pandemic for both people and operations, the impact of the energy transition at a local level and results from the Shell People Survey.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nThe AC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal controls by reviewing reports on risks, controls and assurance, including the annual assessment of the system of risk management and internal control, in order to monitor the effectiveness of the procedures for internal control over financial reporting, compliance and operational matters. This annual assessment includes the AC's review of outcomes from the Group Assurance Letter process (a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal and ethical requirements and the Shell Control Framework carried out by each Executive Director) and the Company's evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404). The AC updated the Board on compliance with internal controls across the Shell Group and on/uni00A0any major matters for which action or improvement was needed.\n\nThroughout the year, the AC discussed with management the Company's overall approach to risk management and internal control, including compliance, tax and information risk management matters and the adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures. The AC received quarterly reports from the Executive Vice President Taxation and Controller on the\n\nstatus of actions to address control weaknesses identified during assurance reviews, as well as trend information regarding business incidents and other metrics used to monitor the robustness of the risk management framework and internal control systems. As part of considering the risk management framework, the AC was informed of developments in the legal, regulatory and financial reporting landscape that could affect the Company. The AC was also briefed on litigation matters (see 'Governance' on page 187 and Note 25 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 260-262)./uni00A0\n\nThe AC reviewed on a quarterly basis the status of management's SOX 404 testing of controls and remediation actions to address any identified weaknesses. For 2020, these quarterly reviews also included consideration of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the controls and assurance landscape, including the financial reporting process. The AC and management discussed the steps taken to maintain an effective control environment to demonstrate 'management in control' during the pandemic and to address any new or emerging risks due to the working from home setting during most of 2020.\n\nIn particular, the AC dedicated time to the following standing items during/uni00A02020:\n\n- \u25a0 Information risk management - The Chief Information Officer briefed the AC on the diverse and expanding risk landscape, including changes in cyber-attacks due to the COVID-19 environment, and regulatory developments. The AC was briefed on activities undertaken in 2020 to address and manage new and evolving risks as well as improvements planned for 2021.\n- \u25a0 Tax risks - In addition to the regular review of Shell's tax position, the/uni00A0AC/uni00A0discussed with management new and potential tax legislation developments in various countries and how their potential impact on Shell is being managed. The AC also discussed with management Shell's updated Approach to Tax and proposed responses to the continued demand for greater transparency of tax information, noting/uni00A0for example, Shell's publication of its second Tax Contribution/uni00A0Report in 2020.\n- \u25a0 Oil and gas reserves control framework - The AC reviewed the/uni00A0framework in place to support internal reporting and external disclosures. The AC discussed the processes and controls for preventing and/or mitigating the risks of non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements, and ensuring accurate reserves information is reported in an efficient manner.\n\nIn addition to the above discussions with management, on a quarterly basis, the AC and the Chief Internal Auditor discussed the Company's risk management and internal control system, any significant matters arising from the internal audit assurance programme and management's response to significant audit findings and notable control weaknesses including potential improvements and agreed actions. The AC held similar/uni00A0discussions with EY on a quarterly basis.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nIn 2020, the AC received comprehensive reports from management and the external auditor on quarterly financial reporting, accounting policies and judgements and reporting matters.\n\nShell's annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019 was selected by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for their thematic review of a sample of companies' reporting on the impact of climate change and the first full year of adoption of IFRS 16, Leases. The FRC carried out a limited scope review of Shell's disclosures relating to these matters and did not conduct a full review of Shell's 2019 Annual Report and accounts. Following correspondence, the review was closed on February 10, 2021 and certain disclosure improvements have been made to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The AC reviewed Shell's correspondence with the FRC and discussed with management the disclosures incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements in response to the FRC review.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT/uni00A0 continued\n\nThe AC reviewed the Company's 2020 quarterly unaudited interim financial statements, half-yearly report and Annual Report with management and the external auditor. Following the decision to produce a separate Annual Report and Form 20-F beginning with financial year 2019, the AC reviewed the control framework put in place to ensure the disclosures in both reports comply with relevant requirements.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe AC advised the Board that in its view the 2020 Annual Report including the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy. (See 'Governance' on page 189). To arrive at this conclusion, the AC critically assessed drafts of the 2020 Annual Report including the financial statements and discussed with management the process undertaken to ensure that these requirements were met. This process included: verifying that the contents of the 2020 Annual Report are consistent with the information shared with the Board during the year to support their assessment of Shell's position and performance; ensuring that/uni00A0consistent materiality thresholds are applied for favourable and unfavourable items; considering comments from the external auditor; and/uni00A0receiving assurance from the Executive Committee (EC).\n\n## Going concern and viability statement\n\nThe AC reviewed and considered the Directors' half-year and full-year statements with respect to the going concern basis of accounting. As noted in the viability statement, the Board also reviews the strategic plan which takes account of longer-term forecasts and a wide range of outlooks. Factors considered included: the impact of commodity prices; exchange rates; future carbon costs; agreements like liquid natural gas contract renewals; production levels and product demand, schedules of growth programmes; the financial framework; Shell's business portfolio developments including consideration of the impacts of climate change and Shell's commitment to the Paris Agreement goals; the project funnel to/uni00A0support future growth; and using severe but possible scenarios to run/uni00A0models of the financial impact if certain of Shell's principal risks materialised. The AC considered the mitigating measures and sensitivities that management had applied to the modelling of such scenarios when evaluating the viability statement. The AC also considered the merits of extending the viability statement beyond a period of three years and concluded that the three-year period selected by the Board for the review of Shell's prospects, in line with the operating plan, remained appropriate. The AC supported the going concern basis of accounting and the inclusion of Shell's viability statement in 'Governance' on page 183-184 and considered such statement to be in line with best practice guidance issued by the FRC.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe AC reviewed: the year-end reported proved oil and gas reserves, including management judgements and adjustments made to reflect changes in geological, technical, contractual and economic information, the Brent crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas long-term price assumptions; estimated refining margins; discount rates used for financial/uni00A0reporting, particularly with respect to impairment testing and/uni00A0decommissioning and other provisions (see Note 2 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 221-229 for further information); and the effectiveness of financial controls.\n\n## COMPLIANCE AND GOVERNANCE Ethics and compliance\n\nThe AC discussed with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer the potential impact of COVID-19 on conduct risk at Shell. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer summarised the macro factors affecting conduct risk during the pandemic and the related economic downturn. The AC was/uni00A0updated on management's risk-based approach and mitigation actions taken by Shell in response to these issues, including reinforcing adherence to Shell's compliance rules and Code of Conduct.\n\nIn October 2020, the AC and the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee held a joint session with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer which facilitated an effective discussion of the controls, procedures and governance for managing high risk transactions in Shell, with a particular focus on proposed portfolio activities including new business development opportunities, acquisitions, divestments and joint ventures.\n\nAs part of the annual assessment of the system of risk management and internal control, the AC discussed with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer his annual report on compliance matters. The report included an/uni00A0overview of the effectiveness of the Shell ethics and compliance programme in managing ethics and compliance risk in Shell's business activities, regulatory developments and compliance risks. The AC also discussed investigations of cases involving ethics and compliance concerns. The AC discussed management's findings in such cases to/uni00A0satisfy/uni00A0itself that a rigorous process had been followed, and, where/uni00A0necessary, appropriate disciplinary actions had been taken and management had embedded learnings into Shell's systems and controls.\n\n## Whistleblowing investigations\n\nThe AC is responsible for establishing and monitoring the implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation and follow-up actions of complaints received, including those from the Shell Global Helpline. The/uni00A0AC reviewed whistleblowing reports and internal audit reports and considered management's responses to the findings in these reports.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nThe AC was briefed on regulatory developments in areas including: sustainable finance (in particular management's work on the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy); non-financial reporting (in particular management's assessment of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive Revision); accounting and reporting; environmental liabilities and treasury activities.\n\n## AC annual evaluation\n\nThe AC undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Consistent with the Board's annual performance evaluation for 2020, the AC's performance evaluation was facilitated by Lintstock Limited, a London-based corporate advisory firm. Each AC member responded to a confidential questionnaire about the AC's performance covering questions on: the management of the AC in areas such as the annual cycle of work, agenda for meetings and time and input in meetings; the quality of the information provided to the AC; the value of/uni00A0the virtual site visits and the AC briefings on specific topics; the effectiveness of the AC's oversight in areas such as financial reporting, risk management and internal control, compliance and governance and the work of internal and external audit; rating the AC's performance in reviewing and assessing significant accounting and reporting judgements; and how to improve the AC's performance. When assessing progress against 2019, the AC concluded it had achieved all the 2020 priorities identified in the 2019 evaluation discussion (including visits to Shell's operations in Singapore, Krakow, and Kuala Lumpur, including the finance operation centres in Krakow and Kuala Lumpur, and reviews related to Trading and Supply, regulatory developments, decommissioning and integrated risk management). The AC discussed the outcome of this review as part of its annual evaluation. The AC concluded that its performance in/uni00A02020 had been effective and that it had fulfilled its role in accordance with its Terms of Reference.\n\nIn preparing its workplan for 2021, the AC has agreed the following focus/uni00A0areas in addition to the standing items: New business models and ventures; Pensions; Contracting and Procurement; Reshape management framework and oil and gas pricing methodology. As part of its review of/uni00A0new business models and ventures, the AC plans to visit one of Shell's new ventures in 2021.",

The Chair of the AC approves, in consultation with the/uni00A0Chief Financial Officer, all decisions regarding the performance evaluation, appointment or removal of the Chief Internal Auditor.\n\n## Annual internal audit plan and assessment of internal/uni00A0audit's effectiveness\n\nIn 2020, the AC considered and approved the internal audit function's annual audit plan, including focus areas for 2020 consisting of: (i) talent and capability (professional audit development and technical capabilities); (ii) quality (developing first-line staff competence and clarity on self-verification and supervisory controls); (iii) alignment (improved integration of risk management and alignment of assurance processes across Shell); and (iv) engagement (mainly in the area of keeping staff and Shell stakeholders engaged and informed on effective risk management and internal control). The AC assessed the performance of the internal audit function as effective. The AC also assessed the performance of the/uni00A0Chief Internal Auditor.\n\nThe Chief Internal Auditor periodically assesses whether the purpose, authority and responsibilities of the internal audit function continue to enable it to accomplish its objectives. The results of this periodic assessment are communicated to the EC and AC. The Chief Internal Auditor maintains an internal quality assurance and improvement programme covering all aspects of internal audit's activities, and evaluates the conformance of these activities with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' standards. The Chief Internal Auditor also assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of internal audit's activities and identifies opportunities for improvement. The results of this annual assessment are discussed with the EC and AC and include a reconfirmation to the AC of the continued validity of the charter of the internal audit function, or proposals for an update. At least every five years, the effectiveness and quality of the internal audit function are assessed externally and the report is reviewed/uni00A0with the AC. An independent assessment of internal audit was/uni00A0conducted in 2018. The next such external assessment is planned to/uni00A0take place in 2023.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR Annual external audit plan and assessment of external audit's effectiveness\n\nEY reviewed with the AC its audit strategy, scope and plan for the 2020 audit, highlighting any areas which would receive special consideration. The AC considered the annual audit plan, which included assessing whether the planned materiality levels and proposed resources to execute/uni00A0the audit plan were consistent with the audit scope.\n\nEY regularly updated the AC on the status of their procedures and preliminary findings, providing an opportunity for the AC to monitor the execution and results of the audit. The AC and EY discussed how risks to/uni00A0audit quality were addressed, key accounting and audit judgements, material communications between EY and management and any issues arising from them. Quarterly, the AC met privately with EY representatives without management being present in order to encourage open and transparent feedback from both parties. In addition, the AC Chair meets separately with the external auditor on a regular basis.\n\nAs part of its oversight of the external auditor, the AC annually assesses the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and the audit process, including an assessment of the quality of the audit, the handling of key judgements by the auditor, and the auditor's response to questions from the AC. The AC evaluated the objectivity and independence of EY and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit process. As part of its evaluation, the AC considered and discussed: (i) the results of Shell management's internal survey relating to EY's performance over the financial year 2020, which reflected a broadly comparable performance to 2019; (ii) views and recommendations from management and the Chief Internal Auditor; (iii) EY's audit quality priorities and actions by EY as part of its sustainable audit quality programme; (iv) the forthcoming partner rotation and measures EY has taken for an orderly transition; and (v) the AC's own experiences, including interactions with the external auditor, throughout the year. Key criteria of the evaluation included: professionalism in areas including competence, integrity and objectivity; constructive challenge of management and key judgements; efficiency, covering aspects such as service level and innovation in the audit process; thought leadership and value added; and compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and professional requirements.\n\nThe Committee also considered EY's quality assurance procedures, internal quality control procedures, competence and most recent Transparency Report and opportunities for improvement. Taking into account the above, the AC is satisfied that EY has continued to provide a/uni00A0high-quality and effective audit in its fifth year as auditor and has maintained its independence and objectivity.\n\nAs required under UK and US auditing standards, the AC received a letter/uni00A0from EY confirming its independence. As required by applicable regulations, EY also informed the AC in writing and discussed with the AC any significant relationships and matters that may reasonably be thought to have an impact on its objectivity and independence.\n\nDuring 2020, there was no review of EY's audits of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements by the Audit Quality Review (AQR) team of the FRC. EY reviewed Shell's correspondence with the FRC relating to the FRC's thematic review of a sample of companies' reporting on the impact of climate change and the first full year of adoption of IFRS 16, Leases .\n\n## Reappointment\n\nThe AC is responsible for considering whether, in order to ensure continuing auditor quality and/or independence, there should be a rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm, including consideration of the advisability and potential impact of conducting a tender process for the appointment of a different independent public accounting firm. The AC is also responsible for making a recommendation to the Board for it to put to the Company's shareholders for approval at the AGM, to appoint, reappoint or remove the external auditor.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT/uni00A0 continued\n\nAt the AGM in May 2020, the shareholders approved a resolution to reappoint EY as external auditor until the conclusion of the next AGM. EY/uni00A0was first appointed at the AGM in May 2016 following the conclusion of a competitive tender process. The Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the 2020 financial year. The AC acknowledges the UK and Dutch legal requirements relating to mandatory audit rotation and audit tendering under which the Company will be required to tender for the audit no later than the 2026 financial year. The AC regularly reviews auditor performance and may elect to carry out the tender earlier than the 2026 financial year if it determined it/uni00A0would be in the interests of the Company's shareholders to do so.\n\nAs 2020 represents the conclusion of EY's first five-year term, the AC reflected upon whether conducting an audit tender at this time would be appropriate. The AC's consideration took into account: the AC remains satisfied with the quality and independence of the audit conducted by EY; given Shell's size and complexity, any new external auditor would need a/uni00A0transition period to develop sufficient understanding of the business; frequent changes of external auditor would be inefficient and could lead to increased risk and the loss of cumulative knowledge; a change in auditor would be expected to have a significant impact on Shell, including on the Finance function; and any change in auditor should be scheduled to limit operational disruption. The AC also considered that the current external audit partner, Mr Allister Wilson, who has held this position since EY's initial appointment in 2016, is rotating off the Shell audit after the 2020 audit. Mr Gary Donald will serve as the audit partner beginning with the 2021 audit engagement.\n\nAfter due consideration the AC determined that it would not be appropriate to re-tender for the external audit at this time and has recommended to the Board to propose at the 2021 AGM that EY be reappointed as the external auditor of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2021. The recommendation is free from influence by a third party and there are no contractual obligations that restrict the AC's ability to make such a recommendation.\n\n## NON-AUDIT SERVICES\n\nThe AC maintains an auditor independence policy (AIP) in respect of the provision of services by the external auditor. The AC regularly reviews this policy for necessary changes in response to changes in related standards and regulatory requirements. This policy was updated in January 2020 (and became effective in March 2020) to incorporate the Revised Ethical/uni00A0Standards issued by the FRC in December 2019.\n\nThis policy, designed to safeguard auditor objectivity and independence, includes rules relating to the provision of audit services, audit-related services and other non-audit services, and stipulates which services require specific prior approval by the AC.\n\nThe policy also defines prohibited services that are not to be provided by/uni00A0the auditor because they represent a risk to the external auditor's independence. Prohibited services are any that relate to management decision-taking or any other service that could compromise auditor independence or the perception thereof. These prohibited services include/uni00A0all services listed as prohibited in the UK and US auditor independence rules.\n\nFor certain services that are not prohibited, because of the knowledge and experience of the external auditor and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it can be more efficient or prudent to engage the external auditor rather than another party. This is particularly the case with audit-related assurance services that are closely connected to the audit function where the external auditor has the benefit of knowledge gained from work already performed as part of the audit.\n\nUnder the AIP, the AC will only approve services to be carried out by the/uni00A0external auditor or its affiliates where such services do not present a/uni00A0conflict of interest risk in fact or in appearance. The AC reviews quarterly reports from management on the audit and non-audit services reported in/uni00A0accordance with the policy or for which specific prior approval from the AC is being sought. To the extent that the fee value of an additional audit service contract does not individually exceed $500,000, no prior approval of the AC is required. All non-audit services where the fee for an individual contract exceeds $100,000 (from January 1 to March 15, 2020, $50,000), including audit-related services, require individual prior approval by the AC. In each case where the audit or non-audit service contract does not exceed the relevant threshold, the matter is approved by management by delegated authority from the AC and is subsequently presented for approval by the AC at the next quarterly AC meeting. The AC is mindful of the overall proportion of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining whether to approve such services.\n\nThe scope of the non-audit services contracted with the external auditor in/uni00A02020 consisted mainly of interim reviews and other audit-related assurance services. The associated compensation for these audit-related services and other non-audit services amounted to 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively, of the external auditor's audit and audit-related remuneration.\n\n## FEES\n\nAfter due consideration, the AC approved the auditor's remuneration, satisfying itself that the level of fees payable in respect of the audit and non-audit services provided was appropriate and that an effective, high-quality audit could be conducted for such fees.\n\n- Note 28 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 263 provides details of the auditor's remuneration.",

This report consists of two further sections:\n\n- \u25a0 the Directors' Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM.\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe Remuneration Committee (REMCO) has worked hard in recent years to/uni00A0engage with shareholders on decision-making and to improve the quality of our disclosures. At the Annual General Meeting in May 2020, when my predecessor, Gerald Kleisterlee, stepped down, there was strong support of the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration (95.44% in favour) and the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy (92.91% in favour). I/uni00A0have since had the opportunity to meet a considerable number of shareholders and I value the openness of these discussions. In such challenging times, these engagements have helped to shape and inform the REMCO's decisions.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have had an enormous impact in 2020, affecting people around the world and creating extremely challenging conditions for Shell, the energy sector and wider industry. Throughout this period, in addition to the steps to reinforce the financial strength and resilience of its business, Shell's priorities have been the well-being and safety of employees, taking care of customers, and supporting the communities where Shell operates.\n\nce",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT/uni00A0 continued\n\nFor Shell employees, the pandemic and the changes to the way in which we live and work undoubtedly caused increased anxiety and stress. Shell has sought to provide support in a variety of ways to help our people manage their mental health and bolster resilience during these difficult times. For example; additional leave policies were introduced and flexible working patterns have been encouraged to support families juggling home schooling and caring for dependent parents. Cash allowances for ergonomic office equipment have been provided to those working from home offices, dining tables and bedrooms around the world.\n\nGiven the scale of the challenge facing Shell and the uncertainty about the speed of recovery, measures to ensure Shell's financial resilience have also impacted our people. Where required, Shell has sought to manage these sensitively, giving employees certainty and choice wherever possible. For example, towards the start of the pandemic, Shell made the commitment that there would be no new redundancies for three months. It/uni00A0then offered voluntary severance programmes giving those with a preference to leave employment the chance to do so. On pay, base salaries have been protected, with no cuts or temporary reductions made/uni00A0to salary.\n\nThe deteriorating global economic situation and significant uncertainties about mid- to longer-term economic conditions meant management and the Board had to take decisive measures to ensure the financial resilience of the Company. These included the decision by the Board to not proceed with the next tranche of the share buyback programme and to rebase the dividend. We have subsequently announced an intent to increase the dividend annually, subject to Board approval. These measures have had/uni00A0a/uni00A0significant effect on our shareholders, and accordingly have influenced the REMCO's decision-making in 2020.\n\nShell has also taken steps to support customers and communities. These have included providing free food and drinks to health-care professionals and delivery workers at more than 15,000 retail sites across more than 30 countries. We also delivered care packs to frontline workers and essential service drivers in six countries. We have donated fuel vouchers, groceries, hygiene kits and ingredients for sanitising products. In December 2020, Shell made a $10 million donation to the GAVI vaccine alliance to help fund the COVAX initiative for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines. Further information on Shell's contribution to COVID-19 relief efforts will be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2021.\n\nDuring 2020, many governments introduced packages to support business and stimulate economies as the pandemic negatively affected businesses and jobs. Shell recognises that much of this support was intended to help smaller businesses. Shell has made very limited use of/uni00A0these support measures, and only where it was considered appropriate/uni00A0in/uni00A0the local context.\n\nThe REMCO has sought to balance two factors in its deliberations. The/uni00A0first was the response to the headwinds of 2020 and how this has affected our shareholders, our employees and our relationships with customers and governments. Against this, the REMCO has had to weigh/uni00A0the need to achieve Shell's longer-term strategic ambitions as it/uni00A0accelerates its transformation into a provider of net-zero emissions energy products and services.\n\n## 2020 PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION DECISIONS\n\nIn 2020, the REMCO was pleased to see improved safety performance, with a reduction in the number of personal and process safety incidents. There were no safety-related fatalities in 2020 in Shell-operated ventures, but there were two COVID-19-related occupational illnesses resulting in/uni00A0death.\n\nShell has demonstrated resilience despite facing significant headwinds in 2020. Cash flow from operations (CFFO) has been strong, with the Shell Group clearly outperforming our competitors. This reflects the work done over recent years to high-grade the portfolio, the value created from Shell's integrated business model, and the disciplined approach to managing operating expenditure over the year.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Remuneration Committee made no changes to targets under the in-flight annual bonus or LTIP awards.\n\nThe share price performance has, of course, been disappointing. The mechanisms in the Remuneration Policy mean there is strong alignment of interests between management and shareholders. The high shareholding targets of 700% of base salary for the CEO and 500% for the CFO, and the/uni00A0three-year post-delivery holding requirements attached to the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the 50% portion of the bonus delivered in shares. This mean that Executive Directors have a large investment in Shell, so the share price performance over 2020 has had significant personal impact.\n\n## 2021 base salary\n\nThe REMCO decided in April 2020 that in light of the financial challenges and the need for disciplined management of operating expenses, there would be no salary increases for Executive Directors/uni00A0and Senior Management for 2021. There will also be no salary increase for the majority of Shell employees globally.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe REMCO had approved a 2020 annual bonus scorecard at its meeting on January 28, 2020, based on Shell's operating plan, but this scorecard was not communicated to participants as within a few weeks it became clear that the operating plan had been overtaken by events and was no longer appropriate. It was decided that targets would not be reset, but that operating priorities would be recast to Care in terms of health, safety and well-being for our people, Continuity for our business to support customers and communities and to Cash management to ensure the financial resilience of Shell. The approved scorecard was set aside and Care, Continuity and Cash quickly became the new framework to reflect on performance.\n\nIt had also become clear that there would be difficult financial outcomes ahead. Shell announced a change to the financial framework in March 2020. This included stating that we would not proceed with the next tranche of the share buyback programme and would be rebasing the dividend. In light of this, the REMCO decided that there should be no 2020 annual bonuses for Executive Directors and Senior Management. As no Group scorecard was being published and there would be no measurement of performance against the obsolete 2020 scorecard targets other employees were informed that the/uni00A0Group scorecard outcome for 2020 would be set to zero. This was communicated in April 2020 to allow employees to make financial plans.\n\nAfter the depths of the crisis, there has been some recovery in commodity prices and the business has been resilient in 2020, delivering strong cash generation relative to our peers and performing strongly on safety. But taking into account all relevant factors such as business performance, impairments, dividend changes and the limited use of government support, the REMCO confirmed that its decision that there should be no/uni00A02020 annual bonuses for Executive Directors and Senior Management/uni00A0remained appropriate.\n\n## Vesting of 2018 LTIP awards\n\nThe financial resilience of Shell and work in recent years to high-grade the/uni00A0portfolio are evident in the vesting outcome of the LTIP, which was 90% out of a maximum of 200% based on relative total shareholder return (TSR), CFFO growth, return on average capital employed (ROACE),/uni00A0and absolute free cash flow (FCF).",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 CFFO is measured on a relative basis and Shell ranked first, leading to a vesting outcome of 50%. Total CFFO was $34 billion in 2020, with more than $129 billion generated over the three-year vesting period. In/uni00A0absolute terms, this is more than double the CFFO generated in 2020 by our next closest competitor.\n- \u25a0 The ROACE performance metric is assessed on a relative basis and/uni00A0Shell ranked third, leading to a vesting outcome of 20%.\n- \u25a0 On TSR, Shell ranked third in the peer group. Returning $55 billion to shareholders over three year performance period in the form of dividends and share buybacks and leading to a vesting outcome of 20%.\n\nThe challenges of 2020 are clearly evident in the outcome on the FCF, which/uni00A0is measured on an absolute basis, based on the sum of the annual operating plan targets over the three year performance period. The outcome, $87 billion, was below the vesting threshold of $93 billion (target/uni00A0$102 billion).\n\nIn making the final vesting decision, the REMCO considered the overall performance of Shell during the three-year vesting performance period. In/uni00A0its deliberations, the REMCO paid particular attention to:\n\n- \u25a0 guidance issued by the investor community and feedback from shareholders regarding the appropriate pay outcomes for 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u25a0 the shareholder experience;\n- \u25a0 the impact of the pandemic on financial outcomes;\n- \u25a0 the conclusion that there should be no 2020 annual bonuses, which took into account business performance, impairments, dividend changes and the limited use of government support;\n- \u25a0 the effectiveness of management over the performance period in developing a high-quality portfolio capable of delivering resilient cash/uni00A0flows;\n- \u25a0 the Committee assured itself that the limited use of government support had not impacted the vesting outcomes; and\n- \u25a0 the impact of the high shareholding requirement, which has helped align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders.\n\nThe REMCO also noted it would mean a 10-year average vesting outcome of the LTIP of 98%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the current LTIP structure in delivering alignment with target pay and balancing cyclical performance. Taking all these factors into account, the REMCO determined to vest the 2018 LTIP awards at 90% without using discretion. A formulaic outcome was also applied to the Performance Share Plan (PSP) made to around 16,500 employees annually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 single figure of remuneration\n\nThe overall single figure of remuneration for 2020 is \u20ac5.8 million for the CEO and \u20ac3.7 million for the CFO. This is one of the lowest CEO single figure outcomes in ten years.\n\nIn finalising these amounts, the REMCO noted the decline in pay outcomes from the previous year. These, as noted above, were a decline of 41% for the CEO and 38% for the CFO. The REMCO considered that the decision that there should be no 2020 annual bonuses appropriately reflected Shell's 2020 performance outcomes, including the business performance, financial impairments taken in the year and dividend changes. It also considered the strong alignment between Executive Director and shareholder interests through the shareholding requirements. The REMCO also took account of the pay outcomes for employees, the majority of whom received no 2020 bonus and will not receive a 2021 salary increase. The REMCO was satisfied that the remuneration policies had operated as intended and that realised pay in 2020 was appropriate in the context of wider Company performance and the target pay opportunity as illustrated on pages 174-175.\n\n## Ten year CEO single figure outcomes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBase Salary and benefits\n\nBonus\n\nLTI\n\nPension and tax equalisation\n\n## 2021 LTIP grants\n\nIn considering the response to the challenges of 2020, the REMCO believes it is important to maintain the strong focus on variable pay. The LTIP is an important element of the pay framework. It has been proven to provide a robust link between pay and performance over a sustained period of time. The usual awards are 300% of base salary for the CEO and 270% for the CFO. When determining award sizes, the REMCO has been mindful of the risk of windfall gains, given how the decline in the Shell share price during 2020 affected the number of shares awarded. The REMCO has sought to consider how shareholders will view this issue, in/uni00A0light of their disappointment with returns and the rebasing of the/uni00A0dividend. At the same time, the REMCO has sought to continue paying competitively in line with the approved remuneration policy.\n\nTaking this into account, the REMCO has decided to make a reduction to/uni00A0the award level for 2021 as a one-off acknowledgement of the unique circumstances. Shell's share price has declined approximately 24% for RDS A shares and 16% for RDS.A ADS since the 2020 share awards. The REMCO has decided to reduce the 2021 awards by 50% of the fall in the share price and has therefore reduced the usual LTIP awards for the CEO and CFO. On this basis, the REMCO approved an award of 231,679 RDS A shares for the CEO and 69,972 RDS.A ADS for the CFO on March 5, 2021. The number of shares awarded to the wider employee population also increased to maintain a competitive pay opportunity.\n\nCEO target pay\n\n(see pages 174-175)",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT/uni00A0 continued\n\nRegardless of the number of shares awarded, the REMCO will closely scrutinise performance over the vesting period to ensure the highest variable pay outcomes are only achieved for the highest quality of performance across all significant areas of activity. If required, discretion will be used to address windfall gains on vesting. This will take into account the effect of any recovery in demand and energy sector outlook on Shell's share price as well as shareholder experience and management's success in delivering Shell's financial performance and strategic ambitions.\n\nThe REMCO will use discretion to override formulaic reward outcomes if they/uni00A0fail to reflect the wider financial or non-financial performance of Shell, or/uni00A0if management has benefited from a general economic or sectoral improvement outside their control. The REMCO has a strong track record of/uni00A0exercising discretion, having used it to adjust the outcome of the annual/uni00A0bonus in five of the past ten years.\n\n## EVOLVING REMUNERATION IN LINE WITH STRATEGY\n\nTurning now to the future, I would like to provide further detail on how we/uni00A0intend to link pay to Shell's evolving strategic ambitions.\n\nPowering Progress sets out a strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions. Reflecting our evolving priorities, in future we will place greater focus on measures connected to succeeding in the energy transition, balanced with the fundamental requirements to deliver financial success, while operating our assets safely, effectively and to plan.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety remains Shell's number one priority, and as part of a refresh of Shell's safety framework, a new Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) metric will replace Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF) as the personal safety metric on the annual bonus scorecard from 2021.\n\nThis adjustment is intended to increase attention on the most serious outcomes, to ensure the focus is on identifying and preventing incidents with the potential to cause life-altering injuries. The number of Tier 1 and 2 process safety incidents will be retained as the measure of process safety, with weighting for safety increasing from 10% to 15% (equally split between personal and process safety).\n\n## Energy transition\n\nShell has been at the forefront of linking executive pay to progress towards a/uni00A0lower-carbon future. We set a Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) target that covers emissions from our customers' use of our products as well as our own operational emissions, and have directly linked employee and management pay to three-year targets aligned with the NCF target. The LTIP energy transition performance metric includes the short-term targets relating to the NCF target and a number of other strategic business transformation targets that measure Shell's progress towards achieving our longer-term ambitions.\n\nThese measures extend the link between pay and the energy transition well beyond the linkage provided by short-term sustainability metrics that focus on operations. When we introduced these measures, Shell was the only major energy company to link long-term incentive pay in this way. We believe we are still among the front-runners in terms of the breadth and detail/uni00A0of our energy transition pay metrics.\n\nOur original targets were calibrated to keep Shell in step with a society working to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and to restrict the rise/uni00A0in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But societal views have evolved rapidly and large parts of society have now set their sights on the most ambitious goal in the Paris Agreement: to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5/uni00A0degrees Celsius. Shell recognised this, and in 2020 announced an updated target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step/uni00A0with society.\n\nThe connection to remuneration will strengthen with the updated strategy./uni00A0We intend to reflect them in the following ways:\n\n- \u25a0 As an energy provider. We have significantly raised our net carbon intensity target in step with achieving a 1.5 degrees Celsius future. We will measure this using our NCF metric. Meaningful carbon intensity reductions will require significant business transformations with longer/uni00A0timescales and are therefore best reflected in the LTIP. We are increasing the weighting of the energy transition condition to account for 20% of the LTIP (up from 10%), putting it on the same level as the financial measures (TSR, CFFO, FCF and ROACE), which will each account for 20% of the LTIP.\n- \u25a0 As an energy user. Shell has a target to achieve net-zero operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050, in step with society. In the annual bonus, progress will be linked to performance assessment based on the/uni00A0greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of our main business lines and, from 2021, a new GHG-abatement target.\n- \u25a0 As an energy partner. In our role as an energy supplier, we will work with sectors which use energy to help them identify and implement ways to decarbonise and make progress towards a net-zero emissions future. New performance measures will need to be developed in this area before it can be linked to remuneration. The REMCO will assess such performance measures, as is appropriate, in the future.\n\nThe connections between remuneration and progress in the energy transition received good support from shareholders during our engagements. These measures will continue to mature as we implement the updated strategy. I also know that many of you are keen to know how/uni00A0we are progressing on the existing energy transition condition and/uni00A0further information is provided on/uni00A0pages 164-165.\n\n## Other changes to 2021 remuneration\n\n- \u25a0 The weighting of the CFFO metric will increase from 30% to 35%, reflecting our commitment to the updated financial framework.\n\nTo ensure that Shell's remuneration structures evolve in line with the recent strategy developments, the following changes will also take place for the 2021 annual bonus scorecard:\n\n- \u25a0 The strength of Shell is as an integrated energy business and our updated strategy and portfolio choices emphasise operational excellence and the delivery of value rather than volume. To reflect this, we will retire the existing production and LNG liquefaction volume measures. We will introduce a new asset management excellence measure, based on Upstream controllable availability, midstream availability and downstream availability. This is designed to encourage an ongoing focus on running our assets effectively and to schedule. Operational excellence will always be fundamental to our/uni00A0success, but/uni00A0its weighting will decrease from 50% of the scorecard to 35% to/uni00A0allow for increased weightings on CFFO, progress/uni00A0in the energy transition and safety.\n- \u25a0 We will further emphasise the importance of achieving progress in the energy transition by making this a separate section of our scorecard. Performance will be based on GHG-emissions-intensity targets and assessments of the delivery of GHG-abatement projects that support our/uni00A0net-zero operational emissions target. These targets will account for/uni00A015% of the scorecard.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe year ahead promises to be another busy one as we look to continue to/uni00A0enhance our alignment of pay with the updated strategy. I look forward to/uni00A0continuing to engage with/uni00A0shareholders in the coming months and I thank/uni00A0you for your continued/uni00A0support.\n\n## NEIL CARSON\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee March 10, 2021",

The REMCO monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior executives below Senior Management, and makes recommendations if appropriate to ensure consistency and alignment with Shell's remuneration objectives. When setting the policy for/uni00A0Executive Director remuneration, the REMCO reviews and considers workforce remuneration and related policies, and how incentives and rewards align with culture.\n\nIn exercising its responsibilities, the REMCO takes into account a variety of/uni00A0stakeholder considerations.\n\nThe REMCO operates within its Terms of Reference, which are reviewed annually. They were last updated on March 13, 2019 and are available at/uni00A0www.shell.com.\n\nAdvice from within Shell was provided by:\n\n- \u25a0 Ronan Cassidy, Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer and Secretary to the REMCO; and\n- \u25a0 Ben van Beurden, Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25a0 Stephanie Boyde, Executive Vice President Performance and Reward.\n\nThe Chair of the Board was consulted on remuneration proposals affecting the CEO, and the CEO was consulted on proposals relating to the CFO and Senior Management.\n\nDuring 2020, the REMCO met five times and its activities included:\n\n- \u25a0 determining vesting of the 2017 LTIP award for Senior Management;\n- \u25a0 carefully deliberating on pay quantum for the CEO;\n- \u25a0 deciding on 2019 annual bonus outcome, 2020 base salaries, 2020 target bonuses and 2020 LTIP awards for Senior Management;\n- \u25a0 approving the 2019 Directors' Remuneration Report;\n- \u25a0 developing the Directors' Remuneration Policy in preparation for the/uni00A02020 AGM vote, in consultation with shareholders;\n- \u25a0 setting 2020 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and targets and subsequently making the decision that there should be/uni00A0no/uni00A0annual bonus in 2020;\n- \u25a0 considering matters relating to the updated strategy and accelerated transition of our business to net-zero emissions and the potential implications for 2021 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and targets; and\n- \u25a0 considering matters related to business performance, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on employees, and determining that no salary increases would apply for 2021 for Executive Directors and Senior Management;\n- \u25a0 monitoring external developments and assessing the impact on the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nIn 2020, the REMCO reviewed benchmarking data and analysis on executive pay market developments that were prepared by Shell's internal/uni00A0HR function. The REMCO has not incurred external remuneration/uni00A0adviser fees.\n\n## PRINCIPLES\n\nThe principles that underpin the REMCO's approach to executive remuneration are set out on page 173.\n\nThe REMCO considered the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance code, and in deciding 2020 pay outcomes it has sought to reflect the principles of clarity, simplicity, risk management, predictability, proportionality and alignment with culture.\n\nShell has a consistent global reward and performance philosophy that sets clear expectations of employees. Through the annual bonus scorecard and the LTIP, remuneration is clearly aligned with Shell's operating plan and strategic ambitions. The same measures apply to Executive Directors and Senior Management and to a significantly broader employee base. This provides alignment throughout the organisation with Shell's culture and strategy. The annual operating plan translates into targets on the annual bonus scorecard, and a quarterly update on performance against scorecard targets is provided to employees. (Exceptionally in 2020, updates on the annual bonus scorecard were not published, this is discussed further on page 154.) Similarly the LTIP is largely based on outperforming the competition, and regular updates on Shell's performance against competitors is provided to employees. In reviewing the Directors' Remuneration Policy, approved at the 2020 AGM, the REMCO sought to make changes that help to simplify remuneration structures (for example, removing the individual performance factor for Executive Directors) and giving more transparent outcomes (for example, removing the bonus asymmetry from the CEO's remuneration structure). To/uni00A0assist in the mitigation of reputational risk and to ensure proportionality, the powers of the REMCO to apply malus and clawback and make discretionary adjustments to variable pay outcomes were expanded, with the intention that the REMCO will use discretion to ensure the highest pay outcomes are delivered only for outstanding performance.\n\nce",

In March, as the implications of the pandemic became increasingly apparent, it became clear that the operating plan and 2020 scorecard had been overtaken by events and were no longer appropriate. It was decided that targets would not be reset but operating priorities would be recast to Care in terms of health, safety and well-being for our people, Continuity for our business to support customers and communities, and Cash management to ensure the financial resilience of Shell. The approved scorecard was set aside and there was no review of the targets or performance against it (or any other/uni00A0targets for the purposes of calculating bonus entitlements). Care, Continuity and Cash quickly became the new framework to reflect on/uni00A0performance.\n\nIt had also become clear that there would be difficult financial outcomes ahead. In March 2020, Shell announced a change to the financial framework. This included stating that we would not be proceeding with the next tranche of the share buyback programme and would be rebasing the dividend. In light of this, the REMCO decided there would be no 2020 annual bonuses for Executive Directors and Senior Management. As no Group scorecard was being published, employees were informed that the/uni00A0Group scorecard outcome for 2020 would be set to zero. This was communicated in April 2020 to allow employees to make financial plans.\n\nAfter the depths of the crisis, there has been some recovery in commodity prices and the business has been resilient in 2020, delivering strong cash generation relative to our peers and performing strongly on safety. But we/uni00A0are far from the financial success in 2020 that would allow an annual bonus. Taking into account all the relevant factors such as business performance, impairments, dividend changes, and the limited use of government support, the REMCO confirmed that its decision that there should be no 2020 annual bonuses remained appropriate.\n\nFor reference, the redundant 2020 annual bonus framework is set out/uni00A0below.

Shell ranked first among our competitors in relative CFFO growth. Total CFFO was $34 billion in 2020, with more than $129 billion generated over the three-year vesting period. In absolute terms, this is more than double the CFFO generated in 2020 by our next closest competitor. On TSR, Shell ranked third in the comparator group, with $55 billion distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. The work done in recent years to focus on capital discipline and get the portfolio to the right size was also reflected in/uni00A0the outcome for return on average capital employed (ROACE), where Shell ranked third among the comparators.\n\nThe REMCO also considered the change in share price between award and vesting, and the impact this had on the outcome. The REMCO also reflected on the overall single outcome for the CEO and decided that no/uni00A0adjustment to the vesting outcomes was required.\n\nAccordingly, the REMCO determined that the LTIP should vest at 90%/uni00A0without the use of discretion. This is illustrated opposite.\n\nThe CEO's and CFO's vested awards are subject to a further three-year holding period which extends beyond Executive Director tenure.\n\n## 2018 LTIP vesting outcome\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A] Based on the share price at award of \u20ac27.325 for CEO and $67.30 for CFO.\n- [C] Based on the opening share price on the date of vesting, March 5, 2021 of \u20ac17.85 for CEO and $43.72 for CFO.\n- [B]  Calculated as the opening share price March 5, 2021 minus the share price at the date of award for the CEO \u20ac17.85 - \u20ac27.325 = -\u20ac9.475 and for the CFO $43.72 - $67.30 = -$23.58\n- [D] Vested shares are subject to a three-year holding period.\n\n## 2018 LTIP vesting outcome - performance metrics\n\nShell\n\n- Comparator oil majors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Measures                                                      | Target   | Outcome                 | Outcome                 | Outcome                 | Outcome                 | Outcome                 | Vesting   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| Relative CFFO  growth                                         | 25%      | 1                       | 2                       | 3                       | 4                       | 5                       | 50%       |\n| Relative TSR                                                  | 25%      | 1                       | 2                       | 3                       | 4                       | 5                       | 20%       |\n| Relative ROACE  growth                                        | 25%      | 1                       | 2                       | 3                       | 4                       | 5                       | 20%       |\n| Absolute FCF \u25a0 Maximum $117bn \u25a0 Target $102bn Threshold $93bn | 25%      | 39.4                    | 39.4                    | 39.4                    | 39.4                    | 39.4                    | 0%        |\n|                                                               | 25%      |                         | 26.4 20.8               | 26.4 20.8               | 26.4 20.8               | 26.4 20.8               | 0%        |\n|                                                               | 25%      |                         |                         | 2018 2019 2020          | 2018 2019 2020          | 2018 2019 2020          | 0%        |\n| Total                                                         | 100%     | (out of a 200% maximum) | (out of a 200% maximum) | (out of a 200% maximum) | (out of a 200% maximum) | (out of a 200% maximum) | 90%       |",

Over the  performance period, the CFO also played a key role in  Shell's/uni00A0endorsement of the responsible tax principles set                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\nThe REMCO considered the single-figure outcomes for the CEO and CFO. It noted that the overall remuneration outcomes were 41% (CEO) and 38% (CFO) lower than in 2019. The REMCO was satisfied that these singlefigure outcomes represented a fair level of remuneration. In deciding this, the REMCO took account of the challenging global economic conditions in 2020, and the steps necessary to reinforce the financial strength and resilience of Shell. It also considered the strong and positive leadership shown in setting out a clear strategic direction for Shell and ensuring it was/uni00A0supported by the necessary organisational design.\n\nIn finalising its remuneration decisions for 2020, the REMCO considered a/uni00A0range of factors, including:\n\n- \u25a0 potential risk adjustment considerations, including safety, ethics and compliance and feedback from the Audit Committee and the Safety, Environment and/uni00A0Sustainability Committee;\n- \u25a0 Shell's performance in 2020 and over the LTIP performance period 2018-2020;\n- \u25a0 the actions taken to protect value, strengthen the balance sheet and preserve cash;\n- \u25a0 the internal relativity of remuneration compared with the variable pay outcomes for the general workforce;\n- \u25a0 the final LTIP vesting outcome;",

Most of this support was automatic, such as around SGD 55 million under the Singaporean Job Support Scheme and \u00a320 million of business rate relief in the UK. Relief which Shell has applied for is very limited, with the most notable being CAD 34 million received under the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy scheme. Careful consideration was given prior to making an application as to whether it was appropriate to take this support. We are comfortable that doing so was appropriate from a Canadian perspective and consistent with doing all that we could to protect jobs and care for employees in the worst phase of the crisis, many of whom work in small communities. The REMCO reviewed and was satisfied that this support had no impact on the mathematical vesting outcome of the LTIP;\n- \u25a0 the decision that there should be no 2020 annual bonuses, which took into account business performance, impairments, dividend changes and the use of limited government support;\n- \u25a0 the alignment of the Executive Directors with the shareholder experience through their high shareholding requirements;\n- \u25a0 feedback from shareholders regarding the appropriate pay outcomes in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n- \u25a0 the personal performance of the Executive Directors.\n\nAfter reflecting on the above factors, the REMCO was satisfied that the remuneration policies had operated as intended.\n\n## Pension\n\nBen van Beurden's pension arrangements comprise a defined benefit plan with a maximum pensionable salary of \u20ac98,993; and a net pay defined contribution pension plan with a 2020 employer contribution of 27% of/uni00A0salary in excess of \u20ac98,993. He has the option to take cash as an alternative to pension contributions (in either case subject to income tax)/uni00A0and elected to take his benefit in the form of contributions throughout/uni00A02020.\n\nThe employer contribution levels are in line with those applicable to other Netherlands-based employees. Under the Dutch pension regulations applicable to the pension arrangement in which he participates, the contribution rate increases with age and is shown opposite.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the average employer contribution rate for Netherlands employees who participate in the net pay defined contribution pension arrangement on the same terms as Ben van Beurden was 20%. For reference, in the UK, the average employer contribution rate to the Shell UK defined contribution plan is 20%.\n\n## Shell Netherlands Pension Stichting net pay defined/uni00A0contribution ladder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Age     | Employer contribution   |\n|---------|-------------------------|\n| 15 - 19 | 6.30%                   |\n| 25 - 29 |                         |\n| 30 - 34 | 10.44%                  |\n| 35 - 39 | 12.31%                  |\n|         | 14.38%                  |\n| 45 - 49 | 17.07%                  |\n| 50 - 54 |                         |\n|         | 19.77%                  |\n| 60 - 64 |                         |\n| 65 - 67 |                         |\n\nJessica Uhl is a member of the Shell US retirement benefit arrangements, which include the Shell Pension Plan (a defined benefit plan), and a defined contribution plan where she receives an employer contribution of 10% of salary. This is the same as the average employer contribution rate for US employees, which was 10%. As for all other pre-2013 members of the Shell Pension Plan, she has an annual choice of two accrual formulas with different forms of benefits, one in the form of a lifetime annuity and the other allowing for a lump-sum payment. She elected to accrue benefits for 2020 under the former. Around 10,000 out of 17,000 Shell US employees have the option of choosing between the two formulas. These arrangements are the same for all employees who joined Shell US at the same time as Jessica Uhl. The difference in pension provision for Jessica Uhl, compared with employees who joined pre-2013, is that her bonus is not pensionable as an Executive Director while for other relevant US employees the bonus is pensionable. She also has a deferred Dutch defined benefit pension plan, as a result of/uni00A0a prior Shell assignment on/uni00A0local Dutch terms and conditions.\n\nThe REMCO believes these arrangements are aligned with corporate governance developments in the UK which emphasise the desirability of/uni00A0Executive Directors'/uni00A0pension arrangements being the same as those for/uni00A0the general employee/uni00A0population.\n\n## Scheme interests awarded in 2020\n\nScheme interests awarded to Executive Directors in 2020 (audited)\n\nPotential amount vesting\n\n| Scheme interest type   | Type of interest  awarded   | End of  performance  period   | Target award [A]                                                                                                                                                     | Minimum  performance  (% of shares  awarded) [B]   | Maximum performance  (% of shares of the  target award) [A]                         |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LTIP                   | Performance  shares         | December 31,  2022            | Ben van Beurden: 200,589 A shares, equivalent  to 3.0 x base salary or \u20ac4,764,000.

They are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Net Carbon Footprint: a target for reducing the NCF of the energy products Shell sells (a carbon intensity measure that takes into account their full life-cycle emissions, including customers' emissions associated with using them).\n\nLagging measure - a measure of our progress in meeting our ambition:\n\nLeading measures - the levers we will use to drive future NCF reduction:\n\n- \u25a0 Advanced biofuels and alternative fuels technology: biofuels are expected to play a valuable role in the changing energy mix and are likely to be one of the key decarbonisation levers for sectors that need to continue to use liquid fuels in the foreseeable future, such as some segments of transport and industry. For society and for Shell, commercialisation of advanced biofuel technology is one of the most important steps in energy transition.\n- \u25a0 The growth of our power business: all decarbonisation scenarios recognise that a key way to cut greenhouse gas emissions is to increase electricity use and decarbonise electricity by shifting to renewables and gas-fired power generation. Our ambition to grow our power business is based on selective investments in generation, and in business models based on reselling power generated by others.\n- \u25a0 The development of systems to capture and absorb carbon: carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon sinks, such as nature-based solutions, are required as part of the global response to climate change.\n\n## Operation of energy transition measures in the 2020 LTIP\n\n## NCF reduction target\n\n- \u25a0 Measured against 2016 base year (79 grams of CO 2 equivalent per megajoule)\n\n## Drive future NCF reduction\n\n- \u25a0 Advanced biofuels technology\n- \u25a0 Growing our power business\n- \u25a0 Systems to capture and absorb carbon\n\n## Energy transition vesting (basis for the Remuneration Committee's decision) [A]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 10% weighting\n- \u25a0 Targets set as ranges\n- \u25a0 Combination of leading and lagging measures\n- \u25a0 Commercially sensitive targets, so will be disclosed retrospectively. Annual updates on progress relating to the measures will be provided\n- [A] The vesting schedule for the energy transition metric will be based on how many of the four targets are met. 1/4 will equal 40% vesting, 2/4 100%, 3/4 150%, and 4/4 200%. The Remuneration Committee may take into account other appropriate considerations, after taking advice from the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee. For example, it may increase the weighting of NCF relative to the other performance conditions in making its vesting decision. Any use of discretion will be disclosed and explained.\n\n## 2020 - 2022 target\n\n\u25a0 3-4% reduction\n\nTargets have been set for each element. Progress in the energy transition is/uni00A0not expected to be linear, because it will reflect the pace of change of society as a whole and the speed at which Shell progresses its strategic business objectives. As a result, targets have been set as ranges. These targets are commercially sensitive, so they will not be disclosed until the end of the performance period (or until they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive). An update on our progress in relation to the measures is provided on page/uni00A0165.\n\nThe vesting outcome for the part of the award weighted to the energy transition condition ranges from 0% to 200% of award. The REMCO, at its sole/uni00A0discretion, will determine vesting outcomes after considering achievement against the target ranges and feedback from the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo). In doing so, the REMCO will take into account, in relation to each element, progress over the performance period relative to nearer-term aims in pursuit of the long-term ambition announced by Shell to reduce the NCF of energy products sold, in step with society's drive to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The starting point for determining the vesting outcome will be seeing how many of the targets have been met for each of the four areas. One out of four will equal 40%, two will equal 100%, three will equal 150%, and 200% will be achieved for scoring four out of four./uni00A0It/uni00A0is important to note that performance against these elements will serve/uni00A0simply as a starting point for the REMCO, which will also take into account/uni00A0any other considerations it deems appropriate, including (without limitation) the relative importance of these elements in meeting the long-term ambition announced by Shell. For example, the REMCO may decide to allocate a greater importance to overall performance in relation to the NCF/uni00A0than the other three elements. The REMCO believes this approach is/uni00A0appropriate, given the uncertainties around the speed and/uni00A0direction of/uni00A0progress in the energy transition. The application of any discretion will/uni00A0be/uni00A0fully disclosed and explained by the REMCO.\n\nAccelerate the transition to net-zero emissions",

        "page_content": "## FCF\n\nThe FCF performance condition supports the delivery of our cash flow priorities, which are to service and reduce debt, pay dividends, buy back/uni00A0shares and/uni00A0make future capital investments.\n\nThe target for FCF, along with the ranges for threshold and outstanding performance, will be set by reference to Shell's annual operating plans, being the aggregate of our plan FCF targets over the three-year performance period. Given that FCF is heavily influenced by the volatility of oil and gas prices, the annual operating plans are updated each year to set an annual target to reflect a changing oil price premise. As a result, FCF targets are set annually for each annual operating plan and will only be disclosed in aggregate retrospectively after the three-year period. While consideration has been given to setting a three-year target at the outset, the REMCO has determined that such an approach would require adjustments for the oil and gas price premise and other matters at the end of/uni00A0the period, given the unpredictability and volatility in oil and gas prices. The REMCO has a long-standing 'no adjustments' policy and therefore believes a more appropriate target-setting approach is to set the target based on the aggregation of the annual operating plans.\n\nThe amounts payable under this measure will range from 20% of the/uni00A0available maximum, for threshold performance, to full vesting for outstanding performance. A straight-line vesting schedule will apply for/uni00A0performance between threshold and outstanding.\n\n## Relative measures\n\nThe relative measures are based on our performance on a number of key/uni00A0financial metrics against the other oil majors.\n\nFor relative measures, we measure and rank growth based on the data points at the end of the performance period compared with those at the beginning of the period, using publicly reported data.\n\n- \u25a0 ROACE growth. For this purpose, in order to facilitate the comparison, the calculation of ROACE differs from that described in 'Performance indicators' on page 43 because there is no adjustment for after-tax interest expense; and\n- \u25a0 TSR, calculated in US dollars using a 90-day averaging period around the/uni00A0start and end of the performance period;\n- \u25a0 growth in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nEach relative measure can vest independently with the amounts payable ranging from 0% to 200%, in accordance with the following vesting schedule:\n\n- \u25a0 ranking second equals 150% vesting for the element of the LTIP weighted to that metric;\n- \u25a0 ranking first equals 200% vesting for the element of the LTIP weighted to that metric;\n- \u25a0 ranking third equals 80% vesting for the element of the LTIP weighted to/uni00A0that metric; and\n- \u25a0 ranking fourth or fifth equals 0% vesting for the element weighted to/uni00A0that metric.\n\n## TSR Underpin\n\nIf the TSR ranking is fourth or fifth, the level of the award that can vest on the basis of the other measures will be capped at 50% of the maximum.\n\n## Performance update on energy transition metric Lagging indicator - NCF\n\nPerformance measurement is subject to third-party limited assurance. For/uni00A0the year ended December 31, 2020, NCF had reduced to 75 grams of/uni00A0CO2 equivalent per megajoule, a 5% reduction against the baseline.\n\n## Leading indicators - power, advanced biofuels and systems to/uni00A0capture and absorb carbon\n\nThese targets are commercially sensitive, so they will not be disclosed until the end of the performance period (or until they are no longer considered\n\nto be commercially sensitive). The REMCO, though, is committed to sharing progress. To date we are seeing positive progress across a range/uni00A0of indicators of future NCF reduction. Specific examples include:\n\n- \u25a0 progress on the development of systems to capture and absorb carbon, for example the Northern Lights CCS joint venture with our partners, and nature-based solutions projects such as the acquisition of Select Carbon and Climate Bridge.\n- \u25a0 developments towards growing a material power business, such as the/uni00A0acquisition of ERM Ltd in Australia and investment in renewable energy projects such as CrossWind; and\n\nWhile many of these initiatives will take time to scale, they represent important steps towards building the organisational capacity and/uni00A0commercial value chains that will lead to future large-scale carbon/uni00A0reductions.\n\n## FCF\n\nAt December 31, 2020, FCF performance is below target, with belowthreshold outcomes for 2019 of $26.4 billion (target $35 billion) and for 2020 of $20.8 billion (target $38 billion). As one year of FCF performance remains, and 77.5% of the award is subject to relative and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect/uni00A0the/uni00A0potential vesting of the award.\n\n## 2019 LTIP award\n\n## 2020 LTIP award\n\nAt December 31, 2020, FCF performance, $20.8 billion for 2020, is below threshold (target $38 billion). As two years of FCF performance remain, and 77.5% of the award is subject to relative and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect the potential vesting of/uni00A0the/uni00A0award.\n\n## Statement of Directors' shareholding and share interests/uni00A0(audited) Shareholding guidelines\n\nThe REMCO believes that Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company). The CEO is expected to build a shareholding with a value of 700% of base salary, and the CFO 500%. The shareholding requirement extends post-employment, such that Executive Directors will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement, or the number of shares actually held if this is less than the shareholding requirement, for a period/uni00A0of two years post-employment. There is a Company-sponsored nominee account which allows for restrictions to be applied on the sale or transfer of shares that are subject to holding periods and individual shareholding requirements. The restrictions remain in force beyond the Executive Director's employment.\n\nOnly unfettered shares count. Shares delivered that are subject to holding requirements also count towards the guidelines. The values of shares counting towards the shareholding guideline (as a percentage of base salary) for the CEO and CFO were 919% and 526%, respectively, at March 5, 2021. Non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their fixed annual fee and to maintain that holding during their tenure.\n\n## Executive Directors' shareholding (audited)\n\n|                 | Shareholding guideline  (% of base salary)   | Value of shares  counting towards  guideline (% of base  salary at December  31, 2020) [A]   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ben van Beurden | 700%                                         | 637%                                                                                         |\n| Jessica Uhl     | 500%                                         | 333%                                                                                         |",

Under option A, a comparable single total figure for all UK employees has been calculated in order to identify the employees whose pay and benefits are at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for comparison with the CEO. Employee pay has been calculated based on/uni00A0the total pay and benefits paid in respect of 2020 for all employees who were employed on December 31, 2020. For part-time workers and/uni00A0joiners in the year, pay and benefits have been annualised based on/uni00A0the/uni00A0proportion of their working time in the UK during the year. This is/uni00A0calculated with an approach consistent with the methodology for determining annual bonuses. The REMCO believes that this provides a/uni00A0fair/uni00A0and reasonable calculation of the pay ratios for Shell employees/uni00A0in/uni00A0the UK.\n\nThe ratio of the CEO's pay to the median UK worker is 57. The global pay/uni00A0ratio, calculated by comparing the CEO single figure to the average employee headcount cost, is 50.The ratio has changed for 2020 compared with 2019, mainly because of the/uni00A0decrease in the single figure of remuneration for the CEO as a result of no 2020 annual bonus and the lower LTIP vesting outcome in comparison with 2019. The pay and benefits for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile employees have also reduced in relation to 2019, primarily because there was no annual bonus for the majority of employees. The REMCO believes this outcome/uni00A0is/uni00A0appropriate and consistent with Shell's philosophy of pay/uni00A0for/uni00A0performance.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\n- \u25a0 Aspects of Shell's response to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected employees' pay and benefits. These included the decisions not to increase salaries for 2021 and to set the annual bonus scorecard outcome at zero, as well as policies that supported the health, safety/uni00A0and well-being of employees.\n\nThe REMCO took a wide perspective in making the remuneration decisions for 2020 and determining the 2020 policy. As examples, in/uni00A02020 the REMCO reviewed the following:\n\n- \u25a0 The provision of retirement benefits to employees across Shell.\n- \u25a0 Remuneration markers such as the CEO pay ratio and gender pay reporting under the UK Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations and voluntary ethnicity pay reporting in the UK. The REMCO noted Shell's average UK gender pay gap had narrowed in 2020 to 18.0% (from 18.7% in 2019), continuing the positive trend since 2017 (22.2%). This is due to a continued upward trend in the proportion of women in Shell's upper and upper middle pay quartiles, and the REMCO has confidence in the policies Shell has/uni00A0to increase the representation of women at all levels in the organisation. The REMCO also noted, that in the first year of reporting,/uni00A0the average UK ethnicity pay gap was 8.5%.\n\nExecutive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with the broader Shell pay policy:\n\n- \u25a0 Executive Directors and Executive Committee members participate in the LTIP. Around 150 Senior Executives participate in the same plan. The measures and metrics for that plan also apply to/uni00A050% of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) awarded to around 16,500 employees.\n- \u25a0 In recent years the Group scorecard architecture has been identical to/uni00A0the Executive Committee and Senior Executive scorecard in terms of/uni00A0measures, weightings and targets.\n- \u25a0 All employees in the Group participate in the relevant pension plan for/uni00A0their country based on their date of joining. Shell does not operate/uni00A0separate executive pension arrangements.\n\nThis consistency means that less explanation of executive remuneration structures is required than in companies where alignment is not the default practice. To support an ongoing dialogue with employees regarding how pay connects to Company strategy, a video was shared with employees, presented by the REMCO Chair, explaining the key features of the new 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy in March 2020, alongside an article on the Shell intranet sharing why it matters for employees.\n\nce",

        "page_content": "## ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION/uni00A0\n\n## STATEMENT OF 2021 PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION OF/uni00A0POLICY\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Policy as detailed on pages 173-181 took effect/uni00A0from May 19, 2020, after it was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM. It will be effective until the 2023 AGM, unless a further policy is proposed by Shell and approved by shareholders before then. This section describes elements of the policy that will apply/uni00A0for/uni00A02021.\n\n## Executive Directors Salaries\n\nThere will be no salary increases for 2021. Salaries will be maintained at/uni00A02020 levels, which are \u20ac1,588,000 for Ben van Beurden and \u20ac1,035,000 for Jessica Uhl. This is consistent with the approach taken/uni00A0for/uni00A0the majority of employees for 2021.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nTo ensure that the scorecard remains well aligned with our strategic and operational priorities, the REMCO has reviewed the structure of the 2021 scorecard. The REMCO has decided to focus on four key areas: financial delivery, operational excellence, progress in the energy transition, and/uni00A0safety.\n\nCash flow from operations (CFFO) remains the metric we will use to measure financial delivery. This reflects our ability to generate the cash necessary to fund investment in our future business and distributions to our/uni00A0shareholders. We are increasing the weighting of this metric from 30%/uni00A0to 35%.\n\nProduction and LNG Liquefaction volumes have been retired as performance metrics. Reflecting the ongoing importance of operational delivery, performance will be assessed against two measures:\n\n- \u25a0 Project delivery excellence: our ability to successfully execute large and complex projects remains essential, and we will continue measuring how well we deliver our material projects on time and to budget.\n- \u25a0 Asset management excellence: measured against availability for Upstream, midstream and downstream, each equally weighted, in order to maintain a strong ongoing focus on operating our assets to plan, delivering scheduled downtime activities on time and minimising unscheduled shutdowns; and\n\nWe are separating out energy transition to provide a clear and visible focus on the importance of making progress in this area. Measures will initially focus on the operational delivery of our ambitions, and we expect this section of the scorecard to evolve and expand as we accelerate the transition of our business to a net-zero emissions business by 2050, in step/uni00A0with society. For 2021, performance will be assessed against:\n\n- \u25a0 GHG emissions intensity: no change to this measure, which sets emission-intensity targets for our main lines of business.\n- \u25a0 GHG abatement: a new metric that measures execution of GHG abatement projects and sets us on a trajectory towards achieving net-zero operational emissions; and\n\nOur commitment to safety remains at the heart of everything we do. We/uni00A0are increasing the weighting on safety in the scorecard to 15%. The/uni00A0measures relating to safety will be as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Process safety: no change to the number of Tier 1 and 2 operational safety incidents as our measure of process safety.\n- \u25a0 Personal safety: a new Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) metric will replace Total Recordable Case Frequency as our measure of/uni00A0personal safety performance. This is to ensure we focus our attention and learning on those incidents with the potential to cause the most serious harm; and\n\nThe performance measures, weightings and link to strategy for the 2021 performance year are set out below:\n\n## 2021 annual bonus scorecard measures and weightings\n\n| Performance measure                                                                 | Weighting

Scorecard targets will be disclosed in the subsequent Directors' Remuneration Report/uni00A0when they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive.\n\n## Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nOn March 5, 2021, a conditional award of performance shares under the LTIP was made to the Executive Directors resulting in 231,679 Royal Dutch Shell plc A shares (A shares) being conditionally awarded to Ben van Beurden and 69,972 Royal Dutch Shell plc A American Depositary Shares (A ADSs) being conditionally awarded to Jessica Uhl. The award had a face value of 264.5% (maximum performance outcome 529%) of the base salary for the CEO and 248.5% (maximum performance outcome 497%) of the base salary for the/uni00A0CFO, excluding potential share price appreciation and dividends.\n\nIn making these awards, the REMCO considered the Company's share price and determined to use the closing share price on the award. But to moderate the impact of any potential windfall gains arising from share price volatility in 2020, the 2021 awards have been reduced 11.8% for the CEO and 8.0% for the CFO from the usual target award levels. This is equivalent to a 50% of the share price reduction since the previous award. Further discussion on the REMCO's approach to managing windfall gains is set out on page 155.\n\nFor LTIP awards made in 2021, performance will be assessed over a three-year period based on four financial measures and an energy transition condition. The weighting of the energy transition condition has been increased to 20%, reflecting the increasing importance of delivering on the strategic business transformations required to succeed in the energy transition.",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY\n\n## The Directors' Remuneration Policy sets out:\n\n- \u25a0 A summary of proposed changes to the Directors' Remuneration/uni00A0Policy, page 173;\n\n/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 174; and\n- \u25a0 Non-executive Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 180.\n\nThis section describes the Directors' Remuneration Policy (Policy) which, following shareholder approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM), came into effect from May 19, 2020, and will be effective until the 2023 AGM, unless a further policy is proposed by Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company) and approved by shareholders in the meantime.\n\nThe principles underpinning the REMCO's approach to executive remuneration are the foundation for everything we do, and are:\n\n- \u25a0 Pay for performance: the majority of the Executive Directors' compensation, (excluding benefits and pensions), should be linked directly to Shell's performance through variable pay instruments;\n- \u25a0 Alignment with Shell's strategy: the Executive Directors' compensation package should be strongly linked to the achievement of stretching targets that are seen as indicators of the execution of Shell's strategy;\n- \u25a0 Competitiveness: remuneration levels should be determined by reference internally against Shell's Senior Management and externally against companies of comparable size, complexity and global scope;\n- \u25a0 Consistency: the remuneration structure for Executive Directors should generally be consistent with the remuneration structure for Shell's Senior Management. This consistency builds a culture of alignment with Shell's purpose and a common approach to sharing in Shell's success;\n- \u25a0 Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in/uni00A0Shell;\n- \u25a0 Compliance: decisions should be made in the context of the Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct. The REMCO also\n\nRemuneration\n\n- seeks to ensure compliance with applicable laws and corporate governance requirements when designing and implementing policies and plans; and\n- \u25a0 Risk assessment: the remuneration structures and rewards should meet risk-assessment tests to ensure that shareholder's interests are safeguarded and that inappropriate actions are avoided.\n\nThe Executive Directors' remuneration structure is made up of a fixed element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus (50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Variable pay outcomes are conditional on the successful execution of the operating plan in the short term and the delivery of strategic goals and financial outperformance over the longer term. The award of shares under the bonus and LTIP, along with significant shareholding requirements, are intended to ensure executives have a sizeable shareholding in Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company) and experience the same outcomes as shareholders.\n\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the REMCO reviewed the Remuneration Policy to ensure that the Policy continues to be aligned with Shell's strategy, including delivery of shareholder returns. REMCO determined that while the current policy remains appropriate in many respects, certain changes will support the REMCO to simplify remuneration structures and address the management of quantum. For each area of the policy, the REMCO has considered market practice, the corporate governance environment and feedback from shareholders. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) has provided input to the development of the sustainable development and energy transition metrics.

The Executive Director will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement (or  existing shareholding if lower) for a period of two years from the date they cease to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Shareholding (% of base salary):                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY/uni00A0 continued\n\n## Notes to the Executive Directors' remuneration policy/uni00A0table\n\nThe benchmarking comparator group consists of the other oil majors (BP,/uni00A0Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Total) and a selection of major Europebased companies.\n\n## Comparator group\n\nThe comparator companies are reviewed by the REMCO as part of the Remuneration Policy review every three years. The last review took place in 2019 in preparation for the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy vote. No changes to the comparator group are proposed.\n\nThe other oil majors are included in the comparator group as these represent our closest direct competitors operating in similar market conditions. The Europe-based companies are selected based on their size,/uni00A0complexity and global reach. The REMCO uses benchmark data from these companies only as a guide to the competitiveness of the remuneration packages. We do not seek to position our remuneration at/uni00A0any defined point against the benchmarked positions.\n\nThe REMCO retains the right to alter the comparator group as it sees fit in/uni00A0order to ensure it remains an appropriate and relevant benchmark.\n\n## 2020 European comparator group\n\n| Allianz      | Daimler         | Rio Tinto   |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| AstraZeneca  | Diageo          | Roche       |\n| BAT          | GlaxoSmithKline | Siemens     |\n| Bayer        | Nestle          | Unilever    |\n| BHP Billiton | Novartis        | Vodafone    |\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits for Executive Directors deemed taxable in the UK are included as/uni00A0taxable benefits in the single total figure of remuneration table. These elements may include transport to and from home and office, the provision of home security, and occasional business-required partner travel, which are generally considered legitimate business expenses rather than components of remuneration.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nFor the 2020 performance year, the scorecard framework will consist of cash flow from operating activities (30% weight), operational excellence (50% weight) and sustainable development (20% weight). Targets are derived from the annual business plan. These measures are designed to drive focus on the financial and operational performance critical to our success as a world-class investment case and to maintain a strong licence to operate, underpinned by our commitment to safety and journey to thrive in the energy transition. The REMCO believes it is important for annual variable pay to remain balanced, with operational and environmental components, complementing the LTIP's focus on longer-term financial and/uni00A0strategic outcomes. The same annual bonus scorecard applies to the majority of group employees, supporting consistency of/uni00A0remuneration and/uni00A0alignment of objective across employees and senior/uni00A0management.\n\nFor future years, the specific measures and weightings for the annual bonus scorecard will be reviewed annually by the REMCO and adjusted accordingly to evolve with Shell's strategy and circumstances. The annual review will also consider the scorecard target and outcome history over a/uni00A0decade to ensure that the targets set remain stretching but realistic.\n\nThe REMCO retains the right to exercise its judgement to adjust the mathematical bonus scorecard outcome to ensure that the bonus scorecard outcome for Executive Directors reflects other aspects of Shell's performance which the REMCO deems appropriate for the reported year.\n\n## Annual bonus - time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nThe LTIP rewards longer-term performance linked to Shell's strategy, which includes cash generation, capital discipline, value created for shareholders as well as progress towards meeting our ambition to thrive in the energy transition.\n\nFor 2020, the absolute measures will be FCF and energy transition, and relative growth compared with our peers will be based on: TSR, ROACE and CFFO. The relative measures, which focus on outperforming our closest competitors on key financial metrics, are supported by the absolute FCF metric which provides cash to service and repay debt, make shareholder distributions and fund capital investment. These are aligned with our strategic ambition to be a world-class investment case, and are supported by an energy transition measure focused on thriving in the energy transition and delivering our NCF target.\n\nFor the relative measures, 200% vests for first position, 150% for second, 80% for third and 0% for ranking fourth or fifth. The comparator group consists of four of the strongest companies in our industry (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total). Outperforming Shell's closest competitors on key financial metrics is challenging. A vesting outcome of 80% for median performance (40% of maximum) in a small comparator group is considered appropriate by the REMCO. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median performance is generally set at a limit of 25% of maximum for other UK companies. However, these are typically applied against a larger comparator group.\n\nThe REMCO will regularly review the measures, weightings and comparator group, and retains the right to adjust these to ensure that the/uni00A0LTIP continues to serve its intended purpose with a stretching level of/uni00A0challenge. If the REMCO was to propose any material changes to the/uni00A0LTIP/uni00A0performance metrics, it would consult with major shareholders.\n\n## TSR underpin\n\nIf the TSR ranking is fourth or fifth, the level of the award that can vest on the basis of the other measures will be capped at 50% of the maximum payout for the LTIP.\n\nThe detailed weightings and metrics applicable to the 2020 bonus scorecard are set out on page 160.\n\nThe detailed weightings and metrics applicable to the 2020 grant are set out on page 164.",

        "page_content": "## Performance Period\n\nLTIP performance is assessed over a three-year period. Vested shares from the LTIP are subject to a further three-year holding period post-vesting. This holding period commences on the date of vesting and remains in force beyond an Executive Director's tenure. This time horizon is deemed to be suitable for incentive purposes but is recognised as short relative to some of Shell's operations. However, the REMCO believes that it provides for broad alignment with shareholder interests when coupled with significant shareholding requirements.\n\n## LTIP time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discretion, malus and clawback\n\nVariable pay awards may be made subject to adjustment events. At the discretion of REMCO, such an award may be adjusted before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if an adjustment event occurs.\n\nAdjustment events will be specified in award documentation and it is intended that they will, for example, relate to restatement of financial statements due to material non-compliance with a financial reporting requirement; misconduct by an Executive Director or misconduct through their direction or non-direction; any material breach of health and safety or environment regulations; serious reputational damage to Shell; material failure of risk management; corporate failure; or other exceptional events as determined at the discretion of the REMCO. The REMCO retains the right to alter the list of adjustment events in respect of future awards.\n\nIn addition, the REMCO retains the discretion to adjust mathematical outcomes if and to the extent that it considers this appropriate. This power to adjust the outcomes is broad and includes adjusting the outcomes to zero. For example, an adjustment might be made if the REMCO considers:\n\n- \u25a0 The LTIP vesting percentage is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at award; and\n- \u25a0 The mathematical outcomes do not reflect the wider financial or non-financial performance of RDS or the participant over the performance period;\n- \u25a0 There is any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate.\n\nIt is not anticipated that discretion would be used for upwards adjustment. If, in exceptional circumstances, it was considered, this would be done only after consultation with major shareholders.\n\nPerformance outcomes and/or share price appreciation make it difficult to predict the final amounts delivered under the LTIP at the time of award. In years where the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration\n\ninappropriate for any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to the annual bonus outcome or the LTIP vesting outcome for/uni00A0the purposes of managing remuneration quantum. In making any adjustment to the annual bonus or LTIP vesting outcome for this purpose REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, as well as the/uni00A0internal context for other employees.\n\nAn explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the/uni00A0relevant Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Treatment of outstanding awards\n\nAwards granted prior to the approval and implementation of this Policy and/or prior to an individual becoming an Executive Director will continue to vest and be delivered in accordance with the terms of the original award even if this is not consistent with the terms of this Policy.\n\nAs at March 10, 2020, this applies to Executive Directors Ben van Beurden and Jessica Uhl who each have outstanding awards under the LTIP.\n\n## Shareholding\n\nThe REMCO believes significant shareholding by Executive Directors is an/uni00A0important way of ensuring that shareholders and Executive Directors share the same priorities. Shareholding is one of Shell's core remuneration principles as it creates a balanced connection between individual wealth and Shell's long-term performance. This will support effective governance and an ownership mindset. Significant shareholding requirements reflect the performance timescales of Shell and are aligned with absolute shareholder return.\n\nThe CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of seven times their base salary over five years from appointment. The CFO is expected to build up a shareholding of five times their base salary over the same period. In the event of an increase to the guideline multiple of salary, for every additional multiple of salary required, the director will have one extra year to reach the increased guideline, subject to a maximum of five years from the date of the change.\n\nExecutive Directors will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement (or their existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for/uni00A0a/uni00A0period of two years post-employment.\n\nThe holding periods for LTIP vested shares and shares delivered as part of/uni00A0the annual bonus continue to apply after Executive Directors leave employment.\n\n## Differences for Executive Directors from other employees\n\nThe remuneration structure and approach to setting remuneration levels is consistent across Shell, with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities. However, a higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for Executive Directors and members of Senior Management.\n\nThe salary for each Executive Director is determined based on the indicators in the 'Executive Directors' remuneration policy table', which reflect the international nature of the Executive Directors' labour market. The salary for other employees is normally set on a country basis.",

The provisions which are not generally available for other employees are described in 'Benefits'.\n\nThe methodology used for determining the annual bonus for Executive Directors is broadly consistent with the approach for Shell employees generally. However, bonuses for the majority of Shell employees are determined taking into account individual and business performance, whereas bonuses for Executive Directors are based solely on business performance. Although the makeup and weightings scorecard used for the majority of Shell employees is currently aligned with the scorecard, these scorecards may differ if required to support the achievement of business objectives. All Executive Directors and Executive Committee members receive 50% of their annual bonus in shares, which are subject/uni00A0to/uni00A0a three-year holding period.\n\nExecutive Directors are not eligible to receive new awards under employee share plans other than the LTIP, although awards previously granted will continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the original award. Selected employees participate in the Performance Share Plan (PSP). The operation of the PSP is similar to the LTIP, but currently differs, for/uni00A0example, in some performance measures and their relative weightings. As at March 2020, around 51,000 employees participate in one or more of Shell's global share plans and/or incentive plans, further supporting alignment with shareholder interests.\n\nExecutive Directors' retirement benefits are maintained in line with those of/uni00A0the wider workforce in their base country.\n\n## Illustration of potential remuneration outcomes\n\nThe charts on this page represent estimates under four performance scenarios ('Minimum', 'On-target', 'Maximum' and 'Maximum, assuming a 50% share price appreciation between award and vest') of the potential remuneration outcomes for each Executive Director resulting from the application of 2020 base salaries to awards made in accordance with the proposed Policy. The majority of Executive Directors' remuneration is delivered through variable pay elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching targets.\n\nThe REMCO will review the formulaic Single Figure outcome relative to the quality of performance outcomes and adjust these, taking into account Shell's performance, shareholder experience, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant factors, to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only achieved in years with the highest quality performance.\n\nThe scenario charts are based on future Policy award levels and are combined with projected single total figures of remuneration. The pay scenarios are forward-looking and only serve to illustrate the future Policy. For simplicity, the minimum, on-target and maximum scenarios assume no share price movement and exclude dividend accrual, for the portion of the bonus paid in shares and the LTIP, although dividend accrual during the performance and holding period applies. The scenarios are based on the current CEO (Ben van Beurden) and CFO (Jessica Uhl) roles.\n\n## Performance scenarios\n\n|                         | Minimum   | Target   | Maximum[A]   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| Base salary (2020)      |           |          |              |\n| Benefits (2019 actual)  |           |          |              |\n| Pension (2020 estimate) |           |          |              |\n| Bonus                   | NIL       | 125% CEO | 250% CEO     |\n| Bonus                   |           | 120% CFO | 240% CFO     |\n| LTIP                    | NIL       | 300% CEO | 600% CEO     |\n| LTIP                    |           | 270% CFO | 540% CFO     |\n\n[A] Maximum assuming 50% share price appreciation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recruitment\n\nThe REMCO determines the remuneration package for new Executive Director appointments. These appointments may involve external or/uni00A0internal recruitment or reflect a change in role of a current Executive/uni00A0Director.\n\nWhen determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to:\n\n- \u25a0 take into account the individual's current remuneration package and/uni00A0other contractual entitlements;\n- \u25a0 attract and motivate candidates of the right quality;\n- \u25a0 seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, without overpaying;\n- \u25a0 honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal candidates before their promotion to the Board. The REMCO will follow the approach set out in the table below when determining the/uni00A0remuneration package for a new Executive Director.\n- \u25a0 encourage relocation if required; and",

Executive Directors with the Netherlands as their base country will be employed on the basis of a contract of employment governed by Dutch employment law. For Executive Directors with a base country other than the Netherlands, REMCO will determine their employment arrangements based on a number of considerations, including Dutch immigration requirements and base country retirement benefits. Executive Directors' employment arrangements are available for inspection at the AGM or on/uni00A0request. For further details on appointment and re-appointment of Directors, see the 'Governance Framework' on page 128 and 'Other/uni00A0Regulatory and Statutory Information' on page 189.\n\n## End of employment Notice period\n\nEmployment arrangements of Executive Directors can generally end by either the employee or the employer providing one month's notice, or the applicable statutory notice period. For example, under Dutch law, the statutory notice period for the employer will vary in line with the length of service, with the maximum being four months' notice. Under Dutch law, termination payments are not linked to the contract's notice period.\n\n## The Netherlands statutory end-of-employment compensation\n\nWith effect from July 1, 2015, employment legislation in the Netherlands introduced statutory end-of-employment compensation. Under this legislation, every termination (other than following retirement or for cause) of a Dutch employment contract that has continued for a minimum of two/uni00A0years will give rise to an obligation to pay the departing employee transition compensation ('transitievergoeding'). The statutory compensation is capped at one times the annual salary, which is deemed to include variable pay such as the annual bonus. Executive Directors are expected not to claim transition compensation or any other applicable statutory compensation over and above the agreed compensation for loss/uni00A0of office as set out in the 'End of employment' table on page 180.\n\n## Outstanding entitlements\n\nIn cases of resignation or dismissal for cause, fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits, and employer pension contributions) will cease on the last/uni00A0day of employment, variable remuneration elements will generally lapse and the Executive Director is not eligible for compensation for loss/uni00A0of/uni00A0office.\n\nThe information, on page 180, generally applies to termination of employment by Shell giving notice, by mutual agreement, or in situations where the employment terminates because of retirement with Shell consent at a date other than the normal retirement date, redundancy or/uni00A0in/uni00A0other similar circumstances at the REMCO's discretion.",

        "page_content": "## Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nNEDs, including the Chair, have letters of appointment. NEDs' letters of appointment are available for inspection at the AGM or on request. For further details on appointment and re-appointment of Directors, see the 'Governance Framework' on page 128 and 'Other Regulatory and Statutory Information' on page 189.\n\n## Non-executive Director recruitment\n\nThe REMCO's approach to setting the remuneration package for NEDs is to offer fee levels and specific benefits (where appropriate) in line with the 'Non-executive Directors' remuneration policy table' and subject to the Articles of Association. NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or retention awards.\n\nWhen determining the benefits for a new Chair, the individual circumstances of the future Chair will be taken into account.\n\n## Non-executive Director termination of office\n\nNo payments for loss of office will be made to NEDs.\n\n## Consideration of overall pay and employment conditions\n\nWhen setting the Policy, no specific employee groups were consulted. However, Shell seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement performance as required.\n\nWhen determining Executive Directors' remuneration structure and outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect of remuneration and average salary increases applying in the Netherlands, UK and the USA). During the Policy review, pay and employment conditions of the wider Shell employee population were taken into account by adhering to the same performance, rewards and benefits philosophy for the Executive Directors, as well as overall benchmarking principles. Furthermore, any potential differences from other employees (see 'Differences for Executive Directors from other employees') were taken into account when providing the REMCO with advice in the formation of this Policy.\n\nDialogue between management and employees is important, with the/uni00A0annual Shell People Survey being one of the principal means of gathering employee views on a range of matters. The Shell People Survey includes questions inviting employees' views on their pay and benefit arrangements. Shell also encourages share ownership among employees, and many are shareholders who are able to participate in the vote on the/uni00A0Policy at the AGM.\n\nThe REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources &/uni00A0Corporate Officer and the Executive Vice President Remuneration and HR Operations on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration matters affecting other senior executives, extending to multiple levels below the Board and Executive Committee.\n\n## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe REMCO engages with major shareholders on a regular basis throughout the year and this allows it to hear views on Shell's remuneration approach and test proposals when developing or evolving the Policy. Recent examples of the REMCO responding to shareholder views include: considering the quantum of executive pay and the use of/uni00A0alternative reward structures; introducing the Energy Transition metric to/uni00A0the LTIP in line with our strategic ambitions; removing the individual performance modifier from the calculation of annual bonus outcomes to/uni00A0make remuneration structures simpler and more transparent to shareholders; reducing the CEO's target bonus from 150% to 125%; reducing the CEO's LTIP grant; and enabling the broader use of discretion/uni00A0to manage remuneration outcomes.\n\nThe REMCO will review the Policy regularly to ensure it continues to reinforce Shell's long-term strategy and remains closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\n## Additional policy statement\n\nThe REMCO reserves the right to make payments outside the Policy in/uni00A0limited exceptional circumstances, such as for regulatory, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation or/uni00A0exchange controls, and only where the REMCO considers such payments are necessary to give effect to the intent of the Policy.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board\n\n/s/ Linda M.

        "page_content": "## MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT\n\nWe prioritise buying from and encouraging local providers by procuring goods and services from local suppliers who meet the standards we require. The standards include those relating to human rights, labour practices and business integrity and are governed by the Shell Supplier Principles. Monitoring is undertaken centrally in connection with the preparation of the Shell Group's Modern Slavery Act (MSA) Statement which is prepared by taking proposed inputs from Shell companies in scope of the MSA as to their steps taken to ensure modern slavery does not occur in their supply chain or organisation. The Shell Group Statement is approved by the Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc, after approval by the boards of Shell companies which are in scope of the MSA.\n\n## DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS\n\nIn accordance with section 418 of the Act, each of the persons who is a/uni00A0Director at the date of approval of this Report confirms that, so far as the/uni00A0Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware. The Director has taken all steps that he or/uni00A0she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself/uni00A0aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the/uni00A0Company's auditor is aware of that information.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND POLICY\n\nThe 'Consolidated Statement of Income' and 'Consolidated Balance Sheet' can be found on pages 217 and 218 respectively.\n\nSubject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per share by/uni00A0around 4% every year, and once the Shell Group's net debt level has reached $65 billion, Shell will target the distribution of 20-30% of its cash/uni00A0flow from operations to shareholders. The Board may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share/uni00A0buybacks. When setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the/uni00A0Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro-environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of the Shell Group, the current balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans, and existing commitments.\n\nInterim dividends are currently declared by the Board and paid on a quarterly basis. Shell does not currently pay a 'final' dividend, which would need to be voted on by shareholders, requiring the introduction of a resolution at the AGM. This would delay the payment of the fourth quarter dividend (currently paid in late March) until after the AGM, which is towards the end of May, a delay of around seven weeks. Our approach to dividend payments is not uncommon for companies distributing returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis.\n\nShell pays its dividend in USD, EUR or GBP fully electronically either in CREST or via interbank transfers.\n\nThe Directors have announced a fourth quarter interim dividend as set out in the table below, payable on March 29, 2021, to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on February 19, 2021. The closing date for dividend currency elections was March 5, 2021 [A] and the euro and sterling equivalents announcement date is March 15, 2021.\n\n## VIABILITY STATEMENT\n\nThe 'Strategic Report' includes information about Shell's strategy, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, as well as the factors, including the principal risks, likely to affect Shell's future development. It also describes Shell's business model, including competitive advantages and key strengths. The Directors assess Shell's prospects both at an operating and strategic level, each involving different time horizons. To this/uni00A0end, the Directors assess Shell's portfolio and strategy against a wide range of outlooks, including assessing the potential impacts of various possible energy transition pathways and scenarios for changes in societal expectations in relation to climate change. Shell recognises in its strategy that the world is transitioning to a lower-carbon energy system (see 'Climate change and energy transition'). The Risk Factors section provides an overview of the principal risks Shell is exposed to in its operations.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Directors approve a detailed three-year operating plan, which forecasts Shell's cash flows and ability to service financing requirements, pay dividends and fund investing activities during the period. Shell's three-year operating plan contains assumptions in relation to internal and external parameters, including recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the key assumptions include the impact of commodity prices, exchange rates, future carbon costs, agreements like LNG contract renewals, production levels and product demand, and schedules of growth programmes. Considering the degree of change possible in these parameters, Shell has deemed a three-year period of assessment appropriate for the longer-term viability statement.\n\nIn making the going concern and longer term viability assessment, Shell has also considered the financial impact of each of the following severe but possible scenarios that could threaten Shell's viability. In reviewing these stress tests, the Directors have considered possible mitigation steps and have made certain assumptions regarding the availability of future funding options, including credit lines, debt facilities, possible asset disposals, changing levels of shareholder returns, and the ability to raise future financing in line with the operating plan window.\n\nScenario\n\nLink to principal risks\n\n| A significant HSSE event                                                                                                                                                                         | [A]              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Unplanned shutdown of a major cash-generating  asset for a year                                                                                                                                  | [A]              |\n| A low oil and gas price environment  (Brent at 2021: $40, 2022: $40, 2023: $45 MOD)                                                                                                              | [B] and [D]      |\n| A significant HSSE event in a low oil and gas price  environment                                                                                                                                 | [A], [B] and [D] |\n| Sustained impact from politically adverse developments,  lower growth in developing countries, as well as lower  growth in Europe                                                                | [C]              |\n| Global macroeconomic uncertainties (including those from  a pandemic) - low oil and gas price environment, negative  impact on oil product and chemical margins, and long-term  demand reduction | [B], [C] and [D] |\n\nce",

We are exposed to macroeconomic risks including fluctuating prices of/uni00A0crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals.\n- A.  The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which/uni00A0we work, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks.\n- C.  We are exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and credit/uni00A0risk. We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment/uni00A0and by financial and commodity market conditions.\n- D.  We seek to execute divestments in pursuing our strategy. We may be/uni00A0unable to divest these assets successfully in line with our strategy.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the events that have occurred in 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic and significant fall in oil and gas prices during the first half of the year, the Board have received regular updates in/uni00A0relation to the financial framework. The short-term cash preservation measures, including opex and capex reduction, not to continue with the next tranche of the share buyback programme, lower dividend payments, and debt issuance, and the medium-term measures including the reshape of Shell's portfolio and organisation demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative actions being taken to support the viability of the Company.\n\nTaking account of Shell's position and principal risks at December 31, 2020, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Shell will be able/uni00A0to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over/uni00A0its/uni00A0three-year operating plan period.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption over the period to 31 March 2022 (the 'going concern period'), management have stress tested Shell's most recent financial projections to incorporate a/uni00A0range of potential future outcomes by considering Shell's principal risks, further potential downside pressures on commodity prices and cash preservation measures, including reduced future operating costs, capital expenditure and dividend distributions. This assessment confirmed that Shell has adequate cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due in order to continue its operations during the going concern period. Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement below forms part of the Strategic Report on pages 4-111.\n\n## Non-Financial Information Statement\n\n| Reporting requirement                     | Where to read more in this report                              | Page     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Business Model                            | Shell story                                                    | 10       |\n| Non-financial KPIs                        | Performance indicators                                         | 43       |\n| Environmental matters                     | Environment and society, Climate  change and energy transition | 85, 94   |\n| Employees                                 | Our people and Directors' Report                               | 108, 124 |\n| Social matters                            | Environment and society                                        | 85       |\n| Respect for human rights                  | Environment and society                                        | 85       |\n| Anti-corruption and  anti-bribery matters | Our people                                                     | 108      |\n\n## REPURCHASES OF SHARES\n\nOn July 26, 2018, the Company announced the start of a share buyback programme of at least $25 billion, subject to further progress with debt reduction and oil price conditions. On March 23, 2020, the Company announced that in light of the economic and oil price environment, it had decided not to continue with the next tranche of the share buyback programme following the completion of the tranche announced on January 30, 2020. On April 14, 2020, the seventh tranche of the share buyback programme was completed, and no further tranches were undertaken in 2020. As announced on October 29, 2020, the Shell Group's cash allocation framework includes a target to reduce net debt to/uni00A0$65 billion and following that an aim to increase distributions to shareholders through a combination of Shell's progressive dividend and/uni00A0share buybacks.\n\nTo ensure that the Company had the necessary authority to continue to buy back its shares when the time is considered appropriate, at the 2020 AGM, shareholders granted an authority for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 783 million of its shares (excluding purchases for employee share plans). This authority expires on the earlier of the close of/uni00A0business on August 19, 2021, or the end of the 2021 AGM.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, 496 million A shares with a nominal value of \u20ac34.7 million ($41.8 million) and 39 million B shares with a nominal value of \u20ac2.8 million ($3.2 million) (6.85% of the Company's total issued share capital at December 31, 2020) had been cumulatively purchased and cancelled since the beginning of this programme, for a total cost of $15.8/uni00A0billion including expenses, at an average price of $29.45 per share. The purpose of the shares repurchased in 2020 under the share buyback programme was to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. This is to offset the number of shares issued under the Scrip Dividend Programme and to reduce the equity issued in connection with the Company's combination with BG Group. The Scrip Dividend Programme was cancelled with effect from the fourth quarter 2017 interim dividend. More information can be found at www.shell.com/scrip. Since the completion of the tranche announced on January 30, 2020, no further shares have been bought back by the Company. This means that 783 million shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM authority.\n\nThe Board continues to regard the ability to repurchase issued shares in/uni00A0suitable circumstances as an important part of Shell's financial management. A new resolution will be proposed at the 2021 AGM to renew the authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up/uni00A0to specified limits, for a further year. This proposal will be described in/uni00A0more detail in the 2021 Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe names of the Directors who held office during the year can be found/uni00A0on pages 144-121. Information on the Directors who are seeking appointment or reappointment is included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## QUALIFYING THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITIES\n\nThe Company has entered into a Deed of Indemnity (Deed) with each Director of the Company who served during the year. The terms of each of/uni00A0these Deeds are identical and they reflect the statutory provisions on indemnities contained in the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006). Under the terms of each Deed, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Director, to the widest extent permitted by the CA 2006, against any loss, liability or damage, howsoever caused (including in respect of a Director's own negligence), suffered or incurred by a Director in respect of their acts or omissions while or in the course of acting as a Director or employee of the Company, any associated company or affiliate (within the meaning of the CA 2006). In addition, the Company shall lend funds to Directors as required to meet reasonable costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by them in defending any criminal or civil proceedings brought",

The provisions in the Company's Articles relating to arbitration and exclusive jurisdiction are incorporated, mutatis mutandis, into the Deeds entered into by each Director and the Company.\n\nThe Company has provided both indemnities and Directors' and officers' insurance to the Directors in connection with the performance of their responsibilities. Copies of these indemnities and the Directors' and officers' insurance policies are open to inspection. A copy of the form of these indemnities has been previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange/uni00A0Commission.\n\n## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nSave as set out below and other than disclosures given in Notes 9 and 27 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 238 and 262-263, there were no transactions or proposed transactions that were material to either the Company or any related party. Nor were there any transactions with any related party that were unusual in their nature or conditions.\n\nOn February 27, 2020 the fully-consolidated Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. (SHLX) signed an agreement with its Shell-controlled general partner to eliminate all incentive distribution rights and economic general partner interest in SHLX and convert the general partner's two per cent general partner interest in SHLX into a non-economic general partner interest in SHLX. SHLX also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Shell affiliates to acquire our 79% interest in the Mattox Pipeline Company LLC, which owns the Mattox Pipeline, and certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex. Both transactions completed on April 1, 2020. As consideration for the assets and the elimination of incentive distribution rights, Shell received 160 million newly issued SHLX common units, plus $1.2 billion of Series A perpetual convertible preferred units at/uni00A0a/uni00A0price of $23.63 per unit.\n\n## POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nNo donations were made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to political parties or organisations during the year. Shell Oil Company administers the non-partisan Shell Oil Company Employees' Political Awareness Committee (SEPAC), a political action committee registered with the US Federal Election Commission. Eligible employees may make/uni00A0voluntary personal contributions to the SEPAC. All employees' contributions comply with federal and state law and are publicly reported/uni00A0in accordance with US election laws. Shell Oil Company does/uni00A0not exercise control over SEPAC's funding decisions.\n\n## RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND POST-BALANCE SHEET/uni00A0EVENTS\n\nSee Note 30 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 264.\n\n## SHARE CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's issued share capital at December 31, 2020, is set out in/uni00A0Note 8 to the 'Parent Company Financial Statements' on pages 289-290.

The shares held by the Dutch foundation are voted by its Board and the shares in the US Rabbi Trusts are voted by the Voting Trustee, Newport Trust Company. Both the Board of the Dutch foundation and the Voting Trustee are independent of Shell.\n\nThe UK Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan has a separate related share ownership trust. Shares held by the trust are voted by its trustee, Computershare Trustees Limited, as directed by the participants.\n\n## AUDITOR\n\nA resolution relating to the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor for/uni00A0the financial year 2021 will be proposed at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThe AGM will be held on May 19, 2021, at Carel van Bylandtlaan 16, 2596 HR, The Hague, The Netherlands. The Notice of Annual General Meeting will include details of the business to be put to shareholders at/uni00A0the/uni00A0AGM.\n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nIn accordance with the Act and the Company's Articles, the Board may authorise any matter that otherwise may involve any Directors breaching their duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The Board has adopted a procedure to address these requirements. Detailed conflict of interest questionnaires are reviewed by the Board and, if considered appropriate, authorised. Conflicts of interest as well as any gifts and hospitality received by and provided by Directors are kept under review by the Board. Further information relating to conflicts of interest can be found in/uni00A0the Articles, available on the Shell website.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS OF THE CHAIR\n\nThe Chair's other significant commitments are given in his biography on/uni00A0page 114.\n\n## SHELL GENERAL BUSINESS PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Shell General Business Principles define how Shell subsidiaries are expected to conduct their affairs and are underpinned by the Shell core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. These principles include, among other things, Shell's commitment to support fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business and to contribute to/uni00A0sustainable development. They are designed to mitigate the risk of damage to our business reputation and to prevent violations of local and international legislation. They can be found at www.shell.com/sgbp.

This Code clarifies the basic rules and standards they are expected to follow and the behaviour expected of them. These individuals must also complete mandatory Code of Conduct training.\n\nDesignated individuals are required to complete additional mandatory training on antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, financial crime, data protection laws and/uni00A0trade compliance requirements (see 'Risk factors' on page 28 37)./uni00A0The Shell Code of Conduct can be found at www.shell.com/ codeofconduct.\n\n## CODE OF ETHICS\n\nExecutive Directors and Senior Financial Officers of Shell must also comply with the Code of Ethics. This Code is specifically intended to meet the requirements of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It can be found at www.shell.com/codeofethics.\n\n## INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE\n\nAll Directors may seek independent professional advice in connection with/uni00A0their role as a Director. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The Company has provided both indemnities and Directors' and officers' insurance to the Directors in connection with the performance of their responsibilities. Copies of these indemnities and the Directors' and officers' insurance policies are open to inspection. A copy of the form of these indemnities has been previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n## RESULTS PRESENTATIONS AND ANALYSTS' MEETINGS\n\nThe planned dates of the quarterly, half-yearly and annual results presentations, as well as all major analysts' meetings, are announced in advance on the Shell website and through a regulatory release.\n\nGenerally, presentations are broadcast live via webcast and teleconference. Other meetings with analysts or investors are not normally announced in advance, nor can they be followed remotely by webcast or any other means. Procedures are in place to ensure that discussions in such meetings are always limited to non-material information or information already in the public domain.\n\nResults and meeting presentations can be found at www.shell.com/ investor. This is in line with the requirement to ensure that all shareholders and other parties in the financial market have equal and simultaneous access to information that may influence the price of the Company's securities.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control, and for regularly reviewing its/uni00A0effectiveness.\n\nA single overall control framework is in place for the Company and its subsidiaries that is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of/uni00A0failure to achieve business objectives. It therefore only provides reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement/uni00A0or/uni00A0loss.\n\n## CONTROL FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The Foundation elements of the Shell Control Framework define the/uni00A0principles that underpin the Shell Group's activities.\n- The Management processes define activities critical to an effective control framework.\n- The Structural component defines how businesses and functions facilitate achievement of the Shell Group's overall business objectives, while respecting the separate legal identity of the individual Shell companies that implement them.\n\nThe Control Framework diagram illustrates the key components 'Foundations', 'Management processes' and 'Structural' - that make up the Control Framework. 'Foundations' comprises the objectives, principles\n\nand rules that underpin and establish boundaries for Shell activities. 'Management processes' refers to the more significant management processes, including how strategy, planning and appraisal are used to improve performance and how risks are to be managed through effective controls and assurance. The 'Structural' component defines how Businesses and Functions facilitate achievement of the Shell group's overall/uni00A0business objectives.\n\n## Risk management\n\n- \u25a0 Strategic risks: we consider current and future portfolio considerations, examining parameters such as country concentration or exposure to higher-risk countries. We also consider long-range developments in order to test key assumptions or beliefs in relation to energy markets.\n\nThe 'Statement on Risk Management' is a foundation element of Shell's Control Framework and a key enabler of many of its management processes. We assess risks across the Shell Group in terms of three distinct/uni00A0categories:\n\n- \u25a0 Operational risks: we consider material operational exposures across Shell's entire value chain, and promote a more granular assessment of key risks facing the organisation.\n- \u25a0 Conduct and culture risks: we consider alignment of our policies, practices and behaviours against our purpose and core values.",

    {
        "page_content": "To support risk assessment across each category, Shell has developed a risk appetite framework, which helps management establish and articulate the level of risk that they are willing to accept in pursuit of Shell's strategy and objectives, noting that there are also risks that Shell accepts or does not seek to fully mitigate. The financial framework sets an overarching boundary condition in the consideration of risk appetite, as the financial resilience of Shell should logically inform the aggregate level of risk appetite that could be sustained.\n\nShell's principal risks and the broad array of measures used to manage each risk are described on pages 28-37. During the year, management regularly reviews these principal risks and associated risk responses and/uni00A0implements further remedial actions as appropriate. The Executive Committee and the Board regularly consider Group-level risks, framed across the three categories above, together with the associated control mechanisms and risk responses. In 2020, specific attention was given to/uni00A0our response to the COVID-19 pandemic (see 'Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic' on page 188.\n\nManagement and the Board also consider emerging risks, defined as risks where the scope, impact and likelihood are still uncertain, but which could have a material effect on achieving Shell's strategy and objectives in the future. These risks are identified through, (among other procedures), the monitoring of external developments, scenario planning, the status of risk/uni00A0indicators, learnings from incidents and assurance findings, and the appraisal of Shell's forward-looking plans. Once identified, we undertake activities to monitor, prepare for and/or reduce the future impact, where possible, should such emerging risks materialise.\n\nThe system of risk management and internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of the Control Framework. Regular reviews are/uni00A0performed to identify the significant risks to financial reporting and the key controls designed to address them. These controls are documented, responsibility is assigned, and they are monitored for design and operating effectiveness. Controls found to be ineffective are remediated.\n\nShell has a climate change risk management structure which is supported by standards, policies and controls (see 'Risk factors' on page 29 and 'Climate change and energy transition' on pages 94-107). Climate change and risks resulting from greenhouse gas emissions have been identified as significant risk factors for Shell and are managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee.\n\nMany of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or associates, which may reduce the degree of control and/uni00A0ability to identify and manage risks (see 'Risk Factors' on page 35). In each case, Shell appoints a representative to manage its interests who/uni00A0seeks to ensure that such projects operate under equivalent Shell standards to Shell.\n\nWe operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. In addition, we and our joint arrangements and associates face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide (see 'Risk/uni00A0Factors' on page 30). We continuously monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests. Employees who/uni00A0engage with government officials are subject to specific training programmes, procedures and regular communications, in addition to Shell General Business Principles and Shell Code of Conduct compliance. We are prepared to exit a country if we believe we can no longer operate in that country in accordance with our standards and applicable law, and we have done so in the past.\n\nThe Board confirms it has carried out a robust assessment of Shell's principal risks, including a robust process for identifying, evaluating and managing Shell's principal risks. The Board confirms it has carried out a robust assessment of Shell's emerging risks, the procedures in place to identify the emerging risks, and how risks are being managed or mitigated to help Shell achieve its strategy and objectives. This has been in place throughout 2020 and up to the date of this Report; is regularly reviewed by the Board; and accords with the FRC Guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee to assist it in/uni00A0fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and internal control system, the integrity of financial reporting as well as consideration of compliance matters. (see/uni00A0'Audit Committee Report' on pages 145-152).\n\nThe Audit Committee met six times this year and received regular reports from the Chief Internal Auditor on notable internal audits and those with a/uni00A0significant impact on control effectiveness. The Audit Committee also reviewed significant financial, business and compliance control incidents and received regular reports on business integrity issues. The Audit Committee also requested updates on specific financial, operational and compliance control issues throughout the year. The Audit Committee Chair provided an update to the Board after every Audit Committee meeting.\n\nDuring and after such reports, the Board has an opportunity to request further information and/or ask clarifying questions, which it does to varying degrees depending on the issue. Similarly, the Chairs of the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) and the Nigeria Special Litigation Committee, an ad hoc Board committee, also provide regular updates after each of their respective meetings covering, among other matters, the respective aspects of controls that they monitor pursuant to their Terms of Reference. The Audit Committee and SESCo minutes, once approved, are further provided to the Board and incorporated into Board minutes to ensure full access to and review by all/uni00A0Directors. These aspects, together with the 2020 Reports respectively produced by the Executive Vice President Taxation and Controller and Chief Internal Auditor, the External Auditors, the Chairs of the Disclosure Committee and the Financial Reporting Control Committee and the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, as well as summaries of the Annual Proved Reserves Disclosure and the Full Year HSSE & Social Performance Assurance Report, enable the Board's ongoing monitoring and annual review of material controls.\n\nAn annual review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control was carried out by both the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. This was based on their own insights and experience throughout the year as well as outcomes from the Group-level risk reviews and the Group Assurance Letter process, a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal and ethical requirements and the Shell Control Framework carried out by each Executive Director. As part of their annual review, the Executive Committee and Audit Committee also considered input from the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer and the External Auditor. The insights and conclusions from this annual assessment were reviewed and discussed by the Board.\n\nThe Board confirms that it has conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of Shell's system of risk management and internal control in/uni00A0respect of 2020, such review covering all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls.",

Shell has been responding to the pandemic with a broad, structured approach to ensure we support our colleagues, suppliers, customers and the communities where we work, while ensuring resilience in our day-to-day operations and overall financial framework. A dedicated Group Coordination Team, under the direct supervision of the Executive Committee, has been in place to oversee Shell's risk response plans globally.\n\nWe have taken many steps to protect the health of our colleagues, including requiring or encouraging office-based staff to work from home, depending on the advice of local authorities. We are providing the technology support to ensure up to 70,000 colleagues can work remotely each day. We have developed comprehensive COVID-safe return to site approaches across Shell's offices with small-scale proof-of-concept tests.\n\nFor people working on our platforms offshore, or our facilities onshore, we enforce social distancing, carry out health screening and have procedures in place to allow the safe evacuation of any suspected cases of COVID-19.\n\nTo keep our customers safe at our retail sites we launched Clean+, a global initiative to provide enhanced cleaning, regular sanitation of common touchpoints, free sanitiser and/or wipes, protection for staff and reminders to maintain safe distancing.\n\nManagement at all levels continue to engage extensively with staff to understand and respond to the stresses placed on them as a result of the pandemic. A confidential counselling service is available to help colleagues experiencing the psychological impact of the pandemic,\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OF SHELL\n\nShell's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of Shell's disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that Shell's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF SHELL\n\nManagement, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Shell's financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements'. It conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Shell's internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of this evaluation, management concluded that, at December 31, 2020, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was effective.\n\n## THE TRUSTEE'S AND MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ROYAL DUTCH SHELL DIVIDEND ACCESS TRUST\n\nThe Trustee of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the Trustee) and Shell's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures in respect of the Dividend Access Trust (the Trust) at/uni00A0December 31, 2020. On the basis of this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the/uni00A0Trust are effective.\n\n## THE TRUSTEE'S AND MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE ROYAL DUTCH SHELL DIVIDEND ACCESS TRUST\n\nThe Trustee and the Company's management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Trust's\n\nand we continue to provide extra online resources to help people manage their physical and mental well-being.\n\nTo sustain our operations and supply chains, which in turn support our suppliers and customers, we have business continuity plans in place across all our businesses, functions and operating sites. These plans are adjusted as needed by considering short- and medium-term 'likely' and 'worst case' scenarios developed by the Group Coordination Team. Examples of specific enhanced controls include the strengthening of our global web content filtering capability in response to the switch from office to remote working and additional measures to improve cyber-awareness. We have reiterated and emphasised adherence to Shell's compliance rules (including the Code of Conduct). Shell's Crisis Management Standard is also being used to guide our operational risk responses, and our country chair network has been strengthened to address specific challenges that arise at local levels.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have maintained a strong focus on our cash allocation framework, using a bespoke COVID-19 risk register to monitor the effectiveness of our risk responses to ensure the financial resilience of our portfolio. These responses included the implementation of certain cash preservation measures. More details are provided on pages 81 - 84.\n\nWe expect many of our risk response measures to stay in place in 2021. We continue to adjust and apply our learnings from this experience to ensure we remain resilient in this new macroeconomic environment. Detailed information about the impact of the pandemic on Shell's principal risks and our responses to these impacts is provided on pages 28-37.\n\nfinancial reporting. The Trustee and the Company's management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. On the basis of this evaluation, the Trustee and management concluded that, at December 31, 2020, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n\n## CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThere has not been any change in the internal control over financial reporting of Shell or the Trust that occurred during the period covered by/uni00A0this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Shell or/uni00A0the/uni00A0Trust. Material financial information of the Trust is included in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and is therefore subject to the same disclosure controls and procedures as Shell. See the 'Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust Financial Statements' on pages 294-297 for additional information.\n\n## ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association (Articles) were adopted at the 2019 AGM.

Board membership and biographical details of the Directors are provided on pages 114-121. However, Directors follow the direction laid out in the Code and stand for re-election annually.\n\nDuring the year, Dick Boer and Martina Hund-Mejean (effective May 20, 2020), Sir Andrew Mackenzie and Bram Schot (effective October 1, 2020) were appointed to the Board. Further, Gerard Kleisterlee, Linda Stuntz and Roberto Setubal stood down from the Board at the 2020 AGM held on May 19, 2020.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the Company announced the appointment of Sir Andrew Mackenzie as Chair of the Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc, with effect from the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. Andrew replaces Chad Holliday, who stands down following the 2021 AGM after more than 10 years' service.

These require the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. As such, the Directors have prepared the (i) Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, and therefore in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the/uni00A0European Union; and (ii) Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the\n\nrequirements of the UK Companies Act 2006. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Shell and the Company and of the profit or loss of Shell and the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u25a0 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u25a0 adopt the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to do so;\n- \u25a0 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and\n- \u25a0 state whether international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB have been followed.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of Shell and the Company and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of Shell and the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and, as regards the Consolidated Financial Statements, with Article 4/uni00A0of the IAS Regulation and therefore are in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Shell and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions can be found on/uni00A0pages/uni00A0114-121, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u25a0 the Management Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of Shell, together with a/uni00A0description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n- \u25a0 the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of Shell and the Company; and\n\nFurthermore, so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware, and each of the Directors has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken in order to become aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThe Directors consider that the Annual Report, including the financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Shell website (www.shell.com).

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISA (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report below. We are independent of Shell and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained during the planning, execution and conclusion of our audit is sufficient and appropriate to provide/uni00A0a suitable basis for our opinion.\n\n## 3. CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN\n\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of the controls over management's going concern evaluation. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. We tested management's controls over the review and approval of the business operating plan and the underlying economic assumptions;\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements of the Group is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Shell Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we assessed the information used in the going concern assessment for consistency with the operating plan and information obtained through auditing other areas of the business, obtained an understanding of the business planning process and challenged the central assumptions, including those relating to climate risk and the energy transition. We involved our economist to review Shell's global economic scenarios as well as their economic projections in 10 major countries;\n- \u25a0 we conducted severe but plausible independent stress testing and a reverse stress test to determine the conditions under which Shell could potentially experience a liquidity shortfall. This included assuming lower Brent prices of $20/bbl for 2021 and 2022 and overlaying the assumptions that Shell will not achieve any further asset sales over this period, will not have access to new capital raising and no access to commercial paper programmes. Under this stress testing, we concluded that there would still be sufficient facilities available for Shell to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25a0 given that management prepare forecasts for other business purposes that go beyond March 31, 2022 (the going concern period), we have used such forecasts in our management challenge process and considered events and conditions beyond the period of management's assessment that may cast significant doubt over the entities' ability to continue as going concerns; and\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as going concerns until 31 March 2022.",

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Company's or Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 4. OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nOur global audit team has deep industry experience through working for many years on the audits of large integrated international oil and gas companies and commodity trading organisations. Our audit planning starts with updating our view on external market factors, for example geopolitical risk, the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition, commodity price risk and major trends in the industry. In 2020, the oil and gas industry suffered severe macro-economic shocks due to factors such as the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and on GDP growth, the pace of decarbonisation and the energy transition and the volatility in the oil price, refining margins and in demand for petroleum products.\n\nUPDATING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SHELL'S BUSINESS AND ITS ENVIRONMENT\n\nIDENTIFYING AND/uni00A0ASSESSING/uni00A0THE RISKS/uni00A0OF/uni00A0MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT\n\nIn planning our 2020 audit, we were mindful that there is increased importance on companies providing stakeholders with information on significant judgements applied in the preparation of the financial statements, including the sources of estimation uncertainty and other key assumptions in light of economic and market uncertainty, climate risk and the energy transition. Shell has focused on cost control, capital spending, cash flow management, tackling climate change and is undertaking a fundamental restructuring. As part of our audit, we understood Shell's energy transition strategy and how this is reflected in setting oil and gas commodity price assumptions, refining margin assumptions, the estimation of oil and gas reserves, the recoverable amounts of assets and the recognition and measurement of provisions. This assessment was conducted in light of the commitments that Shell has made with respect to decarbonisation in order to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.\n\nOur updated understanding of Shell's business and the environment in which it operates informed our risk assessment procedures.\n\nThe current macro-economic environment has created heightened estimation uncertainty and an elevated risk of material misstatement of Shell's asset and liability carrying values. These factors had a pervasive impact on Shell's financial statements and increased the risk around key areas of accounting judgement, such as impairment, inventory valuation and provisioning. We also faced additional audit risk due to the fact that the entire 2020 audit was conducted under remote working conditions. We have therefore clarified, and shown as a separate risk, the risk of employee and management fraud as a result of remote working and the potential implications of the restructuring announcement on the stability of the control environment.\n\nThe risks we identified were as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the risk of unrealised trading gains and losses being recognised as a result of errors, unauthorised trading activity or deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading position;\n- \u25a0 impairment of PP&E (including exploration and production assets and refineries) and joint ventures and associates (JVA);\n- \u25a0 risk of fraud through management override within other significant revenue streams; and\n- \u25a0 the risk of both employee and management fraud, including financial statement fraud to overstate financial results or position, misappropriation of assets and illegal acts in responding to the current environment.\n\nOur additional areas of audit focus were:\n\n- \u25a0 legal proceedings and other contingencies, with specific emphasis on OPL 245;\n- \u25a0 the estimation of decommissioning and restoration provisions;\n- \u25a0 uncertain tax positions;\n- \u25a0 identification of onerous regasification contracts in the LNG portfolio;\n- \u25a0 trading valuation (including mark-to-market, hedging, impairment and credit losses);\n- \u25a0 inventory valuation (in relation to net realisable value);\n- \u25a0 pension asset and liability valuations;\n- \u25a0 recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets;\n- \u25a0 recoverability of government receivables;\n- \u25a0 the impact of climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements;\n\n\u25a0\n\nthe dividend distribution process, including the determination of realised profits and losses for the purposes of\n\n- \u25a0 the recoverable amount of investments held by the parent company (this area of audit focus relates to the parent company/uni00A0only).\n\nmaking/uni00A0distributions under the Companies Act 2006 (this area of audit focus relates to the parent company only); and\n\nIn conducting our audit procedures, we changed the nature of our testing compared to the prior year through developing alternative means of obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, including through our enhanced use of technology and/uni00A0digital audit techniques.\n\nThe use of these digital audit tools provided us with an integrated view of risk, thus enabling us to focus our audit effort on operating units with higher risk profiles. They also enabled us to perform risk-led analyses of entire populations of data.\n\nt\n\ns",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH continued\n\n## Our determination of materiality in uncertain times\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of these financial statements. In determining this year's materiality, we have considered both Shell's changing risk landscape and the unique combination of macro-economic factors, including current market volatility, disruption in demand and production and global supply chain oversupplies in 2020.\n\nThe world is in an uncertain place and will be so for some time. However, we believed that it was important that, in setting materiality in these uncertain times, we did not overreact to what is expected to be a relatively temporary phenomenon especially when Shell continues to be the same company structurally. In the 4th Quarter of 2020 and post year-end, the oil price has more than recovered to the levels it was before the pandemic and oil price collapse in March 2020. Our key criterion in determining materiality remained our perception of the needs of Shell's investors. We considered which earnings, activity or capital-based measure aligned best with the expectations of the Audit Committee and users of Shell's financial statements. In so doing, we applied a 'reasonable investor perspective', which reflected our understanding of the common financial information needs of the members of Shell as a group.\n\nFor the previous four years, we believed that investor needs were best met by basing materiality on normalised adjusted earnings, which excludes identified items and are adjusted for tax (adjusted earnings). However, for 2020, in light of the extraordinary circumstances under which Shell was operating, we undertook a fundamental review of the possible alternative bases on which to determine materiality. We considered alternative benchmarks to adjusted earnings, including revenue, EBITDA, total assets and equity. These indicated a range for materiality of $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion, with the capital-based measures being at the top end of this range.\n\nWe believed that an adjusted earnings approach remained appropriate, despite the fact that the difficult trading environment would distort short-term earnings-based measures. Although this was an unprecedented time for Shell and the industry and there was uncertainty around how long negative price impacts would last, views of economists and market participants were that demand would return and that the supply/demand balance would be re-addressed over time. By applying an adjusted earnings approach, the materiality range narrowed to $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion. We planned our 2020 audit using the bottom end of this range, which resulted in the following materiality measures for 2020:\n\n- \u25a0 performance materiality: $500 million (2019: $900 million); and\n- \u25a0 planning materiality: $1,000 million (2019: $1,200 million);\n- \u25a0 reporting differences threshold: $50 million (2019: $60 million).\n\nOur determination of performance materiality was underpinned by our assessment of the potential impact of remote working on/uni00A0Shell throughout the year and the potential impact on Shell's control environment of the restructuring programme (Project Reshape). We confirmed with the Audit Committee that they were satisfied that these levels of materiality were appropriate. We/uni00A0kept our assessment of materiality under review throughout the year.\n\nOur scope was tailored to the circumstances of our audit of Shell and was influenced by our determination of materiality and our assessed risks of material misstatement.\n\nWe reassessed our 2020 audit scope following the completion of our 2019 audit. Our starting point was the consolidated 2019/uni00A0financial reporting data by Area of Operation (AoO). We identified those AoOs that were significant by virtue of their contribution to Shell's results or significant by virtue of their associated risk or complexity. In doing this we considered the history or/uni00A0expectation of unusual or complex transactions, potential for or history of material misstatements, the previous effectiveness of controls, our assessment in relation to fraud, bribery or corruption; and internal audit findings. We then considered the adequacy of account coverage and remaining audit risk of AoOs not directly covered by audit procedures. Finally, we sense checked our scope to the prior year, ensured that there was appropriate unpredictability and made the necessary changes where appropriate.\n\nBy following this approach, our audit effort focused on higher risk areas, such as management judgements. Our group wide procedures enabled us to obtain audit evidence over the AoOs that were not full, specific or specified procedure scope.\n\n## ASSESSING MATERIALITY (SECTION 5)\n\n## DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT (SECTION 6)",

These relate to: (1) the impact of climate risk and the energy transition on the financial statements; and (2) impairment of investments held by the Parent Company.\n\n## 5. OUR ASSESSMENT OF MATERIALITY\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risks of material misstatement.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY continued\n\n## Overall materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, as well as in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements (including omissions) on our audit and in forming our audit opinion. For the purposes of determining whether or not Shell's financial statements are free from material misstatement (whether due to fraud or error), we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatements that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of these financial statements. We are required to establish a materiality level for the financial statements as a whole that is appropriate in light of Shell's particular circumstances.\n\nOur overall materiality provides a basis for identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. Our/uni00A0evaluation of materiality requires professional judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative considerations. It also considers our assessment of the expectations of those charged with governance at Shell and users of Shell's financial statements. As required by auditing standards, we reassess materiality throughout the duration of the audit.\n\n## Level set\n\n## Group materiality\n\nWe set our preliminary overall materiality for Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements at $1,000 million (2019: $1,200 million). We kept this under review throughout the year and reassessed the appropriateness of our original assessment in light of Shell's results and external market conditions. Based on these reviews/uni00A0and reassessments, we did not find it necessary to revise our level of/uni00A0overall/uni00A0materiality.\n\n## Parent Company materiality:\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $1.0 billion (2019:/uni00A0$2.6/uni00A0billion), which is 0.4% of equity (2019: 1% of equity). We concluded that equity remains an appropriate basis to determine materiality for an investment holding company. However, we identified an indicator of impairment in the carrying value of the Parent Company's investments, which represent the majority of the equity value of the Parent Company. As a result, we concluded it was appropriate to align the Parent Company materiality with the lower materiality of/uni00A0the Group. Any balances in the Parent Company financial statements that were/uni00A0relevant to our audit of the consolidated group were audited using an allocation of group performance materiality.\n\n## Our basis of determining materiality in uncertain times\n\nOur assessment of overall materiality was $1,000 million. This was derived from an average of Shell's earnings for 2018 and 2019 and the estimated result for 2020 on an adjusted earnings basis reported by Shell in its quarterly results announcements, and adjusted for an effective tax rate.\n\nIn determining materiality, auditing standards require us to use benchmark measures, such as pre-tax income, total revenue, total assets and equity. Nevertheless, we have to exercise considerable judgement, including which earnings, activity or capital-based measure aligns best with the expectations of users of Shell's financial statements and the Audit Committee.\n\nIn determining this year's materiality, we have considered both Shell's changing risk landscape and various macro-economic factors, such as the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and on GDP growth, the pace of decarbonisation and the energy transition and volatility in oil and gas prices and in demand for petroleum products.\n\nThe world is in an uncertain place and will be so for some time. However, we believed that it was important that, in setting materiality in these uncertain times, we did not overreact to what is expected to be a relatively temporary phenomenon - especially when Shell continues to be the same company structurally. In the 4th Quarter of 2020 and post year-end, the oil price has more than recovered to the levels it was before the pandemic and oil price collapse in March 2020. Our key criterion in determining materiality remained our perception of the needs of Shell's investors.\n\nWe considered which earnings, activity or capital-based measure aligned best with the expectations of the Audit Committee and users of Shell's financial statements. In so doing, we applied a 'reasonable investor perspective', which reflected our understanding of the common financial information needs of the members of Shell as a group.\n\nFor the previous four years, we believed that investor needs were best met by basing materiality on adjusted earnings. However, for 2020, in light of the extraordinary circumstances under which Shell was operating, we undertook a fundamental review of the possible alternative bases on which to determine materiality. We considered alternative benchmarks to adjusted earnings, including revenue, EBITDA, total assets and equity. These indicated a range for materiality of $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion, with the capital-based measures being at the top end of this range.\n\nIn light of this analysis, we re-considered whether or not an adjusted earnings approach remained appropriate, despite the fact that the difficult trading environment would distort short-term earnings-based measures. In so doing, we reflected on the following factors:\n\n- \u25a0 analyst forecasts predominately feature adjusted earnings, which exclude identified items, as the basis for their forecasts. The analyst consensus data supports our judgement that adjusted earnings, excluding identified items, remains the key indicator of performance from a reasonable investor perspective;\n- \u25a0 the use of adjusted earnings allows investors to understand how management has performed despite the commodity price environment, as opposed to because of it;\n- \u25a0 although this is an unprecedented time for Shell and the industry and there is uncertainty around how long negative price impacts will last, views of economists and market participants are that demand will return and that the supply/demand balance will be re-addressed over time; and\n- \u25a0 Shell were not forecasting a significant drop in volumes in 2020 (although there would be some impacts as capital expenditure reductions flowed through later in the year). This provided further support to this being a price driven impact on earnings rather than one relating to Shell's fundamental business model, underlying activities and produced and manufactured volumes.\n\nOn the basis of our analysis of these factors, we concluded that we should continue to focus on Shell's adjusted earnings reported by Shell in its quarterly results announcements and adjusted for an effective tax rate.\n\nBy applying an adjusted earnings approach, the materiality range narrowed from our initial range of $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion to $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion. We planned our 2020 audit using the bottom end of this range.\n\nThe identified items excluded in 2020 were: net divestment gains ($0.3 billion), net impairments ($28.1 billion charge), fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts ($1.2 billion charge), onerous contract provisions ($1.4 billion charge), redundancy and restructuring ($0.9 billion charge), and the aggregate of other individually small items (net $0.7 billion charge).\n\nThe identified items excluded in 2019 were: net divestment gains ($2.6 billion), net impairments ($4.2 billion charge), fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts ($0.6 billion gain), redundancy and restructuring ($0.1 billion charge), and the aggregate of other individually small items (net $0.8 billion charge).\n\nThe identified items excluded in 2018 were: net divestment gains ($3.3 billion), net impairments ($1.0 billion charge), fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts ($1.1 billion gain), redundancy and restructuring ($0.2 billion charge), and the aggregate of other individually small items (net $0.1 billion charge).",

        "page_content": "## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nHaving established overall materiality, we determined 'performance materiality', which represents our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account. It is calculated as a percentage of overall materiality in order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality of $1,000 million for Shell's financial statements as a whole.\n\nOnce we had determined our audit scope, we then assigned performance materiality to our various in-scope operating units. Our in-scope operating unit audit teams used this assigned performance materiality in performing their group audit procedures. The performance materiality allocation is dependent on the size of the operating unit, measured by its contribution of earnings to Shell, or other appropriate metric, and the risk associated with the operating unit.\n\n## Level set\n\nIn assessing the appropriate level of performance materiality, we consider the nature, the number and impact of the audit differences identified in 2019 as well as the overall control environment.\n\nAt the planning stage of the audit, which was at the very start of the pandemic, we set our performance materiality at 75% (2019: 75%) of planning materiality, namely $750 million (2019: $900 million). However, we noted that the developing macro-economic environment was creating heightened estimation uncertainty and an elevated risk of material misstatement of Shell's asset and liability carrying values. These factors had a pervasive impact on Shell's financial statements and increased the risk around key areas of accounting judgement. We also faced additional audit risk due to the fact that the entire 2020 audit was conducted under remote working conditions.\n\nConsequently, we kept our planning and performance materiality under ongoing review. Whilst we confirmed that the overall materiality level of $1,000 million remained appropriate, in the second half of 2020, we revised performance materiality downwards to be 50% of planning materiality ($500 million). This decision was based on the following considerations:\n\n- \u25a0 the heightened estimation uncertainty;\n- \u25a0 the potential impacts of remote working through the year-end close;\n- \u25a0 the potential impact on Shell's control environment of the restructuring programme (Project Reshape); and\n- \u25a0 corrected and uncorrected errors.\n\nThe primary impact of reducing our performance materiality was a reduction in the testing thresholds that were assigned to our component teams, which led to larger sample sizes for the purposes of our substantive audit testing.\n\nIn 2020, the range of performance materiality allocated to operating units was $75 million to $325 million (2019: $135 million to $450 million). This is set out in more detail in section 6 below.\n\n## Audit difference reporting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial.\n\nThe threshold is the level above which we collate and report audit differences to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe also report differences below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Level set\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences more than $50 million (2019: $60 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF SHELL'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\nGroup evaluation, review and oversight of component teams\n\n## Involvement with local EY teams\n\nThe group engagement partner and Senior Statutory Auditor, Allister Wilson, has overall responsibility for the direction, supervision and performance of the Shell audit engagement in compliance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. He is supported by 14 segment and function partners and associate partners, who are based in the Netherlands and the UK, and who together with related staff, comprise the integrated group engagement team. This group engagement team established the overall group audit strategy, communicated with component auditors, performed work on the consolidation process and evaluated the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence as the basis for forming EY's opinion on the group financial statements.\n\nFor the purpose of the group audit, the group engagement team is responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating and reviewing the work of/uni00A0EY global network firms operating under their instruction (local EY teams) to assess whether:\n\n- \u25a0 the local EY audit team demonstrated that they had challenged management sufficiently and had executed their audit procedures with a/uni00A0sufficient level of scepticism; and\n- \u25a0 the work was performed and documented to a sufficiently high standard;\n- \u25a0 there is sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the conclusions reached.\n\nThe group engagement team provided detailed instructions to our BSC and in-country teams to drive the audit strategy and execution in a/uni00A0coordinated manner. However, travel restrictions presented challenges to us exercising sufficient and appropriate direction, supervision, oversight and review of overseas EY audit teams such that we had adequate involvement in their work.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Allister Wilson and other group audit partners and directors would visit in-scope operating units and Shell's BSCs. The purpose of these visits would be to discuss the audit approach with the local EY teams and any issues arising from their work, meet with local management, attend planning and closing meetings and review key audit working papers on risk areas. However, in planning our audit, we assumed a worst-case scenario where travel restrictions and lockdowns would persist throughout the period of the audit. As a result, we developed an audit strategy that enabled the group engagement team to fulfil its responsibilities under auditing standards to evaluate, review and oversee the work of component teams on a remote basis.\n\nIn the absence of group team members being able to travel to visit local EY teams at component locations, this process included maintaining a/uni00A0continuous and open dialogue with our component teams, as well as holding formal closing meetings quarterly, to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. Between quarters, and during critical periods of the audit, we increased the use of online collaboration tools to facilitate team meetings, information sharing and the evaluation, review and oversight of component teams. We requested more detailed deliverables from component teams and we utilised fully the interactive capability of EY Canvas, our global audit workflow tool, to review remotely the underlying work performed. Our experience of this way of working - with both Shell and our teams - was positive. The technology proved to be robust and resilient in supporting the new way of working.\n\nShell has centralised processes and controls over key areas within its BSCs. Members of the group engagement team provide direct oversight, review and coordination of our BSC audit teams. Our BSC teams performed centralised testing in the BSCs for certain accounts, including revenue, cash and payroll. In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the operating units or BSCs by the group engagement team or by auditors from other local EY teams.\n\nThe group engagement team performed procedures directly on 90 of the in-scope operating units. For the operating units where the work was performed by local EY auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement of the group engagement team to enable us to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained.\n\nDuring 2020, the group team were unable to carry out physical site visits. However, we performed virtual site visits at those locations that we would normally have visited in person. We also joined the virtual site visits at 3 locations carried out by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Senior Statutory Auditor and other group audit partners, associate partners and directors conducted virtual site visits of operating units across 7 countries as well as each of Shell's four BSCs. The countries and the BSC locations visited were as follows:\n\n| Countries visited                                        | BSCs                                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Australia                                                | India [A]                                                |\n| Brazil [A]                                               | Malaysia [A]                                             |\n| Nigeria [A]                                              | Philippines [A]                                          |\n| Singapore                                                | Poland [A]                                               |\n| Qatar                                                    | Poland [A]                                               |\n| UK [A]                                                   | Poland [A]                                               |\n| USA [A]                                                  | Poland [A]                                               |\n| [A] These were visited multiple times on a virtual basis | [A] These were visited multiple times on a virtual basis |",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\n- \u25a0 the risks that we believed were significant to our audit and therefore required special audit consideration;\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. As Shell's auditors, we are required to determine - from the matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee during the year - those matters that required significant attention from us in performing our audit of Shell's 2020 Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements. In making this determination we took/uni00A0the following into account:\n\n- \u25a0 areas of higher assessed risk of material misstatement that influenced our audit focus;\n- \u25a0 the effect on our audit of significant events or transactions that occurred during the period; and\n- \u25a0 significant audit judgements relating to areas in Shell's Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements, including accounting estimates that/uni00A0we identified as having high estimation uncertainty;\n- \u25a0 those assessed risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0audit team.\n\nOn this basis, we identified the following key audit matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of Shell's 2020 Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u25a0 the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \u25a0 our overall strategy;\n- \u25a0 directing the efforts of our audit team.\n\nThe key audit matters have been addressed in the context of the audit of Shell's Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinions thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The table below describes the key audit matters, a summary of our procedures carried out and our key observations that we communicated to the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the current year, we have added two key audit matters that were not reported as key audit matters in our 2019 report. These relate to: (1) the impact of climate risk and the energy transition on the financial statements; and (2) the recoverable amount of investments held by the Parent Company (this key/uni00A0audit matter relates to the Parent Company only).\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK AND THE ENERGY TRANSITION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThe financial impacts of climate change and the energy transition remain an area of audit focus, as they have a pervasive impact on many areas of accounting judgement and estimate and, therefore, our audit. Risk is elevated compared to 2019 due to the increased focus on climate change of investors and regulators.\n\nClimate change presents financial risk both to business and/uni00A0to the global economy. The Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions and, in turn, enable stakeholders to/uni00A0understand better the concentrations of carbon-related assets in the financial sector and the financial system's exposures to climate-related risks.\n\nShell has incorporated climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management and strategic planning processes and is focused on increasing transparency and promoting investors' understanding of its strategies to respond to the risks and opportunities presented by climate change (see page 94).\n\nShell states that its Energy Transition Report is aligned with the TCFD recommendations and sets out how Shell plans to be resilient to expected changes in the energy system and how its strategy helps it to thrive as the world transitions to lower-carbon energy page 162.\n\nThe audit risk is that critical accounting estimates or judgements do not reflect material climate risks and could, as a result, mislead investors. For example, forecast assumptions that underpin management's operating plan used in assessing the recoverable amount of assets, particularly oil and gas price assumptions relevant to upstream oil and gas PP&E assets, and refining margins relevant to manufacturing assets, may not appropriately reflect the macro-economic impacts of the pandemic, combined with changes in supply and demand due to climate risk and the energy transition.\n\nSimilarly, there is an audit risk that the narrative disclosures around material climate risk in the Annual Report and the financial statements are not aligned.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements and estimates that are impacted by climate risk and the energy transition include the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the useful economic lives of PP&E and the estimation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A);\n- \u25a0 the estimation of oil and gas reserves and resources;\n- \u25a0 impairment assessments for goodwill, PP&E and joint ventures and associates, including the recovery of exploration and evaluation assets that may no longer be considered to be economic due to the impact of climate risk and the energy transition on oil and gas prices;\n- \u25a0 the recognition and measurement of Deferred Tax Assets; and\n- \u25a0 the recognition and measurement of decommissioning and restoration (D&R) provisions, including operations that historically have been assumed to have indefinite lives;\n- \u25a0 climate change-related litigation brought against Shell that may lead to/uni00A0an outflow of resources or otherwise impact Shell's business.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nIn January 2021, we reported to the Audit Committee that we did not see any evidence that Shell's balance sheet overstated assets or understated liabilities. For Upstream and Integrated Gas assets, we were satisfied that the reserves used in the DD&A calculation do not extend to an unrealistic period in the future based on our current understanding of expected future developments. For Oil Products and Chemicals assets, we considered the fundamental shift in the refining market driven by overcapacity in the mid-term, energy transition in the long-term, and further exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19 in the short to medium term. Given the headroom that supports the carrying amount of goodwill that is allocated to CGUs at the segment level, we were satisfied that the carrying amount of goodwill was appropriately recorded.\n\nCritical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nAlso, based on our assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances as well as the audit evidence obtained from legal counsel, we were satisfied with management's assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change-related litigation.\n\nKey observations in relation to the other financial impacts of climate change and the energy transition are included in the other key audit matters below.\n\nOur audit procedures took account of the content of a letter dated 5 November 2020 sent by Sarasin and Partners to the Audit Committee Chair regarding their call for \"Paris-aligned\" accounts, as well as the document published on the same date by/uni00A0the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) entitled 'Investor Expectations for Paris-aligned Accounts' and the FRC's climate change thematic review.\n\nThe procedures we carried out included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 assessing the reasonableness of Shell's carbon prices included as part of the forecast operating plan, going concern and viability assessments with assistance of EY auditors with expertise in climate change;\n- \u25a0 understanding Shell's processes around the climate change and energy transition-related disclosures in the Annual Report, including risk assessment, viability and greenhouse gas emissions' reporting;\n- \u25a0 assessing the consistency of Shell's public statements on energy transition and climate change with significant judgements and estimates reflected in the financial statements (for example oil and gas reserve estimates, future capital and operating expenses assumptions and assumed refining margins);\n- \u25a0 we made inquiries of management relating to Shell's assessment of its resilience to/uni00A0the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 assessing the historical accuracy of disclosures made in the Annual Report. This included considering the disclosure recommendations of the TCFD and the appropriateness of Shell's disclosures in respect thereof;\n- \u25a0 we evaluated Shell's long-term pricing assumptions against the IEA outlook;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin estimation methodology, particularly in light of the expected impacts of a lower carbon world. For example, we read reports from independent, third-party sources in order to identify potential contrary evidence and to assess the reasonableness of/uni00A0key inputs and assumptions used in Shell's refining margin model. These inputs included refining capacity additions, expected refinery closures, carbon dioxide costs and the strategic and political behaviour of National Oil Companies;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the energy transition assumptions within the estimation of oil and gas/uni00A0reserves;\n- \u25a0 we mapped the climate change and energy transition risks to key audit areas; and\n- \u25a0 with the assistance of EY auditors with expertise in climate change, we assessed and challenged the reasonableness of Shell's narrative disclosures around material climate risk. In addition, we evaluated the consistency between these narrative disclosures and the financial statements.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team.",

For example, for Shell to reach net-zero emissions by 2050,  it/uni00A0would also be necessary for Shell's customers to de-carbonise. Importantly also, Shell has  reported in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements that their operating plan and pricing  assumptions do not yet reflect Shell's 2050 net-zero emissions target. For these reasons, it is neither  possible nor appropriate for EY, as Shell's auditor, to attempt to provide in our audit opinion  Paris-aligned assumptions that are not in our remit to determine, and the impact that any such  assumptions might/uni00A0be expected to have on the financial statements. We are satisfied that the disclosure in relation to the Board's current view on the ways in which  Shell's critical accounting judgements and estimates are impacted by climate risk and the  energy/uni00A0transition are sufficient and appropriate. However, it is not within our professional remit,  responsibility or expertise to disclose in our audit opinion what we would consider to be reasonable  assumptions taking the net-zero transition into account, and the impact such assumptions might  have/uni00A0on Shell's financial statements.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\nTHE ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES, INCLUDING RESERVES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTISATION (DD&A), IMPAIRMENT TESTING TO EVALUATE THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNTS OF EXPLORATION AND OF PRODUCTION ASSETS AND IN THE ESTIMATION OF DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION (D&R)/uni00A0PROVISIONS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n## This is a forecast-based valuation. Risk is unchanged compared/uni00A0to 2019.\n\nAs described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Exploration and evaluation assets amounted to $9,226 million, and Production assets amounted to $131,763 million. Production assets had an associated DD&A charge of $33,806 million. The accounting for these financial statement amounts relies on management's estimation of/uni00A0oil and gas reserves. As further described in Note 8, impairment charges of $20,155 million of Exploration and Production assets were/uni00A0recorded during the year. As described in Note 18, D&R/uni00A0provisions amounted to $23,175 million.\n\nAuditing the estimation of oil and gas reserves is complex as there is significant estimation uncertainty in assessing the quantities of Shell's reserves and resources. The estimates are based on a central group of experts' assessments of petroleum initially in place, production curves and certain other inputs, including future capital and operating cost assumptions and future carbon costs.\n\nIn-year movements are driven by revisions of previous estimates resulting from reclassifications, improved recovery assumptions, extensions and discoveries and purchases and sales of reserves in place. Revisions generally arise from new information, for example additional drilling results, changes in production patterns and changes to development plans, which are an input to the cash flows used in the measurement of Exploration and Production assets and D&R provisions.\n\nAuditing these financial statement areas is complex because we are required to evaluate the work of reservoir engineers and assess the appropriateness of the inputs selected by management described above. These inputs are used by reservoir engineers in estimating oil/uni00A0and gas reserves.\n\nOur reserves audit team includes auditors with substantial oil and gas reserves expertise, valuation experience and relevant qualifications in energy economics.\n\nThe procedures we carried out included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we tested whether significant additions or reductions in reserves had been made in the period in which the new information became available;\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's oil and gas reserves estimation process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested management's controls over completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the reservoir engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves;\n- \u25a0 we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of Shell's internal reservoir engineers who:\n- - are primarily responsible for providing independent review and challenge, and ultimately endorsement of, the reserve estimates;\n- - provide the detailed preparation of the reserve estimates; and\n- \u25a0 we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating the economic limit test for the determination of oil and gas reserves by agreeing the inputs to source documentation. The economic limit of a project is reached when the operating cash flow from a project becomes negative. The economic limit test has a direct impact on DD&A and impairment. Where relevant, we assessed whether the economic limit test incorporated Shell's estimate of future carbon costs to reflect the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition. We also identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence by comparing actual to prior year forecasts;\n- \u25a0 we tested the existence and completeness of the undeveloped reserves recognised. Where volumes recognised remained undeveloped for more than five years from the date they were booked, or where development was not expected for at least five years, we assessed whether or not Shell was still working towards development by comparing with future development plans, including capital expenditure plans. Also, where reserves are recognised beyond current licence terms, we obtained evidence to/uni00A0support the assumption that the licence would be renewed; and\n- \u25a0 for undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management's development plan for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations must be scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer period. This evaluation was made by assessing consistency of the development projections with Shell's drilling, development and capital expenditure plans;\n- \u25a0 we assessed whether or not the energy transition assumptions used in the asset plans reflected the commitments that Shell has made with respect to decarbonisation in order to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, specifically considering reserve volumes expected to be lifted beyond 2030.\n\nOur procedures were led by the group engagement team, with input from our teams in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, Norway, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia and the USA.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe reported that our reserves audit team included a partner with significant oil and gas reserves expertise and valuation experience. He is a graduate of the 'Ecole Polytechnique', the industrial and engineering school in France, holds a post graduate diploma from the French Petroleum School (Institut Francais du P\u00e9tr\u00f4le) and lectures on oil and gas reserves. Other audit team members had relevant industry experience through working for many years on the audits of oil and gas companies.\n\nBased on our testing, we did not identify any significant errors in the oil and gas reserves and resources and concluded that the inputs and assumptions used to estimate reserves and resources were reasonable. We reported that we had verified that significant additions to or reductions in reserves had been recorded in the appropriate period, and that they were in compliance with Shell's reserves and resources guidance.\n\nWe reported to the Audit Committee that, in light of the commitments that Shell has made to be a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050, we saw no evidence that the recognition of the reserve volumes expected to be lifted beyond 2030 results in the overstatement of Shell's balance sheet by overstating the recoverable amounts of Shell's assets or understatement of D&R provisions.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 147 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed assurances for oil and gas reserves.

        "page_content": "## IMPAIRMENT OF PP&E (INCLUDING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS AND REFINERIES) AND JOINT VENTURES/uni00A0AND ASSOCIATES (JVA)\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is a forecast-based estimate. Risk is elevated compared to/uni00A02019 due to the increased uncertainty in future commodity prices, refining margins and demand for petroleum products, as/uni00A0well as the impact of the energy transition.\n\nAs described in Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Shell recognised $141 billion of Exploration and Production assets, $50 billion of manufacturing, supply and distribution assets (refineries), as well as investments in joint ventures and associates of $22 billion. As disclosed in Note 8 and Note 9, Shell recorded impairment charges of $27 billion and $0.6 billion of PP&E and JVAs respectively.\n\nAuditing the recoverable amounts of PP&E and investments in JVAs is complex and subjective due to the significant amount of judgement involved. The most complex judgements in forecasting future cash flows relate to management's view on the long-term oil and gas price outlook and refining margins appropriate to local markets. These judgements are particularly difficult because of increased demand uncertainty due to factors such as the macro-economic impacts of the pandemic and the pace of decarbonisation and the energy transition.\n\nOther judgements relate to oil and gas reserve estimates, future expected production volumes, the risking of cash flows and the expected useful lives of the assets.\n\nFurther, given the long timeframes involved, the recoverable amounts of assets are often sensitive to the extent of the risking of the future cash flows. There is a risk of material misstatement in the event that the future cash flows do not reflect appropriately the risks specific to the asset.\n\n## Production assets, including JVAs\n\nProducing assets' operational performance and the impact of/uni00A0external factors have a significant bearing on the estimate of/uni00A0the/uni00A0recoverable amounts of Shell's Upstream and Integrated Gas assets.\n\nThe most complex judgement in determining the recoverable amount of Production assets within Upstream and Integrated Gas is the estimation of/uni00A0future oil and gas price, both in the short term and the long term. The estimation of future oil and gas prices is subject to increased uncertainty, given climate change, the energy transition and the impact of the pandemic on the demand for petroleum products. There is a risk that management's oil and gas price assumptions are not appropriate, potentially leading to a material misstatement.\n\nA further management judgement relates to the estimation of oil and gas reserves as there is significant estimation uncertainty in the process of assessing the quantities of Shell's reserves and resources. We have described the risk within the Estimation of oil and gas reserves key audit matter above.\n\n## Overall\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's asset impairment process for: (1) production assets, including joint ventures and associates; (2) exploration and evaluation assets; and (3) manufacturing, supply and distribution assets. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls over the identification of cash generating units, of indicators of impairment and reversals of impairment and the approval of key inputs to impairment assessments, including oil and gas prices and refining margins, discount rates and oil and gas reserves.\n\nWe evaluated Shell's asset impairment methodology and where impairment assessments were carried out, we tested the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the models used. For those assets or investments impaired previously, we evaluated the actual results versus the assumptions made and considered if reversals were required.\n\nIn order to evaluate the cash flow inputs of the impairment models, our procedures included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 tested whether carbon pricing was included in cash flows, where applicable;\n- \u25a0 tested whether operating expenditure profiles, capital costs to complete construction and refinery turnaround costs, agreed to approved operator budgets and management forecasts;\n- \u25a0 reconciled reserves volumes in the impairment models and tested whether the life-of-field assumptions were consistent with those applied in the decommissioning and restoration provision models; and\n- \u25a0 performed sensitivity analyses on key variables in the base case cash flow models to understand the impact of changes in certain assumptions (including oil and gas prices, refining margins, production and the risking of cashflows).\n\nWhere impairment tests were undertaken, we performed sensitivity analyses of the models using different price scenarios and asset specific risks taking into account the nature of the asset, its location, its stage of development and associated risks.\n\n## Oil and gas price assumptions\n\nTo test price assumptions, we compared future short and long-term commodity prices to consensus analysts' forecasts and those adopted by other international oil companies; we evaluated whether prices were used consistently across Shell, including pricing differentials, and evaluated whether Shell's long-term price assumptions incorporated the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition by comparing the assumptions to the International Energy Agency price outlook in the Energy Outlook scenarios.\n\n## Risking of cash flows\n\nWe assessed the basis for adjusting the cash flows to reflect the risks of each individual asset that were not reflected in the impairment discount rate. In so doing, we considered, for Upstream and Integrated Gas, the stage of the life of the asset, the nature of the asset and tested the consistency across similar fields. In respect of refineries, we considered refining margins, refinery availability and estimated unplanned maintenance costs.\n\n## Oil and gas reserves estimates\n\nThe procedures we performed in relation to oil and gas estimates are described above within the Estimation of oil and gas reserves key audit matter.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF PP&E (INCLUDING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS AND REFINERIES) AND JOINT VENTURES/uni00A0AND ASSOCIATES (JVA) continued\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\n## Exploration and evaluation assets\n\nExploration and evaluation (E&E) expenditures are capitalised on a project-by-project basis. E&E activity is inherently risky given the level of uncertainty considered in the run up to Final Investment Decision (FID). Where FID is not achieved, there is a significant judgement relating to the risk that certain E&E costs are not written off in the appropriate reporting period. Given the current environment, there is a heightened risk that projects will no longer proceed, in which case they may need to be written off. It is possible that a greater than usual number of projects will/uni00A0not proceed in the current environment.\n\n## Manufacturing, supply and distribution assets\n\nIn the event that there is a prolonged period of low refining margins, there may be a need to assess refineries for impairment. Auditing future refining margins is inherently complex as the margins are influenced by regional factors and there is limited external refining margin forecast data available.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe obtained external evidence, including price forecasts by banks, brokers, consultants and published data from Shell's peer group, to support the reasonableness of Shell's price assumptions. Overall, Shell's assumptions for both Brent and Henry Hub lie comfortably within the benchmarks that we had identified. In the short-term, Shell's Brent price assumption is the most conservative compared to our sector benchmarks and Shell's forecast aligns broadly with/uni00A0the/uni00A0sector averages from 2023 onwards.\n\n## Oil and gas price assumptions\n\nFor Henry Hub, compared to the sector, Shell's forecast is below the average in the short-term, converging with the bank/broker, consultant and peer group averages by 2024.\n\n## Refining margins\n\nKey observations in relation to refining margins are set out in the key audit matter below.\n\n## Impairment discount rates\n\nShell applied a discount rate of 6% to estimate the recoverable amount in impairment tests, with additional risking included in the cashflows. Whilst the risking of/uni00A0cashflows is highly judgemental, we were satisfied that the cash flows had been risked appropriately.\n\n## Production assets, including Joint ventures and associates\n\nWe reported that management's review to determine whether or not any indicators of impairment were present had considered all relevant information available at the end of each reporting period, including: the reserves and resources review process, the output of Shell's operating plan and strategic changes in Shell's intended future use of assets, including the refining portfolio, some of which were driven by the energy transition.\n\nFor the assets where management's impairment assessment resulted in an impairment charge, the charges were within an acceptable range. Also, we were satisfied that the impairment charges were recorded in the appropriate period.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets\n\nThe E&E assets that were being carried were consistent with Shell's strategy and operating plan, including the impacts of the energy transition. We were satisfied that it remained appropriate to continue to carry the E&E assets whilst the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting commercial reserves were being assessed.\n\n## Manufacturing, supply and distribution assets\n\nThe significant reduction in future margin assumptions represents an impairment trigger, which resulted in Shell's entire refinery portfolio being tested for impairment. We reported that, in our view, management had performed extensive and rigorous impairment assessments covering 14 refineries. Management's forecasts included appropriate risking covering margin, availability and cost downside risks. We were satisfied that the risking had been applied appropriately across the portfolio of refineries. We reported that the outcome of the impairment assessments was consistent with our analysis of expected future refining margins, based on the configuration of each individual refinery, including the fact that refineries that are able to produce the most beneficial mix of products, in particular low density products, are expected to fare more favourably and therefore have a higher recoverable amount.\n\nA pre-tax impairment charge of $4.8 billion was recorded. The impairment models were most sensitive to refining margins. A +/-10% change in the long-term refining gross/uni00A0margin across the portfolio would have had an impact of approximately $1.5-$2.5 billion of additional impairment or $1.7-$2.7 billion of impairment/uni00A0reversal.\n\n## Impairment disclosures\n\nWe agreed that the disclosure of the impairments recorded during the year, including sensitivity analysis, performed by the company was appropriate.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 150 for details on how the Audit Committee considered impairments. Also, see Notes 2, 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation assets\n\nWe performed a licence-by-licence risk assessment of Shell's E&E assets to identify assets with a significant risk of impairment. We assessed each significant licence area against the impairment criteria within IFRS 6, with a particular focus on those assets that were expected to be developed over the medium and long term, or those assets where the dominant commodity that will be produced is oil.\n\nWe considered whether the development of E&E projects would be inconsistent with Shell's current strategy and may no longer be considered to be economic due to the impact of climate risk and the energy transition on oil and gas prices.\n\n## Manufacturing, supply and distribution\n\nIn addition to the procedures described above, the procedures we performed are described within the Estimation of future refining margins to evaluate the recoverability of manufacturing assets key audit matter below.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed by our group engagement teams as well as our local audit teams in Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, the UK and the USA, which covered 49% of PP&E and investments in joint ventures and associates across the Group.\n\nWe also performed specified procedures over the recoverability of PP&E balances in Argentina,/uni00A0Australia, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy,/uni00A0Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, South/uni00A0Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA which covered an additional 17% of PP&E and investments in joint ventures and associates across the Group.",

        "page_content": "## THE ESTIMATION OF FUTURE REFINING MARGINS TO EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF REFINERIES\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is a forecast-based valuation. Risk is elevated compared to 2019/uni00A0due to Shell reshaping its refining portfolio and refocusing its downstream strategy.\n\nAs described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, manufacturing, supply and distribution assets/uni00A0were $50 billion. As further described in Note 8, an/uni00A0impairment charge of $6,859 million was recorded in respect of manufacturing, supply and distribution assets. As/uni00A0described in Note 2, forecast refining margins are a/uni00A0key/uni00A0input to:\n\n- \u25a0 estimating the recoverable amount of refining assets; and\n- \u25a0 assessing whether or not there are indicators that refining assets might be impaired;\n- \u25a0 whether or not there is a need for D&R provisions.\n\nAuditing future refining margins is inherently complex as the margins are influenced by regional factors and there is limited external refining margin forecast data available. In prior years, Shell's estimation of long-term refining margins focused on the concept of reversion to mean, as opposed to attempting to forecast refining cycles. The previous approach was, by nature, backward looking and assumed that the refining margin will revert to the mean over time, unless a fundamental shift in markets had been identified.\n\nShell viewed the expected increase in supply of refined products with new refineries being constructed, as well as the ongoing impact of energy transition on the demand side as a fundamental shift in markets. Consequently, Shell revised its approach to estimating refining margins. The revised estimation process represented a significant shift in terms of margin methodology, reflecting energy market demand and supply fundamentals, including the energy transition, as well as the shorter-term impacts of the pandemic.\n\nThe approach incorporates long-run demand forecasts, including the impacts of the energy transition, and supply dynamics, including the speed of the industry's response to changing demand through either constructing new refineries or closing older refineries.\n\nUnder Shell's new estimation methodology, forecast average gross refining margins between 2020 and 2030 have decreased compared to the historic reversion to mean approach. As a result of over-capacity in the market, a significant decrease in refining margins is estimated between 2021 and 2025. As market rationalisation occurs, margins are forecast to recover between 2025 and 2030. The refineries that remain in operation are forecast to generate stronger margins from/uni00A02030.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe reported to the Audit Committee in July 2020 that the more significant assumptions in the new estimation methodology related to demand change, primarily as a result of the energy transition and, on the supply side, non-economic behaviour, such as investment in refineries for strategic rather than economic reasons. The structural shifts in energy markets were likely to result in more volatile future margins, as well as prolonged periods of abnormally high or low margins. This means that in an uncertain future, the risk of operating a refinery would increase and therefore a reversion to mean methodology may no longer be appropriate; this was particularly the case in an environment where the outlook was unstable and refinery owners begin to act in a manner driven by different economic fundamentals.\n\nWe confirmed to the Audit Committee that we involved our oil and gas valuations specialists in assisting us in concluding on the appropriateness of management's revised methodology and reasonableness of their assumptions. We also confirmed that we used external broker reports to support our expectations with respect to future refining margins and assessed whether or not management's projections were consistent with our independent analysis. Based on our benchmarking against these external sources, we satisfied ourselves that Shell's demand forecast assumptions and refining margins were consistent with industry forecasts; however, we noted that Shell's view was at the conservative end of the industry.\n\nShell's revised refining assumptions were conservative compared to other market benchmarks and represented approximately a 30% decrease compared to previous views on refining margins. We benchmarked Shell's key assumptions in estimating future refining margins to external data, where possible, and concluded that the assumptions used were reasonable and supportable, albeit conservative. The company followed a rigorous and robust process to determine the revised assumptions.\n\nThe significant reduction in future margin assumptions represented an impairment indicator (see key audit matter above).\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 150 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed refining margins. Also, see Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the estimation of/uni00A0refining margins. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls over the approval of refining/uni00A0margins.\n\nOur other procedures included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we involved our oil and gas valuations specialists to assess the reasonableness of/uni00A0Shell's refining margin estimation methodology and reasonableness of their assumptions;\n- \u25a0 we read Shell's documentation with respect to their methodology for determining refining margins and held discussions with the Shell individuals responsible for the/uni00A0analysis and design and implementation of Shell's new methodology and the/uni00A0resulting model;\n- \u25a0 we read reports from independent, third-party sources in order to identify potential contrary evidence and to assess the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used in the model. These inputs included refining capacity additions, expected refinery closures, carbon dioxide costs and the strategic and political behaviour of National Oil/uni00A0Companies;\n- \u25a0 we undertook numerical analysis of the indicative refining margins for the three key refining hubs (US Gulf Coast, North West Europe and Singapore) and compared these/uni00A0to market and consultant forecasts;\n\n\u25a0\n\n- \u25a0 we recreated refining margins from Shell's price forecasts and benchmarked these to/uni00A0the refining margins derived from traded futures; and\n\nwe reviewed analysts' views of refining margins for each of the three refining hubs;\n\n- \u25a0 we reperformed management's calculations for taking the forecast margins at the/uni00A0three/uni00A0regional hubs and turning them into localised margin forecasts on a refinery-by-refinery basis.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## THE ESTIMATION OF DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION (D&R) PROVISIONS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is an estimation based on uncertain outcomes. Risk is elevated compared to 2019 due to the rationalisation of Shell's manufacturing portfolio.\n\nAs described in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2020, Shell recognised $23 billion of D&R provisions.\n\nD&R provisions are a highly judgemental area. They are based on a number of estimates and assumptions that are impacted by future activities, economic factors and the legislative environments in which Shell operates.\n\nD&R provisions are also affected by changes in the oil and gas reserve estimates and price assumptions, which determine the date on which production will cease.\n\nThe main judgements in determining the D&R provisions include the appropriateness of the cost, inflation, capital cost outlook escalation rates, estimated asset lives, discount rate, cessation of production (COP), the number of days to decommission an asset and contingency rate assumptions used in the models and the consistency of their application across the portfolio.\n\nIndustry practice has been not to recognise D&R provisions associated with refineries and petrochemicals facilities. This was on the basis that the assets were considered to have indefinite lives and, therefore, that it was considered remote that an outflow of economic benefit would be required. This was driven by the assumption that demand for oil products would continue to grow and there would be a need for more, rather than less, refining capacity; hence it was not expected that existing refineries would be shut down and decommissioned for the foreseeable future.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Shell revised downwards/uni00A0its discount rate for D&R provisions from 3%/uni00A0to/uni00A01.75%. The reduction in the rate was driven by unprecedent macroeconomic conditions due to COVID-19, which resulted in a significant drop in US treasury bond rates. The impact of the change in discount rate was to increase Shell's decommissioning liabilities by $3.6 billion as at June/uni00A030, 2020.\n\nThe procedures we performed included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we considered the increasing expectation that demand for oil products will fall, particularly in developed economies, together with Shell's plans to rationalise their manufacturing portfolio. In so doing, we challenged management's assessment of whether or not the expected useful lives of/uni00A0manufacturing assets remained appropriate. In particular, we challenged management's conclusion that manufacturing assets could no longer be considered to have indefinite lives, and/uni00A0that therefore D&R provisions were required for certain refineries. We also challenged management's assessment of the need for contingent liability disclosure in respect of certain other assets;\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's D&R estimation process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls over the review of the estimation and completeness of costs in accordance with Shell's internal guidelines;\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of the procedures performed by management to estimate the D&R provisions. This included understanding the processes to establish whether or not a legal or/uni00A0constructive obligation existed;\n- \u25a0 we read case studies relating to previously decommissioned sites and compared the cost of those decommissioning activities to management's assumptions;\n- \u25a0 we understood changes in D&R cost estimates, and assessed whether they reflected the latest regulatory requirements and technical developments;\n- we agreed key inputs such as site acreage and distillation capacity to publicly available sources;\n- \u25a0 we assessed changes in assumptions for the anticipated date of decommissioning;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 we evaluated changes in assumptions for labour rates, rig type and rates, number of wells, well durations and any contingency applied;\n- \u25a0 in the case of non-operated assets, we understood and challenged whether management applied their own assumptions to the D&R estimate or used the operator-provided estimates;\n- \u25a0 we challenged the timing of recognition of D&R provisions related to projects in development;\n- \u25a0 we tested the D&R accounting models and assumptions therein, including discount rates, equity/uni00A0percentages and inflation rates. We involved our valuation specialists in testing these assumptions, including the change in Shell's discount rate assumption from 3% to 1.75% during/uni00A0the year;\n- \u25a0 we evaluated contingent liabilities and D&R provisions arising from assets previously disposed of;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the counterparty risk of prior disposals to ascertain the risk of the related D&R provision becoming a liability of Shell; and\n- \u25a0 we ensured key assumptions used were aligned with the assumptions used in other areas of measurement, such as impairment;\n- \u25a0 we reviewed and challenged the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team and our component teams in Australia, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK and the USA.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nIn January 2021, we reported that the Upstream and Integrated Gas D&R provisions recorded as at December 31, 2020 were fairly stated and that changes in D&R provisions during the year, including the application of the revised discount rate and capital cost outlook escalation rates, had been reflected appropriately in the financial statements.\n\n## Upstream and Integrated Gas\n\n## Refineries\n\n- \u25a0 we agreed with management's conclusion that it was no longer appropriate to consider refineries to have indefinite lives and that for manufacturing assets either D&R provisions or contingent liability disclosures were required;\n\nIn January 2021, we confirmed to the Audit Committee that:\n\n- \u25a0 for those provisions recorded, that the amounts recorded fell within a reasonable range and that the provisions were supported by appropriate evidence;\n- \u25a0 we considered Shell's risk-free rate assumption to be reasonable and supported by our analysis, based on data from the US Department of Treasury and Oxford/uni00A0Economics. We also concluded that changes in D&R provisions as a result of the revised discount rate, were reflected appropriately in the financial statements; and\n- \u25a0 estimating refinery useful lives is highly judgemental, particularly when considering time periods of 50 to 100 years. In our view, management had appropriately stratified the refining portfolio and, in doing so, had made reasonable judgements as to which refineries required a provision and which required contingent liability disclosure;\n- \u25a0 we agreed that the disclosure of contingent liabilities was appropriate.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 147 on how the Audit Committee reviewed D&R provisions.

        "page_content": "## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is an estimation based on uncertain outcomes. The realisation of these assets is largely dependent on generating substantial future profits. Risk is elevated compared to 2019 due to the increased uncertainty in forecasting future profits in the current macro-economic environment.\n\nAs described in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2020 Shell recognised gross deferred tax assets (DTAs) totalling $33 billion, which are recognised within two balance sheet line items, DTAs and as an offset against deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), depending on the overall tax position in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nThe recognition of material DTA balances is supported by the/uni00A0unwinding of DTLs and forecast future taxable profits, which are underpinned by Shell's assumptions, including commodity price assumptions and the timing of the unwinding of/uni00A0DTAs.\n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of DTAs is complex because the estimation requires significant judgement, including the timing of reversals of DTLs and the availability of future profits against which tax deductions represented by the DTAs can be offset.\n\nA key judgement applied by management in assessing whether it is appropriate to recognise certain DTAs includes the expectation of probable taxable profits arising beyond Shell's 10-year planning horizon. There is greater uncertainty regarding future taxable profits that exist outside the 10-year planning period.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's processes for the recognition and measurement of DTAs. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls over projected sources of taxable income and the calculations that support the recognition of DTAs.\n\nWe considered the expected timing of utilisation of the DTA, including the relevant country tax laws that apply to the utilisation of tax losses and deductible temporary differences. This included the ability to carry tax losses forward or back and any restrictions arising from ring fencing losses for tax purposes.\n\nWe tested the forecast timing of the unwinding of taxable temporary differences by evaluating the/uni00A0projected sources of taxable income and considering the nature of the temporary differences and the relevant tax law.\n\nFor DTAs that are supported by forecast taxable profits or tax planning strategies, our procedures/uni00A0included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we evaluated the extent to which sufficient probable taxable profits would arise in the period within which the related losses and/or deductible temporary differences would be available for utilisation, considering for example, limits on the length of time that losses can be carried forward, if applicable, or if losses are ring fenced for tax purposes;\n- \u25a0 we performed sensitivity analyses over the commodity price and/or other key assumptions, including the risking of forecast profit, that underpin Shell's assessment of forecast probable taxable profits;\n- \u25a0 we evaluated management's negative stress test to enable us to understand the tolerance of the/uni00A0estimation uncertainty to further risking; and\n- \u25a0 we confirmed that the tax balances were calculated using substantively enacted tax laws and/uni00A0rates.\n\nFor the tax planning strategies necessary to justify the recognition of the relevant DTAs, we involved our tax professionals to evaluate whether the Company's proposed tax planning strategies were achievable.\n\nOur audit procedures over the recognition and valuation of DTAs were performed by our tax specialist teams in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, Qatar, the UK and the USA, which covered 77% of the gross DTA balance. We also performed specified procedures over the recognition and valuation of DTAs in Albania, Austria, China, Egypt,/uni00A0France, Germany, Kazakhstan, Norway, Oman, Philippines, South Africa, Spain,/uni00A0Switzerland, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago and Tunisia, which covered an additional 14%/uni00A0of/uni00A0the gross DTA balance.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nIn January 2021, we reported to the Audit Committee that the majority of the DTAs are either offset against DTLs or are expected to be recovered from forecast profits within the operating planning horizon. In aggregate, these factors supported 97% of the recognised DTAs. The remaining 3% relied on estimated future profits between 2031 and 2040. Whilst the application of risking is judgemental, we satisfied ourselves that management's risking of forecast profit was appropriate to reflect the uncertainty throughout the forecast period.\n\nThe COVID-19 impact on the global economy and on GDP growth, together with the dramatic fall in the oil price and in demand for petroleum products, had increased the level of pressure on the recoverability of DTAs that were supported by estimated future taxable profits. However, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support Shell's recognition of DTAs, although there is a greater degree of judgement required when profits beyond Shell's operating plan planning horizon are necessary to support the asset recognition.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 150 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed certain tax matters, in particular the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION: THE RISK OF UNREALISED TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES BEING RECOGNISED AS A RESULT OF/uni00A0ERRORS, UNAUTHORISED TRADING ACTIVITY OR DELIBERATE MISSTATEMENT OF SHELL'S TRADING POSITIONS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\n## This is a risk of error in revenue due to the complexity of Shell's trading and supply function. Risk is unchanged compared to 2019.\n\nAs described in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2020 Shell recognised $181 billion of revenue. As described in Note 19, Shell recognised derivative financial instrument assets of/uni00A0$9 billion and derivative financial instrument liabilities of $6 billion.\n\nThe recognition of unrealised trading gains and losses is a complex audit area. There is an inherently higher risk of error, of unauthorised trading activity or of deliberate misstatement of the group's overall trading positions.\n\nShell's trading and supply function is integrated within the Oil/uni00A0Products, Chemicals, Integrated Gas and Upstream segments and is spread across multiple regions. The trading and supply function is inherently complex due to, amongst other things, the fact that trading is not always carried out in/uni00A0active markets where prices are readily available. This exposes Shell to risks that are not normally associated with core oil and gas activities. Further, in 2020, trading margins have been under pressure due to the volatility of commodity prices and demand since the start of the pandemic.\n\nAuditing unrealised trading gains and losses is complex because of the significant judgement used in determining the/uni00A0key assumptions used in valuing the trades, the risk of error, of unauthorised trading activity or of deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions.\n\nThe deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions or mismarking of positions could result in understated trading losses, overstated trading profits and/or individual bonuses being manipulated through inappropriate inter-period profit/uni00A0or loss allocations.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the recognition of revenue relating to unrealised trading gains and losses. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls within the front-to-end deal lifecycle across the trading and supply function and controls around the review of valuation models.\n\nOur trading audit professionals comprise individuals who have significant experience of auditing both large commodity trading organisations and financial institutions.\n\nTo audit the existence, completeness and valuation of open positions, we focused specifically on over-the-counter (OTC) physical and financial transactions. Our audit procedures included the following:\n\n## Existence:\n\n- \u25a0 we obtained external confirmations for a sample of open trading positions with brokers and counterparties and, where necessary, we evaluated the existence of the position by agreement to signed contracts.\n\n## Completeness:\n\n- \u25a0 we performed procedures to identify unrecorded liabilities by comparing sales to trade receivables and purchases to trade payables that occurred near the end of the financial year to evaluate whether or not transactions were recorded in the correct period.\n- \u25a0 we performed additional confirmation testing by obtaining confirmations from a sample of counterparties who had open positions in the prior trading year, but no reported trading positions in the current year; and\n\n## Valuation:\n\n- \u25a0 we assessed Shell's valuation methodology against market practice. This included comparing the price curves and volatility assumptions adopted by Shell to external broker quotes, market consensus providers, and our independent assessments;\n- \u25a0 we analysed the key valuation inputs to the valuation models;\n- \u25a0 for a sample of non-complex derivatives (Level 1 and 2), we performed an independent recalculation of their fair value at the end of the year; and\n- \u25a0 we involved EY valuation specialists to assist us in performing independent testing of the valuation models of Level 3 contracts. We evaluated the contract terms and key assumptions against independent market information.\n\nThe other audit procedures we performed included:\n\n- \u25a0 we assessed the design of key controls and performed independent testing of key trading controls throughout the financial year;\n- \u25a0 we enquired of management whether or not there were any breakdowns of trading controls or instances of rogue trading reported or known or suspected frauds;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the relevant accounting policies against IFRS and considered their appropriateness under current market conditions; and\n- \u25a0 we evaluated the appropriateness of presentation on both the income statement and balance sheet based on the standards required by IFRS.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team and the UK and US component teams.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 the valuation of derivative contracts as at December 31, 2020 was appropriate;\n\nIn March 2021, we reported to the Audit Committee that:\n\n- \u25a0 our testing satisfied us that the models used to value contracts were appropriate for the purposes of the valuations included in Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 our completeness testing did not identify any unrecorded liabilities or significant cut-off issues; and\n- \u25a0 the unrealised gains and losses had been recorded appropriately;\n- \u25a0 our testing did not identify any indications of unauthorised trading activity or deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 147 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed the Trading and Supply's control framework.

This key audit matter relates to the/uni00A0Parent Company only. Risk is unchanged compared to 2019.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc has $19.2 billion of distributable/uni00A0profits at December 31, 2020. In 2020,/uni00A0Shell distributed $7.3 billion of dividends and/uni00A0repurchased/uni00A0$1.2 billion of shares.\n\nThere is considerable public interest in ensuring that companies pay dividends and buy back shares out of profits available for distribution. Although Shell has reduced quarterly dividends and the share buyback programme was/uni00A0paused during 2020, shareholders' returns are a fundamental part of Shell's financial framework and it remains a major dividend-paying company. Given the uncertainty surrounding a prolonged period of economic crisis, volatility, weaker commodity prices and demand outlook, this remains a key matter of interest to stakeholders.\n\nThe legal framework applicable to UK companies for determining profits available for distribution is contained in both the Companies Act 2006 and complementary technical guidance. Under this framework, distributions are made by/uni00A0individual companies and not by groups. The Shell Consolidated Financial Statements are therefore not relevant for the purpose of determining Shell's profits available for distribution. Whether or not a distribution may be made by Shell is determined by reference to Shell's 'relevant accounts', which are the Parent Company financial statements.\n\nThe procedures we performed included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we tested management's distributable reserve controls at both the Parent Company and subsidiary entities that pay significant dividends, which are designed to ensure that there are sufficient profits available for distribution prior to a dividend being proposed and approved. Our/uni00A0testing included a review of management's analysis of non-distributable profits or losses. We/uni00A0also assessed the completeness of the non-distributable profits or losses identified;\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of the procedures performed by management to monitor the/uni00A0profits available for distribution of the Parent Company. This included understanding the processes to monitor profits available for distribution of the subsidiary entities paying significant dividends to the Parent Company;\n- \u25a0 we analysed transactions that impacted significantly the retained earnings of the Parent Company and subsidiary entities paying significant dividends and considered whether any of/uni00A0these transactions do not meet the criteria of distributable profits or losses. We considered whether operating and financial circumstances existed that could result in a dividend block within/uni00A0the group structure;\n- \u25a0 we confirmed that, as at December 31, 2020, the Parent Company had a merger reserve of/uni00A0$234 billion and that, in the event that the investment in Shell Petroleum N.V. held by RDS plc were to be impaired (see the key audit matter below), this would have no impact on Shell's distributable profits. We confirmed further that this is because, under the Companies Act 2006, any such impairments would first be charged to the income statement and then transferred to the/uni00A0merger reserve, as opposed to impacting distributable reserves; and\n- \u25a0 we reviewed management's analysis of profits available for distribution in the Parent Company and compared this to the expected future distributions. We also reperformed the calculation of distributable profits available for distribution of the Parent Company by reference to the relevant accounts;\n- \u25a0 we satisfied ourselves that distributions made in 2020 were allowable, by reference to the most/uni00A0recent relevant accounts, for the purposes of making distributions under the Companies Act/uni00A02006.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team and the UK component team.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 the procedures performed by management to monitor the profits available for distribution of the Parent Company and subsidiary entities paying significant dividends to the Parent Company were appropriate;\n\nIn March 2021, we reported to the Audit Committee that:\n\n- \u25a0 the analysis performed by management to identify non-distributable profits or losses and expected future commitments or operating and financial circumstances that could result in a dividend block is appropriate; and\n- \u25a0 we were satisfied that the profits available for distribution, by reference to the relevant accounts, were sufficient to support the distributions made by the Parent Company.\n\nCross-reference: See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 8 to the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PARENT COMPANY\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is a forecast-based valuation. The risk is elevated compared to 2019 due to the impact of the pandemic on the Global economy and on Shell's profitability. This key audit matter relates to the Parent Company/uni00A0only.\n\nAs described in Note 4 to the Parent Company Financial Statements, at December 31, 2020, RDS plc/uni00A0held investments in subsidiaries of $257 billion, mainly related to its investment in Shell Petroleum N.V. (SPNV).\n\nThe weak macro-economic environment and the impact of/uni00A0the pandemic have led to a shortfall of the market capitalisation of the group versus the carrying value of the investment held in SPNV of around of $100 billion at year end. This is an indicator of impairment and management have tested SPNV for impairment as a result.\n\nSPNV holds directly and indirectly the entire Shell group. Therefore, both the operational performance of the group's assets and external factors have a significant impact on the estimate of the recoverable amount of SPNV.\n\nAccounting standards require the recoverable amount to be determined at the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use (VIU). Management have estimated the recoverable amount of SPNV on the basis of an aggregation of the VIU of the group's CGUs discounted at a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 6%.\n\nThe most significant judgement applied in determining the VIU of SPNV is the projection of cashflows form Shell's business plan. A further significant judgement applied is in/uni00A0the risking of the projected cashflows. In order to assess how sensitive the VIU is to fluctuations in assumptions, management performed a reverse stress test to determine the/uni00A0level at which an impairment would be recorded.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 we were satisfied that the overall VIU methodology was appropriately applied by management and was consistent with the impairment assessments performed at an asset level and provided a reasonable basis for estimating the VIU of SPNV;\n\nIn March 2021, we reported to the Audit Committee that:\n\n- \u25a0 we did not identify any contrary evidence from the goodwill and asset impairment tests performed by management during the year and we were satisfied that the conclusions reached in those impairment tests did not contradict the results of management's SPNV impairment assessment;\n- \u25a0 based on our analysis, we determined a reasonable range for the recoverable amount of SPNV and confirmed that the carrying value of the investment lies within our range; and\n- \u25a0 the VIU of SPNV was higher than its fair value and that, therefore, it was appropriate to estimate the recoverable amount of SPNV at its VIU;\n- \u25a0 we were satisfied that, whilst the recoverable amount has decreased significantly in 2020, no impairment was required.\n\nCross-reference: See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 4 to the Parent Company Financial Statements.\n\nWe tested the controls over the management approval of key inputs, metrics and adjustments made to Shell's Operating Plan which supports the recoverable value of the investment, including oil and gas prices, oil and gas reserves and future refining margins.\n\nIn order to evaluate the cash flow inputs of the impairment model, we gained an understanding of the methodology behind the model and verified its mathematical accuracy and completeness.\n\nWe assessed the conclusions reached in the asset impairment tests performed during the year and Shell's impairment assessment of the goodwill allocated at the Upstream and IG segment level and whether any contrary evidence existed from those tests that would call into question the validity of mangement's SPNV VIU methodology.\n\nWe challenged the appropriateness of the extent to which the cashflows had been risked and/uni00A0considered the sensitivity of the impairment assessment to further risking. We reviewed management's reverse stress test, which adjusted the extent to which cashflows were risked until the headroom was removed entirely; we also evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence to assess whether this level of risking of the cashflows was within a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\nWe engaged our EY valuations specialists to assist in the review and challenge of the appropriateness of the VIU approach applied by management. Our specialists applied alternative approaches to calculate the VIU of SPNV at December 31, 2020. We also carried out sensitivity analyses by applying further adjustments and risking and determined a reasonable range for the recoverable amount of SPNV. We considered whether the outcome of these analyses supported the carrying value of SPNV.\n\nOur valuation specialists also estimated the fair value of SPNV at December 31, 2020 on the basis of data observed in historic market transactions. This confirmed that the VIU of SPNV was higher than its fair value and that, therefore, it was appropriate to estimate the recoverable amount of SPNV at its VIU.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed by the group engagement team and local audit teams through a combination of substantive and control procedures.",

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS\n\nAs explained more fully in the statement of Directors' responsibilities set out on page 22, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free/uni00A0from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing Shell's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as going concerns,/uni00A0disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend/uni00A0to liquidate Shell or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or/uni00A0have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a/uni00A0guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can/uni00A0arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or/uni00A0in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the/uni00A0economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial/uni00A0statements.\n\n## 11. EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT OUR AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud.\n\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n## Our approach was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 We understood how Shell is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for/uni00A0legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We/uni00A0corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received/uni00A0from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.\n- \u25a0 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to Shell and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, Companies Act/uni00A02006, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which Shell operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations relating to health and/uni00A0safety, employee matters, environmental and bribery and/uni00A0corruption practices.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the susceptibility of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by embedding forensic specialists into our group engagement team. Our forensic specialists worked with the group engagement team to identify the fraud risks across various parts of the business. In addition, we utilised internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment for each of the countries of operation. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated data analytics across manual journal entries into our audit approach. We also considered the possibility of fraudulent or corrupt payments made through third parties and conducted detailed analytical testing on third party vendors in high risk jurisdictions. Where instances of risk behaviour patterns were identified through our data analytics, we performed additional audit procedures to address each identified risk. These procedures included the testing of transactions back to source information and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. We also conducted specific audit procedures in relation to the risk of/uni00A0bribery and corruption across various countries of operation determined on a risk-based approach.",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 Based on the results of our risk assessment we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified above. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a/uni00A0focus on journals meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit and all full and specific scope management; review of the volume and nature of complaints received/uni00A0by the whistleblowing hotline during the year; and\n- \u25a0 If any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were identified, these were communicated to the relevant local EY teams/uni00A0who performed sufficient and appropriate audit procedures, supplemented by audit procedures performed at the group level.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https:// www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part/uni00A0of our auditor's report.\n\n## 12. OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were re-appointed by Royal Dutch Shell plc's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May/uni00A019,/uni00A02020, as auditors of Royal Dutch Shell to hold office until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, and signed an engagement letter/uni00A0on July 16, 2020. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is five years covering periods from our appointment through to the period ending/uni00A0December 31, 2020.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to Shell or the Parent Company and we remain independent of Shell/uni00A0and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\nOur audit opinion is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee explaining the results of our audit.\n\n## 13. USE OF OUR REPORT\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the company's members as a body for our audit work for this report or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## /s/ Allister Wilson (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\n## ALLISTER WILSON\n\nSenior Statutory Auditor for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP London March 10, 2021\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1 - BASIS/uni00A0OF/uni00A0PREPARATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Royal Dutch Shell plc (the 'Company') and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'Shell') have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act'), and therefore in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. As applied to Shell, there are no material differences from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by/uni00A0the/uni00A0IASB.\n\nAs described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods, except for the accounting for lease contracts following the prospective adoption of IFRS 16 Leases from January 1, 2019./uni00A0\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were approved and authorised for/uni00A0issue by the Board of Directors on March 10, 2021.\n\n## 2/uni00A0- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS/uni00A0AND ESTIMATES\n\nThis Note describes Shell's significant accounting policies, which are those relevant to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. It/uni00A0includes the measurement bases used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. It allows an understanding as to how transactions, other events and conditions are reported. It also describes: (a) judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management makes in applying the policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (b) estimations, including assumptions about the future, that management makes in applying the policies. The sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of/uni00A0assets and liabilities within the next financial year are specifically identified as a significant estimate.\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the adoption as from January 1, 2020 of amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and IFRS 7 Financial/uni00A0Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), and IFRS 3 Business Combinations (IFRS/uni00A03).\n\nThe transition to the accounting pronouncements as listed below has no/uni00A0or/uni00A0no material impact.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures/uni00A0 Inter-Bank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform - Phase 1\n\nIFRS 9 and IFRS 7 contain a temporary targeted exception from applying specific hedge accounting requirements pre-IBOR reform.\n\nBy applying the exception, Shell anticipates that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged risk is based is not altered as a result of/uni00A0the IBOR reform. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be/uni00A0recorded in the income statement. The exception ceases to apply when/uni00A0the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no/uni00A0longer present.\n\n## IFRS 3 Business Combinations/uni00A0\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 3 resolves the difficulties that arose when an entity/uni00A0determined whether it acquired a business or a group of assets. Under the amended definition of a business, an acquisition qualifies as a business combination when the assets and liabilities acquired include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The amended definition of a business is applied prospectively.\n\n## Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars (dollars) and comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entities. Information about subsidiaries at December 31, 2020, can be found in 'Appendix 1: Significant Subsidiaries and Other Related Undertakings'.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control ceases, using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interest represents the proportion of income, other comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the Company's shareholders.\n\n## Climate change and energy transition\n\nMeeting the goals of the Paris Agreement is a global and Shell target. Shell's pathway to Paris alignment is reflected in the Group's strategy and in 2020 we announced a long-term target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\nIt is important to note that the world needs to transform in a number of complex and interconnected ways. While the world has made some movement towards the goals of Paris, unfortunately, society is not yet on a/uni00A0path to meet Paris. Getting the energy system on a path to net-zero emissions will require coordinated action between energy providers, energy users and governments.\n\nOne of the key aspects that underpin Shell's financial statements are the oil and gas price and refining margin assumptions. These price assumptions are developed with input from our scenarios and other factors. The mid-price is our reasonable best estimate and the basis for our operating plans, outlooks and impairment testing.\n\nShell's operating plan and outlook (including portfolio changes) are forecasted for a 10-year period and include significant actions to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its journey towards its net-zero emissions target by 2050 as outlined in this report. However, our plan and pricing assumptions do not yet reflect Shell's 2050 net-zero emissions target, because our planning timeframe is 10 years and there is significant uncertainty on how society will transition to net-zero emissions. Instead these reflect the current economic environment, the pace of the world's energy transition and Shell's reasonable expectation of how the next 10 years will evolve. As society moves towards net-zero emissions, Shell expects its operating plan, outlook and assumptions to be revised accordingly.\n\nLong term, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making on the future portfolio is guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards the goal of the Paris Agreement. Shell has set out its strategy of how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nt\n\ns",

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at quarter-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (including those in respect of inter-company balances, unless related to loans of a long-term investment nature) are recognised in income unless when recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow or net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses in income are presented within interest and other income or within purchases where not related to financing. Share capital issued in currencies other than the dollar is translated at the exchange rate at the date of issue.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of non-dollar entities are translated to dollars at year-end rates of exchange, while their statements of income, other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at quarterly average rates. The resulting translation differences are recognised as currency translation differences within other comprehensive income. Upon sale of all or part of an interest in, or upon liquidation of, an entity, the appropriate portion of cumulative currency translation differences related/uni00A0to that entity is generally recognised in income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from sales of oil, natural gas, chemicals and other products is recognised at the transaction price to which Shell expects to be entitled, after deducting sales taxes, excise duties and similar levies. For contracts that contain separate performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to those separate performance obligations by reference to their/uni00A0relative stand-alone selling prices.\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the customer. For sales by Integrated Gas and Upstream operations, this generally occurs when the product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism; for sales by refining operations, it is either when the product is placed onboard a vessel or offloaded from the vessel, depending on the contractually agreed terms; and for sales of oil products and chemicals, it is either at the point of delivery or the point of receipt, depending on contractual conditions.\n\nRevenue resulting from hydrocarbon production from properties in which Shell has an interest with partners in joint arrangements is recognised on the basis of Shell's volumes lifted and sold. Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) is recognised for those amounts relating to Shell's cost recoveries and Shell's share of the remaining production. Gains and losses on derivative contracts and the revenue and costs associated with other contracts that are classified as held primarily for the purpose of being traded are reported on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of hydrocarbons under exchange contracts that are necessary to obtain or reposition feedstocks for refinery operations are presented net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nRevenue resulting from arrangements that are not considered contracts with customers is presented as revenue from other sources.\n\n## Research and development\n\nDevelopment costs that are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised as intangible assets. All other research and development expenditure is recognised in income as incurred.\n\n## Exploration costs/uni00A0\n\nHydrocarbon exploration costs are accounted for under the successful efforts method: exploration costs are recognised in income when incurred, except that exploratory drilling costs, including in respect of the recapitalisation of the depreciation, are included in property, plant and equipment pending determination of proved reserves. Exploration costs capitalised in respect of exploration wells that are more than 12 months old are written off unless: (a)/uni00A0proved reserves are booked; or (b)/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0they have found commercially producible quantities of reserves and (ii)/uni00A0they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the/uni00A0assessing of reserves and the economic and operating viability of the/uni00A0project.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment comprise assets owned by Shell, assets held by Shell under lease contracts, and assets operated by Shell as contractor in PSCs. They include rights and concessions in respect of properties with proved reserves ('proved properties') and with no proved reserves ('unproved properties'). Property, plant and equipment, including expenditure on major inspections, and intangible assets are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost where it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits. This includes capitalisation of decommissioning and restoration costs associated with provisions for asset retirement (see 'provisions'), certain development costs (see 'research and development') and the effects of associated cash flow hedges (see 'financial instruments') as applicable. The accounting for exploration costs is described separately (see 'exploration costs'). Intangible assets include goodwill, liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-take and sales contracts obtained through acquisition, emission certificates, software costs and trademarks. Interest is capitalised as an increase in property, plant and equipment, on major capital projects during construction.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortisation (including any impairment). Gains and losses on sale are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amounts of assets sold and are/uni00A0recognised in income, within interest and other income.\n\nAn asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, which is when the sale is highly probable, and it is available for immediate sale. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount upon classification and the fair value less costs to sell.",

        "page_content": "## Depreciation, depletion and amortisation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment related to hydrocarbon production activities are in principle depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the proved developed reserves of the field concerned, other than assets whose useful lives differ from the lifetime of the field which are depreciated applying the straight-line method. However, for certain Integrated Gas and Upstream assets, the use for this purpose of proved developed reserves, which are determined using the SEC-mandated yearly average oil and gas prices, would result in depreciation charges for these assets which do not reflect the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed as, for example, it may result in assets with long-term expected lives being depreciated in full within one year. Therefore, in these instances, other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base for the purpose of calculating depreciation, such as using management's expectations of future oil and gas prices rather than yearly average prices, to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that more appropriately reflects the expected utilisation of the/uni00A0assets concerned. (See Note 8)\n\nRights and concessions in respect of proved properties are depleted on the unit-of-production basis over the total proved reserves of the relevant area. Where individually insignificant, unproved properties may be grouped and depreciated based on factors such as the average concession term and past experience of recognising proved reserves.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment held under lease contracts and capitalised LNG off-take and sales contracts are depreciated or amortised over the term of the respective contract. Other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, except for goodwill, which is not amortised. They include refineries and chemical plants (for which the useful life is generally 20 years), retail service stations (15 years), upgraders (30 years) and major inspection costs, which are depreciated over the estimated period before the next planned major inspection (three/uni00A0to five years).\n\nOn classification of an asset as held for sale, depreciation ceases.\n\nEstimates of the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed annually and adjusted if/uni00A0appropriate.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually; in addition, assets other than unproved properties (see 'exploration costs') are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable. On classification as held for sale, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are also reviewed. If/uni00A0assets are determined to be impaired, the carrying amounts of those assets are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of/uni00A0fair value less costs of disposal (see 'fair value measurements') and value in use.\n\nValue in use is determined as the amount of estimated risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash-generating units based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows. Estimates of future cash flows used in the evaluation of impairment of assets are made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs/uni00A0associated with operational GHG emissions, mainly related to CO/uni2082,\n\nand forecast product and refining margins. In addition, management takes into consideration the expected useful lives of the manufacturing facilities, exploration and production assets, and expected production volumes. The latter takes into account assessments of field and reservoir performance and includes expectations about both proved reserves and volumes that are expected to constitute proved reserves in the future (unproved volumes), which are risk-weighted utilising geological, production, recovery and economic projections. Cash flow estimates are risk-adjusted to reflect local conditions as appropriate and discounted at a rate based on Shell's marginal cost of debt./uni00A0\n\nImpairments, except those related to goodwill, are reversed as applicable to the extent that the events or circumstances that triggered the original impairment have changed.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals are reported within depreciation, depletion and amortisation.\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\nUnit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are principally measured based on management's estimates of proved developed oil and gas reserves. Also, exploration drilling costs are capitalised pending the results of further exploration or appraisal activity, which may take several years to complete and before any related proved reserves can be booked.\n\n## Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved reserves are estimated by a central group of reserves experts. The estimated proved reserves are determined by reference to available geological and engineering data and only include volumes for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty. Yearly average oil and gas prices are applied in the determination of proved reserves. Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to regular revision, either upward or downward, based on new information such as from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms, legislation or development plans.\n\nChanges to estimates of proved developed reserves affect prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged and, consequently, the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets. Generally, in the normal course of business the diversity of the asset portfolio will limit the net effect of such revisions. The outcome of, or assessment of plans for, exploration or appraisal activity may result in the related capitalised exploration drilling costs being recognised in income in that period.\n\nJudgement is involved in determining when to use an alternative reserves base in order to appropriately reflect the expected utilisation of the assets concerned (see 'depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\nInformation about the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets and the amounts charged to income, including depreciation, depletion and amortisation and the quantitative impact of the use of/uni00A0an alternative reserves base, is presented in Note 8.\n\nt\n\ns",

In addition, management uses other assumptions such as potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions and expected production volumes appropriate to the local circumstances and environment. These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Changes in assumptions could affect the carrying amounts of assets, and any impairment losses and reversals will affect income. Changes in economic conditions can affect the rate used to discount future cash flow estimates or the risk-adjustment in the future cash flows.\n\n## Impairment\n\nExpected production volumes, which comprise proved reserves and/uni00A0unproved volumes, are used for impairment testing because management believes this to be the most appropriate indicator of expected future cash flows. As discussed in 'Proved oil and gas reserves' above, reserves estimates are inherently imprecise. Furthermore, projections about unproved volumes are based on information that is necessarily less robust than that available for mature/uni00A0reservoirs.\n\nEstimation is involved with respect to the expected life of refineries and chemicals sites, and also including management's view on the future development of refining margins.\n\nThe determination of cash-generating units requires judgement. Changes in this determination could impact the calculation of value in/uni00A0use and therefore the conclusion on the recoverability of assets' carrying amounts when performing an impairment test.\n\nJudgement, which is subject to change as new information becomes available, can be required in determining when an asset is classified as/uni00A0held for sale. A/uni00A0change in that judgement could result in impairment charges affecting income, depending on whether classification requires a write-down of the asset to its fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIn assessing the value in use, the estimated risk adjusted future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects Shell's marginal cost of debt, current market assessments of/uni00A0the time value of money and residual risks (e.g. normal/uni00A0operational and other generic uncertainties). The discount rate/uni00A0applied does not reflect risks/uni00A0for which future cash flow estimates/uni00A0have been adjusted.\n\n## Significant estimates\n\nFuture commodity price assumptions used in the impairment testing in Integrated Gas and Upstream, presented in Note 8, tend to/uni00A0be stable because management does not consider short-term increases or decreases in prices as being indicative of long-term levels,/uni00A0but they are/uni00A0nonetheless subject to change.\n\nUntil 2019 management's estimate of longer-term refining margins used in the impairment testing in Oil Products was based on the reversion to mean methodology, unless a fundamental shift in markets had been identified, over the life of the refineries. Under this approach, it was assumed that refining margins would revert to historical averages over time. As from 2020, a different price methodology applies, based on Shell management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals in the near term and taking into account various other factors such as industry rationalisation and energy transition in/uni00A0the long term.\n\nFuture commodity prices and refining margins used in impairment testing provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in/uni00A0paragraph 125 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS/uni00A01.125).\n\nInformation about the carrying amounts of assets and impairments and/uni00A0their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates are presented in/uni00A0Notes 7 and 8.\n\n## Leases (from January 1, 2019)\n\nA contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for payments to be made to the owners (lessors) is accounted for as a lease. Contracts are assessed to determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of a contract or when the terms and conditions of a contract are significantly changed. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with contractual options to extend or to terminate the lease early, where it is reasonably certain that an extension option will be/uni00A0exercised or a termination option will not be exercised.\n\nAt the commencement of a lease contract, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised, unless the lease term is 12 months or less. The commencement date of a lease is the date on which the underlying asset is made available for use. The lease liability is measured at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The lease liability includes contingent rentals and variable lease payments that depend on an index, rate, or where they are fixed payments in substance. The lease liability is remeasured when the contractual cash flows of variable lease payments change due to a change in an index or rate when the lease term/uni00A0changes following a reassessment.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate is not readily available, the incremental borrowing rate is applied. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\n\nIn general, a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any pre-paid lease/uni00A0payment relating to the specific lease contract. The depreciation on/uni00A0right-of-use assets is recognised in income unless capitalised as exploration drilling cost (see 'exploration cost') or capitalised when the/uni00A0right-of-use asset is used to construct another asset./uni00A0\n\nWhere Shell is the lessor in a lease arrangement at inception, the lease arrangement will be classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. Classification is based on the extent to which the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset lie with the lessor or the/uni00A0lessee.",

        "page_content": "Where Shell, usually in its capacity as operator, has entered into a lease contract on behalf of a joint arrangement, a lease liability is recognised to/uni00A0the extent that Shell has primary responsibility for the lease liability. A/uni00A0finance sub-lease is subsequently recognised if the related right-of-use asset is subleased to the joint arrangement. This is usually the case when the joint arrangement has the right to direct the use and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset./uni00A0\n\n## Impairment of the right-of-use asset\n\nRight-of-use assets are subject to existing impairment requirements as set/uni00A0out in 'property, plant and equipment' (see Note 8).\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\nA lease term includes optional lease periods where it is reasonably certain Shell will exercise the option to extend or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. Determination of the lease term is subject to judgement and has an impact on the measurement of the lease liability and related right-of-use asset. When assessing the lease term at the commencement date, Shell takes into consideration the broader economics of the contract. Reassessment of the lease term is performed upon changes in circumstances that may affect the probability that an option to extend or to terminate the lease will/uni00A0be/uni00A0exercised.\n\nWhere the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in/uni00A0a similar economic environment. Determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires estimation.\n\n## Leases (prior to January 1, 2019)/uni00A0\n\nAgreements under which payments are made to owners in return for the right to use an asset for a period are accounted for as leases. Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are recognised at the commencement of the lease term as finance leases within property, plant and equipment and debt at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Finance lease payments are apportioned between interest expense and repayments of debt. All other leases are classified as operating leases and the cost is recognised in income on a straight-line basis, except where capitalised as/uni00A0exploration drilling costs (see 'exploration costs').\n\n## Joint arrangements and associates/uni00A0\n\nArrangements under which Shell has contractually agreed to share control (see 'Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements' for the definition of control) with another party or parties are joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Investments in entities over which Shell has the right to exercise significant influence but neither control nor joint control are classified as associates. Information about incorporated joint arrangements and associates at December/uni00A031, 2020, can be found in 'Appendix 1: Significant Subsidiaries and Other Related Undertakings'.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Shell share of post-acquisition income\n\nless dividends received and the Shell share of other comprehensive income and other movements in equity, together with any loans of a long-term investment nature. Where necessary, adjustments are made to/uni00A0the financial statements of joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of Shell. In an exchange of assets and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the non-Shell share of any excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred over the pre-exchange carrying amounts is recognised in income. Unrealised gains on other transactions between Shell and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of Shell's interest in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly but may also result in an assessment of whether the asset transferred is impaired.\n\nShell recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly and liabilities incurred jointly with other partners.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost comprises direct purchase costs (including transportation), and associated costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present condition and location, and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for oil, gas and chemicals and by the weighted average cost method for materials.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for current tax is calculated based on the income reported by the Company and its subsidiaries, as adjusted for items that are nontaxable or disallowed and using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is determined, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and on unused tax losses and credits carried forward.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when an asset is realised or a liability is settled. They are not recognised where they arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction (other than in a business combination) that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, or in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the respective temporary difference can be controlled by Shell and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward can/uni00A0be utilised.\n\nIncome tax receivables and payables as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities include provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments.\n\nIncome taxes are recognised in income except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income. Income tax assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a right of offset within fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle such balances on a net basis.\n\nt\n\ns",

In such cases, provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments are measured at the most likely amount or the expected value, whichever method is more appropriate. Generally, uncertain tax treatments are assessed on an individual basis, except where they are expected to be settled collectively. It is assumed that taxing authorities will examine positions taken if they have the right to do so and that they have full knowledge of the relevant information. A/uni00A0change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow and/or in the expected amount to be settled would be recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. This requires the application of judgement as to the ultimate outcome, which can change over time depending on facts and circumstances. Judgements mainly relate to transfer pricing, including inter-company financing, interpretation of PSCs, expenditure deductible for tax purposes and taxation arising on/uni00A0disposal.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to/uni00A0offset the assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the amounts recognised in respect of deferred tax assets as well as in the amounts recognised in income in/uni00A0the period in which the change occurs.\n\nTaxation information, including charges and deferred tax assets and/uni00A0liabilities, is presented in Note 16. Income taxes include taxes at/uni00A0higher rates levied on income from certain Integrated Gas and Upstream activities.\n\n## Retirement benefits/uni00A0\n\nBenefits in the form of retirement pensions and health care and life insurance are provided to certain employees and retirees under defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nObligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which takes into account employees' years of service and, for pensions, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and of a duration consistent with the plan obligations. Where plans are funded, payments are made to independently managed trusts; assets held by those trusts are measured at fair value. Defined benefit plan surpluses are recognised as assets to the extent that they are considered recoverable, which is generally by way/uni00A0of a refund or lower future employer contributions.\n\nThe amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit plans mainly comprise service cost and net interest. Service cost comprises principally the increase in the present value of the obligation for benefits resulting from employee service during the period (current service cost) and also amounts relating to past service and settlements or amendments of plans. Plan amendments are changes to benefits and are generally recognised when all legal and regulatory approvals have been received and the effects have been communicated to members. Net interest is\n\ncalculated using the net defined benefit liability or asset matched against the discount rate yield curve at the beginning of each year for each plan. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset resulting from/uni00A0actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding the amount recognised in income, are recognised in other comprehensive/uni00A0income.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, pension expense represents the amount of/uni00A0employer contributions payable for the period.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates\n\nDefined benefit obligations and plan assets, and the resulting liabilities and assets that are recognised, require significant estimation as these are subject to volatility as (actuarial) assumptions regarding future outcomes and market values change. Substantial judgement is required in determining the actuarial assumptions, which vary for the different plans to reflect local conditions but are determined under a/uni00A0common process in consultation with independent actuaries. The assumptions applied in respect of each plan are reviewed annually and adjusted where necessary to reflect changes in experience and actuarial recommendations.\n\nActuarial assumptions applied in determining defined benefit obligations provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to/uni00A0in/uni00A0IAS 1.125.\n\nInformation about the amounts reported in respect of defined benefit pension plans, assumptions applicable to the principal plans and their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates are presented in Note 17.\n\n## Provisions/uni00A0\n\nProvisions are recognised at the balance sheet date at management's best/uni00A0estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. Non-current amounts are discounted at a rate intended to reflect the time value of money. The carrying amounts of provisions and the discount rate applied are regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts or changes in law, technology or financial markets.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning and restoration costs, which arise principally in connection with hydrocarbon production facilities, oil products manufacturing facilities and pipelines, are measured on the basis of current requirements, technology and price levels; the present value is calculated using amounts discounted over the useful economic life of the assets. The liability is recognised (together with a corresponding amount as part of the related property, plant and equipment) once a legal or constructive obligation arises to dismantle an item of property, plant and/uni00A0equipment and to restore the site on which it is located and when a/uni00A0reasonable estimate can be made. The effects of changes resulting from/uni00A0revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of the provision are reflected on a prospective basis, generally by/uni00A0adjustment to/uni00A0the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment. However, where there is no related asset, or the change reduces the carrying amount to nil, the effect, or the amount in excess of/uni00A0the reduction/uni00A0in the related asset to nil, is recognised in income.\n\nShell reviews its refinery and chemical sites on a regular basis to determine whether any changes in assumptions, including expected life, trigger the need to recognise a provision for decommissioning and restoration.\n\nRedundancy provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated cost and an appropriate timeline, and the employees affected have been notified of the plan's main features.",

        "page_content": "An onerous contract provision is recognised when the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable cost under a/uni00A0contract is/uni00A0the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or/uni00A0penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. Before an onerous provision is recognised Shell first recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.\n\nOther provisions are recognised in income in the period in which an/uni00A0obligation arises and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Provisions are measured based on current legal requirements and existing technology where applicable. Recognition of any joint and several liability is based on management's best estimate of the final pro rata share of the liability. Provisions are determined independently of expected insurance recoveries. Recoveries are recognised when virtually certain of realisation.\n\n## Estimates\n\nEstimates of provisions for future decommissioning and restoration costs are recognised and based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology and price levels. Because actual cash outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of such changes.\n\n## Significant estimate\n\nThe discount rate applied to reflect the time value of money in the carrying amount of provisions requires estimation. The discount rate applied is reviewed regularly and adjusted following changes in market rates.\n\nThe discount rate applied to determine the carrying amount of provisions provides a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to/uni00A0in/uni00A0IAS 1.125.\n\nInformation about decommissioning and restoration provisions and their sensitivity to changes in estimates are presented in Note 18.\n\n## Financial instruments/uni00A0\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets is determined by the contractual cash flows and where applicable the business model for managing the financial assets.\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortised cost, if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. It is initially recognised at fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Subsequently the financial asset is measured using the effective interest method less any impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\n\nAll equity instruments and other debt instruments are recognised at fair value. For equity instruments, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) can be made to designate these as/uni00A0at fair value through other comprehensive income instead of fair value through profit or loss. Dividends received on equity instruments are recognised as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when Shell benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains/uni00A0are recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Investments in securities\n\nInvestments in securities ('securities') comprise equity and debt securities. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Generally, unrealised holding gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained earnings. Debt securities are generally carried at fair value with unrealised holding gains and losses recognised in/uni00A0other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in income.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe expected credit loss model is applied for recognition and measurement of impairments in financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The expected credit loss model is also applied for financial guarantee contracts to which IFRS 9 applies and which are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on/uni00A0the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal/uni00A0to the lifetime expected credit losses. Changes in loss allowances are recognised in profit or loss. For trade receivables, a simplified impairment approach is applied recognising expected lifetime losses/uni00A0from/uni00A0initial recognition.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including offsetting bank overdrafts, short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments that generally have a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, such as instruments held for trading, or Shell has opted to measure them at fair value through profit or loss. Debt and trade payables are recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost except for fixed rate debt subject to fair value hedging which is remeasured for the hedged risk (see/uni00A0below). Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method, and other than interest capitalised, is recognised in income. For financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option, the change in the fair value related to own credit risk is recognised in other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value change is recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative contracts and hedges\n\nDerivative contracts are used in the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, and foreign currency cash balances. Derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract in terms of economic characteristics and risks and the host contract of which/uni00A0is not a financial asset are separated from their host contract and/uni00A0recognised at fair value with the associated gains and losses recognised in/uni00A0income.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/uni00A0 continued\n\n## 2/uni00A0- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS/uni00A0AND ESTIMATES continued\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash are accounted for as financial instruments, with the exception of those contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Shell's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognised in income.\n\nCertain derivative contracts qualify and are designated either: as a fair value hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; or as a cash flow hedge for the change in cash flows to be received or paid relating to a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction; or as a net investment hedge of the change in foreign exchange rates associated with net investments in foreign operations with a different functional currency than/uni00A0Shell's functional currency.\n\nA change in the fair value of a hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recognised in income, together with the consequential adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item. The effective portion of a change in fair value of a derivative contract designated as a/uni00A0cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income until the/uni00A0hedged transaction occurs; any ineffective portion is recognised in income. Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability (reclassified to the balance sheet); a net investment hedge is accounted for similarly to a cash flow hedge. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statements. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement.\n\nThe effective portion of a change due to retranslation at quarter-end exchange rates in the carrying amount of debt and the principal amount of derivative contracts used to hedge net investments in foreign operations is recognised in other comprehensive income until the related investment is sold or liquidated; any ineffective portion is recognised in income.\n\nAll relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are documented, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The effectiveness of hedges is also continually assessed and hedge accounting is discontinued when there is/uni00A0a change in the risk management strategy.\n\nUnless designated as hedging instruments, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items that can be settled net as if the contracts were financial instruments and that do not meet expected own use requirements (typically, forward sale and purchase contracts for commodities in trading operations), and contracts that are or contain written options, are recognised at fair value; associated gains and losses are recognised in/uni00A0income.\n\nDerivatives that are held primarily for the purpose of trading are presented as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nFair value measurements are estimates of the amounts for which assets or/uni00A0liabilities could be transferred at the measurement date, based on the/uni00A0assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use into/uni00A0account.\n\n## Estimates\n\nWhere available, fair value measurements are derived from prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. In the absence of such information, other observable inputs are used to estimate fair value. Inputs derived from external sources are corroborated or otherwise verified, as appropriate. In the absence of publicly available information, fair value is determined using estimation techniques that take into account market perspectives relevant to the asset or liability, in as far as they can reasonably be ascertained, based on predominantly unobservable inputs. For derivative contracts where publicly available information is not available, fair value estimations are generally determined using models and other valuation methods, the key inputs for which include future prices, volatility, price/uni00A0correlation, counterparty credit risk and market liquidity, as appropriate; for other assets and liabilities, fair value estimations are/uni00A0generally based on the net present value of expected future cash/uni00A0flows.\n\n## Share-based compensation plans/uni00A0\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Shell's main equity-settled plans - is estimated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model and is recognised in income from the date of grant over the vesting period with a corresponding increase directly in equity. The model projects and averages the results for a range of potential outcomes for the vesting conditions, the principal assumptions for which are the share price volatility and dividend yields for Shell and four of its main competitors over/uni00A0the last three years and the last 10 years.\n\n## Shares held in trust/uni00A0\n\nShares in the Company, which are held by employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities, are not included in assets but are reflected at/uni00A0cost as a deduction from equity as shares held in trust.\n\n## Acquisitions and sales of interests in a business/uni00A0\n\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed when control is obtained over a business, and when an interest or an additional interest is acquired in a joint operation which is a business, are recognised at their fair value at the date of the acquisition; the amount of the purchase consideration above this value is recognised as goodwill. When control is obtained, any non-controlling interest is recognised as the proportionate share of the identifiable net assets. The acquisition of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and the sale of an interest while retaining control are accounted for as transactions within equity. The difference between the purchase consideration or sale proceeds after tax and the relevant proportion of the non-controlling interest, measured by reference to the carrying amount of the interest's net assets at the date of acquisition or sale, is recognised in retained earnings as a movement in equity attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders.\n\n## Environmental schemes and related environmental plans Emission trading schemes\n\nEmission certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost and classified under intangible assets. In the schemes where a cap is set for emissions, the associated emission certificates granted are recognised at cost, which may be zero. Emission certificates held for trading purposes are recognised at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower, and classified under inventory. An emission liability is recognised under other liabilities when actual emissions occur that give rise to an obligation. To the extent the liability is covered by emission certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these emission certificates held and for the",

Both the emission certificates and the emission liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Biofuels certificates\n\nSelf-generated biofuel certificates are recognised at nil value, as they primarily offset the obligation. Biofuel certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are recognised at cost under intangible assets. A/uni00A0biofuel liability is recognised under other liabilities when the number of biofuel certificates available from own activities is less than required. To the extent covered by biofuel certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these certificates held and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. Biofuel certificates and the biofuel liability are both derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Renewable power schemes\n\nRenewable power certificates acquired for compliance purposes are recognised at cost as an intangible asset. Self-generated renewable power certificates are generally transferred to the customer upon sales of electricity. A renewable power liability is recognised under other liabilities when electricity sales take place that give rise to an obligation to retire renewable power certificates. The associated cost is recognised in 'Purchases' in the income statement. If the obligation relates to power consumed in business operations, it is presented in other liabilities with cost reflected in 'Production and manufacturing expenses'. To the extent covered by renewable power certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these renewable power certificates and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. Renewable power certificates and the renewable power liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Income presentation/uni00A0\n\nPurchases reflect all costs related to the acquisition of inventories and the effects of the changes therein, and include associated costs incurred in conversion into/uni00A0finished or intermediate products. Production and manufacturing expenses are the costs of operating, maintaining and managing production/uni00A0and manufacturing assets. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses include direct and indirect costs of marketing and/uni00A0selling products.\n\n## 3/uni00A0- CHANGES TO IFRS NOT YET ADOPTED Inter-Bank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform - Phase 2\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) were issued in August 2020 that complement those amendments issued in 2019 (IBOR Reform - Phase 1) and focus on the effects of IBOR reform on a company's financial statements that arise when, for example, an IBOR used to calculate interest on a financial asset is replaced with an alternative benchmark rate.\n\nIn Phase 2 the IASB amended requirements relating to: changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; hedge accounting; and disclosures. These amendments apply only to changes required by the IBOR reform to financial instruments and hedging relationships.\n\nThe amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2021 and are to be applied retrospectively. Early application is permitted.\n\nShell's fixed-rate debt hedged to floating rate will be affected by the market-wide replacement of London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by/uni00A0alternative risk-free reference rates, most significantly by reform of dollar LIBOR.\n\nThe majority of Shell's debt-related interest rate and currency swaps were designated in fair value hedge relationships at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe notional amount of hedging instruments designated in hedge relationships affected by the reform, at December/uni00A031, 2020, was $23,010/uni00A0million. Furthermore, Shell has one floating rate note of $500/uni00A0million tied to LIBOR, maturing in 2023, which will be affected.\n\nA Group-wide project is in progress to manage the transition to alternative/uni00A0benchmark rates disclosures.\n\n## UK-adopted international accounting standards\n\nOn December 31, 2020 at 11pm BST, legislation made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 brought into UK law IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the/uni00A0European Union (EU) (previously referred to as 'IFRS as adopted by/uni00A0the EU') to provide continuity. These standards are referred to as UK-adopted international accounting standards .\n\nFor reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, Shell's filing of the Annual Report to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales ('Companies House') and other UK regulatory filings will be prepared in accordance with these UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe IFRS endorsement powers for the UK have been transferred from the European Commission to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n\nThere are currently no material differences between the UK-adopted international accounting standards and IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. But if divergence occurs between the two accounting frameworks this may result in the need to report against both accounting frameworks to meet the UK and Dutch reporting requirements. However, if the EU determines that UK-adopted international accounting standards are equivalent to IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU, any divergence between the two accounting frameworks would have no impact on Shell's future reporting. The EU has not yet accepted the UK-adopted international accounting standards at the time of publishing/uni00A0this Report.\n\nIt is expected that in the short term there will be no material differences between IFRS as issued by the IASB, UK-adopted international accounting standards and IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIFRS 17 was issued in 2017, and is required to be adopted for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The IFRS 17 model combines a current balance sheet measurement of insurance contracts with recognition of profit over the period that services are provided. The general model in the standard requires insurance contract liabilities to be measured using probability-weighted current estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment for risk, and a contractual service margin representing the profit expected from fulfilling the contracts. Effects of changes in the estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment relating to future services are recognised over the period services are provided rather than immediately in profit or loss. Shell is in the process of/uni00A0evaluating the initial impact of this standard.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/uni00A0 continued\n\n## 4/uni00A0- SEGMENT INFORMATION General information/uni00A0\n\nShell is an international energy company engaged in the principal aspects of the oil and gas industry and reports its business through segments. With effect from 2020, Shell's reporting segments consist of Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products, Chemicals and Corporate, reflecting the way Shell reviews and assesses its performance. The Oil Products and Chemicals businesses were previously reported under the Downstream segment. Oil sands mining activities, previously included in the Upstream segment, are reported under Oil Products. Comparative information has been reclassified.\n\nThe Integrated Gas segment manages liquefied natural gas (LNG) activities and the conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products, as well as the New Energies portfolio. It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas and liquids to market. It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, electricity and carbon-emission rights, and also markets and sells LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels./uni00A0\n\nThe Upstream segment explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market./uni00A0\n\nThe Oil Products segment comprises the Refining and Trading, and Marketing classes of business. The Refining and Trading class of business turns crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products which are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. With effect from 2020, this class of business includes the oil sands mining activities which were previously reported under the\n\nUpstream segment. The Marketing class of business includes the Retail, Lubricants, Business-to-Business (B2B), Pipelines and Biofuels businesses./uni00A0\n\nThe Chemicals segment operates manufacturing plants and its own marketing network.\n\nThe Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting Shell, comprising Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, its selfinsurance activities and its headquarters and central functions.\n\n## Basis of Segmental Reporting\n\nSales between segments are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially available prices. Third-party revenue and non-current assets information by geographical area are based on the country of operation of the Group subsidiaries that report this information. Separate disclosure is provided for the UK as this is the Company's country of domicile.\n\nSegment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings).

        "page_content": "Impairment losses in 2020 were mainly triggered by Shell's revision of the mid- and long-term commodity price and refining margin outlook reflecting the/uni00A0expected effects of the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic as well as energy market demand and supply fundamentals. The/uni00A0impairment losses for exploration and production assets related primarily to Integrated Gas ($11,539 million), including the Queensland Curtis LNG and Prelude floating LNG operations, and Upstream ($8,629 million), including assets in the Gulf of Mexico, unconventional assets in North America, offshore assets in Brazil and Europe and a project in Nigeria (OPL 245). The impairment losses for manufacturing, supply and distribution related primarily to Oil Products ($6,493 million), including assets in Europe and the shutdown of the Convent refinery in the USA.\n\nImpairment losses in 2019 were mainly triggered by the revision to Shell's long-term oil and gas price outlook and change to future capital expenditure plans. The impairment losses related primarily to Upstream shale and deep-water properties in North and South America, in Integrated Gas to properties in Australia and in Oil Products to the refining portfolio. Impairment losses in 2018 were mainly in Upstream, and principally related to the disposal of Shell's interests in Norway and Ireland and related to assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Impairment reversals in 2018 were mainly related to assets in North America.\n\nFor impairment testing purposes, the respective carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were compared with their value in use. Cash flow projections used in the determination of value in use were made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions, product margins including forecast refining margins and expected production volumes (see Note 2). These cash flows were adjusted for the risks specific to the assets, and therefore these risks were not included in the determination of the discount rate applied. The nominal pre-tax rate applied in 2020 was/uni00A06% (2019:/uni00A06%;/uni00A02018:/uni00A06%).\n\nOil and gas price assumptions applied for impairment testing are reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted on a periodic basis. Reviews include comparison with available market data and forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, policy measures and, in supply, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply, and behaviour of major resource holders./uni00A0The near-term commodity price assumptions applied in impairment testing in/uni00A02020/uni00A0were as follows:/uni00A0\n\n## Commodity price assumptions [A]\n\n|                                 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |   2024 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent crude oil ($/b)           |   40   |   50   |  60    |  63    |\n| Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu) |    2.5 |    2.5 |   2.75 |   3.03 |\n\n[A] Money of the day.\n\nFor periods after 2024, the real-terms long-term price assumptions applied were $60 per barrel (/b) (2019: $60/b)for Brent crude oil and $3.00/uni00A0per/uni00A0million British thermal units (/MMBtu) (2019: $3.00/MMBtu) for Henry Hub natural gas, both at real-terms 2020.\n\nUntil 2019 management's estimate of longer-term refining margins in Oil Products was based on the reversion to mean methodology, unless a fundamental shift in markets had been identified, over the life of the refineries. Under this approach, it was assumed that refining margins will revert to/uni00A0historical averages over time. As from 2020, a different price methodology has been applied, based on management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals in the near term and taking into account various other factors such as industry rationalisation and/uni00A0energy transition in the long term. This resulted in a downward revision of average long-term refining margins by around 30% from previous assumptions applied.\n\nSome 53% of the Group's combined 'Property, plant and equipment', 'Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates' and 'Intangible assets' were tested for impairment in 2020. Of the assets tested, some 56% were subject to either partial or full impairments. At December 31, 2020, the recoverable amounts principally determined through value in use of assets subject to impairment were $17.2 billion for Integrated Gas, $39.1 billion for Upstream and/uni00A0$1.8 billion for Oil Products respectively.\n\nThe main sensitivities in relation to impairment are the commodity price assumptions in Integrated Gas and Upstream and refining margins in Oil Products. A change of -10% or +10% of the commodity price assumptions would ceteris paribus result in some $6.0-$8.0 billion impairment or of some $6.0-$9.0 billion impairment reversal respectively in Integrated Gas and Upstream. A change of -10% or +10% in long-term refining margins would ceteris paribus result in some $1.5-$2.5 billion impairment or some $1.7-$2.7 billion impairment reversal respectively in Oil Products.\n\n## Capitalised exploration drilling costs\n\n|                                                                           | 2020    | 2019    | $ million 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|\n| At January 1                                                              | 5,668   | 6,629   | 6,981            |\n| Additions pending determination of proved reserves                        | 1,016   | 2,036   | 2,588            |\n| Amounts charged to expense                                                | (815)   | (1,218) | (449)            |\n| Reclassifications to productive wells on determination of proved reserves | (1,385) | (1,655) | (2,461)          |\n| Other movements [A]                                                       | (830)   | (124)   | (30)             |\n| At December 31                                                            | 3,654   | 5,668   | 6,629            |\n\nt\n\ns",

The provision matrix is initially based on Shell's historical observed default rates. Shell calculates the ECL to adjust the historical credit loss experienced with forward-looking information. The ECL at December 31, 2020 is $112 million (2019: $83 million), which represents 0.27%-0.51% (2019: 0.08%-0.27%) of all trade receivables. The increase compared with/uni00A0prior year is mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses - trade receivables\n\nA loss allowance provision of $349/uni00A0million (2019: $193/uni00A0million) was established, in addition to all other impairments to trade receivables as at December/uni00A031, 2020, that are outside of the provision matrix calculations.\n\n## Lease receivables/uni00A0\n\nLease contracts where Shell is the lessor are classified as finance leases or operating leases. Receivables for lease contracts classified as finance leases are as follows: /uni00A0\n\n|                                              | Dec 31, 2020   | $ million Dec 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Less than one year                           | 262            | 305                      |\n| Between 1 and 5 years                        | 859            | 953                      |\n| 5 years and later                            | 852            | 1,019                    |\n| Total undiscounted lease payments receivable | 1,973          | 2,277                    |\n| Unearned finance income                      | 407            | 536                      |\n| Net investment in leases                     | 1,566          | 1, 741                   |\n\nIn addition at December 31, 2020, Shell is entitled to contractual payments under operating leases of/uni00A0$248 million (2019: $344/uni00A0million).\n\n## 12/uni00A0- INVENTORIES\n\n|                           | Dec 31, 2020   | $ million Dec 31, 2019   |\n|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Oil, gas and chemicals    | 16,949         | 21,653 [A]               |\n| Other including materials | 2,508          | 2,418 [A]                |\n| Total                     | 19,457         | 24,071                   |\n\nInventories at December 31, 2020, include write-downs to net realisable value of $239 million (2019: $546 million).\n\n## 13/uni00A0- CASH/uni00A0AND/uni00A0CASH/uni00A0EQUIVALENTS\n\n|                                                              | Dec 31, 2020   | $ million Dec 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Cash                                                         | 4,831          | 4,168                    |\n| Short-term bank deposits                                     | 2,220          | 2,665                    |\n| Money market funds, reverse repos and other cash equivalents | 24,779         | 11,222                   |\n| Total                                                        | 31,830         | 18,055                   |\n\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, were amounts totalling $65 million (2019: $431 million) subject to currency controls or other legal restrictions.

In 2020, debt issued under this programme amounted to $6,734/uni00A0million (2019: $3,322/uni00A0million).\n\nThe US shelf registration provides Shell with the flexibility to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants. The registration is updated every three years. The US shelf registration expired in December 2020. Concurrent with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 20-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 11, 2021, a new US shelf registration statement will be filed with the SEC and be effective upon filing. During 2020, debt totalling $6,250/uni00A0million (2019: $4,000/uni00A0million) was issued under the registration.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, Shell entered into $10/uni00A0billion revolving credit facilities, which in anticipation of the LIBOR reform (see Notes 2 and 3), were linked to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Under the terms of the facilities, the LIBOR interest rate was replaced by SOFR on the first anniversary of the signing date of these revolving credit facilities. The committed credit facilities are available at pre-agreed margins, with $2/uni00A0billion expiring in 2021 and $8/uni00A0billion expiring in 2025. Each facility includes a remaining one-year extension option at the discretion of each lender. The terms and availability are not conditional on Shell's financial ratios nor its financial credit ratings. The interest and fees paid on both facilities are linked to Shell's progress towards reaching its short-term Net Carbon Footprint intensity target. In April 2020, Shell entered into a dual currency $7,200/uni00A0million and \u20ac4,432/uni00A0million revolving credit facility expiring in April 2021, with two 6 month extension options at the discretion of Shell. The extension options have not been exercised, and the facility will expire in April 2021.\n\nIn addition, other subsidiaries have access to undrawn short-term bank facilities totalling $3,115 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $2,784 million).\n\nThe following tables compare contractual cash flows for debt excluding lease liabilities at December/uni00A031 with the carrying amount in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contractual amounts reflect the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates; differences from carrying amounts reflect the effects of discounting, premiums and, where fair value hedge accounting is applied, fair value adjustments. Interest is estimated assuming interest rates applicable to variable rate debt remain constant and there is no change in aggregate principal amounts of debt other than repayment at scheduled maturity, as reflected in the table.\n\n## 2020\n\n$ million\n\n|                            | Contractual payments     | Contractual payments    | Contractual payments   | Contractual payments    | Contractual payments    | Contractual payments   | Contractual payments   | Contractual payments                     | Contractual payments   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                            | Less/uni00A0than  1 year | Between  1 and 2  years | Between  2 and 3 years | Between  3 and 4  years | Between  4 and 5  years | 5 years                |                        | Difference  from/uni00A0carrying  amount | Carrying  amount       |\n|                            |                          |                         |                        |                         |                         | and later              | Total                  |                                          |                        |\n| Commercial paper           | 6,746                    | -                       | -                      | -                       | -                       | -                      | 6,746                  | (15)                                     | 6,731                  |\n| Bonds                      | 5,080                    | 4,720                   | 5,408                  | 4,633                   | 8,043                   | 41,853                 | 69,737                 | 1,308                                    | 71,045                 |\n| Bank and other borrowings  | 944                      | 162                     | 33                     | 215                     | 47                      | 417 42,270             | 1,818                  | -                                        | 1,818                  |\n| Total (excluding interest) | 12,770                   | 4,882                   | 5,441                  | 4,848                   | 8,090                   |                        | 78,301                 | 1,293                                    | 79,594                 |\n| Interest                   | 1,834                    | 1,707                   | 1,630                  | 1,527                   | 1,412                   | 15,985                 | 24,095                 |                                          |                        |",

The overall deferred tax position in a particular tax jurisdiction determines if a deferred tax balance related to/uni00A0that jurisdiction is presented within deferred tax assets or deferred tax/uni00A0liabilities.\n\nOther movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities principally relate to/uni00A0acquisitions, sales of non-current assets and businesses, and amounts recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe deferred tax category 'Other' primarily includes deferred tax positions in respect of leases, financial assets and liabilities, inventories, intangible assets and investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\nDeferred tax assets of $16,311 million (2019: $10,524 million) are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to be recovered, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets. It is considered probable based on business forecasts that such taxable profits will be available. For Oil Products additional judgement is required; in some European jurisdictions the assessment of forecasted taxable profits resulting in deferred tax asset recognition of $778 million (2019: $1,194 million) extends for an additional 10 years beyond Shell's regular 10 years planning horizon. In those situations, additional risking has been applied to the forecast of taxable profits.\n\n## 17 - RETIREMENT/uni00A0BENEFITS\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets which are dependent on future taxable profits not arising from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, and which relate to tax jurisdictions where Shell has suffered a loss in the current or preceding year, was $12,759 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $8,773 million). The increase of the amount compared with 2019 is/uni00A0primarily due to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities or increase in deferred tax assets resulting from impairments recorded in 2020, as well/uni00A0as a greater number of entities having incurred a loss in 2020.\n\nUnrecognised taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed retained earnings of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates amounted to $6,705 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $6,356 million). These retained earnings are subject to withholding tax upon distribution.\n\nUnrecognised deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward amounted to $42,836 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $33,068 million), including amounts of $31,873 million (2019: $24,295 million) that are subject to time limits for utilisation of five/uni00A0years or later, or are not time limited.\n\nFurthermore, there are unrecognised losses for Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) in Australia, amounting to $39,402 million as at the end of the/uni00A0most recent PRRT fiscal year, June 30, 2020 (June 30, 2019: $36,905 million). Based on business forecasts at existing commodity price levels, and the annual augmentation of the unused PRRT losses, this amount is expected to increase in the near future.\n\nRetirement benefits are provided through a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, the most significant of/uni00A0which are in the Netherlands, UK and USA. Benefits comprise principally pensions; retirement health care and life insurance are also provided in certain countries.\n\n## Financial position\n\n$ million\n\n|                                                        | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Obligations                                            | (115,792)      | (103,545)      |\n| Plan assets                                            | 102,678        | 94,826         |\n| Asset ceilings                                         | (17)           |                |\n| Deficit                                                | (13,131)       | (8,719)        |\n| Retirement benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: |                |                |\n| Non-current assets                                     | 2,474          | 4,717          |\n| Non-current liabilities                                | (15,168)       | (13,017)       |\n| Current liabilities                                    | (437)          | (419)          |\n| Total                                                  | (13,131)       | (8,719)        |",

The duration of the related Dutch defined benefit obligation is 19 years (2019: 19 years). Whilst the plan was closed to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 2013, it currently remains open for/uni00A0ongoing accrual for existing active members. 31% (2019: 34%) of the/uni00A0overall defined benefit liability in the Netherlands relates to active members. From July 1, 2013 onwards new employees in the Netherlands are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.\n\nIn line with Dutch regulations, the defined benefit pension plan has a joint Trustee Board with trustee representatives nominated by the company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. The defined benefit pension plan also has an Accountability Council comprised of members nominated by the company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. Furthermore, there is a Supervisory Committee which includes external experts from the pension industry to oversee management, compliance and operations of the fund. The defined contribution pension plan has a one-tier Trustee Board with an independent chairperson, and trustee representatives nominated by the company and the Central Staff Council (currently no retired members in the fund to act as trustee) as well as two executive board members. The defined contribution fund also has an Accountability Council comprised of members nominated by the company/uni00A0and the Central Staff Council.\n\nThe Dutch government is currently drafting a new regulatory framework for pensions in the Netherlands. The government aims to complete development of new regulations by January 2022 with subsequent implementation by January 2026. It is expected that these regulatory changes will have an impact on both the defined benefit pension plan and/uni00A0the defined contribution pension plan with anticipated changes currently being discussed with the Central Staff Council.\n\n## UK\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the UK is a funded final salary pension arrangement with retired employees mainly drawing benefits as an annuity with the option to take a portion as a lump sum. The/uni00A0duration of the related UK defined benefit obligation is 19 years (2019: 18 years). Whilst the plan was closed to employees hired or rehired on or after March 1, 2013, it currently remains open for ongoing accrual for existing active members. 21% (2019: 21%) of the overall defined liability in the UK relates to active members. From March 1, 2013 onwards new employees in the UK are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.\n\nIn line with UK regulations, the defined benefit pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of four trustee directors nominated by the company including the chair and four membernominated trustee directors. The defined contribution pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of three company nominated directors including the chair and two membernominated trustee directors. The trustees are responsible for administering the plans in line with the Trust Deed and Regulations, including setting the investment strategy for the pension plans' assets and paying member benefits, and are required to act in the best interests of the members of/uni00A0the/uni00A0pension plans.",

        "page_content": "## USA\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA is a funded average final pay pension plan. At retirement, all retirees can choose to draw their benefit as an annuity, whereas some also have the choice to take their benefit as a lump sum. The duration of the related US defined benefit obligation is 13 years (2019: 13 years). In addition, the company provides a defined contribution plan. Each of these plans is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). 25% (2019: 31%) of the overall defined liability of the funded defined benefit plan in the USA relates to active members.\n\nBoth the defined benefit pension plan and the defined contribution pension plan are governed by trustees who are appointed by the Plan Sponsor and are named fiduciaries with respect to the plans. The trustees are generally responsible for investment-related matters, appointing the Plan Administrator, maintaining general oversight and deciding appeals of/uni00A0participants.\n\nThe company also sponsors 'other post-retirement employee benefit' (OPEB) plans in the USA that provide medical, dental, and vision benefits as well as life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. The plan that provides post-retirement medical benefits is closed to employees hired or/uni00A0rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Certain life insurance benefits are/uni00A0paid by the company.\n\nSignificant funding requirements:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 There are no set minimum statutory funding requirements for the UK plans. A professional qualified independent actuary, appointed by the/uni00A0trustee board, undertakes a local funding valuation typically every/uni00A0three years. The most recent completed funding valuation for the/uni00A0principal defined benefit plan was undertaken as at December 31, 2017. A funding valuation as at December 31, 2020 is currently under way. The most recent completed funding valuation (2017) revealed a/uni00A0funding ratio of 108% and the resulting Schedule of Contributions was for no Sponsor contribution (except for salary sacrifice contributions); and\n- \u25a0 Additional contributions to the Dutch defined benefit pension plan would be required if the 12-month rolling average local funding percentage falls below 105% for six months or more. At the most recent/uni00A0(2020) funding valuation the local funding percentage was above this level;\n- \u25a0 Under the Pension Protection Act, US pension plans are subject to minimum required contribution levels based on the funding position. No contributions are required based on the most recent funding valuation.\n\n## Associated risks to which retirement benefits are/uni00A0exposed\n\nThere are inherent risks associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. These risks are related to various assumptions made on valuation of/uni00A0the liabilities and the cash funding requirement of the underlying plans. Volatility in capital markets or government policies, and the resulting consequences for investment performance, interest and inflation rates, as/uni00A0well as changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement, could result in significant changes/uni00A0to the funding level of future liabilities, and in case of a shortfall, there could be a requirement to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations).\n\nThese inherent risks are managed by a pension forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell's pension strategy, policy and/uni00A0operations. The forum is supported by a risk committee in reviewing the results of the assurance process with respect to the pension risk.\n\n## Investment strategies\n\nLong-term investment strategies of plans are generally determined by the relevant pension plan trustees using a structured asset/liability modelling approach to define the asset mix that best meets the objectives of optimising returns within agreed risk levels while maintaining adequate funding levels.\n\n## Principal and actuarial assumptions\n\n- \u25a0 rates of increase in pensionable remuneration, pensions in payment and health-care costs: historical experience and management's long-term expectation;\n\nThe principal assumptions applied in determining the present value of/uni00A0defined benefit obligations and their bases were as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 discount rates: prevailing long-term AA corporate bond yields, chosen to match the currency and duration of the relevant obligation; and\n- \u25a0 mortality rates: published standard mortality tables for the individual/uni00A0countries concerned adjusted for Shell experience where/uni00A0statistically significant.\n\nThe weighted averages for those assumptions and related sensitivity information at December/uni00A031 are presented below. Sensitivity information indicates by how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease with no change in other assumptions./uni00A0\n\n$ million, except where indicated\n\nEffect of using alternative assumptions\n\n|                                              |                        |                    | Assumptions used  at nominal rates   | Assumptions used  at nominal rates   | Assumptions used  at nominal rates   | Assumptions used  at nominal rates   | Assumptions used  at nominal rates   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                              | December 31,  2020 [A] | December 31,  2019 | Range  of/uni00A0assumptions         | December 31, 2020                    | December 31, 2020                    | December 31, 2019                    | December 31, 2019                    |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable remuneration | 3.8%                   | 4.1%               | -1% to +1%                           | (1,780) to                           | 1,948                                | (1,975) to                           | 2,266                                |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment      | 1.6%                   | 1.6%               | -1% to +1%                           | (10,937) to                          | 13,523                               | (9, 541) to                          | 11,757                               |\n| Rate of increase in health-care costs [B]    | 6.0%                   | 6.1%               | -1% to +1%                           | (605) to                             | 751                                  | (546) to                             | 675                                  |\n| Discount rate for pension plans              | 1.5%                   | 2.1%               | -1% to +1%                           | 21,463 to                            | (16,382)                             | 18,431 to                            | (14,155)                             |\n| Discount rate for health-care plans [B]      | 2.6%                   | 3.2%               | -1% to +1%                           | 791 to                               | (624)                                | 704 to                               | (558)                                |\n| Expected age at death for persons aged 60:   |                        |                    |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |\n| Men                                          | 87 years               | 87 years           | -1 year to +1 year                   | (2,022) to                           | 2,112                                | (1,717) to                           | 1,782                                |\n| Women                                        | 88 years               | 89 years           | -1 year to +1 year                   | (1,985) to                           | 2,070                                | (1,631) to                           | 1,694                                |\n\nt\n\ns",

Reviews of estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs and the discount rate applied are carried out regularly. The/uni00A0discount rate applied at December 31, 2020 was 1.75% (2019: 3%). This decrease resulted from the significant decrease in capital markets rates in/uni00A02020. An increase of 0.5% or a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate could result in a decrease of $1.7 billion or an increase of $2.2 billion of decommissioning and restoration provisions, respectively. Such increase/decrease will be reflected in the carrying amount of the related asset. Where/uni00A0applicable that carrying amount is tested for impairment.\n\nIn 2020, there was an increase of $3,999 million (2019: $2,241 million) in the decommissioning and restoration provision as a result of the change in the discount rate, partly offset by a decrease in the provision resulting from changes in cost estimates of $1,909 million (2019: $545 million), reported within remeasurements and other movements.\n\nOf the decommissioning and restoration provision at December 31, 2020, an estimated $3,921 million is expected to be utilised within one to five years, $2,206 million within six to 10 years, and the remainder in later periods.\n\nOther provisions include amounts recognised in respect of onerous contracts ($1,739 million) and employee benefits. At December 31, 2020, the onerous contract provision includes onerous contracts that relate to Lake Charles terminals and the closure of the Convent refinery, both in the USA.",

These policies cover: financing structure; interest rate and foreign exchange risk management; insurance; counterparty risk management; and use of derivative contracts. Wherever possible, treasury operations are carried out through specialist regional organisations without removing from each subsidiary the responsibility to formulate and implement appropriate treasury policies.\n\nApart from forward foreign exchange contracts to meet known commitments, the use of derivative contracts by most subsidiaries is not permitted by their treasury policy.\n\nOther than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative contracts is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.\n\nShell's operations expose it to market, credit and liquidity risk, as described below./uni00A0\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the prices of crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and carbon-emission rights will/uni00A0adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash/uni00A0flows./uni00A0\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nMost debt is raised from central borrowing programmes. Shell's policy continues to be to have debt principally denominated in dollars and to maintain a largely floating interest rate exposure profile; however, Shell has issued a significant amount of fixed rate debt in recent years, taking advantage of historically low interest rates available in debt markets. As a result, the majority of the debt portfolio at December/uni00A031, 2020, is at fixed rates and this reduces Shell's adverse exposure to rising floating dollar interest rates (see Notes 2 and 3).\n\nThe financing of most subsidiaries is structured on a floating-rate basis, and any further interest rate risk management is only applied under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn the basis of the floating-rate net cash position at December 31, 2020 (both issued and hedged), and assuming other factors (principally foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further interest rate management action was taken, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have increased 2020 income before taxation by $62/uni00A0million (2019: $98 million decrease, based on the floating rate net/uni00A0debt position at December 31, 2019)./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe carrying amounts and maturities of debt and borrowing facilities are/uni00A0presented in Note 14. Interest expense is presented in Note 6./uni00A0\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nMany of the markets in which Shell operates are priced, directly or indirectly, in dollars. As a result, the functional currency of most Integrated Gas and Upstream entities and those with significant cross-border business is the dollar. For Oil Products and Chemicals entities, the functional currency is typically the local currency. Consequently, Shell is exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when an entity enters into transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date and as a result of holding net investments in operations that are not dollar-functional. Each entity is required to adopt treasury policies that are designed to measure and manage its foreign exchange exposures by reference to its functional currency.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arise in the normal course of business from the recognition of receivables and payables and other monetary items in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. Foreign exchange risk may also arise in connection with capital expenditure. For major projects, an assessment is made at the final investment decision stage whether to hedge any resulting exposure.\n\nAssuming other factors (principally interest rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further foreign exchange risk management action were taken, a 10% appreciation against the dollar at December/uni00A031 of the main currencies to which Shell is exposed would have the following/uni00A0effects:\n\n$ million\n\n|                                         | Increase/(decrease)  in income before taxation   | Increase/(decrease)  in income before taxation   | Increase in net assets   | Increase in net assets   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                         | 2020                                             | 2019                                             | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| 10% appreciation against the dollar of: |                                                  |                                                  |                          |                          |\n| Euro                                    | (263)                                            | 36                                               | 451                      | 1,227                    |\n| Malaysian ringgit                       | 255                                              | 243                                              | 270                      | 290                      |\n| Australian dollar                       | 179                                              | (55)                                             | 598                      | 835                      |\n| Sterling                                | (166)                                            | (58)                                             | 328                      | 581                      |\n| Canadian dollar                         | 1                                                | (97)                                             | 1,299                    | 1,380                    |\n\nt\n\ns",

The effect on income before taxation arises in connection with monetary balances denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency; the effect on net assets arises principally from the translation of assets and liabilities of entities that are not dollar-functional.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses included in income are presented in Note 5./uni00A0\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCertain subsidiaries have a mandate to trade crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and carbon-emission rights, and/uni00A0to use commodity derivative contracts (forwards, futures, swaps and options) as a means of managing price and timing risks arising from this trading activity. In effecting these transactions, the entities concerned operate within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those relating to the default of counterparties, are managed within authorised limits.\n\nValue-at-risk (VAR) techniques based on variance/covariance or Monte Carlo simulation models are used to make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 1-day holding period and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions, the history of price movements and the correlation of these price movements. Models are/uni00A0regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The VAR year-end positions in respect of commodities traded in active/uni00A0markets, which are presented in the table below, are calculated on a diversified basis in order to reflect the effect of offsetting risk within/uni00A0combined portfolios./uni00A0\n\n## Value-at-risk (pre-tax)\n\n$ million\n\n|                             |   December 31, 2020 |   December 31, 2019 |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Global oil                  |                  24 |                  22 |\n| North America gas and power |                  14 |                  12 |\n| Europe gas and power        |                  11 |                   5 |\n| Carbon-emission rights      |                   7 |                   4 |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nPolicies are in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. These policies include detailed credit analysis and monitoring of trading partners against counterparty credit limits. Credit information is regularly shared between business and finance functions, with dedicated teams in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration. Mitigation measures are defined and implemented for higher-risk business partners and customers, and include shortened payment terms, collateral or other security posting and vigorous collections. In addition, policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution. There are no material concentrations of credit/uni00A0risk, with individual customers or geographically, and there has been no significant level of counterparty default in recent years.\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos/uni00A0and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. Management monitors the investments regularly and adjusts the investment portfolio in light of new market information where necessary to ensure credit/uni00A0risk is effectively diversified.\n\nIn commodity trading, counterparty credit risk is managed within a framework of credit limits with utilisation being regularly reviewed. Credit risk exposure is monitored and the acceptable level of credit exposure is determined by a credit committee. Credit checks are performed by a department independent of traders, and are undertaken before contractual commitment. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage specific risks.\n\nShell routinely enters into offsetting, master netting and similar arrangements with trading and other counterparties to manage credit risk. Where there is a legally enforceable right of offset under such arrangements and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, the net asset or liability is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, otherwise assets and liabilities are presented gross. These amounts, as presented net and gross within trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, were as follows:/uni00A0\n\n## 2020\n\n|                                         | $ million                    | $ million       | $ million                 | $ million                         | $ million                     | $ million   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n|                                         | Amounts offset               | Amounts offset  | Amounts offset            | Amounts not offset                | Amounts not offset            |             |\n|                                         | Gross amounts  before offset | Amounts  offset | Net amounts  as presented | Cash collateral  received/pledged | Other offsetting  instruments | Net amounts |\n| Assets:                                 |                              |                 |                           |                                   |                               |             |\n| Within trade receivables                | 10,658                       | 6,470           | 4,188                     | 14                                | 79                            | 4,095       |\n| Within derivative financial instruments | 12,798                       | 6,125           | 6,673                     | 1,573                             | 1,750                         | 3,350       |\n| Liabilities:                            |                              |                 |                           |                                   |                               |             |\n| Within trade payables                   | 10,580                       | 6,467           | 4,113                     | 1                                 | 79                            | 4,033       |\n| Within derivative financial instruments | 10,502                       | 5,893           | 4,609                     | 797                               | 1, 761                        | 2,051       |",

Collateral mainly relates to initial margins held with commodity exchanges and over-the-counter counterparty variation margins. Some derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk./uni00A0\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for Shell's business activities may not be available. Management believes that it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements. Information about borrowing facilities is presented in Note 14./uni00A0\n\n## Derivative contracts and hedges\n\nDerivative contracts are used principally as hedging instruments, however, because hedge accounting is not always applied, movements in the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that are recognised in income are not always matched in the same period by the recognition of the income effects of the related hedged items.\n\n## Carrying amounts, maturities and hedges\n\nThe carrying amounts of derivative contracts at December 31, designated and not designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes, were as follows:\n\n## 2020\n\n$ million\n\n|                                    | Designated   | Not  designated   | Total   | Designated   | Not  designated   | Total   | Net   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|-------|\n| Interest rate swaps                | 451          | -                 | 451     | 26           | 22                | 48      | 403   |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | -            | 276               | 276     | -            | 651               | 651     | (375) |\n| Currency swaps and options         | 1,890        | 13                | 1,903   | 280          | 63                | 343     | 1,560 |\n| Commodity derivatives              | -            | 5,534             | 5,534   | 92           | 4,565             | 4,657   | 877   |\n| Other contracts                    | -            | 424               | 424     | -            | 29                | 29      | 395   |\n| Total                              | 2,341        | 6,247             | 8,588   | 398          | 5,330             | 5,728   | 2,860 |\n\n## 2019\n\n|                                    | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                    | Designated  | Not  designated | Total       | Designated  | Not  designated | Total       | Net         |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 227         | 8               | 235         | 34          | 24              | 58          | 177         |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 7           | 236             | 243         | 2           | 309             | 311         | (68)        |\n| Currency swaps and options         | 90          | 15              | 105         | 932         | 56              | 988         | (883)       |\n| Commodity derivatives              | -           | 6,914           | 6,914       | -           | 5,281           | 5,281       | 1,633       |\n| Other contracts                    | -           | 341             | 341         | -           | -               | -           | 341         |\n| Total                              | 324         | 7, 5 1 4        | 7, 8 3 8    | 968         | 5,670           | 6,638       | 1,200       |\n\nt\n\ns",

The International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) guidance concerning the physical settlement of a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item has been applied prospectively as from 2020. The result of this decision is that $597 million of prior gains that would have previously reversed at the time of trade delivery, have been excluded from the amount disclosed in 2020.\n\nCertain contracts, mainly to hedge price risk relating to forecast commodity transactions, were designated in cash flow hedging relationships and are presented after the offset of related margin balances with exchanges. Contracts to hedge foreign exchange risks were also designated in cash flow hedging relationships and the net carrying amount of these contracts at December 31, 2020, was an asset of $556 million (2019: $167 million liability). See Note 22 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.\n\nCertain interest rate and currency swaps were designated in fair value hedges, principally in respect of debt for which the net carrying amount of the related derivative contracts, net of accrued interest, at December 31, 2020, was an asset of $1,422 million (2019: $518 million liability).\n\nIn 2020, \u20ac3 billion of debt instruments were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, relating to the foreign exchange risk arising between certain intermediate holding companies and their subsidiaries. See Note 22 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the course of trading operations, certain contracts are entered into for delivery of commodities that are accounted for as derivatives. The resulting price exposures are managed by entering into related derivative contracts. These contracts are managed on a fair value basis and the maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the undiscounted fair value of derivative liabilities.\n\nFor a minority of commodity derivatives contracts, carrying amounts cannot be derived from quoted market prices or other observable inputs, in which case fair value is estimated using valuation techniques such as Black-Scholes, option spread models and extrapolation using quoted spreads with assumptions developed internally based on observable market activity.\n\nOther contracts include certain contracts that are held to sell or purchase commodities and others containing embedded derivatives, which are required to be recognised at fair value because of pricing or delivery conditions, even though they were entered into to meet operational requirements. These contracts are expected to mature in 2021-2025, with certain contracts having early termination rights (for either party). Valuations are derived from quoted market prices.\n\nThe contractual maturities of derivative liabilities at December 31 compare with their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:\n\n| 2020                               |                        |                         |                         |                         |                         |                           |                        |                                       |                        |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                    | Contractual maturities | Contractual maturities  | Contractual maturities  | Contractual maturities  | Contractual maturities  | Contractual maturities    | Contractual maturities | Contractual maturities                | Contractual maturities |\n|                                    | Less than  1 year      | Between  1 and 2  years | Between  2 and 3  years | Between  3 and 4  years | Between  4 and 5  years | 5 years  and/uni00A0later | Total                  | Difference  from carrying  amount [A] | Carrying  amount       |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 12                     | 10                      | 9                       | 7                       | 5                       | 6                         | 49                     | (1)                                   | 48                     |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 504                    | 56                      | 22                      | 38                      | -

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/uni00A0 continued\n\n## 25/uni00A0- LEGAL/uni00A0PROCEEDINGS/uni00A0AND/uni00A0OTHER/uni00A0CONTINGENCIES General\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Shell subsidiaries are subject to a number of contingencies arising from litigation and claims brought by governmental authorities, including tax authorities, and private parties. The operations and earnings of Shell subsidiaries continue, from time to time, to be affected to varying degrees by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to the protection of the environment and indigenous groups in the countries in which they operate. The industries in which Shell subsidiaries are engaged are also subject to/uni00A0physical risks of various types.\n\nThe amounts claimed in relation to such events and, if such claims against Shell were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. Based on information available to date and taking into account that in some cases it is not practicable to estimate the possible magnitude or timing of any resultant payments, management believes that the foregoing are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty around these contingencies, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition./uni00A0\n\nIn certain divestment transactions, liabilities related to decommissioning and restoration are de-recognised upon transfer of these obligations to the buyer. For certain of these obligations Shell has issued guarantees to/uni00A0third parties and continues to be liable in case the primary obligor is/uni00A0not/uni00A0able to meet its obligation. These potential obligations arising from/uni00A0issuance of these guarantees are assessed to be remote.\n\n## Decommissioning and restoration of manufacturing/uni00A0facilities\n\nIndustry practice has been not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with manufacturing facilities in Oil Products and Chemicals. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefinite lives and, therefore, that it was considered remote that an outflow of economic benefits would be required.\n\nIn 2020, the changed macroeconomic fundamentals were considered, together with Shell's plans to rationalise the Group's manufacturing portfolio. It was also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not/uni00A0to/uni00A0recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities.\n\nIt was concluded that the assumption of indefinite lives for manufacturing facilities is no longer appropriate, and the need for either recognition of decommissioning and restoration provisions or contingent liability disclosure was reviewed. In 2020, provisions have been recognised for/uni00A0certain shorter-lived manufacturing facilities (See Note 18). For the remaining longer-lived facilities, where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away, it was concluded that, while there is a present obligation that has arisen from past events, the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. This conclusion was reached on the basis that the settlement dates are indeterminate; and/uni00A0that other estimates, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, are not reliable. Consequently, a/uni00A0decommissioning and restoration obligation exists that cannot be recognised or quantified and that is disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\n## Pesticide litigation\n\nShell Oil Company (SOC), along with another agricultural chemical pesticide manufacturer and several distributors, has been sued by public and quasi-public water purveyors, water storage districts, and private landowners alleging responsibility for groundwater contamination caused by applications of chemical pesticides. There are approximately 60 such cases currently pending. These suits assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, and seek to recover actual damages, including drinking well treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. While the Company continues to vigorously defend these lawsuits, a new environmental regulatory standard became effective in the State of California, where a majority of the suits are pending. Effective January 2018, the new standard requires public water systems state-wide to perform quarterly or monthly sampling of their drinking water sources for a chemical contained in certain pesticides. Water systems deemed out of compliance with the five parts per trillion regulatory standard must take corrective action to resolve the exceedance or take the potable water source out of service. In response to this new regulatory standard, the Company is monitoring the sampling results to determine the number of/uni00A0wells potentially impacted. Based on the claims asserted and SOC's track record, with regard to amounts paid to resolve varying claims, management does not expect the outcome of these lawsuits pending at/uni00A0December 31, 2020, to have a material adverse impact on Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.\n\n## Climate change litigation\n\nIn the USA, 18 lawsuits have been filed by several municipalities and/or states against oil and gas companies, including Royal Dutch Shell plc. The plaintiffs seek damages for a variety of claims including harm to their public and private infrastructure from rising sea levels and other alleged impacts of climate change caused by the defendants' fossil fuel products. A similar suit has been filed by a crab-fishing industry group claiming harm to their fisheries as a result of alleged ocean-related impacts of climate change. In the Netherlands a case has been filed against Shell by a group/uni00A0of environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) and individual claimants seeking a court order that emission levels from Shell's activities and sold energy products are unlawful and that by 2030 it should reduce those emissions by least (net) 45%, alternatively 35% or 25% (as compared with 2019 levels). Management believes the outcome of these matters should be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell, but there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.\n\n## Brazil tax\n\nPursuant to Law 7.183/2015 issued by the State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ State) and effective March 2016, a value-added levy has been imposed on oil extraction in the RJ State. The Company understands that the obligations arising from this law are not legally sustainable and Shell obtained favourable injunctions suspending the enforcement of the law in two separate lawsuits, one filed to cover year 2016 and the other covering year 2017 onwards. The injunctions remain in effect and Shell received favourable decisions on the subject matter from the RJ State Court. The/uni00A0R J/uni00A0State has appealed against both decisions and one is pending",

        "page_content": "confirmation by the State Court while the other is pending final decisions by the Brazilian Superior and Supreme Courts. In addition, and as this is/uni00A0an industry-wide issue, the Brazilian Association of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Companies, of which Shell is a member, filed a suit in February 2016 before the Brazilian Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the law. This matter is currently pending with the Supreme Court. Should Shell be required to pay such a levy, it could result/uni00A0in a potential total liability of approximately $5,473 million as of/uni00A0end 2020.\n\n## Louisiana coast litigation\n\nThe State of Louisiana and multiple local governments have initiated 43 lawsuits against 200 oil and gas companies, claiming either current or historical oil and gas operations caused or contributed to contamination, land loss and the erosion of the Louisiana coastline. Shell entities are named in 14 of the suits. Although the State and local parishes fail to claim specified amounts, these claims represent potentially material matters. The/uni00A0cases are of first impression, arise out of an untested 1980/uni00A0Louisiana statute and represent a novel attempt to render illegal operations that federal and state agencies permitted and authorised at/uni00A0the time. Management believes the outcome of these matters should ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell; there remains a/uni00A0high degree of uncertainty, however, concerning the scope of the claims/uni00A0and the ultimate outcomes, as well as their potential effects on/uni00A0future operations, earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial/uni00A0condition. /uni00A0\n\n## NAM (Groningen gas field) litigation\n\n- \u25a0 housing claims where NAM was found liable for value loss;\n\nSince 1963 NAM - a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50%-50%) - has been producing gas from the Groningen field, the largest gas field in Western Europe. After smaller tremors in the 1990s and the late 2000s, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale occurred in 2012, causing damage to properties in the affected area, and the area continues to experience tremor/earthquake-type events. NAM has received more than 100,000 claims for physical damage to property - the majority of which have been successfully settled. The Dutch State has taken over the damage-claim-handling from NAM for all claim categories (physical damage to property, housing value loss, emotional damages and loss of living enjoyment) while NAM remains financially responsible. NAM still faces claims in civil litigation from claimants who elect not to use the government arrangement or from claims pre-dating the governmental arrangements. These claims include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 emotional damages and loss of living enjoyment ~5,000 claimants; and\n- \u25a0 other civil litigation matters.\n\nThere remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning the ultimate outcomes and their potential effects on future operations, earnings, cash/uni00A0flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.\n\n## Nigerian litigation\n\nShell subsidiaries and associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various environmental and contractual disputes brought in the courts of Nigeria, England and the Netherlands. These disputes are at different stages in litigation, including at the appellate stage, where judgements have been rendered against Shell entities. If taken at face value, the aggregate amount of these judgements could be seen as material. Management, however, believes that the outcomes of these matters will ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding these cases, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.\n\n## OPL 245\n\nAuthorities are investigating Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd.'s (SNEPCO's) investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and/uni00A0the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block with regard to/uni00A0potential anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the Nigeria Federal High Court issued an Interim Order of Attachment for Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), pending the conclusion of the investigation. SNEPCO applied for and was granted a discharge of this order on constitutional and procedural grounds. Also in Nigeria, in March 2017 criminal charges alleging official corruption and conspiracy to commit official corruption were filed against SNEPCO, one current Shell employee and third parties including ENI SpA and one of its subsidiaries. Those proceedings are ongoing. In January 2020, criminal charges alleging disobeying direction of law were filed in Nigeria against Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Ltd., SNEPCO, and third parties including Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (NAE). Those proceedings are ongoing. In March 2017, parties alleging to be shareholders of Malabu Oil and Gas Company Ltd. (Malabu) filed two actions to challenge the 2011 settlement and the award of OPL 245 to SNEPCO and an ENI SpA subsidiary by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Those proceedings are/uni00A0also ongoing. On May 8, 2018, Human Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) sought permission from the Federal High Court of Nigeria to apply for an order to direct the Attorney General of the Federation to revoke OPL 245 on grounds that the entire Malabu transaction in relation to the OPL is unconstitutional, illegal and void as it was obtained through fraudulent and corrupt practice. On October 4, 2018, SNEPCO was joined as a defendant in the HEDA action. Those proceedings are ongoing. On July 3, 2019, the Nigerian Federal High Court upheld objections from SNEPCO and NAE and struck the lawsuit filed by HEDA. The suit was struck because of the statute of limitations and the determination by the court that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. HEDA has appealed the judgement.\n\nOn December 12, 2018, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) issued a claim form in the UK against Shell and six of its subsidiaries, ENI SpA and two of its subsidiaries, Malabu as well as two other entities for the amount of $1,092 million/uni00A0plus damages for having participated in a fraudulent and corrupt scheme leading to the acquisition by Shell and ENI corporate defendants in 2011 of OPL 245. The Shell entities were served with proceedings in April and May 2019, following which they, and other defendants, challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts. Following a hearing in April 2020, the English High Court rendered judgement in May 2020, dismissing the claims in England and refusing the FRN's request for permission to appeal. In September 2020, the UK Court of Appeal also refused the FRN's permission to appeal, meaning the case is now concluded.\n\nOn February 14, 2017, Royal Dutch Shell plc received a notice of request for indictment from the Milan public prosecutor with respect to this matter. On December 20, 2017, Royal Dutch Shell plc and four former Shell employees including one former executive were remanded to trial in Milan. On May 14, 2018, a trial commenced in the Court of Milan. The FRN was admitted as a civil claimant by a court decision on July 20, 2018. On September 18, 2018, Shell was joined to the proceedings as the civilly responsible party for the damages caused by the alleged illegal acts of the four former Shell employees. Three other Shell entities (Shell UK Ltd, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd. and Shell Exploration and Production Africa Ltd.) also joined the proceedings as responsabile civile for their respective former employees at that phase of the proceedings. The trial is ongoing with closing arguments completed in January and rebuttals scheduled for February. Based on Shell's review of the Milan public prosecutor's file and the information and facts currently available to Shell, management does not believe there is a basis to convict/uni00A0Shell or the four former Shell employees.\n\nt\n\ns",

That decision is under appeal. Separate OPL 245 pre-trial criminal proceedings are pending against another individual who also did not work for or on behalf of Shell.\n\nIn February 2019, we were informed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (DPP) that they were nearing the conclusion of their investigation and preparing to prosecute Royal Dutch Shell plc for criminal charges directly or indirectly related to the 2011 settlement of disputes over OPL 245 in Nigeria. On October 2, 2019, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) informed Shell that it was closing its inquiry into Shell in relation to OPL 245. We understand that the decision was based on the facts available to the DOJ, including ongoing legal proceedings in Europe. On April 22, 2020, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission notified us that it had also closed its inquiry into Shell in relation to OPL 245. There remains a high degree of uncertainty around the OPL 245 matters and contingencies discussed above, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows/uni00A0and Shell's financial condition. Accordingly, at this time, it is not practicable to estimate the magnitude and timing of any possible obligations or/uni00A0payments. Any violation of anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering legislation could/uni00A0have a material adverse effect on Royal Dutch Shell plc's earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## 26/uni00A0- EMPLOYEES\n\n## Employee costs\n\n|                                        | 2020   | 2019   | $ million 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------|\n| Remuneration                           | 9,128  | 10,075 | 10,167           |\n| Social security contributions          | 793    | 844    | 810              |\n| Retirement benefits (see Note 17)      | 1,851  | 1,753  | 1,878            |\n| Share-based compensation (see Note 21) | 359    | 537    | 531              |\n| Total [A]                              | 12,131 | 13,209 | 13,386           |\n\n[A] Excludes employees seconded to joint ventures and associates./uni00A0\n\n## Average employee numbers\n\n|                  |   2020 |   2019 |   Thousand 2018 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| Integrated Gas   |     11 |     10 |               9 |\n| Upstream [A]     |     14 |     14 |              14 |\n| Oil Products [A] |     34 |     32 |              35 |\n| Chemicals [A]    |      2 |      4 |               4 |\n| Corporate [B]    |     25 |     23 |              20 |\n| Total [C]        |     86 |     83 |              82 |\n\n- [A] Due to the resegmentations.

Remuneration paid by those benefit plans amounted to $1 million in 2020 (2019: $1 million; 2018: $1 million).\n\n## 29 - EMISSION SCHEMES AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL PLANS Emission trading schemes\n\nGenerally, emission trading schemes (ETS) are mandated governmental schemes to control emission levels and enhance clean energy transition, allowing for the trading of emission certificates. In most ETS, governments set an emission cap for one or more sectors. Generally, entities in scope of the/uni00A0scheme are allowed to buy emission certificates to cover shortages or sell surplus emission certificates. In certain countries emissions are priced through a carbon tax. For Shell, the most significant carbon pricing mechanisms are established in the EU, Canada, Singapore and the USA.\n\n## Biofuel schemes\n\nBiofuel schemes are mandated schemes that set binding national targets on the share of renewables in fuel consumption or measures on reducing GHG emissions by fuel suppliers. Biofuels are blended with existing fuels such as gasoline and diesel to reduce net emissions. The share of biofuel in the total sales mix of fuel is used to comply with regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by biofuel production through 'selfblending' in jurisdictions that grant the biofuel certificates at blending stage or through purchase of renewable, certified feedstock like ethanol used subsequently in the manufacturing process.\n\n## Renewable power schemes\n\nRenewable power schemes create a financial incentive to consume power that is sourced from renewable origins or requires that a minimum percentage of power sold meets the green definition of the relevant standard. These regulations are typically accompanied by schemes supporting investments in the renewable technology. Renewable power schemes generally use certificates to monitor compliance, where renewable power credits are granted for each MWh of energy generated that meets the predefined renewable criteria. Shell's compliance obligation under renewable power schemes comes primarily from energy supply and results from regulations applying in Europe, North America and Australia.\n\nt\n\ns",

The figures present compliance schemes only, excluding voluntary activities.\n\n## 30/uni00A0- POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\n\nA restructuring plan named Reshape was announced in the third quarter 2020. Under Reshape, between 7,000 and 9,000 job reductions are expected by the end of 2022, including around 1,500 people who have already elected to take selective voluntary severance in 2020. In January 2021 the impact of Reshape was communicated to employees, establishing for some employees, a constructive obligation that satisfies the IFRS criteria for recognising a provision. This represents a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event under IFRS. The costs for this phase of the plan, and where the IFRS recognition criteria have been satisfied, are in the range of $650 million to $850 million (Shell share pre-tax) and will be recognised in the first quarter of/uni00A02021. Further redundancy costs will be recognised once the IFRS recognition criteria are met during 2021 and 2022.\n\nOn February 17, 2021, an agreement was reached with publicly listed Canadian energy company Crescent Point Energy Corp. to sell the Duvernay shale light oil position in Alberta, Canada, for a total consideration of $707 million (C$900 million). The transaction has an effective date of January 1, 2021. The consideration is comprised of $550 million in cash and 50 million shares (valued at $157 million) in Crescent Point Energy common stock (TSX:/uni00A0CPG). Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in April 2021.\n\nOn March 9, 2021, we announced that Shell Egypt and one of its affiliates have signed an agreement with a consortium made up of subsidiaries of/uni00A0Cheiron Petroleum Corporation and Cairn Energy plc to acquire Shell's upstream assets in Egypt's Western Desert for a base consideration of/uni00A0$646/uni00A0million and additional payments of up to $280 million between 2021 and 2024, contingent on the oil price and the results of further exploration./uni00A0The transaction is subject to government and regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in the second half of 2021.",

Extractive activities for this purpose include exploration and production activities to extract oil, condensates, natural gas liquids, oil sands and natural gas from their natural reservoirs.\n\nIn Shell, extractive activities, or oil and gas exploration and production activities, are undertaken within the Upstream segment, Integrated Gas segment and Oil Products segment (oil sands). Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of the Upstream, Integrated Gas and Oil Products activities and exclude downstream GTL, some LNG activities, Marketing business in Oil Products, Power and New Energies, trading and optimisation, as well as other non-extractive activities. The information in this 'extractive activities' section is therefore not suitable for modelling Shell's integrated businesses for which we refer to the segment information. Full segment information to the Consolidated Financial Statements is available on pages 230-232.\n\nThe information set out on pages 265-282 is referred to as 'unaudited' as/uni00A0a means of clarifying that it is not covered by the audit opinion of the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES\n\nProved reserves estimates are calculated pursuant to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules and the FASB's Topic 932. Proved reserves can be either developed or undeveloped. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. We include proved reserves associated with future production that will be/uni00A0consumed in operations.\n\nProved reserves shown are net of any quantities of crude oil or natural gas that are expected to be (or could be) taken as royalties in kind. Proved reserves outside North America include quantities that will be settled as royalties in cash. Proved reserves include certain quantities of crude oil or natural gas that will be produced under arrangements that involve Shell subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in risks and rewards but do not transfer title of the product to those entities./uni00A0\n\nSubsidiaries' proved reserves at December 31, 2020, were divided into 85% developed and 15% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. For the Shell share of joint ventures and associates, the proved reserves at December 31, 2020, were divided into 88% developed and 12% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis./uni00A0\n\nProved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements. Shell's proved reserves volumes at December 31, 2020, present in agreements such as production-sharing contracts (PSC), tax/ variable royalty contracts or other forms of economic entitlement contracts, where the Shell share of reserves can vary with commodity prices, were 2,044 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, and/uni00A012,133 thousand million standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas./uni00A0\n\nProved reserves cannot be measured exactly because estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement (see 'Risk factors' on page 31 and our 'Proved reserves assurance process' below). These estimates remain subject to revision and are unaudited supplementary information./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES ASSURANCE PROCESS\n\nA central group of reserves experts, who on average have around 25 years' experience in the oil and gas industry, undertake the primary assurance of the proved reserves bookings. This group of experts is part of/uni00A0the Resources Assurance and Reporting (RAR) organisation within Shell. A Vice President with 35/uni00A0years' experience in the oil and gas industry currently heads the RAR organisation. He is a member of the Society of\n\nPetroleum Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and holds a BA in mathematics from Oxford University and an MEng in Petroleum Engineering from Heriot-Watt University. The RAR organisation reports directly to an Executive Vice President of Finance, who is a member of the Upstream Reserves Committee (URC). The URC is a multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior representatives from the Finance, Legal, Projects & Technology and Upstream organisations. The URC reviews and endorses all major (larger than 20 million barrels of oil equivalent) proved reserves bookings and de-bookings and endorses the total aggregated proved reserves. Final approval of all proved reserves bookings remains with Shell's Executive Committee, and all proved reserves bookings are reviewed by Shell's Audit Committee. The Internal Audit function also provides secondary assurance through audits of the control framework. /uni00A0\n\n## CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL AND BITUMEN\n\nShell subsidiaries' proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic crude oil and bitumen at the end of the year; their share of the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the end of the year; and the changes in such reserves during the year are set out on pages 266-268. Significant changes in these proved reserves are discussed below, where 'revisions and reclassifications' are changes based on new information that resulted from development drilling, production history, and changes in economic factors./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES 2020-2019 Shell subsidiaries\n\nThe net increase of 181 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Kazakhstan and Oman./uni00A0\n\n## Asia\n\n## USA\n\nThe net decrease of/uni00A0116 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications of which half was mainly in Permian and Belridge Light Oil./uni00A0\n\n## Canada\n\nThe net increase of 55 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Jackpine Mine and Muskeg River mine./uni00A0\n\n## South America\n\nThe net decrease of 82 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Brazil./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES 2019-2018 Shell subsidiaries\n\nThe net decrease of/uni00A065 million barrels in sales and purchases resulted from divestments carried out in Denmark./uni00A0\n\n## Europe\n\n## Asia\n\nThe net increase of/uni00A0226 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Oman and Kazakhstan.\n\n## USA\n\nThe increase of/uni00A086 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications mainly resulted from field performance studies and development activities in the Permian Basin and in the Mars and Ursa fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase of/uni00A074 million barrels in extensions and discoveries was in the Permian Basin and PowerNap./uni00A0\n\n## South America\n\nThe increase of 72 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications mainly resulted from field performance studies and development activities in the Lula (recently renamed Tupi) and Lapa fields (Brazil). The net increase of/uni00A060 million barrels in extensions and discoveries was mainly in Mero/uni00A0(Brazil).\n\nt\n\ns",

In our view, the information so calculated does not provide a reliable measure of future cash flows from proved reserves, nor does it permit a realistic comparison to be made of one entity with another because the assumptions used cannot reflect the varying circumstances within each entity. In addition, a substantial but unknown proportion of future real cash flows from oil and gas production activities is expected to derive from reserves which have already been discovered, but which cannot yet be regarded as proved./uni00A0\n\n## STANDARDISED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED RESERVES AT DECEMBER/uni00A031\n\n2020 -

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe Financial Statements of Royal Dutch Shell plc (the 'Company') have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act'). As applied to the Company, there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Financial/uni00A0Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0as/uni00A0issued by the IASB.\n\nAs described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nThe financial results of the Company are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 216-264. The financial results of the Company incorporate the results of the Dividend Access Trust (the 'Trust'), the financial statements of which are presented on pages 294-297.\n\nThe Company's principal activity is being the parent company for Shell, as/uni00A0described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 221).\n\n## 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Company's accounting policies follow those of Shell as set out in Note/uni00A02 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 221-229. The/uni00A0following are Company-specific policies./uni00A0\n\n## Presentation and functional currency\n\nThe Company's presentation and functional currency is US dollars (dollars).\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, net of any impairment. Investments are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those investments may not be recoverable. For the purposes of determining whether impairment of investments in subsidiaries has occurred, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal, the key assumptions management uses in estimating future cash flows for value-in-use measures include future oil and gas prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and expected product volumes and refining margins appropriate to the local circumstances and environment. These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Cash flow estimates are discounted at a rate based on Shell's marginal cost of debt. Changes in economic conditions can also affect the/uni00A0rate used to discount future cash flow estimates.\n\nThe original cost of the Company's investment in Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch) was based on the fair value of the shares transferred to the Company by the former shareholders of Royal Dutch in exchange for A shares in the Company during the public exchange offer in/uni00A02005. The original cost of the Company's investment in The 'Shell' Transport and Trading Company plc, now The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited (Shell Transport), was the fair value of the shares held by the former shareholders of The 'Shell' Transport and Trading Company plc, transferred in consideration for the issuance of B shares as part of the Scheme of Arrangement in 2005. The Company's investments in Royal Dutch and Shell Transport subsequently became an investment in Shell Petroleum N.V. (Shell Petroleum); this change had no impact on the cost of investments in subsidiaries. On February 15, 2016 the Company acquired all the voting rights in BG Group plc via the issuance of shares and cash payments of a total fair value $53,086 million. In September 2016, the Company's shares in BG Group Limited (BG), formerly BG Group plc, were exchanged for an increased investment in Shell Petroleum. This change had no impact on the cost of investment in/uni00A0subsidiaries.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividends are recognised on a paid basis unless the dividend has been confirmed by a general meeting of Shell Petroleum, in which case income is recognised on the date at which receipt is deemed virtually certain./uni00A0\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation for equity-settled plans granted to employees of subsidiaries under the Company's plans is recognised as an investment in subsidiaries from the date of grant over the/uni00A0vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nIn the year of vesting of a plan, the costs for the actual deliveries are charged to the relevant employing subsidiaries. This is recognised as a realisation of the investment originally booked. If the actual vesting costs are higher than the cumulatively recognised share-based compensation charge, the difference is recognised in income./uni00A0\n\nSee Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 256) for/uni00A0information on the Company's principal plan./uni00A0\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Company is tax-resident in the Netherlands. For the assessment of corporate income tax in the Netherlands, the Company and certain of its/uni00A0subsidiaries form a fiscal unit. The recognition and derecognition of deferred tax assets and or liabilities, as applicable, may be done either by/uni00A0the Company or by any of its subsidiary members. Any current tax receivable or payable (and deferred tax asset or liability) recognised by/uni00A0the Company for the fiscal unit as a whole is settled between the Company and other members of the fiscal unit at the balance sheet date. Balances not settled with the Company at the balance sheet date are recognised in the subsidiary member's financial statements and, to the extent they are material, are disclosed in the notes to the Company's financial statements./uni00A0\n\nThe Company's tax charge or credit recognised in the income statement is/uni00A0calculated at the statutory tax rate prevailing in the Netherlands for current tax and statutory tax rate substantively enacted in the Netherlands for deferred tax.",

As such, management has performed an impairment test in order to compare the carrying value of/uni00A0the investment in the Group to the associated value in use. Cash flow projections have been derived from internally approved business plans, and reflect management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with GHG emissions, product margins including refining margins and expected production volumes. Cash flows include a balanced view of risk arising from the integrated nature of the portfolio. The nominal pre-tax rate applied was 6% (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nOil and gas price assumptions applied for impairment testing are reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted on a periodic basis. Reviews include comparison with available market data and forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, policy measures and, in supply, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply, and behaviour of major resource/uni00A0holders. The near-term commodity price assumptions applied in impairment testing were as follows:\n\n## Commodity price assumptions [A]\n\n|                                 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |   2024 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent crude oil ($/b)           |   40   |   50   |  60    |  63    |\n| Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu) |    2.5 |    2.5 |   2.75 |   3.03 |\n\n[A] Money of the day.\n\nFor periods after 2024, the real-terms long-term price assumptions applied were $60 per barrel (/b) (2019: $60/b) for Brent crude oil and $3.00/uni00A0per/uni00A0million British thermal units (/MMBtu) (2019: $3.00/MMBtu) for Henry Hub natural gas, both at real-terms 2020.\n\nUnderlying cash flow forecasts used in determining value in use are consistent with those used to assess the recoverable amount of individual cash generating units in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBased on the impairment test analysis performed, management remains satisfied that the carrying amount of the investment remains recoverable under/uni00A0the reasonable range of anticipated outcomes.\n\n## 5 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n|                                           | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2020   | $ million Dec 31, 2019   | $ million Dec 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                           | Current        | Non-current    | Current                  | Non-current              |\n| Amounts due to subsidiaries (see Note 13) | 874            | -              | 750                      | -                        |\n| Accruals and other liabilities            | 44             | -              | 730                      | -                        |\n| Withholding tax payable                   | 322            | -              | 291                      | -                        |\n| Unclaimed dividends                       | 10             | -              | 4                        | -                        |\n| Total                                     | 1,250          | -              | 1,775                    | -                        |\n\nAccruals and other liabilities at December 31, 2019, principally comprise commitments for share repurchases undertaken on the Company's behalf under/uni00A0irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangements.

The Dutch Fiscal/uni00A0Unit has unrecognised unused tax losses amounting to $3,776 million (2019: $1,683 million) and unrecognised credits carried forward amounted to $349 million (2019: $273 million). Unused tax losses are available for relief against future taxable profits for a period of up to six to nine years, depending on the year in which the losses were incurred. Unused tax credits are available indefinitely. Under the proposed new tax legislation, which is/uni00A0not considered substantively enacted as at December 31, 2020, the losses are expected to be available indefinitely, to the extent not yet expired as/uni00A0at/uni00A0January 1, 2022.\n\n## 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost in the Company's Balance Sheet comprise amounts due from subsidiaries (see Note 13) and certain amounts reported within accounts payable and accrued liabilities (see Note 5). The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, approximates their carrying amount.\n\nInformation on financial risk management is presented in Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 251-255). Foreign currency derivatives are used by the Company to manage foreign exchange risk, which arises when certain transactions are denominated in a currency that is/uni00A0not/uni00A0the Company's functional currency. No derivative financial instruments were held at December 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019.",

This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 19, 2021, and the end of the AGM to be/uni00A0held in 2021, unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting./uni00A0\n\nAt the May 19, 2020 AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase up to 783 million ordinary shares (excluding any treasury shares), renewing the authority granted by the shareholders at previous AGMs. The authority will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 19, 2021 and the end of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2021. Ordinary shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this authority will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are owned by the Company itself. The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is \u20ac0.07. The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out./uni00A0\n\nOn March 23, 2020, in light of the economic and oil price environment, the Board decided not to continue with the next tranche of the share buyback programme following the completion of the tranche announced on January 30, 2020.\n\nA and B shares repurchased in 2020 under the Company's share buyback programme were all cancelled./uni00A0\n\nB shares rank equally in all respects with A shares except for the dividend access mechanism described below. The Company, Shell Transport and BG can procure the termination of the dividend access mechanism at any time. Upon such termination, B shares will form one class with A shares ranking equally in all respects and A and B shares will be known as ordinary shares without further distinction./uni00A0\n\nThe sterling deferred shares are redeemable only at the discretion of the Company for \u00a31 each and carry no voting rights. There are no further rights to participate in profits or assets, including the right to receive dividends. Upon winding up or liquidation, the shares carry a right to repayment of paid-up nominal value, ranking ahead of A and B shares./uni00A0\n\nFor information on the number of shares in the Company held by Shell employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities to meet delivery commitments under employee share plans, see Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 256)./uni00A0\n\n## Dividend access mechanism for B shares General\n\nDividends paid on A shares have a Dutch source for tax purposes and are subject to Dutch withholding tax.\n\nIt is the expectation and the intention, although there can be no certainty, that holders of B shares will receive dividends through the dividend access mechanism. Any dividends paid on the dividend access shares will have a/uni00A0UK source for UK and Dutch tax purposes. There will be no Dutch withholding tax on such dividends. From April 2016, there were changes to the taxation of dividends for individual shareholders resident in the UK. The dividend tax credit was abolished, and a tax-free dividend allowance introduced.\n\n## Description of dividend access mechanism\n\nShell Transport and BG have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited as Trustee. Pursuant to a declaration of trust, the Trustee will hold any dividends paid in respect of the dividend access shares on trust for the holders of B shares and will arrange for prompt disbursement of such dividends to holders of B shares. Interest and other income earned on unclaimed dividends will be for the account of Shell Transport and BG and any dividends which are unclaimed after 12 years will revert to Shell Transport and BG once forfeited. Holders of B shares will not have any interest in either dividend access share and will not have any rights against Shell Transport and BG as issuers of the dividend access shares. The only assets held on trust for the benefit of the holders of B shares will be dividends paid to the Trustee in respect of the dividend access shares./uni00A0\n\nThe declaration and payment of dividends on the dividend access shares will require board action by Shell Transport and BG (as applicable) and will be subject to any applicable limitations in law or in the Shell Transport or BG (as appropriate) articles of association in effect. In no event will the aggregate amount of the dividend paid by Shell Transport and BG under the dividend access mechanism for a particular period exceed the aggregate of the dividend announced by the Board of the Company on B shares in respect of the same period (after giving effect to currency/uni00A0conversions)./uni00A0\n\nIn particular, under their respective articles of association, Shell Transport and BG are each only able to pay a dividend on their respective dividend access shares which represents a proportional amount of the aggregate of any dividend announced by the Company on the B shares in respect of the relevant period, where such proportions are calculated by reference to, in the case of Shell Transport, the number of B shares in existence prior to completion of the Company's acquisition of BG and, in the case of BG, the number of B shares issued as part of the acquisition, in each case as against the total number of B shares in issue immediately following completion of the acquisition of BG./uni00A0\n\nt\n\ns",

The right of holders of B shares to receive distributions from the Trustee will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any payment actually made by the Company on account of any dividend on B shares./uni00A0\n\nIf for any reason no dividend is paid on the dividend access shares, holders of B shares will only receive dividends from the Company directly. Any payment by the Company will be subject to Dutch withholding tax (unless an exemption is obtained under Dutch law or under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty).\n\n## 9 OTHER RESERVES\n\n|                          | Merger  reserve   | Share  premium  reserve   | Capital  redemption  reserve   | Share  plan  reserve   | Total   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| At January 1, 2020       | 234,231           | 154                       | 123                            | 1,053                  | 235,561 |\n| Repurchases of shares    | -                 | -                         | 6                              | -                      | 6       |\n| Share-based compensation | -                 | -                         | -                              | (148)                  | (148)   |\n| At December 31, 2020     | 234,231           | 154                       | 129                            | 905                    | 235,419 |\n| At January 1, 2019       | 234,231           | 154                       | 95                             | 1,056                  | 235,536 |\n| Repurchases of shares    | -                 | -                         | 28                             | -                      | 28      |\n| Share-based compensation | -                 | -                         | -                              | (3)                    | (3)     |\n| At December 31, 2019     | 234,231           | 154                       | 123                            | 1,053                  | 235,561 |\n\nThe Dutch tax treatment of dividends paid under the dividend access mechanism has been confirmed by the Dutch Revenue Service in an agreement (vaststellingsovereenkomst) with the Company and N.V. Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij (Royal Dutch Petroleum Company) dated October 26, 2004, as supplemented and amended by an agreement between the same parties dated April 25, 2005, and a final settlement agreement in connection with the acquisition of BG dated November 9, 2015. The agreements state, among other things, that dividend distributions on the dividend access shares by Shell Transport and/or BG will not be subject to Dutch withholding tax provided that the dividend access mechanism is structured and operated substantially as set out above./uni00A0\n\nThe Company may not extend the dividend access mechanism to any future issuances of B shares without prior consultation with the Dutch Revenue Service./uni00A0\n\nAccordingly, the Company would not expect to issue additional B shares unless confirmation from the Dutch Revenue Service was obtained or the Company were to determine that the continued operation of the dividend access mechanism was unnecessary. Any further issue of B shares is subject to advance consultation with the Dutch Revenue Service./uni00A0\n\nThe dividend access mechanism may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company's Directors or the Directors of Shell Transport or BG, for any reason and without financial recompense. This might, for instance, occur in response to changes in relevant tax legislation./uni00A0\n\n$ million\n\nThe merger reserve was established as a consequence of the Company becoming the single parent company of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport and/uni00A0represented the difference between the cost of the investment in those companies and the nominal value of shares issued in exchange for those investments as required by the prevailing legislation at that time, section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. On February 15, 2016, the Company acquired all shares in BG Group plc by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Act, via the issuance of 218.7 million A shares and 1,305.1 million B shares and cash payments. This resulted in an increase in the merger reserve, representing the difference between the fair value and the nominal value/uni00A0of the shares issued by the Company./uni00A0\n\nOn January 6, 2006, loan notes were converted into 4,827,974 A shares. The difference between the carrying value of the loan notes and the nominal/uni00A0value of the new shares issued was credited to the share premium reserve. The capital redemption reserve was established in connection with/uni00A0repurchases of shares of the Company. The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 21 to the/uni00A0Consolidated Financial Statements) and movement in share-based compensation for the year is the net of the charge to equity and the release as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result of vested awards./uni00A0",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued/uni00A0by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Royal Dutch Shell Divided Access Trust's (the Trust) affairs as at December 31, 2020 and of its income for the year then ended; and have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for/uni00A0the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustee of/uni00A0Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust's (the Trustee) use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or/uni00A0collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern until 31 March 2022 (the going concern period).\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to/uni00A0going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this/uni00A0statement is not a guarantee as to the company's ability to continue as/uni00A0a going concern.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Board of Directors of Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Directors) are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the/uni00A0Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to/uni00A0determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we/uni00A0are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Trustee\n\nThe Trustee is responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Trustee determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, the Trustee is responsible for assessing the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Trustee either intends to liquidate the Trust or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial/uni00A0statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a/uni00A0guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\n- \u25a0 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Trust and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934).\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or/uni00A0through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both the Trustee and those charged with governance of Royal Dutch Shell plc and its management.\n\n- \u25a0 We understood how the Trust is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of the Trustee, Royal Dutch Shell plc management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures over the Trust. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Resolutions of the Trust Committee of the Trustee, papers provided to the Royal Dutch Shell plc Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.",

We considered the programmes and design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls that the Trustee and Royal Dutch Shell plc have established to prevent and detect fraud over the Trust and how the Trustee, Royal Dutch Shell plc management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures over the Trust monitor/uni00A0those programmes and controls.\n- \u25a0 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to/uni00A0identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved review of Resolutions of the Trust Committee of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Trustee and Royal Dutch Shell plc Audit Committee minutes to identify noncompliance with laws and regulations, journal entry testing with a focus on journals meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the Trust and enquiries of the Trustee, Royal Dutch Shell plc management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures over the Trust.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part/uni00A0of our auditor's report.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Trustee and the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell plc as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Trustee and the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell plc those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Trustee and the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell plc as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## /s/ Paul Sater/uni00A0\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London/uni00A0 March/uni00A010, 2021/uni00A0\n\nt\n\ns",

The Trust is governed by the applicable laws of England and Wales and is resident and domiciled in Jersey. The Trust is not subject to taxation. The Trustee of the Trust is Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, registration number 92182 (the/uni00A0'Trustee'), 13 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 1ES. The Trust was/uni00A0established as part of a dividend access mechanism./uni00A0\n\nShell Transport and BG Group Limited (BG), have each issued a dividend access share to the Trustee. Following the announcement of a dividend by the Company on the B shares, Shell Transport and BG may declare a dividend on their dividend access shares./uni00A0\n\nThe primary purposes of the Trust are to receive, on behalf of the B shareholders of the Company and in accordance with their respective holdings of B shares in the Company, any amounts paid by way of dividend on the dividend access shares and to pay such amounts to the/uni00A0B/uni00A0shareholders on the same pro rata basis. The Trust is not subject to/uni00A0significant market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk./uni00A0\n\nThe Trust shall not endure for a period in excess of 80 years from May 19, 2005, being the date on which the Trust Deed was executed./uni00A0\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe Financial Statements of the Trust have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

The Trust's dividend income and dividends paid are principally in sterling.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividends on the dividend access shares are recognised on a paid basis unless the dividend has been confirmed by a general meeting of Shell Transport or BG, in which case income is recognised on the date on which receipt is deemed virtually certain. Dividend income includes amounts receivable from Shell Transport and BG in respect of dividends declared but unclaimed (see Note 4).\n\n## Distributions made\n\nAmounts are recorded as distributed once a payment is made in the appropriate currency using various electronic transfer methods, or an unconditional payment obligation is established. Shell Transport or BG (as/uni00A0appropriate) may, each at their respective discretion, withhold any part of the funding relating to an unpayable dividend until such time as the/uni00A0relevant B shareholder provides accurate or complete details for payment of any such dividend.\n\n## 4 UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS\n\nUnclaimed dividends of \u00a37 million (2019: \u00a33 million) include any pre-electronic transfer dividend cheque payments that have not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have been returned unpresented. Dividends are also classified as unclaimed where amounts have been withheld due to incomplete or incorrect electronic payment details. Dividends which are unclaimed after 12 years will unconditionally revert to Shell Transport and BG once forfeited./uni00A0\n\n## 5 CAPITAL ACCOUNT\n\nThe capital account is represented by the dividend access share of 25 pence settled in the Trust by Shell Transport and the dividend access share of 10 pence settled in the Trust by BG. There have been no changes in the capital account in the current or prior year./uni00A0\n\n## 6 DISTRIBUTIONS MADE\n\nDistributions are made to the B shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Trust Deed.

Holders of ADSs will not have shareholder rights. The rights of the holder of an A or a B ADS are specified in the Deposit Agreement with the Depositary and are summarised below./uni00A0\n\nThe Depositary will receive all cash dividends and other cash distributions made on the deposited shares underlying the ADSs and, where possible and on a reasonable basis, will distribute such dividends and distributions to holders of ADSs. Rights to purchase additional shares will also be made available to the Depositary who may make such rights available to holders of ADSs. All other distributions made on the Company's shares will be distributed by the Depositary in any means that the Depositary thinks is equitable and practical. The Depositary may deduct its fees and expenses and the amount of any taxes owed from any payments to holders and it may sell a holder's deposited shares to pay any taxes owed. The Depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to holders of ADSs. /uni00A0\n\nThe Depositary will notify holders of ADSs of shareholders' meetings of the/uni00A0Company and will arrange to deliver voting materials to such holders of ADSs if requested by the Company. Upon request by a holder, the Depositary will endeavour to appoint such holder as proxy in respect of such holder's deposited shares entitling such holder to attend and vote at\n\nshareholders' meetings. Holders of ADSs may also instruct the Depositary to vote their deposited securities and the Depositary will try, as far as practical and lawful, to vote deposited shares in accordance with such instructions. The Company cannot ensure that holders will receive voting materials or otherwise learn of an upcoming shareholders' meeting in time to ensure that holders can instruct the Depositary to vote their shares. /uni00A0\n\nUpon payment of appropriate fees, expenses and taxes: (i)/uni00A0shareholders may deposit their shares with the Depositary and receive the corresponding class and amount of ADSs; and (ii)/uni00A0holders of ADSs may surrender their ADSs to the Depositary and have the corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account. /uni00A0\n\nFurther, subject to certain limitations, holders may, at any time, cancel ADSs and withdraw their underlying shares or have the corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account. /uni00A0\n\n## FEES PAID BY HOLDERS OF ADS s\n\nThe Depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The Depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The Depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid. See page 301. /uni00A0\n\n## PAYMENTS BY DEPOSITARY TO THE COMPANY\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Depositary, has agreed to share with the Company portions of certain fees collected, less ADS programme expenses paid by the Depositary. For example, these expenses include the Depositary's annual programme fees, transfer agency fees, custody fees, legal expenses, postage and envelopes for mailing annual and interim financial reports, printing and distributing dividend cheques, electronic filing of US federal tax information, mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimile and telephone calls and the standard out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the ADSs. From January/uni00A01, 2020, to/uni00A0February 12, 2021, the Company received $6,418,504.69 from the/uni00A0Depositary. /uni00A0",

As a tax resident of the Netherlands, it is generally required by Dutch law to withhold tax at a rate of 15% on dividends on its ordinary shares and ADSs, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax convention or domestic law. Depending on their particular circumstances, non-Dutch tax-resident holders may be entitled to a full or partial refund of Dutch withholding tax. The following sets forth the operation of other provisions on dividends on the Company's various ordinary shares and ADSs to UK and US holders, as well as certain other tax rules pertinent to holders. Holders should consult their own tax adviser if they are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividend. /uni00A0\n\n## Dividends paid on the dividend access shares\n\nThere is no Dutch withholding tax on dividends on B shares or B ADSs, provided that such dividends are paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism (see 'Dividend access\n\nmechanism for B shares' on page 289). Dividends paid on the dividend access shares are treated as UK-source for tax purposes and there is no UK withholding tax on them. /uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, all dividends with respect to B shares and B ADSs were paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism.\n\n## Dutch withholding tax\n\n- \u25a0 if the US holder is an exempt pension trust as described in article 35/uni00A0of the Convention, or an exempt organisation as described in article 36 thereof, the US holder will be exempt from Dutch withholding tax; or /uni00A0\n\nWhen Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to a US holder (that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B shares or B ADSs that are not paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism), the US holder will be subject to Dutch withholding tax at the rate of 15%. A US holder who is entitled to the benefits of the 1992 Double Taxation Convention (the Convention) between the USA and the Netherlands as amended by the protocol signed on March/uni00A08, 2004, will be entitled to a reduction in the Dutch withholding tax, either by way of a full or a partial exemption at source or by way of a partial refund or a credit as follows: /uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 if the US holder is a company that holds directly at least 10% of the voting power in the Company, the US holder will be subject to Dutch withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 5%. /uni00A0\n\nIn general, the entire dividend (including any amount withheld) will be dividend income to the US holder and the withholding tax will be treated as a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against the US holder's income tax liability or a deduction subject to certain limitations. A 'US/uni00A0holder' includes, but is not limited to, a citizen or resident of the USA, or a corporation or other entity organised under the laws of the USA or any of its political subdivisions. /uni00A0\n\nWhen Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to UK tax-resident holders (that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B shares or B/uni00A0ADSs that are not paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism), the dividend will typically be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15%. Such UK tax-resident holder may be entitled to a credit (not repayable) for withholding tax against their UK tax/uni00A0liability. However, certain corporate shareholders are, subject to conditions, exempt from UK/uni00A0tax on dividends. Withholding tax suffered cannot be offset against such exempt dividends. UK tax-resident holders should also be entitled to claim a refund of one-third of the Dutch withholding tax from the Dutch tax authorities in reliance on the tax convention between the Netherlands and the UK. Pension plans meeting certain defined criteria can, however, be entitled to claim a full refund or exemption at source of the dividend tax withheld. Also, UK tax-resident corporate shareholders holding at least a 5% shareholding and meeting other defined criteria are exempted at source from dividend tax. /uni00A0\n\nn",

A sale of the Company's ordinary shares that are not held within a clearance service (for example, settled through the UK's CREST system of paperless transfers) will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount of the consideration, normally paid by the purchaser./uni00A0\n\nFor the purposes of UK capital gains tax, the market values [A] of the shares of the former public parent companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group at the relevant dates were:/uni00A0\n\n|                                                                                                                                  |   March 31, 1982 | July 20, 2005   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (N.V.

CCS earnings therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. The current cost of supplies adjustment does not impact cash flow from operating activities in the 'Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows'.\n\n## Reconciliation of income for the period to CCS earnings\n\n|                                                                          | 2020     | 2019   | $ million 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|------------------|\n| Income/(loss) attributable to Royal Dutch  Shell/uni00A0plc shareholders | (21,680) | 15,842 | 23,352           |\n| Income/(loss) attributable to  non-controlling interest                  | 146      | 590    | 554              |\n| Income/(loss) for the period                                             | (21,534) | 16,432 | 23,906           |\n| Current cost of supplies adjustment                                      | 1,833    | (605)  | 458              |\n| Of which:                                                                |          |        |                  |\n| Attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders                       | 1,759    | (572)  | 481              |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interest                                 | 74       | (33)   | (23)             |\n| CCS earnings                                                             | (19,701) | 15,827 | 24,364           |\n| Of which:                                                                |          |        |                  |\n| Attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders                       | (19,921) | 15,270 | 23,833           |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interest                                 | 220      | 557    | 531              |\n\n## ADJUSTED EARNINGS\n\nThe 'Adjusted Earnings' measure aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items.

Under/uni00A0these rules, regular settlement will occur on a T+2 basis for trades occurring on or after the SEC's implementation date of September 5, 2017. As a result, RDS A ADSs and RDS B ADSs traded/uni00A0on/uni00A0the NYSE markets will now settle in line with RDS A shares and RDS B shares traded on European markets, which moved to a T+2 settlement basis for trades in 2014, resulting in the same/uni00A0ex-dividend/uni00A0date for RDS A shares, RDS B shares, RDS A ADSs and RDS B ADSs. Record dates will not change. The timings of these are detailed above.\n- [E]  A different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.\n\n## CONTACT US\n\nThe best way to get in touch is via the 'Contact us' section of the Shell website.
