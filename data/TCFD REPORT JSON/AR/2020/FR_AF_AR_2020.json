The Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our lives. In its long history, this is the most severe crisis ever experienced by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and by the airline industry as a whole. Our 2020 financial results confirmed this.\n\nAs the crisis developed, Air France, KLM, Transavia, HOP! and KLM Cityhopper demonstrated their strategic national and European importance, which has been our true strength since our creation. We repatriated our fellow French, Dutch and European citizens, reuniting them with friends and family. Our Cargo teams continue to transport medical equipment and vaccines to combat the epidemic. We have maintained vital links for people, trade and economies.\n\nFrom the beginning of the crisis, we worked closely with our two main shareholders, the French and Dutch governments, to obtain their financial support to help us weather the e/ffects of an extraordinary crisis. With this support comes a major responsibility: that of achieving a successful transformation to return to an adequate level of profitability while accelerating our transition towards a sustainable aviation model.\n\nWe have defined a clear strategy for the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group to adapt to a changed world, with one sole objective: return to our path towards leadership. Right from the start, we implemented the decisive actions vital to our survival from this crisis: very strict cost control, a reduction in CAPEX, the early phase-out of the Boeing 747s at KLM and the Airbus A340s and A380s at Air/uni00A0France, the implementation of wage support programs at both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, together with Voluntary Departure Plans for the two companies. In total, more than 200/uni00A0transformation and operational e/fficiency projects were launched within the Group and the airlines in 2020.\n\n''  IN A SECTOR THAT HAS BEEN LEFT REELING, IT IS THE AIR FRANCE/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM GROUP OF TOMORROW THAT WE MUST BUILD AS OF TODAY.''",

Customer expectations will be di/fferent with a greater focus on the environmental and societal responsibility, on the health and safety, which has gradually become part of our everyday practice, and an increased need for commercial flexibility.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is also committed to playing a pioneering role in sustainable aviation, in both the ground and flight operations. The Group is redoubling its e/fforts to reduce its environmental footprint and achieve its target of a 50% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2030. In particular, it is contributing to the establishment of a sustainable biofuel industry for aviation.\n\nAviation will continue to play a major role in the years to come. I have every confidence in our ability to rise to the challenges of our industry. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's 76,000/uni00A0employees are fully committed to making our Group a leader in European aviation.\n\nBenjamin Smith Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR FRANCE-KLM IN 2020\n\n34\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n900k\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n546\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n300 DESTINATIONS\n\n116 COUNTRIES SERVED\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2020 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\n## Coronavirus public health crisis\n\nThe current Covid-19 pandemic had a significantly negative impact on the Group's operational activities, financial position and results during the 2020 financial year and is expected to continue to adversely impact the Group in the near future.\n\nSince February/uni00A02020, the Group's activities have been strongly a/ffected by the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic. Qualified as a pandemic by the WHO on March/uni00A011, 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in the implementation of numerous restrictive measures to limit its spread. The measures put in place by the public authorities in many countries have notably led to the temporary suspension of airline operations and the significant reduction or suspension of travel, particularly bound for or near destinations where the virus is circulating, thereby having a material and negative impact on the Group's activity in the countries where it operates. Intercontinental and business travel has been particularly badly a/ffected by these regulatory restrictions and by the cost-saving plans of the Group's corporate customers. For the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's passenger tra/ffic (measured in thousands of passengers) thus fell by more than 66% compared to the previous year.\n\nIn view of these travel restrictions and the collapse in passenger tra/ffic and sales, since March/uni00A02020 the Group has been forced significantly to reduce its capacity and, notably, drastically curtail its flight operations.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Group's capacity (in millions of ASK) was thus reduced by 54% relative to the previous year.\n\nThis health crisis had a very strong impact on the Group's activity and results in the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, with an operating result of \u20ac(4.5) billion (versus \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion in 2019).\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also implemented significant cost-saving measures, in terms of staff reductions and the curtailment of non-essential investment and expenditure, whose implementation could damage the Group's reputation owing to negative reactions from the public authorities or unfavorable media coverage, or even lead to labor disputes with a negative impact on the Group's activity. Within this context, at the end of 2020, the reduction represented more than 7,000/uni00A0Full Time Equivalents (FTE) and more departures are expected through to the end of 2022 within the framework of the restructuring.\n\nThe Group also implemented various measures to reinforce its cash and liquidity position and, notably, at Air/uni00A0France, a loan guaranteed by the French State (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat\n\nFran\u00e7ais - PGE) in the total amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion granted by a syndicate of nine banks and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State: these two loans were fully drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020. At KLM, the measures mainly involved a revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State (of which \u20ac665/uni00A0million was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020) and a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion (of which \u20ac277/uni00A0million was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020). The Group also implemented budget measures in recent months to preserve its cash position, including a \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion downwards revision in the 2020 capex plan, a reduction in operational and payroll costs, the suspension of all projects not linked to safety or critical operations and a significant reduction in the use of outside consultants and sta/ff.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's net debt stood at \u20ac11/uni00A0billion.\n\n## On January/uni00A06, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group launched a Tender O/ffer to repurchase three series of existing notes subject to the success of a new issue of senior fixed rate 'Benchmark' notes with a five-year maturity.\n\nThe three series of notes comprised, firstly, a \u20ac600/uni00A0million principal amount of senior notes maturing on June/uni00A018, 2021 and bearing a fixed coupon of 3.875% (ISIN: FR0011965177), secondly \u20ac400/uni00A0million in senior notes maturing on October/uni00A012, 2022 and bearing a fixed coupon of 3.750% (ISIN: FR0013212958) and, lastly, a \u20ac600/uni00A0million initial principal amount of Undated Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate Resettable Notes bearing a fixed coupon of 6.250%, of which \u20ac403.3/uni00A0million was outstanding (ISIN: FR0012650281).\n\nOn January/uni00A010, 2020, after two days of investor road shows, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM successfully placed the new issue of senior notes (ISIN: FR0013477254) in the amount of \u20ac750/uni00A0million, with a five-year maturity and bearing an annual coupon of 1.875%.\n\nThe net proceeds from this new issue were used partly for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's general corporate purposes and partly to fund the repurchase of the notes subscribed to the cash Tender O/ffer, which closed on January/uni00A013, 2020 and whose results were announced on January/uni00A014, 2020, as follows:\n\nExisting Notes for a total principal amount of \u20ac677.7/uni00A0million (representing 48.3% of the outstanding Existing Notes) were tendered to the Tender O/ffer, of which \u20ac350/uni00A0million were accepted, composed of \u20ac311.2/uni00A0million of 2021 Notes; and \u20ac38.8/uni00A0million in 2022 Notes. No subordinated perpetual notes were repurchased by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.",

The settlement and delivery of the Tender O/ffer combined with the net proceeds on the new bonds issued took place on January/uni00A016, 2020.\n\nThis transaction was part of the Company's ongoing dynamic management of the Group's debt maturity profile while contributing to reducing its overall cost.\n\n## Sale of Amadeus shares\n\nOn January/uni00A09, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM sold its remaining shares in the Spanish company Amadeus IT Holding SA ('Amadeus') for \u20ac356/uni00A0million. At December/uni00A031, 2019, the fair value of the shares had amounted to \u20ac360/uni00A0million. Since the whole of the 1.11% shareholding in Amadeus was hedged, the transaction had no impact on the 2020 income statement. The proceeds on the sale are included in the line 'Proceeds on shares of subsidiaries, of shares in non-controlled companies' in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Launch of a major international partnership between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic: the expanded joint-venture enables customers to benefit from more destinations and ways to earn and spend frequent flyer Miles\n\nOn February/uni00A03, 2020, Air/uni00A0 France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic launched their expanded joint-venture o/ffering a wider choice of routes and loyalty options on travel between Europe, the United Kingdom and North America.\n\nThis new partnership enables customers to benefit from more convenient flight schedules and a shared goal of ensuring a smooth and consistent travel experience, whichever airline people fly. The new benefits have been accessible from February/uni00A013. Loyalty program customers can earn and use miles or enjoy elite benefits for flights on any of the four airlines' worldwide operations, including transatlantic trips, intra-European hops or domestic US journey, o/ffering more opportunities to quickly move up through the loyalty tiers and reach a higher status. Eligible elite loyalty program members can enjoy priority boarding and access to more than 100/uni00A0airport lounges when traveling internationally.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France signs a majority agreement with the SNPL (main pilots' union) for the development of Transavia France on the domestic network\n\nOn August/uni00A012, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group took an important step in its development, with the signature of an amendment to the Group's 'Air/uni00A0France-Transavia pilot agreement', allowing Transavia France to operate domestic routes within France.\n\nThis agreement was signed between Air/uni00A0France, Transavia France and the SNPL Air/uni00A0France-Transavia, the union representing a majority of Air/uni00A0France pilots, following a referendum submitted to its members. The turnout rate and vote in favor of the proposal at a respective 82.63% and 90.37% reflect the responsibility the pilots are taking during this crucial juncture and the overall desire of the stakeholders to provide Air/uni00A0France with the means to weather the Covid-19 crisis and emerge stronger by transforming its domestic network. This network has been loss-making for several years despite continuous restructuring since the 2000s and is facing intense competitive pressure within the framework of the relentless growth of the low-cost airlines and the TGV high-speed train network.\n\nThis amendment to the Group agreement permits Transavia to operate routes within France and adjusts the guarantees of the medium-haul activity in line with the levels of activity expected on the domestic network in the coming years. In September/uni00A02019, a first agreement had already been signed lifting restrictions on the growth of the Transavia France fleet.\n\nLaunched in 2006, Transavia France is the low-cost airline of the Air/uni00A0France Group (composed of Air/uni00A0France, its regional subsidiary HOP! and its low-cost subsidiary Transavia. The Air/uni00A0France Group is a subsidiary of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group). It constitutes a major strategic asset for the Group in that it enables Air/uni00A0France to take advantage of the buoyancy of the leisure market in France and to respond to competition from international low-cost operators in an e/fficient and appropriate way.\n\nThe growth of Transavia France on the French domestic market is a key step in the Air/uni00A0France Group's strategic plan to improve its financial performance. With this new o/ffer, the Air/uni00A0France Group gains the resources to be competitive in each market segment in which it operates, with the right tools and a model and product adapted to each of them.\n\nThe planned reorganization of the short-haul operations is also part of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's drive to step up its sustainability e/fforts, which are already among the most ambitious in the industry. Domestic routes between Paris-Orly and the French regions will be closed when there is a train alternative in less than 2h30 and the fleet will be renewed at a sustained pace with the arrival of the first Airbus A220-300s starting in September/uni00A02021. These next-generation aircraft are one of the main levers used by Air/uni00A0France to reduce its carbon footprint and will reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 20% compared to the Airbus A318s and A319s they will replace. Air/uni00A0France will also continue to proactively o/ffset all its customers'/uni00A0CO2 emissions on domestic flights.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Amadeus sign an agreement enabling modern retailing via NDC\n\nSince September/uni00A010, 2020, travel agents have had access to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's NDC services via the Amadeus Travel platform.",

On September/uni00A010, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and Amadeus announced an innovative NDC distribution deal. The agreement means that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM NDC o/ffers can be made available to travel agents through the Amadeus Travel platform and its NDC-enabled solutions. To access Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM content distributed via NDC, agents will need to sign bilateral agreements with Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Amadeus.\n\nOver the last few years, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been working with Amadeus to connect its NDC services to the Amadeus Travel platform. The prime booking flow of shop, order, pay has already been integrated, meaning pilot travel agents will be able to book via NDC through the platform by the end of the year.

        "page_content": "## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\n## Covid-19 - Impact post February/uni00A02021\n\nIn early 2021, the public health crisis continues to significantly impact the Group's activity.\n\nIn view of the pandemic's progressive spread and the unfolding developments, the current and future measures implemented by governments in numerous countries could continue to disrupt the Group's activity for an indeterminate period. Within this context, several countries in which the Group operates, including France and the Netherlands, again implemented lockdowns and other health measures at the end of 2020 in response to the growing spread of the pandemic. Given the uncertainties inherent in any health crisis, the Group does not expect this situation to stabilize in the short term: the Group's baseline scenario is a return to the pre-crisis level of capacity in 2024.\n\nAfter positive Christmas tra/ffic in Domestic France and to the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, travel restrictions were tightened in France, the Netherlands and worldwide, having a negative impact on the Group's tra/ffic in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nDue to the lockdowns and travel restrictions still in force, the Group anticipates a challenging first quarter 2021, with an EBITDA lower than in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nVisibility on the demand recovery curve remains limited as customer booking behavior is much more short-term oriented and also highly dependent on the imposed travel restrictions, on both the long-haul and medium-haul networks.\n\nIn this context, due to the negative environment, the Group expects capacity in Available Seat-Kilometers at circa index 40 for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in the first quarter 2021 compared to the first quarter 2019 for the Passenger Network business.\n\nThe Group will progressively ramp up capacity towards summer 2021 and expects tra/ffic to recover in the second and third quarters of 2021 thanks to vaccine deployment.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM launches its 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program dedicated to corporate customers\n\nOn January/uni00A026, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM launched an innovative program enabling companies to play an active role in the future of sustainable travel.\n\nAfter an estimate of the CO2 emissions associated with their travel, Air/uni00A0France and KLM corporate customers will be able to determine an annual contribution they wish to devote to the Corporate SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) program. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group will invest all of these funds in the sourcing and consumption of SAF. This will support the creation of a sustainable aviation fuel industry that guarantees increasingly eco-responsible air transportation.\n\nBy investing in this Corporate program, companies are taking concrete action to reduce CO2 emissions and are contributing to the ecological transition of air transportation by accompanying and supporting innovative solutions.\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have been involved in research and development programs in the field of alternative fuels. In 2011, the two airlines were among the first to operate commercial flights, demonstrating a possible alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nSustainable aviation fuels can currently be made from waste oils, waste products and forest residues. They can be incorporated into jet fuel without any engine modifications. Their use can reduce emissions by more than 85% compared to conventional fuel. Today's main challenge is the development of a sustainable industry to which Air/uni00A0France and KLM's corporate customers will be able to make a very concrete contribution.\n\nAt a time when awareness of climate issues is at the heart of the strategy of many companies, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Corporate SAF program gives customers the opportunity to become players in the reduction of CO2 emissions within the context of their business trips.\n\n## The Paris region, Choose Paris Region, the ADP Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Airbus launch a ground-breaking call for expressions of interest on hydrogen in Paris airports\n\nOn February/uni00A011, 2021, the Paris region, Choose Paris Region, the ADP Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Airbus launched a ground-breaking call for expressions of interest to explore the opportunities o/ffered by hydrogen in Paris airports, aimed at decarbonizing air transportation activities.\n\nThis worldwide call for expressions of interest complies with the French Government's energy transition strategy and is supported by the European Commission, which is striving for zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Aware that the advent of hydrogen will revolutionize the way in which airport infrastructure is designed and operated, the partners want to anticipate and support developments that should help transform the Paris airports into true 'hydrogen hubs'. The international call for expressions of interest - launched with the support of the Choose Paris Region agency, in charge of the international promotion and attractiveness of the Paris Region - aims to build a unique airport ecosystem federated around hydrogen, major corporations, SMEs, start-ups, laboratories and universities.\n\nThis open innovation initiative is a key step in initiating this technological breakthrough across the entire hydrogen value chain within the airport city. The five partners share a common",

The o/ffering will be composed of a private placement to institutional investors, a public o/ffering and a priority period allowing all shareholders to support this transaction;\n- -  the French State commits to participate in the capital increase while keeping its stake strictly below 30% of the share capital and voting rights;\n- -  China Eastern Airlines intends to participate while keeping its stake strictly below 10% of share capital, as part of further reinforcement of strategical cooperation with the Group;\n- -  the Dutch State which holds 14.0% of the share capital, has informed the Group that it will not subscribe to this capital increase;\n- -  Delta Airlines which holds 8.8% of the share capital, has informed the Group that it will not subscribe to this capital",

The hybrid perpetual bond instruments fully subscribed by the French State and resulting from this first step recapitalization could be used to compensate in part, by way of netting, to future equity and or quasi-equity raisings by the Group.\n\nThe objective of such additional measures will be to further reinforce the Group's equity situation and reduce its Net Debt/ EBITDA ratio circa 2.0x by 2023. In order to achieve this, specific delegations would be then required and submitted at the Group's next General Meeting, scheduled on May/uni00A026.\n\nAdditionally, the French State-backed loan (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - 'PGE') of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion has been extended with a final maturity date in 2023. The Dutch State-backed loan guaranteed loan of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion has a maturity date in 2025. These elements enable smoothen the debt redemption profile of the Group and the airlines a smooth extension of the debt maturity profile of the Group.\n\n## Commitments made in order to comply with the European Commission's 'Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak' (TF)\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be subject to commitments made by the French government in order to comply with the European Commission's 'Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak' (TF).\n\nThese commitments, specifically paragraphs 60-61 and 71-78/uni00A0 of the TF,  include Air/uni00A0France's release of up to 18/uni00A0take-o/ff and landing rights (slots) at Paris-Orly airport to a competing carrier in order to create or develop an existing base at that airport, provided that the competing carrier obtaining Air/uni00A0France's slots bases its aircraft and crews at Paris-Orly airport, in compliance with national and EU labour laws. Other general commitments were made under the TF, including restrictions on acquisitions, share buy-backs dividend distributions and executive management's remuneration. These commitments are applicable to the entire Group with the exception of KLM and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group has reiterated the economic, financial and environmental commitments made in the framework of the State loan and reflected in its transformation plan. The Group therefore maintains an ambitious environmental roadmap to accelerate the Group's sustainable transition, in line with the objectives of the National Low Carbon Strategy (Strat\u00e9gie Nationale Bas Carbone 'SNBC').\n\n'Today's announcement demonstrates both the strong commitment of the French State and the renewed support of the Dutch State to help the Group weather this pandemic and this crisis,' said Anne-Marie Couderc, Chair of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors. 'The commitment of our long-standing partner China Eastern Airlines to participate in the forthcoming capital increase also highlights a resolute confidence in the strengths and prospects of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.'\n\n'These first recapitalization measures are an important milestone for our Group in this exceptionally challenging period,' said Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group CEO, Benjamin Smith . 'They will provide Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM with greater stability to move forward when recovery starts, as large-scale vaccination progresses around the world and borders reopen. Ensuring Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM maintains a sustainable financial trajectory is paramount to realizing our strategic plan, continuing the execution of our transformation plans at the Group and at our airlines. I would like to thank our employees for their engagement and their responsibility throughout this crisis. We will continue to work together to drive new e/fficiencies as we seek to lower unit costs and emerge stronger when the industry rebounds with the ambition to achieve European leadership'.",

It should be noted that in the first two months of 2021, operating result and EBITDA were significantly better than the Group's budgeted assumptions, and capital expenditure was also 10% below budget over that period, reflecting the e/ffective control introduced by management on CAPEX, allowing the Group to have a solid 8.8/uni00A0 billion euros of liquidity and credit lines at disposal at February/uni00A028,/uni00A02021.\n\nOver the coming months, and in particular at the beginning of the summer, the Group still expects a significant recovery in demand, assuming the positive e/ffects of the accelerated vaccination campaigns in several countries could trigger less stringent restrictions on passenger travel across those countries.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis press release is for information purposes only and does not constitute an o/ffer to sell or a solicitation to purchase any securities in any jurisdiction.

The Covid-19 crisis was primarily characterized by a dual shock to o/ffer and demand. The o/ffer shock manifested itself following the total shutdown of Chinese production during Q1 when China imposed a national lockdown to contain the pandemic, disrupting global logistics /thinspace(2) . As the virus spread, almost every developed economy enforced nation-wide lockdowns, which led to a demand shock. Government-imposed lockdowns and border closures paralyzed economic activity, resulting in unemployment for millions of workers around the world and an oil oversupply crisis known as 'Black April' during which US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time in their history. Nationwide lockdowns were accompanied by strict travel restrictions, both locally and globally, to contain the spread of the pandemic, with disastrous repercussions for the transportation and tourism industries. In an attempt to revive the sector, as of July a number of European Union governments reopened their internal borders to members of the Union, and their external borders to a handful of countries, with no real substantive reboot for tourism owing to the loss of confidence and the health safety concerns of travelers.\n\nThe global economy entered a modest recession during the first quarter (-1.65%)/thinspace (1) before hitting a floor at -9% during the second quarter. The first signs of recovery appeared during the third quarter, especially in retail. A renewed wave of infections in September and October, followed by a second wave of lockdowns hit Europe in November and, despite measures to preserve economic activity, the repercussions led to recession in the fourth quarter.\n\nThroughout the year, governments around the world responded to the economic downturn via fiscal stimulus for households (stimulus cheques in the United States) and companies (payroll support in most developed economies). The total government support worldwide reached more than $12/uni00A0trillion, increasing global public debt to an all-time record of almost 100% of GDP /thinspace( 3 ) . The first to be a/ffected but also the first to recover, the Chinese economy recorded +3.1% GDP growth as of the second quarter, and beat recession to post +2% GDP growth in 2020. The recovery in the global economy to pre-crisis levels is forecast for the end of 2021, with marked di/fferences between regions. According to forecasts, the Euro zone and Japan are expected to be the last regions to recover, in around 2022/thinspace (1) .",

        "page_content": "Market and environment\n\nIn July/uni00A02020, after the first round of lockdowns and some improvement at individual country level, some restrictions were lifted, prompting a relative rebound in economic activity and a first wave of recovery for travel and transportation, during which worldwide ASK capacity averaged 35% of the previous year's level:\n\n- -  China-World 9% of ASKs, Intra-China 99%;\n- -  Europe-World 17% of ASKs, Intra-Europe 42%;\n- -  US-World 18% of ASKs, Intra-US 54%/thinspace (9) .\n\nLater in 2020, the world was hit by a second wave of the pandemic, resulting in new restrictive measures and lockdowns implemented at local and national levels, calling into question the forecasts of an early-2021 recovery, with a significant impact on worldwide capacity. This phase depressed growth and looked more like stagnation: 43% of capacity during the peak season in August/uni00A02020, stability at average levels, to close the year with worldwide capacity at around 44% in December/uni00A02020 (with some di/fferences depending on the market).\n\n## Governmental support, financial aid and regulations\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis proved to be particularly devastating for the airline industry which was seriously a/ffected by the tra/ffic restrictions imposed worldwide, notably the closure of the Schengen borders and the various lockdown measures mentioned above. In addition, the actual duration of the crisis is not yet known, with a long and uncertain recovery in prospect for air transportation.\n\nGovernments worldwide have kept airlines on life support with US$173/uni00A0billion of financial aid (relief measures up to November/uni00A013). The regional variation in this aid is huge, with a near-total lack of aid for the African and Latin America carriers, resulting in bankruptcy for the three leading Latin America airlines, LATAM, Aeromexico and Avianca. Furthermore, US$96billion of this aid will need to be repaid, sometimes with high interest rates.\n\nAfter the crisis, the airline industry will be penalized by significant leverage, having taken on at least US$220/uni00A0billion of additional debt between late 2019 and November/uni00A02020, reaching a record figure of \u20ac651/uni00A0billion/thinspace (10) .\n\nGovernment relief measures have often been accompanied by conditions in terms of competitiveness and profitability, mostly to secure loans. Additional climate commitment conditions have been applied, as in the case of Austrian, wherein airlines have pledged to promote rail travel for short journeys, increase jet fuel e/fficiency and reduce their overall/uni00A0CO2 footprint.\n\nGovernments in countries where subsidiaries of airline groups are located have often demanded the maintenance of the relative weight of the subsidiaries versus the other airlines in the Group, as is the case for Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airways.\n\nEuropean-based companies were subject to supplementary constraints to obtain European Commission approval. For example, Lufthansa's recapitalization by the German government was approved only under certain conditions: a ban on the acquisition of competitors until 75% of the State recapitalization has been repaid and the sale to competitors of up to 24/uni00A0slots per day to enable them to base of up to four aircraft at both Frankfurt and Munich airports/thinspace (11) .\n\nThe South Korean government has announced that it will participate in the acquisition of Asiana by Korean Air (increasing the latter from world number 18/uni00A0to number 10/uni00A0by size of fleet), through an additional $730/uni00A0million investment from the State-owned Korean Development Bank.\n\nDuring the crisis, in addition to financial support, government assistance was also extended to slot regulation with a waiver of the '80-20/uni00A0use-it-or-lose-it' rule. This waiver, which was initially granted for the Summer 2020 Season, was subsequently prolonged to Winter 2020 and the Worldwide Airport Slot Board (WASB) is recommending its extension, subject to some conditions, to the Summer 2021 Season.\n\n## Trend in European competitive market conditions\n\n## Bankrupties in early 2020 of airlines in di/fficulty before the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe first repercussions of the Covid-19 public health crisis in 2020 and their consequences for the travel and airline industries accelerated the stagnation, then the bankruptcy, of airlines that had already been struggling financially and operationally:\n\n- -  less than two years after launching its first flight, Air Italy was one of the first to collapse. The airline reportedly lost \u20ac164/uni00A0million in 2018 and \u20ac200/uni00A0million in 2019. It had 20/uni00A0Boeing 737/uni00A0Max aircraft (grounded since March/uni00A02019), forcing the airline to reconfigure its flight schedule and lease A330 aircraft from Qatar (one of Air Italy's main shareholders);\n- -  after a long period of financial di/fficulty (flights suspended for a month in December/uni00A02019), AtlasGlobal, a Turkish airline, declared bankruptcy and terminated its operations in February/uni00A02020;\n- -  Flybe, the British carrier which had, historically, been one of Europe's largest regional airlines, filed for bankruptcy in early March/uni00A02020;\n- -  CityJet, the Irish operator, grounded its fleet in March/uni00A02020, prompting the cancellation of its wet lease contracts (Brussels Airlines, Aer Lingus). The High Court approved a survival scheme allowing CityJet to exit Examinership, on condition it reduces headcount at its Dublin base from 400/uni00A0to 140/uni00A0positions.\n\n## 2020 bankruptcies caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis\n\nIn Austria, LEVEL Europe, the IAG Group's low-cost subsidiary, was the first European airline to cease operations during the crisis, having filed for bankruptcy in June/uni00A02020. LEVEL France also ceased operations in early 2020. Of the LEVEL brand, there remains only the long-haul low-cost flights, operated out of Barcelona.\n\nSunExpress Deutschland, a German subsidiary of SunExpress, an airline jointly owned by Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines, was the second European airline to fold during the crisis. The subsidiary, based in Frankfurt, was closed down as part of a restructuring, and its short-haul fleet of 14/uni00A0Boeing 737-800s was transferred to the SunExpress AOC while its seven A330s were sold to Lufthansa.",

        "page_content": "## The airlines take survival measures to weather the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe measures taken by Lufthansa included a fleet downsizing (at least 100/uni00A0fewer aircraft in 2023 versus the 760-strong fleet in 2019) and a further reduction in headcount (targeting the preservation of at least 100,000/uni00A0of the 138,000/uni00A0jobs as of the end of 2019). It also announced the regrouping of the leisure operations at the German hubs of Frankfurt and Munich in a new leisure entity code-named Ocean, with a new AOC from end 2021, to replace the current long-haul leisure flights from Germany operated by Lufthansa subsidiaries Cityline, Brussels Airlines and SunExpress Germany; Ocean will operate seven A330s in Summer 2021, with the potential addition of eight A320s, sourced from Eurowings Europe.\n\nThe restructuring of British Airways and Aer Lingus accelerated with the departure of over 9,000/uni00A0people as of late September/uni00A02020. This plan should enable British Airways to reduce annual payroll costs by at least 30% in 2021 compared to 2019. Aer Lingus will also make significant savings of up to 50% compared to 2019, including government support. Iberia and Vueling are already benefiting from Spain's furlough programme, ERTE (at least until January/uni00A02021), saving them over 35% of employee costs, in addition to a number of senior management changes already implemented within IAG. The Group has decided to relocate some Aer Lingus resources to open a new long-haul base in Manchester as of Summer 2021.\n\nNorwegian entered the crisis in a weak financial position with an unsustainable level of debt. The airline began 2020 with a fleet of 127/uni00A0Boeing 737s and 41/uni00A0Boeing 787 aircraft/thinspace (12) . Despite restructuring and State aid, the worsening crisis has not allowed the airline to resurface in a stable and healthy financial situation. In November/uni00A02020, Norwegian Air International filed for examinership and, in January/uni00A02021, Norwegian announced that the long-haul operations will no longer fly even after the pandemic. The airline will retrench around a small, short-haul European and domestic Norwegian network, with 50/uni00A0narrowbody aircraft (17/uni00A0Boeing 737 aircraft in service as of January/uni00A02021: four Norwegian and 13/uni00A0Norwegian Air Sweden)/thinspace (13) .\n\n## Cargo\n\nIn 2020, the reduction in passenger flights throughout the year created a shortage of belly capacity in the passenger fleet, putting significant pressure on full-freighter capacity,  leading to an advantageous position for full-freighter operators and helping them survive the crisis. Air freight tra/ffic, measured in revenue ton-kilometers (RTK), collapsed as of the beginning of the year, with April/uni00A02020 posting the biggest fall (-25%) relative to the same period in 2019, before recovering to -8% in September/uni00A02020 ahead of the second wave of the pandemic, then stabilizing at around -6% (versus 2019) through to the end of the year.\n\nMarkets reacted di/fferently to the pandemic (2020 versus 2019):\n\n- -  Latin America was the most impacted in terms of RTK, seeing -41% in April/uni00A02020, before returning to -19% by November/uni00A02020.\n\n- -  North America and Africa were the least impacted in terms of RTK, starting with declines of -14% and -19% in April/uni00A02020 respectively, and building up to highs of +1.5% and +10% respectively in September/uni00A02020.\n- -  Europe saw a substantial decline of -33% in April/uni00A02020 to reach -11% in October/uni00A02020.\n- -  Asia Pacific was down by -25% in April/uni00A02020 before recovering to a high of -10% in November.\n- -  The Middle East saw the sharpest decline at -36% in April/uni00A02020 before recovering to -1.1% in October/uni00A02020.\n\nThe current shortage of cargo belly capacity, combined with steady demand, in particular for e-commerce, pharmaceutical products and perishable goods, saw unprecedented growth in air freight unit revenues during 2020 to a high of around $3.6/uni00A0per kilo (versus $2.1 in 2019) and boosted industry-wide load factors to a peak of 60% (versus 50% in 2019). Air freight posted a high level of revenue in 2020, as both demand and unit revenues rose steadily over the course of the year. In terms of route, the most profitable was Asia-North America, mainly driven by e-commerce.\n\nNote that, in 2020, the extraordinary conditions created by the public health crisis forced companies to make critical decisions, e.g. converting the cabins in their passenger aircraft for cargo transportation to increase capacity, by removing seats or transporting merchandise on seats.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe aeronautics maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair, overhaul) market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to estimates, the global MRO market, which comprises the maintenance and modification spending by aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, collapsed from an expected US$91/uni00A0billion in 2020 to US$50/uni00A0billion/thinspace (14) .\n\nThe trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization. The Covid-19 crisis and CSR priorities have accelerated fleet adjustment decisions, to gain e/fficiency and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions. Airlines are tending to defer maintenance and are focusing on phasing out older generation aircraft and increasing the proportion of next-generation aircraft. The  MRO operators are su/ffering from weaker and more volatile demand on older and current-generation aircraft.\n\nThe market is also characterized by increased pricing pressure resulting from fiercer competition between maintenance operators (MROs) and more exacting requirements on the part of customer airlines in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, a growing number of airlines are looking to transfer the financing of spare parts to maintenance service providers within the framework of increasingly-large-scale contracts (in terms of revenue, duration, complexity, etc.). The competition from Original Equipment and Engine Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Aircraft Manufacturers (OAMs) will remain strong in the coming years. Lastly, the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis on airline bankruptcies will also have residual e/ffect on the MRO market.",

Sanitary measures of quarantines, social distancing and border closures have led to the worst economic crisis since the Second World War for the aviation industry.\n\nThese travel bans and lockdowns in every continent have had dramatic e/ffects on air travel demand as well as the airlines' business operations. For weeks, Air/uni00A0France and KLM were operating under 10% of their regular scheduled capacity while Transavia and Hop! were forced to ground all flights.\n\nAt the end of September, the Group was operating only 46% of its capacity compared to last year. The situation hadn't improved by the end of the year with additional worldwide governmental restrictions, in response to a second wave of the pandemic; by the end of December/uni00A02020, the Group was operating under 40% of its capacity.\n\nall touchpoints, and on products, services and health safety. The Group is targeting a leading Net Promoter Score by improving the customer experience through personalized and digitilized o/ffers and best-in-class operational performance. Thanks to the professionalism of the Group's frontline sta/ff, the quality of its products and services, and an improved operational performance, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia maintain a daily focus on customers.\n\nBeyond the satisfaction of our customers on the quality of the service Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM airlines promise to them, the financial impact of customer satisfaction is huge: it is a key driver of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM market share gains and revenue growth, increasing customer loyalty and propelling customer growth.\n\n## Planet and society: be a pioneer in sustainable aviation\n\nThrough the initiatives of its airlines, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is committed to leading the way in terms of sustainable aviation at both flight and ground operations level. The Group aims to continue its e/fforts to reduce its environmental footprint by improving its operations and processes, partnering and innovating in the supply chain and mobilizing our sta/ff and the industry.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's immediate response to the crisis has been centered around two key principles: safety and social responsibility. Capacity has been reduced in line with the drop in demand and travel bans while cooperating with the French and Dutch States. The safety of employees and customers has been ensured through immediate actions:\n\n- -  equipping employees with necessary supplies such as facemasks and gloves to ensure a sanitary working environment;\n- -  compulsory face masks for customers on all flights along with temperature checks before boarding from the RoissyCharles de Gaulle hub;\n- -  repatriation of customers from all over the world. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has repatriated more than 500,000/uni00A0European citizens from across the world with the exceptional engagement of the employees, responding to the needs and requirements of the French and Dutch nations.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also deployed cargo capacity to respond to the increasing demand for essential medical supplies. Cargo flights were essential elements in the fight against Covid-19. Over one hundred million pieces of protective medical equipment have been shipped through air bridges using cargo and converted passenger aircraft.",

        "page_content": "The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group also took decisive financial actions over the last few months, which have resulted in immediate cash savings.\n\n- -  downwards revision of the Capex investment plan;\n- -  cut in operating costs;\n- -  labor cost reductions thanks to the partial activity in France and the Dutch government employment support program (NOW);\n- -  halt of all non-safety and non-operational critical projects;\n- -  significant reduction in all consultants and external sta/ff.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's ability to rapidly adapt to this major crisis and to support governments and fellow citizens shows how capable and quick the Group is in engaging and mobilizing when necessary.\n\n## Due to the new reality, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is adapting and accelerating its transformation plans\n\nThe Go-Forward plan for the next five years was presented in November/uni00A02019, including an ambitious transformation plan.\n\nThe Group's strategic orientations started to deliver results in 2019 and in early 2020. The Covid-19 crisis, which commenced in Europe at the end of February/uni00A02020, has had an unprecedented impact on the industry. In this context, the Group will look continuously to adapt its activity to the development of demand for travel and will be adapting its capacity and commercial approach to adjust to the new reality. The Group expects a return to the pre-crisis levels of global demand to take several years and the previously-expected short-term recovery was delayed by the resurgence of a second wave of Covid-19 at the end of August/uni00A02020.\n\nNotwithstanding the current crisis situation, the principles of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Go Forward plan remain unchanged, aiming to reinforce the Group's competitive positioning by leveraging its strengths. The Group's sustainability commitments are also reasserted; Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has set specifically for the environment a commitment to reducing its/uni00A0CO2 emissions per passenger by 50% in 2030 compared to 2005. This will be achieved by a multi-facet strategic solution with real reductions of/uni00A0CO2 due to a modern fleet, optimization of fuel consumption, scale up of sustainable aviation fuel and compensation via market-based measures including/uni00A0CO2 schemes and voluntary o/ffsetting by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM customer programs.\n\n## Transformation\n\nIn the post-Covid-19 world, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group needs to balance its medium-term focus on managing liquidity risk and optimizing Capex investments with the long-term focus on achieving increased competitiveness and sustainability targets. The Group plans to do this through the five key levers of organization, productivity, network, fleet and cost management.\n\n## Organization\n\nIt is crucial for the Group and its airlines to restructure their organizations to adapt to the new reality of reduced capacity and a prolonged period of uncertainty. The airlines of the Group will accelerate their ongoing transformation plans and re-adjust the size of their organization to match these new activity levels. Air/uni00A0France's restructuring plan calls for a reduction of 6,560/uni00A0FTEs by the end of 2022. The many natural departures expected over the period (more than 3,500) will represent more than half of this job reduction thanks to a favorable age pyramid. For HOP! the resizing of the activity and the restructuring of the company, linked in particular to the simplification of the fleet, will lead to a reduction of 1,020/uni00A0jobs over the next three years out of a current workforce of 2,420.\n\nBesides the resizing of their respective organizations, both Air/uni00A0France and KLM will focus on further reducing labor costs. Since March/uni00A02020, the sta/ff in France have been on 'partial activity' and a variable remuneration system for pilots and flight attendants (otherwise known as the minimum monthly guarantee or MMG), reflecting lower levels of flight activity. In both France and the Netherlands, a percentage of employee wages is paid via the unique furlough schemes o/ffered by the respective governments as part of their Covid-19 support measures.\n\nIn France, Air/uni00A0France is prioritising mobility options and voluntary departure programs in order to avoid involuntary layo/ffs, while also utilising notably the Rupture Convention Collective (RCC) to permit voluntary departures beyond those that would normally be entitled under French labor laws.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of partial activity (without compensation for lost wages) and the application of the variable remuneration system for pilots (MGA) have made it possible to reduce the wage bill. Air/uni00A0France has also announced a policy of salary moderation through the suspension of negotiations on the profit-sharing scheme for the years 2020/21/22 and the freezing of general and individual increases (excluding promotion and seniority).\n\nAs a condition of the loan package, the French government has required Air/uni00A0France to achieve cost reductions on a par with European peers (Lufthansa, IAG) and to commit to ambitious environmental objectives:\n\n- -  discontinuing the sale of routes with a train journey alternative in under 2.5/uni00A0hours, except for the flights serving Roissy-CDG;\n- -  reducing/uni00A0C O2 consumption per ASK by 50% in 2030 relative to the 2005 baseline;\n- -  increasing the share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel used for the flights.\n\nIn the Netherlands, KLM's restructuring plan submitted to the Dutch Ministry of Finance contains a significant reduction of FTEs compared to pre-Covid-19. Substantively, the plan includes elements such as the reassessment of strategy, cost-cutting initiatives and financial considerations including reduced employment conditions.",

        "page_content": "Strategic outlook\n\nThe basic principle of the restructuring plan is that KLM's existing business model is still valid, but far-reaching, structural initiatives are required to ensure KLM's future success. Owing to the e/ffects of the current pandemic, KLM is preparing itself for an extended period during which fewer flights will be operated. The organization will become smaller, as well as more cost-e/fficient and sustainable.\n\nAs KLM plays an important economic and societal role in the Netherlands, the government has o/ffered the airline a loan package, to which it has attached certain conditions. One condition is that KLM sta/ff should contribute to KLM's restructuring by accepting reduced employment conditions, amounting to income-dependent graduated cutbacks of up to 20%. These reduced conditions will apply for the duration of the loan period.\n\n## Increase productivity\n\nBoth the numerous agreements signed with Air/uni00A0France sta/ff over the course of last year, and a dedicated focus on network optimization and improvement of aircraft utilization, are helping to reduce costs and increase productivity. For instance, an agreement reached with the SNPL (Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne) and approved by an overwhelming majority, allows for restructuring of the French domestic network, including shifting some domestic operations to the lower cost Transavia platform.\n\n## Fleet\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's future competitive position, focus on sustainability and Capex investments are largely linked to decisions made with regards to network and fleet.\n\nThe principles of the Group's fleet strategy remain as follows:\n\n- -  exit aircraft as planned in order to avoid Capex due to life extension;\n- -  optimize our current fleet (for example through densification or other improvements to the LOPA - interior seating configuration);\n- -  introduce committed new aircraft, in line with our existing fleet plan.\n\nContinuing to invest in new aircraft will support the Group's sustainability commitments and cement its future competitive position.\n\nIn the short term, linked to delays in production at Airbus and Boeing in response to the crisis situation at hand, a few A350-900/uni00A0deliveries at Air/uni00A0France, and some committed and uncommitted B787-10/uni00A0deliveries at KLM, have been postponed.\n\nIn addition, Air/uni00A0France and KLM plan to continue to retire aircraft with the highest costs, fuel consumption and/uni00A0CO2 emissions, and to introduce new generation aircraft in order to:\n\n- -  firstly, improve economics through lower costs pertaining to fuel. The introduction of new-generation aircraft is making a major contribution to this reduction in fuel costs. The Boeing 787s and A350-900s combine economic e/fficiency and environmental performance, with fuel consumption reduced by 20/uni00A0to 25% compared to previous generation aircraft.\n- -  secondly, obtain economies of scale via, for example, maintenance facilities and employee training;\n- -  and thirdly, reduce our environmental footprint. A new generation aircraft will typically produce 20% to 25% lower/uni00A0CO2 emissions versus the previous generation aircraft it replaces.\n\nMid- and long-term fleet investments drive the exit from the current crisis and are essential to achieve increased competitiveness and sustainability targets.\n\nThe Group therefore intends to keep the committed fleet delivery schedule for 2021-25/uni00A0intact as much as possible and is carefully considering financing options. At the same time, it is maintaining the highest level of flexibility in fleet development in view of current uncertainty on the recovery trajectory.\n\n## Network\n\nThe agreement with the SNPL is an important first step in the Group's strategy to accelerate the transformation into profitability and restructure Air/uni00A0France's unprofitable domestic network.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France will maintain operations on the historic 'Navette' routes of Marseille, Nice and Toulouse from Paris Orly airport, while Hop! will refocus on Lyon. Transavia will begin operating domestic routes, in addition to its continued development towards other European destinations.\n\n## Manage costs\n\nThe fifth lever of transformation is reducing Group costs and non-essential Capex investment spend.\n\nKey measures to structurally improve future unit costs are being implemented throughout each of the Group's business units, such as a stringent policy to cancel or delay non-essential and non-fleet Capex investments, including IT, Ground and real estate investment projects.\n\nIn addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has implemented a so-called 'control tower' procedure to scrutinise all controllable external expenses, and has frozen contracting of external sta/ff.\n\nFinally, new initiatives linked to transformation to further simplify the support functions have been identified and added to the list of objectives.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3/emspace ACTIVITIES IN 2020\n\n## 1.3.1/emspace Network business (passenger and cargo): 2020 significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe Network business corresponds to passenger and cargo transportation services on the scheduled flights of the network airlines, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The Network business is Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's principal activity, contributing approaching 83% of the Group's revenues.\n\nDue to the Covid-2019 public health crisis, 2020 was to see a significant reduction in our capacity across all the networks, short, medium and long-haul. Total capacity in the Air/uni00A0France network was down by 59% versus 2019. Given that the pandemic situation was unfolding month by month and governmental measures by region were also constantly changing over the course of the year, the Scheduling teams reacted with agility and proactiveness to adjust capacity throughout 2020. The di/fferent quarters saw contrasting situations: a relatively limited impact during the first quarter with, for Air/uni00A0France, capacity down by 11% relative to 2019, a second quarter at a virtual standstill with capacity down by -92% versus 2019, a pick-up during the third quarter despite a -65% reduction in our capacity and, lastly, a maintained low level of activity during the fourth quarter at -63%.\n\nSince the beginning of the epidemic, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has repatriated more than 500,000/uni00A0European citizens from across the world thanks to the exceptional engagement of its people, thereby responding to the needs and requirements of the French and Dutch governments. The KLM Boeing 747s, which had just been retired, were notably temporarily brought back into service to deliver vital medical equipment. In collaboration with Phillips, an air bridge was established between the Netherlands and China to transport important medical and protective equipmenet. KLM operated more than 153/uni00A0flights with cargo in the cabins, delivering a total of 120/uni00A0million masks, gloves and other emergency supplies.\n\n1.3.1.1/emspace Short and medium-haul operations: ongoing adjustments in response to the Covid-19 crisis and acceleration in the Domestic transformation plan\n\n## Faced with the major impact of the Covid-19 crisis, the short and medium-haul network is accelerating its restructuring\n\nOn the French short-haul network , activity was down by -53% relative to 2019. After a fairly stable start to the year in January and February, the announcement of the first lockdown in France during March/uni00A02020 had a major impact on the second quarter, which was down by -92%. Furthermore, given the ban on domestic travel and the closure of Orly airport, our flight operations were reduced to the minimum in April and May. As of the end of June, the re-opening of Orly airport and the progressive pick-up in leisure and Friends and Family-related demand\n\nenabled capacity to recover to -40% in the third quarter. The weak pick-up in Business travel in September-October, followed by the resurgence of the epidemic and the implementation of the second lockdown in France in November, again negatively impacted the short-haul operations during the fourth quarter, with capacity down by -60%.\n\nFaced with the magnitude of this crisis, Air/uni00A0France decided to accelerate and amplify its restructuring plan launched in previous years in short-haul. To contend with the increased competition from the low-cost carriers, the TGV high-speed rail service and the Oui Go o/ffering in the domestic market, the Group thus confirmed the deployment of Transavia in short-haul as of the Winter 2020 Season on the Orly-Biarritz, Nantes-Marseilles, Nantes-Toulouse, Nantes-Nice and Nantes-Montpellier routes. Air/uni00A0France also restructured its network by closing structurally loss-making routes as of the Summer 2020 Season. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0 France has undertaken to halve its/uni00A0CO2 emissions on the domestic network by 2024 and confirmed the closure, as of Summer 2020, of routes for which there is a rail alternative with journey times of under two and a half hours from Paris (OrlyBordeaux, Orly-Nantes, Orly-Lyon). Lastly, the restructuring of the short-haul network will see the repositioning of Hop at CDG and the Lyon hub.\n\nThe medium-haul network also saw a substantial reduction in activity over 2020. On average, for the whole year, capacity was down by -60% on its 2019 level, the quarterly trends being similar to those in short-haul: a first quarter modestly down at -15%, a second quarter at a virtual standstill owing to the lockdown in France and in many European countries with capacity at -94.2%, a recovery in the third quarter with capacity at -53% mainly driven by demand on leisure and Friends and Family destinations; lastly, due to new governmental measures in Europe, a stronger capacity reduction in medium-haul during the fourth quarter at -74%.\n\nBuilt around the Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs, the medium-haul network experienced an even greater impact in that capacity in the long-haul network was also significantly down, impacting connecting tra/ffic. However, in Summer 2020, Air/uni00A0France maintained all the seasonal destinations in its initial schedule, like Bari, Caliari, Olbia and Palermo in Italy, Heraklion, Mykonos, Santorini and Thessalonica in Greece, Faro and Ibiza in the Iberian Peninsula and Djerba in North Africa.\n\nWithin an extremely volatile health context, the Group thus showed its ability very rapidly to adapt to the changes in governmental measures and demand. Agility and reactivity became the principles for the construction of the commercial proposition, in terms of adapting both capacity and the destinations faced with more leisure-oriented demand.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.1.2/emspace Long-haul operations: a historically balanced network which was able to mitigate the e/ffects of the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe KLM network saw a significant reduction in capacity, down by around 50% versus 2019.\n\nLike for most European carriers, as of March, in the space of three weeks, the KLM network had to be reduced and production was cut to 10% of its capacity relative to more normal years. In May, on the slowing of the first Covid-19 wave in Europe, KLM increased its production to 20% of its usual capacity.\n\nThe KLM Summer schedule resumed with a skeleton network of 32/uni00A0European and 25/uni00A0long-haul destinations, compared with the 171/uni00A0destinations served in Summer 2019. Flight frequencies were reduced and adjusted to the availability of Cargo. Over the summer, KLM was able to progressively reinstate the network, even if the load factors were still far from satisfactory. In September, a second wave of Covid-19 hit Europe, impacting the Winter schedule which began at the end of October. KLM reduced its operations by 40% to 20% of its normal capacity, by using KLM Citihopper Embraers which are smaller and more cost-e/fficient.\n\nKLM maximized the number of destinations, even at reduced frequencies, to maintain the global network. It was thus easy to take advantage of opportunities and adapt to the new travel restrictions. KLM succeeded in adding new destinations, like Zanzibar (Tanzania) and Riyad (Saudi Arabia). The Winter schedule, which ran from October/uni00A02020 to March/uni00A02021, was built around di/fferent scenarios, giving KLM the flexibility to adapt to the unfolding changes and opportunities.\n\nAir/uni00A0France long-haul operations also saw a substantial downwards adjustment in capacity to adapt to the travel constraints and the decline in passenger demand. Over the year, Air/uni00A0France capacity measured in Available Seat-Kilometers was down by -59% relative to its 2019 level. At the height of the crisis, in April and May, capacity was down by -94%. The level of capacity subsequently recovered to -69% during the third quarter and -61% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe adjustments to capacity saw considerable variations between regions and were calibrated as closely as possible to the trends in demand by region, country and route. Air/uni00A0France was thus able to benefit from a historically diversified and balanced network to maintain activity in the regions which were the least impacted by the health crisis. The cargo contribution to the passenger aircraft was also a key element in maintaining long-haul operations.\n\nAfter the April and May lockdown during which virtually all capacity was withdrawn, the second half trend in capacity by region reflected this adaptation. While overall long-haul capacity was down by -69%, the breakdown by region was as follows:\n\nCaribbean/Indian Ocean -48%: This was the region where operations were the most preserved, in particular to the French West Indies where demand held up. Air/uni00A0France thus increased its capacity to Pointe \u00e0 Pitre, Fort de France and Reunion Island at the year end, in response to Christmas holiday demand.\n\nIndia/Middle East -52%: Demand for travel to India and destinations like Dubai and Beirut held up relatively well. In addition to the flows from/to France a significant proportion of travelers were connecting to other long-haul regions like North America and Africa. The diversified flight transfer o/ffering at CDG was thus able to mitigate the e/ffects of the crisis.\n\nAfrica -56%: Air/uni00A0 France was able to benefit from its historic presence on niche markets like West Africa to progressively relaunch operations on the exit from lockdown. Leisure and friends and family-style flows proved more resilient than Business tra/ffic. Despite the crisis, Air/uni00A0France was able to open a new destination, Monrovia in Liberia, which notably benefited from numerous flows towards North America.\n\nNorth America -71%: While operations were not totally prohibited, passenger demand collapsed owing to the travel restrictions imposed by governments, which were particularly stringent for travel between Europe and the USA and Canada. The network was thus refocused on routes with, firstly, substantial cargo demand and, secondly, significant demand for flows to/from Africa and the Middle East.\n\nCentral/South America -78%: Operations had to be significantly scaled back to adapt to the travel constraints in the di/fferent countries of the region. The maintained operations were strongly supported by the cargo business whose revenues covered a substantial proportion of the operating costs.\n\nAsia -86%: The Asian network was to see the most significant adjustments to operations, owing to several factors:\n\n- -  limitation of tra/ffic rights: in countries like China, during the second half, Air/uni00A0France was only able to operate a maximum of three flights a week;\n- -  operational complexity: several Asian destinations requiring PCR tests on arrival, with no guarantee of rapid repatriation to France for flight crews testing positive, made it impossible to schedule rest periods for crews. This was notably the case for China and Vietnam. To operate flights to these destinations, they need to be served via another Air/uni00A0France station with geographical proximity, where flight crew rest periods are possible (Seoul in Korea for China and Bangkok for Vietnam);\n- -  decline in demand: the arrival restrictions imposed on travelers had a material impact on travel demand. Thus, the fall in demand, combined with more complex and costly flight operations, required a more drastic reduction in capacity in Asia than for the other networks.\n\n## Fleet & product\n\nWithin a context of global public health crisis, Air/uni00A0France places the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff at the heart of its priorities. As of the emergence of the Covid-19 virus, Air/uni00A0France implemented exceptional measures, regrouped under the Air/uni00A0France Protect label, to ensure a safe travel experience: the strictest health protocols at every step of the journey, 100% flexible tickets and insurance cover linked to the pandemic. The Air/uni00A0France teams are monitoring the evolving health situation closely and more than ever remain mobilized to continue to welcome customers on board its flights in total safety.",

The cabins and all surfaces in contact with customers are scrupulously disinfected, particularly armrests, tablets and entertainment screens.\n\nOn board and throughout the journey, the wearing of surgical masks remains mandatory. A disinfectant wipe is o/ffered to customers on boarding the aircraft. Since January/uni00A05, 2021, on long-haul flights, a sanitary kit containing a surgical mask, a disinfectant wipe and hand sanitizer is o/ffered to every customer in all the cabins.\n\nDuring the flight, the air is completely renewed every three minutes. The air recycling system in all Air/uni00A0France aircraft is equipped with HEPA (High E/fficiency Particulate Air) filters, identical to those used in operating theaters, which capture 99.9% of particles.\n\n## On arrival\n\nCrew announcements made on board invite customers to disembark at a steady rate to respect social distancing. Hand sanitizer dispensers are available in the luggage arrival hall, where floor markings and reminders on social distancing are also in place.\n\n## Travel with KLM for peace of mind\n\nKLM did everything in its power to ensure a safe travel experience for passengers. Preventive measures were taken at every step of the customer journey, on the ground and on board. The products and services were adjusted to minimize contact moments and maximize distance. Passengers clearly expressed the need for reassurance in the areas of hygiene and sanitation, physical and social distancing, health screening, and transparent information in real time.\n\nThe introduction of QR codes on boarding passes reduced the need for physical contact. This enabled passengers to prove their identities and supported increased self-service activities at the airport. KLM digitized the health declaration and connected it to the boarding Pass, and introduced virtual queuing in the lounge and at transfer desks, thereby reducing the need for physical lines. Working together with other SkyTeam members, KLM set standards for hygiene, distancing, screening, preparation and pre-testing.\n\nKLM developed software enabling the creation of a cabin seating plan that maximizes distance between passengers and launched the Willingness to Fly program, which bundles information about flight restrictions and conditions. In line with its ambition to be a leading European network carrier in terms of customer centricity, KLM kept the Crown Lounge at Schiphol open to ensure passengers could benefit from rest and comfort. This made KLM the only major European airline to keep its lounge at the hub open from the beginning of March through to the end of the year. Initially the food and beverage services were limited but, from July, the lounge was cautiously expanded to the full-service o/ffering.\n\n## -Flexible commercial measures with 100% changeable or refundable tickets until December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nTo enable customers to plan their travel with peace of mind and facilitate their journeys in the event of service disruption, Air/uni00A0 France has adapted its commercial measures to enable the highest possible level of flexibility. Whatever their reason, customers may change their booking, obtain a voucher if they no longer wish to travel or be refunded if their flight has been cancelled.\n\nWith the closure of the network having led to a wave of more than two million cancellations, KLM had to contend with huge pressure on its customer care processes, leading to waiting times. KLM took the decision to o/ffer vouchers in the event of cancellation and compensated passengers by increasing the value of the voucher by 15/uni00A0per cent, relaxing the conditions of the Flying Blue program and o/ffering flexible booking terms. KLM mobilized extra staff and expertise, and developed a suite of digital tools allowing passengers to obtain refunds and rebook their flights.",

        "page_content": "## -Insurance to cover the health risk\n\nIn partnership with Allianz Travel, Air/uni00A0France extended its travel insurance guarantees to give greater protection to customers in the event of epidemics like Covid-19. During their stays, customers benefit from medical assistance and the reimbursement of medical expenses incurred internationally or additional costs in the event of quarantine. Proposed on the purchase of a ticket on the airfrance.com website and at the airline's customer relations centers, in some European countries and soon in other countries, this insurance supplements the existing Cancellation + Missed Flight, Multirisk and Assistance products.\n\n## Customer perception\n\nSince June/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France has evaluated customer satisfaction on the hygiene protocols deployed and on their travel experience. Amongst other feedback, some 70% of the customers polled give an excellent or very good score to the measures implemented against the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nIn April/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France figured amongst the Top 5/uni00A0brands, banners or services the French had missed the most during lockdown (Brands&You survey by the CSA Institute).\n\nIn November/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France was ranked the leading airline in Europe for the health and safety of its passengers, having scored 4.1/uni00A0out of 5 in the Safe Travel barometer.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France adapts its services o/ffer\n\nSince the onset of the crisis, Air/uni00A0France has closely monitored the health situation and deployed the protocols required to ensure the well-being and safety of its customers and sta/ff.\n\n## -On-board  service\n\nTo limit interaction and as a function of the unfolding health situation, the on-board service has been regularly adapted. For example, on the short-haul flights in France and elsewhere in Europe, or towards the United Kingdom, the o/ffer has been limited to a glass of water. The catering o/ffer has been gradually reintroduced in all cabins whenever the situation has improved. Film-wrapped or individually packaged products are prioritized. Duty free sales and the press o/ffer have been suspended and customers have access to 150/uni00A0press and magazine titles free of charge on ''Air/uni00A0France Play''.\n\n## -The Air/uni00A0France lounges\n\nDue to the health guidelines, some Air/uni00A0France and third-party lounges have had to close.\n\nWith its focus on improving the customer experience, Air/uni00A0France has been able to progressively re-open some lounges while guaranteeing the same health protocols: hand sanitizer dispensers, the mandatory wearing of surgical masks and respect for social distancing. The catering proposition and certain services have also been adapted: the snack o/ffer in packaged, individual portions has been maintained and drinks remain self-service. At the bu/ffets, the hot and cold products are now served on a plate by a waiter. The bar and Childrens' space remain closed as do the Clarins beauty spaces with the exception of the one in Terminal 2E, Hall K at Paris-Charles de Gaulle.\n\nAhead of the renovation work on the La Premi\u00e8re lounge planned for the end of March/uni00A02021, La Premi\u00e8re customers are being hosted in the mezzanine space in the Air/uni00A0France lounge at Terminal 2E, Hall K at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. The Alain Ducasse Paris catering teams provide the fine-dining proposition.\n\n## -Despite the crisis, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are maintaining investment for their customers\n\nDespite having cancelled or postponed projects and investments, and renegotiated contracts, KLM decided to introduce Premium Economy, a class in its own right between Economy and Business Class. It will feature more space and multimedia screens for inflight entertainment, a dedicated service and an upgraded catering proposition. Furthermore, KLM will invest in a direct aisle business class on all its Boeing 777-300/uni00A0aircraft, which can already be found on the Boeing 787.\n\n## -The 15/uni00A0Airbus A330s in the Air/uni00A0France fleet completely refurbished for an investment of \u20ac140/uni00A0million\n\nThe refurbishment of its Airbus A330s launched in 2019 is an integral part of Air/uni00A0France's product modernization strategy. During 2020, the 15/uni00A0aircraft were refurbished to welcome customers in totally-redesigned cabins: new seats, toilets and galley fittings, integrated moodlighting and more modern and elegant bars. Equipped with 36/uni00A0full flat seats in the Business cabin, 21/uni00A0seats in Premium Economy and 167/uni00A0seats in Economy, the A330 o/ffers an optimal level of comfort and well-being.\n\nFurthermore, Air/uni00A0France is investing an additional \u20ac500/uni00A0million over five years (2020-24) in ongoing cabin refurbishment, the roll-out of on board connectivity, the renovation of some lounges and an innovative new lounge in Terminal 2F.\n\n## -Refurbishment of the cabins in 12/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France B777-300s\n\nIn January/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France unveiled the new travel cabins on board its Boeing 777-300s currently serving destinations in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion Island. At the end of 2020, six refurbished aircraft were brought into revenue service, to be followed by the remaining six in 2021. On board, the aircraft's 472/uni00A0seats - 14/uni00A0full flat in Business, 28/uni00A0fixed shell seats in Premium Economy and 430 in Economy - have been comprehensively redesigned to o/ffer customers the highest standards of comfort, with a soft, warm ambiance in the airline's colors.\n\n## -Ongoing roll-out of 'Air/uni00A0France CONNECT' across the AF fleet and the KLM WiFi o/ffer\n\nKLM continued to install Wi-Fi connectivity on the intercontinental fleet.\n\nWith 'Air/uni00A0France CONNECT', customers can remain connected on board thanks to the three WiFi Pass o/ffers available on their personal smart phones, tablets or laptops.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 73% of the Air/uni00A0France fleet was connected: 70/uni00A0long-haul and 87/uni00A0medium-haul aircraft. Three types of aircraft are already 100% connected: Boeing 787: Panasonic, A330: Gogo, A350: Inmarsat.",

It will welcome customers on departure or connecting to a short or medium-haul flight as of the summer of 2021.\n\n## -Another Customer Relations award for Air/uni00A0France\n\nOn April/uni00A09, 2020, for the fifth year running, Air/uni00A0France won first prize for Customer Relations in the Transport sector. In this sixteenth edition of the Customer Relations awards organised by BearingPoint and Kantar, in partnership with Salesforce, the airline also shot up the general ranking, from 42 nd /uni00A0to 14 th /uni00A0place across all categories. Air/uni00A0France is making progress on most of the excellence criteria in the Customer Relations Awards.\n\n## 1.3.1.3/emspace Acclerated digital reset for the present and future\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Digital hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis\n\nAs an airline group and a player in the travel industry, we have been very hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this crisis and government restrictions, digital channels have become our first point of contact with customers. Our strong digital presence has become all the more evident and the crisis has opened up new opportunities for digital.\n\n## Actions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Digital in response to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nAdjusted sales approach: o/ffering commercial flexibility on all touchpoints to adapt to the continuously changing context, as international governments impose various ''overnight'' travel restrictions, based on local or foreign Covid-19 infections.\n\n## A 'self-service powerhouse'\n\nProvide our customers with self-service tools to manage their bookings and refunds, giving them control and ease of use, and gaining scalability.\n\nIn a record time, new self-service tools were developed on digital touchpoints (desktop and mobile):\n\n- -  information chatbots dedicated to information on the Covid-19 situation;\n- -  special booking bots;\n- -  self-service rebooking tools;\n- -  self-service vouchers and refunds;\n- -  self-service health statements (8% of sales);\n- -  self-service real-time special entry conditions by country: Traveldoc.\n\nThe booking path was also adapted to the new health and commercial conditions:\n\n- -  social distancing on online cabin seatmaps;\n- -  book with Confidence policy: implementation of flexible conditions on all tickets;\n- -  option to use a voucher as a method of payment;\n- -  integration of a 15% bonus at the payment step;\n- -  updates on flight information;\n- -  health form during the check-in process.\n\n## Expertise in social media at the height of the crisis\n\nAs of the onset of the crisis, large social media and customer contact volunteer teams were put in place. In addition, our hybrid model of agent servicing, supported by tooling and bots, proved its essential role in our social media service organization. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we launched additional bots to handle the high service volumes (automated and partly automated), which increased by 500%.\n\n## Digital strategy\n\nOur focus is on providing Covid-19-related information and practical support for customers, by dynamically adapting our targeted advertising in line with constantly-changing market demand and consumer sentiment. This approach is supported by dashboards integrating internal (e.g. API calls) and external data (e.g. Google demand, social media questions).\n\n## Data-driven approach\n\nWe are able to gain key insights into customer expectations and respond by adapting our responses.\n\nWebsite-centric data (searchs on the website, most viewed pages and queries) and marketing data (social media listening in real time, Google queries) have been key to adapting our messages and FAQ on a user-centric basis.",

We do this by providing a highly scalable digital ecosystem to steer our customers towards the most e/fficient direct channel. To achieve our companies' ambition within the scope of the 'selfsales & self-service': revenue, customer satisfaction, (cost)-e/fficiency.\n\n## Key figures: digital for the Group in 2020\n\n- -  241/uni00A0million visits on AF.com and KLM.com, of which 55% on mobile devices;\n- -  45% of all tickets sold direct online;\n- -  65% online check-ins;\n- -  1.7/uni00A0million active users every month on mobile applications.\n\n## 1.3.1.4/emspace Cargo\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Group carried 880/uni00A0million kilograms, down by 20.8%, of which 78% in the bellies of passenger aircraft and 22% in the full-freighter fleet. The tightening of supply and demand levels have increased yields significantly since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, the Group's cargo capacity was down by 30.7%, primarily driven by the reduced belly capacity in passenger aircraft partly o/ffset by the increase in full freighter capacity and mini-cargo flights (passenger aircraft for which only the belly capacity is marketed). The yield and load factor were strongly higher, resulting in a unit revenue increase of 76.8% at constant currency, due to the gap between industry capacity and demand. The Group benefited from its full freighter fleet of six aircraft and a passenger long-haul fleet well suited to the cargo activity (Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and A350).\n\nWorld-wide air freight volumes are down due to the Covid-19 pandemic but are expected to recover steadily in line with trade growth and increased industrial production. The supply-demand gap in recent months is foreseen to narrow once the industry capacity supply increases which will depend on the recovery in passenger traffic. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is ready to transport vaccines worldwide and has already successfully delivered them to several destinations. The volume of vaccines is expected to progressively increase during the first half of 2021.\n\n## 1.3.1.5/emspace Airline partnerships and alliances: expanding the Group's commercial presence to respond to global air transport demand\n\nAir transport demand is global and, to respond to this demand, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is pursuing an ambitious strategy aimed at expanding its commercial presence in every region of the world.\n\nAirline alliances and partnerships are an integral part of this strategy. They contribute to meeting customer expectations and thus creating value for both the Group and its customers. They reinforce the Group's market positioning thanks to an expanded and more diversified network, which supplements the Group's own o/ffer. They may also enable the generation of operational synergies.\n\n## Strategic partnerships\n\nIn July/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced a further major step in the reinforcement of its strategic partnerships with, on one hand, the creation of a single global joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, on the other hand, the intensification of its partnership with China Eastern Airlines. These two commercial alliances have been consolidated by equity links with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines each acquiring an 8.8% equity interest in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases carried out during 2017, for a total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million.\n\nThe strategic, commercial and capitalistic reinforcement of these partnerships positions Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as the European pillar of the leading global airline network.\n\n## Transatlantic joint-venture with Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn January/uni00A01, 2020, following approval by the US authorities on November/uni00A021, 2019, the Group launched a new transatlantic joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic. As a result, as of December/uni00A031, 2019, a decade after its creation, the Group ended the existing joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Alitalia. As with most joint-ventures in the industry, it does not lead to the creation of a common company but rather the signature of a contract defining both the mechanism of a common income statement, and governance and organizations to manage all aspects of the partnership. The existence of an internal common income statement ensures that the partners implement all the actions contributing to an improved operating result for the activity, to their mutual benefit. Each company member of the joint-venture recognizes the revenues and costs relating to the joint-venture scope in their respective income statements. If necessary, a settlement mechanism between joint-venture members will compensate the imbalances in value creation based on a mechanism agreed between the parties. This mechanism contributes to ''metal neutrality'', enabling the di/fferent members to jointly manage capacity and look for overall optimization rather than the individual interests of each airline, ultimately increasing value for both the partners and customers.",

        "page_content": "The governance bodies comprise a CEO Committee, a monthly JV Leadership Team meeting and Working Groups.\n\nThe scope of this joint-venture is very wide, covering all the flights between North America, Mexico and Europe through integrated cooperation and all the flights between North America and Mexico to and from the Mediterranean basin, Africa, the Gulf countries and India together with the flights from Europe to and from Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador through close coordination.\n\nPrior to the public health crisis this new joint-venture had revenues exceeding US$13/uni00A0billion and a market share of 23%, making it a major player on the transatlantic, the leading market for international air transportation. More than 340/uni00A0daily flights linked the nine principal hubs: Paris, Amsterdam, London, Atlanta, New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. Pricing and revenue management are centralized within a 60-strong team based in Amsterdam.\n\nThe coordination of the network is reflected in the strengthening of the hub to hub services, the optimization of aircraft types assigned to each route and an increase in the number of destinations served by non-stop flights on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel. The sales forces have been regrouped in each region.\n\nThis extended scope marks the expansion and strengthening of one of the most advanced partnership models in the airline industry.\n\n## Partnerships in China - a consolidated presence in the Chinese market\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM benefit from a historic presence in China, bolstered by strong partnerships with two of the three largest Chinese carriers, through joint-venture agreements concluded during the past two decades.\n\nIn 2006, KLM was the first to sign a joint-venture agreement with China Southern, thereby benefiting from its partner's vast domestic network operated on departure from the Guangzhou and Beijing hubs. This agreement was expanded to Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern, in 2015. For its part, in 2010, Air/uni00A0France signed a joint-venture agreement with China Southern, regrouping the Paris-Guangzhou operations of the two partners and developing their respective cooperation beyond their main hubs. In July/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on one side, and China Southern and Xiamen Airlines on the other, committed to a new period of joint-venture cooperation by forming a single joint-venture which remains in force despite China Southern's decision to leave the SkyTeam alliance, e/ffective January/uni00A01, 2019.\n\nIn 2012, Air/uni00A0France signed a joint-venture agreement involving the Paris and Shanghai routes with China Eastern Airlines, a major player in Chinese air transportation, operating a vast domestic network and internationally mainly out of its base in Shanghai, China's economic lung. This agreement was extended to KLM in 2016, when China Eastern Airlines inaugurated the ShanghaiAmsterdam service. The partnership was further reinforced in 2017 when China Eastern Airlines acquired an 8.8% equity interest in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM via a reserved capital increase. In\n\nNovember/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern signed an agreement extending their joint-venture to two additional routes, Paris-Wuhan and Paris-Kunming, as of January/uni00A01, 2019, thereby o/ffering their respective customers new routes under code share and new connecting opportunities between Europe and China.\n\nThanks to these partnerships, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can o/ffer its customers access to a total of some fifty destinations in China, completing its own network with eight destinations in Greater China.\n\nIn total, the revenues from routes operated between Europe and China by airlines participating in joint-venture agreements represented more than \u20ac1/uni00A0billion in 2019.\n\n## Strategic partnership with GOL\n\nIn 2014, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes signed an exclusive five-year strategic partnership, reinforcing their commercial cooperation between Brazil and Europe. The partnership notably foresees the optimization of synergies between the two groups and, in particular, connecting opportunities in the major Brazilian cities served by the Group. The partnership led to a significant increase (approaching 25%) in the percentage of Air/uni00A0France and KLM passengers transferring to GOL flights. Since April/uni00A02015, GOL has used its code on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM flights between Europe and Brazil, and on European destinations beyond Paris and Amsterdam. The two partners cooperate on promoting sales in their home markets and, since November/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France has been GOL's GSA for the French market. This GSA agreement is currently being deployed across the European market.\n\nIn May/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France and KLM took a new step in their strategic development in Brazil with the opening of new flights to Fortaleza on departure from Paris and Amsterdam. These flights connect with GOL's new strategic hub in Fortaleza, o/ffering increased connectivity for customers to the main cities in northern and north-eastern Brazil.\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL renewed this strategic partnership agreement for a five-year period, thereby reinforcing this cooperation. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM remains GOL's exclusive European partner and reciprocally, with some exceptions granted.\n\n## Alitalia\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2020, Alitalia has no longer been a member of the transatlantic joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic. However, the US authorities prolonged the anti-trust Immunity until May/uni00A020, 2020, enabling Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Alitalia to continue their commercial cooperation until that date; discussions are ongoing with the new Alitalia to explore di/fferent avenues for future cooperation.\n\n## Other joint-ventures and code shares\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implements various forms of partnership agreements, the choice depending on the balance between value creation for its customers and the Group, and the necessary level of interaction between the o/ffers of the partners, together with the regulatory requirements framing the scope of the agreement.",

        "page_content": "The first levels of interline cooperation are Tra/ffic and Special Prorate Agreements (SPA) between the partner airlines, enabling the combination of their networks while maintaining their respective IATA codes and setting their own fares.\n\nWithin the framework of a code-sharing agreement, two partner airlines sell tickets on the same flight, each under their own code and setting their own fares. The operating carrier has operational control over the aircraft while the marketing partner, for sales purposes, uses its own flight number on its partner's flights. Any such agreement must comply with the safety and regulatory requirements set forth by the competent authorities.\n\nThere are two types of code sharing. In the first, under a block seat agreement, the marketing partner purchases a fixed amount of capacity from the operating carrier. The marketing partner has inventory control over the seat block. In the second, known as free flow, no division of capacity is set, the two partners potentially selling all the seats on the relevant flights although inventory control remains the prerogative of the operating carrier. Access to capacity on the relevant flights is through negotiated fares for each booking class.\n\nJoint-ventures are the next level in alliances and participate in the trend towards consolidation when the partners are seeking a higher level of joint optimization on a sub-scope of their network without, however, considering a merger.\n\nA joint-venture enables value creation for customers in the markets where it is implemented and, as a result for the partners who organize coordination of the commercial activities:\n\n- -  for customers, they enable access to an expanded o/ffer of flights and improved connectivity, loyalty program benefits across a wider perimeter, a harmonized travel experience and integrated commercial propositions;\n- -  the partners thus improve their market positioning, serving a higher number of customers and enabling them to capture market growth.\n\nThe partners define the governance principles and financial sharing mechanisms, enabling decision-making and execution across the whole value chain, thus responding to the commercial objectives of the joint-venture.\n\nThe final stages in cooperation consolidation and integration are mergers or equity interests, anchoring the development of a common strategy over the long term.\n\nJoint-ventures, equity interests and mergers must be approved in the light of the regulations in force in the jurisdictions covering the scopes of the agreements, particularly with respect to the competition rules (e.g. Anti-trust Immunity).\n\n## 1.3.1.6/emspace SkyTeam  alliance\n\nThe three large alliances, SkyTeam (to which Air/uni00A0France and KLM belong), Star Alliance and oneworld, represent some 55% of worldwide tra/ffic. Among the top 50/uni00A0airline carriers in the world, only 15/uni00A0do not belong to a global alliance, including eight low-cost carriers whose business models make them unlikely to want to join an alliance.\n\nSince the inception of the global alliances, their capacity in terms of the available seats o/ffered by member airlines has grown by more than the industry average, with SkyTeam now being the second largest global alliance, behind Star Alliance and ahead of oneworld.\n\n## SkyTeam: a global alliance\n\nSkyTeam, created in 2000, is a global alliance which numbered 19/uni00A0airline members at December/uni00A031, 2020: Aeroflot, Aerolineas Argentinas, Aeromexico, Air Europa, Air/uni00A0France, Alitalia, China Eastern Airlines, China Airlines, Czech Airlines, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Garuda Indonesia, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Tarom, Vietnam Airlines and XiamenAir.\n\nBelonging to SkyTeam enables its members to strengthen their brand awareness and extend their o/ffer around the globe, thereby bolstering their commercial presence. As members of the SkyTeam alliance, Air/uni00A0France and KLM thus have access to a global network of some 15,500/uni00A0daily flights to 1,036/uni00A0destinations in more than 170/uni00A0countries. (1)\n\nThe 676/uni00A0million annual passengers benefit from a seamless travel experience on the flights of member airlines and have access to 790/uni00A0airport lounges around the world. The 230/uni00A0million passengers who are members of frequent flyer programs can earn and burn air miles on all SkyTeam partner flights. (1)\n\nTo become an alliance member, airlines need to fulfil a series of specific membership requirements, relating to operations, technologies and products. Members must be linked by bilateral agreements covering codesharing, their loyalty programs and access to airport lounges.\n\nWhile retaining their separate identities and brands, the airlines combine their networks to o/ffer their customers a more extensive range of travel solutions and the related global services, more rapid earning of miles, access to numerous airport lounges but also a more seamless customer service during the di/fferent stages of their journeys thanks to the SkyPriority and SkyTransfer programs.\n\nSkyTeam also provides an environment and tools enabling members to generate operational cost synergies (e.g. co-located facilities, better use of airport lounges and notably the seven SkyTeam lounges, a joint IT platform, etc.).",

Yields and load factors were strongly up, resulting\n\nin a unit revenue increase of 76.8% at constant currency, thanks to the gap between industry capacity and demand. The Group benefited from a full freighter fleet of six aircraft and a passenger long-haul fleet well suited to the cargo activity (Boeing 777, Boeing 787, and A350).\n\nOn the demand side, world-wide air freight volumes are down due to the Covid-19 crisis but are expected to recover in line with trade growth and industrial production. The supply-demand gap of the past months is foreseen to narrow once the industry capacity supply increases, something which will depend on the recovery in passenger tra/ffic.

Full year 2020 activity was close to 40% of its 2019 level, with unit revenues down by 17.4% compared to 2019. The load factor at 73.8% was impacted by the imposition of travel restrictions.\n\nDuring 2020, Transavia operated more than 150/uni00A0repatriation flights on departure from Europe and North Africa, enabling 28,000/uni00A0passengers to return home before temporarily immobilizing its entire fleet.\n\nTransavia focused on strict cash control and froze all spending and investments. The measures implemented by the company include partial activity in France enabled by the French government, a freeze on all unnecessary expenditure, the deferral of tax payments and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers.\n\nMillions of passengers requested refunds and Transavia moved fast to ramp up customer support and develop a chat bot to speed up the process of customer care. From May, the reimbursement of all cancelled reservations and flexibility was o/ffered to customers.\n\nIn June, Transavia progressively resumed flight operations by constantly adapting its operations to the health protocols, enabling many travelers to enjoy leisure destinations during the summer. The new base in Montpellier was inaugurated on June/uni00A026/uni00A0with some ten destinations o/ffered during the summer. Transavia Netherlands postponed the opening of operations on departure from Brussels, but did start some five new routes on departure from its existing bases.\n\nSpain and Greece, which represent more than half of production, imposed new travel restrictions in August, resulting in another setback for the company. Winter production hovered at around 20% to 30% and the load factor averaged only 45% for Transavia Netherlands. Countries where restrictions were lifted showed an immediate uptick in bookings, indicating that consumers were still eager to fly. At the end of the year, after the restrictions were lifted by the French government, Transavia France operated 70% of its capacity compared to December/uni00A02019, i.e. 80% of the destinations, and was the number one low-cost airline in France in terms of capacity.\n\nTransavia signed a number of collective labor agreements in the Netherlands and France on working conditions and the restructuring measures. Transavia France launched operations in domestic France during the 2020 fourth quarter on departure from Paris Orly and regional airports.\n\n## Launch of the first domestic flights for Transavia France\n\nThe public health crisis has accelerated the reorganization of the Group's domestic network and an agreement was signed in August with the pilots (SNPL) to enable Transavia to fly domestic routes. Transavia France announced the opening of five new routes on the French domestic network in September; one service from Orly airport to Biarritz and four on departure from Nantes to Marseilles, Nice, Toulouse, and Montpellier. Ten additional seasonal transversal domestic routes were opened for the Christmas period, enabling friends and families to be reunited for the festive season.\n\n## Continued innovation\n\nOnly asset-light investments providing direct added-value for customers were authorized and, despite the crisis, Transavia was able to launch customer experience innovations. These included the launch of Transavia Holidays and Transavia Dichtbij, which supports Transavia's sustainability ambitions by focusing on travel within a 750km radius. An ancillary product called 'Flex' was introduced to o/ffer certainty and flexibility, features that have become increasingly important for passengers. Transavia partnered with Takeaway.com to offer 'in-flight delivery', which reduces waste as well as weight on flights. In the area of digitalization and documentation, Transavia France launched a new solution with Vistair, enabling the consultation of airline documentation. Other product and service improvements include cooperation with the Mona system at Lyon airport (contactless check-in and boarding with facial recognition), Smooss (an automated solution for rebooking passengers) and the new cabin luggage policy o/ffering more clarity for passengers and allowing an additional carry-on accessory in the cabin. In September, the new mobile application was launched, enabling easier booking and baggage check-in for customers. With a score of 4.6 in the App store, this new application is a success.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nIn the area of customer experience, the Net Promotor Score (NPS) improved and reached an average of 44 for the full year for Transavia France, i.e. 20/uni00A0points higher than for the previous year. The NPS of Transavia Netherlands was up by more than six points, increasing from 37/uni00A0points in 2019 to 43/uni00A0points in 2020, and even reaching 49 in December. Transavia France was also voted Service Client de l'Ann\u00e9e, a dedicated award reflecting the excellence of its customer service and the engagement of its teams. For the fourth year in a row, Transavia was also awarded the Meilleure Enseigne, Qualit\u00e9 de Service label by Capital magazine, recognizing the brand's quality of service.\n\nOperations and maintenance were adapted at all stages of the crisis enabling a maintained reliable service. Transavia Netherlands was able to realize an on-time performance score of 91%, and Transavia France had a punctuality rate of 84.2%.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability initiatives\n\nTransavia is now part of the Sustainability Leads Group and the Fuel Efficiency Group. In January/uni00A02020, the company partnered with KLM within the framework of the CO2ZERO flight compensation service for passengers and participation is stable at around 4% of passengers. Transavia France is also aligned with the Air/uni00A0France engagement to compensate the/uni00A0CO2 emissions on all its domestic flights through the EcoAct program, which has been in place since November/uni00A02020.\n\nMore waste- and weight-reduction initiatives were worked on with external partners like the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and the Product for Product program. One example is the circular approach for co/ffee cups introduced in December at Transavia Netherlands. All co/ffee cups on board and in the hangars are now recycled in the form of toilet paper. In future, o/ffice cups will also be included. At Transavia France, a test flight was organized in January to check the possibilities of recycling and all single-use-plastic items have now been replaced by sustainable alternatives.\n\nCooperation with start-ups to reduce fuel consumption and/uni00A0CO2 emissions continued with the launch of Optidirect, a new solution developed by Safety Line enabling pilots to choose direct routes. Transavia reinforced its commitment to associations like\n\nMovember, Octobre Rose, Les Rubans Rouges and the Carlesimo association, by promoting awareness-raising actions on board and with Ground sta/ff.\n\n## Recovery plan\n\nTransavia's ambition is to remain the number one low-cost carrier in the Netherlands. Transavia Netherlands has defined a phased recovery plan for the coming three years: reset (2021), relaunch (2022) and regain (2023). The strategic focus will be on three themes: the customer, the proposition and distribution, integral airline planning, and purpose, people and organization. Continued fleet renewal will contribute to meeting passenger expectations, reducing costs, future growth and Transavia's sustainability targets.\n\n2020 was a challenging year but the company was able to adapt quickly and in an agile way. In 2021, Transavia France will continue to adapt its schedule and operations to the health situation and to customer demand, while preparing for the post-crisis era. The company's plans include the opening of new routes on the domestic and international network, and the entry of new aircraft to the fleet. Attention to customer care, innovation and sustainability will be key and the objective of being the preferred low-cost carrier in France remains the top priority. The key word for 2021 will be agility.\n\n## Key figures\n\nYear\n\n| Transavia                                      | 2020   | Change          |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------|\n| Number of passengers  (in thousands)           | 5,182  | -68.7%          |\n| Capacity  (in ASK million)                     | 13,312 | -59.5%          |\n| Tra/ffic  (in RPK million)                     | 9,828  | - 67.6%         |\n| Load factor                                    | 73.8%  | -18.4/uni00A0pt |\n| Total passenger revenues  (in \u20acm)              | 606    | -65.2%          |\n| Unit revenue per ASK  (in \u20ac cents)             | 4.41   | -17.4%          |\n| Unit cost per ASK  (in \u20ac cents)                | 6.65   | +34.7%          |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm) | (299)  | -430            |\n\nThe fourth quarter operating result ended \u20ac65/uni00A0million lower compared to last year at an operational loss of \u20ac(93) million, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and the tightening of border restrictions in Europe and North Africa.\n\nFull year 2020 activity levels were close to 40% of the previous year's level, with unit revenues down by 17.4% compared to 2019.\n\nLoad factors at 73.8% were impacted by the travel restrictions imposed.\n\nThe Transavia growth plan remains valid.

        "page_content": "## 1.3.3/emspace Maintenance  business\n\nAircraft maintenance is the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's third business with third-party revenues of \u20ac1.2/uni00A0billion. These revenues generated with external clients represent 43.7% of the total revenues in this business. In 2020, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and its worldwide impact on the airline industry, the AFI KLM E&M order book decreased by US$2.4/uni00A0billion, to a total of US$9.1/uni00A0billion.\n\nIn the aircraft maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and overhaul) market, Air/uni00A0France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance (AFI KLM E&M) ranks number two globally amongst the multi-product players. The role of AFI KLM E&M is to supply competitive support for the Group's fleet, while consolidating its position as a leading MRO in its own market.\n\nThe Group operates in three major maintenance segments: airframe maintenance, engine maintenance and component support (electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.). Airframe maintenance covers three sub- segments: line operations support which aims to verify the proper day-to-day functioning of systems and the integrity of the aircraft structure, heavy maintenance for in-depth checks involving the disassembly of cabins, equipment and some structural elements, and the realization of modification programs, particularly the retrofitting of cabins.\n\n## 1.3.3.1/emspace Business  environment\n\n## An attractive market despite the growing constraints\n\nThe MRO market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to estimates, the global MRO market, which comprises the maintenance and modification spending by aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, collapsed from an expected US$91/uni00A0billion to US$50/uni00A0billion in 2020 (source: Oliver Wyman MRO Forecast, July/uni00A02020). For 2021, the MRO market should return to a level of US$73/uni00A0billion (source: Oliver Wyman MRO Forecast, July/uni00A02020).\n\nThe trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization. The Covid-19 crisis and CSR priorities have accelerated fleet adjustment decisions to gain e/fficiency and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions. Airlines are tending to defer maintenance, phase out older generation aircraft and replace them by next generation aircraft. The MRO operators are su/ffering from weaker and more volatile demand on older and current-generation aircraft.\n\nFinally, the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis on airline bankruptcies will also have a residual e/ffect on the MRO market.\n\nHowever, the longer-term outlook for the MRO market remains strong, with steady growth projected for the next decade.\n\n## Ever-fiercer competition\n\nAs with all the players in the aeronautics industry, the MRO operators are participating in a vast consolidation movement to reinforce economies of scale.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, air framers, engine manufacturers and aircraft component manufacturers are continuing to develop their after-sales services to o/ffer their customers increasingly-integrated aircraft maintenance solutions. This positioning corresponds to a long-term strategy based on leveraging intellectual property by selling licenses to a limited number of maintenance service providers seeking to expand their business activity on certain products. This trend is escalating, especially with the arrival of new aircraft like the E2, A220, A350, Boeing 787, etc. Ultimately, this trend could result in reduced competition on the MRO market, with a seriously adverse e/ffect on airline maintenance costs.\n\nThe ability to sustain balanced competitive conditions is a priority objective for AFI KLM E&M's commercial activity, but also to contain Air/uni00A0France's and KLM's maintenance costs.\n\nAt the same time, this business is experiencing a technological change which is influencing the products, processes, methods and competencies within the maintenance activities. This is notably the case with next-generation aircraft whose avionics dimension is playing an increasingly important role relative to the mechanical systems: digital tools, composite structures, connectivity, etc. Innovation is an integral part of all the business processes.\n\n## 1.3.3.2/emspace AFI KLM E&M's position as a world leader\n\nOn the strength of its solid position as the number two global multi-product MRO by total revenue, AFI KLM E&M is pursuing its targeted development strategy based on its own specific features and the Group's objectives.\n\nThis strategy has two pillars: firstly, cutting costs and maintaining high standards of quality and performance and, secondly, growing the customer portfolio in high value-added products and services.\n\nIn the past decade, this ambition has been reflected in substantial investment in modernizing AFI KLM E&M's IT system and industrial infrastructure at its principal maintenance sites: Toulouse, Amsterdam, Villeneuve-Le-Roi, Roissy and Orly.",

While it has been impacted by the crisis, the current order book status indicates that AFI KLM E&M is able to maintain and even reinforce its market position with the new aircraft generations, notably by supporting the development of the Group's fleet with the A220 and the E2.\n\nThis market success is supported by The MRO Lab \u00ae innovation program which focuses on strategic areas of the MRO sector, ranging from technician mobility and customer experience to the Internet of Things, Big Data applications, predictive maintenance, digitalization, additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn the digital field, PROGNOS \u00ae constitutes a major building block. Launched in 2016, it regroups a range of predictive maintenance solutions based on exploiting the data from aircraft systems with a view to improving maintenance models and processes. The PROGNOS \u00ae range of solutions now includes PROGNOS \u00ae for Aircraft, PROGNOS \u00ae for APU, PROGNOS \u00ae for Inventory and PROGNOS \u00ae for Engines. AFI KLM E&M is capitalizing on the vast amount of data generated by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM fleets to develop its PROGNOS \u00ae solutions, and verify their operational relevance and performance before sharing such innovations with its customers.\n\nAFI KLM E&M has developed several cost-saving projects, along with transformation and restructuring plans to enhance its competitiveness and adapt its organization to the market environment.\n\nIn aircraft maintenance, the implementation of adaptation projects has also continued to reinforce AFI KLM E&M's competitiveness. Cost-saving initiatives have been implemented to optimize activity on a site-by-site basis, strengthen external partnerships and deploy more e/fficient work organizations. All this has been accompanied by efforts to match resources to the level of business activity and build new career paths.\n\nIn the Engines and Components segments, AFI KLM E&M has managed to strengthen its positioning on products and services aligned with market cycles and expectations, and secure its global MRO network.\n\n## Contributing to the Flight Safety and Operational E/fficiency programs\n\nAFI KLM E&M's primary task is to guarantee the airworthiness of the Group's fleet and ensure regulatory compliance. To this end, AFI KLM E&M manages technical data, implements the maintenance policies, and ensures the permanent availability of the required skilled sta/ff and technical resources.\n\nAFI KLM E&M has pursued the deployment of its Safety Management System (SMS), enabling the implementation of processes relating to Flight Safety in a systematic, cross-functional manner. This is done through regular meetings devoted to event analysis, and the establishment and monitoring of action plans. The SMS is also based on a system of feedback encouraged by the deployment of a 'safety mind-set' and supported by a network of local Flight Safety O/fficers.\n\nAFI KLM E&M has also realized a volunteer-driven oversight evaluation known as MLOSA (Maintenance Line Operations Safety Assessment) in its Paris plants. Consisting of a frontline campaign by a network of observers, this procedure enables the identification and reporting of situations which could present a high risk to Flight Safety. Given the success of this operation in the Airframe, Engines and Components division, the approach has been extended to the Engineering functions.\n\n## Airframe maintenance at the service of airlines\n\n## Line Operations support\n\nAFI KLM E&M continues to market its services to customers in the line maintenance segment and to develop its business in its main bases as well as internationally.\n\n## Light Maintenance operations\n\nWithin the framework of AFI KLM E&M's continuous improvement e/fforts, the Light Maintenance operations, which are mostly executed in Amsterdam, Paris-CDG and Paris-Orly, have continued to implement new processes to further reduce Turn Around Times and increase aircraft utilization, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nAt the same time, AFI KLM E&M continues its iGO Solutions joint-venture operations by delivering high-performance support to its customers; Transavia for its 737/uni00A0fleet and Air Cara\u00efbes/ French Blue for their A330 and A350 fleets.\n\n## Heavy Aircraft Maintenance\n\nHeavy maintenance continues to undergo structural change in a market where prices remain low. A maintenance master plan has thus been implemented, designed to rationalize the aircraft maintenance operations by optimizing activity on a site-by-site basis (Paris-CDG, Amsterdam-Schiphol, Paris-Orly, Toulouse-Blagnac). The Group's new fleet plans will enable this optimization to be continued in the coming years.\n\nAFI KLM E&M continued its use of external partners to cut maintenance costs for the Group's fleets and obtain, in return, additional work in the high-growth Engine and Components segments.",

        "page_content": "From engineering to maintenance, AFI KLM E&M provides continuous support for the Group's airlines, as well as for an ever-growing number of customers, by defining and deploying new cabin products in both short and medium-haul and across the long-haul o/ffering.\n\n## Military Product\n\nIn mid-2015, AFI KLM E&M saw the renewal of the Maintenance Contract for the four AWACS belonging to the French Air Force for a ten-year period. In addition, AFI KLM E&M is also designing and executing the Cockpit Avionic Renovation for the same fleet.\n\n## Component Support: managing a global supply chain\n\nComponent Support covers the repair of a broad technological spectrum of aircraft parts, the management of technical and reliability standards and the management of component shipments to/from customers' operating bases. The growth opportunities for this product are located in far-flung markets. AFI KLM E&M's customers are evolving towards service integration, requiring access to a spares pool. The Group is also deploying appropriate support services worldwide, with local logistics facilities and asset management programs.\n\nThe success of these o/fferings is reflected in the loyalty of AFI KLM E&M's customers. For example, in 2019, Virgin Atlantic demonstrated its continued confidence in AFI KLM E&M by signing a long-term contract for its A350-1000s, on top of the longer-running Boeing 787 and A330/A340 contracts. Also in 2020, despite one of the worst crises in aviation history, AFI KLM E&M's o/ffer on latest-generation aircraft attracted the attention of several airlines such as Air Premia and Bamboo Airways who selected AFI KLM E&M to support their Boeing 787 fleets.\n\n## Engines: continued product development with the LEAP engines equipping the A320neo and the 737MAX\n\nIn 2020, AFI KLM E&M pursued the further roll-out of its LEAP product range. The LEAP is the engine equipping the A320neo and Boeing 737/uni00A0MAX aircraft, and will be one of the main engines for the fast-growing narrow-body fleets.\n\nThe Group o/ffers engine support on the following engines:\n\n- -CFM56: the Group's workshops support one of the world's largest fleets of CFM56 engines, handling some 400/uni00A0engines operated by various airlines. AFI KLM E&M is using its Amsterdam engine shop to position itself on the growing need for CFM56-7B support and the Orly engine shop for the CFM56-5/uni00A0support requirements;\n- -CF6-80: by o/ffering full-service maintenance at its Amsterdam engine shop, AFI KLM E&M is well positioned to support the CF6-80E1 equipping the A330s and the final phase in the life of the CF6-80C2. AFI KLM E&M's long maintenance track record with these engines means that it currently o/ffers the most suitable maintenance solutions. In 2020, the phase-out from the fleet of the Group's Boeing 747-400/uni00A0aircraft gave AFI KLM E&M access to recycled spare parts and enables the\n\nremaining potential of these engines to be used to support its customers' CF6-80C2 fleets;\n\n- -GE90: on the strength of its state-of-the-art infrastructure, AFI KLM E&M offers the main alternative to the engine manufacturer for overhauls to this engine. Since 2012, AFI KLM E&M has had a new engine test cell at Paris-CDG. This test facility can test 300/uni00A0engines per year, reducing processing time and o/ffering a more cost-e/ffective service for customers. This test facility, combined with significant expertise and proven experience, has attracted the interest of a growing number of airlines.\n\nIn 2020, in addition to its infrastructure, AFI KLM E&M continued to build its know-how and can o/ffer customers the benefit of its GE90 operating experience with, for example, On-Site/On-Wing Support enabling remedial as well as preventive actions anywhere in the world. This support can be accompanied by GE90 Engine Monitoring, designed to detect technical problems upstream thereby limiting potential engine damage;\n\n- -GEnx: At the launch in 2015, AFI KLM E&M was the first non-OEM supplier to carry out, Quick Turn checks on this engine. Since 2017, the AFI KLM E&M Zephyr test cell successfully passed the GEnx correlation test, enabling AFI KLM E&M to also perform engine test runs for its ten GEnx airline customers;\n- -LEAP: Through the EASA/FAA approvals, AFI KLM E&M is able to assist LEAP operators worldwide during the entry into operational service phase. AFI KLM E&M can meet the needs of its customers in carrying out the on-wing/ on-site work on LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines. The scope of these interventions is tailored to the requirements of operating airlines, and may include activities like: power plant build-up, borescope inspection, and line replaceable unit (LRU) replacement services, amongst many others. Thanks to its CAAC approval, AFI KLM E&M can also carry out an extensive set of activities for all customers in China (airlines and MROs). Furthermore, AFI KLM E&M is also authorized to o/ffer a large array of engine support services in our Engine workshops to support customers that operate Boeing 737 MAX fleets (LEAP-1B).\n\n## AFI KLM E&M: an international network tailored to local requirements\n\nAFI KLM E&M is pursuing its growth strategy on profitable markets and segments by deploying its network of subsidiaries (EPCOR, CRMA, KLM UK Engineering, Barfield, AFI KLM E&M Components China) and partnerships (ATI, Beijing LMI, Spairliners, Max MRO Services, iGO Solutions, Airfoils Advanced Solutions, Singapore Component Solutions, AMES and Bonus Tech), and leveraging the power of its global logistics network.

The materials recovered will thus have five possible destinations: reuse, disassembly, sale in the surplus parts market, dismantling and reprocessing for sale within the framework of an Air/uni00A0France product line (non-aeronautic) and the reprocessing of waste from reject materials not recovered by one of the previous measures.\n\nThis process has thus been applied for the handling of Economy, Business and La Premi\u00e8re seats at the end of their useful lives. It enriches the Scrap program on the repair of aircraft and engine parts and has a significant environmental impact by, for example, reducing mineral extraction (titanium, nickel, etc.) for component manufacturing. It also generates savings by up-cycling products and o/ffering them a second life.\n\n## Apprenticeship to ensure the perpetuation of know-how\n\nWithin the framework of its apprenticeship policy, Air/uni00A0France Industries o/ffers diverse paths to apprentices in accordance with their aspirations and training needs.\n\nBy passing on their know-how, the apprentice masters enable young people to acquire valuable experience that can increase their employability.\n\nAs part of its Corporate Social Responsibility approach, Air/uni00A0France Industries also welcomes 'School of the Second Chance' (\u00c9cole de la deuxi\u00e8me chance) interns who have dropped out of formal education with no qualifications and are seeking a professional direction.\n\n## Key figures\n\n|                                                | Year     | Year            | Year                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Maintenance                                    | 2020     | Change          | Change at  constant  currency |\n| Total revenues  (in \u20acm)                        | 2,858    | -38.1%          |                               |\n| Third-party revenues  (in \u20acm)                  | 1,248    | -41.6%          | -41.4%                        |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm) | (543)    | -803            | -798                          |\n| Operating margin  (%)                          | (19.0) % | -24.6/uni00A0pt | -24.5/uni00A0pt               |\n\nDuring 2020, external revenues declined by 41.6% and the decrease in activity for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group airlines impacted the total revenues. Operating costs were reduced with the lower level of maintenance activity, sta/ff reductions, governmental wage support measures for employees and other cost-savings measures.\n\nCovid-19 generated around \u20ac320/uni00A0million of exceptional items, of which \u20ac120/uni00A0million of doubtful receivables, \u20ac110/uni00A0million of provisions on asset value and \u20ac90/uni00A0million on contract reviews.\n\nThe Maintenance order book was evaluated at US$9.1/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020, a decrease of US$2.4/uni00A0billion compared to December/uni00A031, 2019, explained by the Covid-19 crisis. The Maintenance business is carefully managing agreements with clients on payment terms.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM maintenance activity is well positioned on new-generation aircraft maintenance and foresees solid opportunities for the future.\n\n## 1.4/emspace THE AIR/uni00A0FRANCE/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM GROUP FLEET\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group fleet was composed of 546/uni00A0aircraft, of which 513 in operation, versus a respective 554 and 546/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nThe main operational fleet consisted of 409/uni00A0aircraft (428/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2019), of which 157/uni00A0were long-haul aircraft (176/uni00A0at December/uni00A031, 2019), six were cargo aircraft (six aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2019) and 246/uni00A0were medium-haul aircraft (246/uni00A0at December/uni00A031, 2019) including 79/uni00A0aircraft in the Transavia Group fleet (80/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nThe regional fleet in operation was composed of 104/uni00A0aircraft (118/uni00A0at December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the average age of the aircraft in the operational fleet was 12.1/uni00A0years, of which 12.0/uni00A0years for the long-haul fleet, 13.2/uni00A0years for the medium-haul fleet, 17.8/uni00A0years for the cargo fleet and 9.2/uni00A0years for the regional fleet.

Air/uni00A0France's sizeable order book (32/uni00A0A350s and 60/uni00A0A220s) for\n\nthe most-environmentally-e/fficient next-generation aircraft will notably enable a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and respect of the Group's environmental commitments.\n\nFor its part, KLM welcomed two more Boeing 787-10s into its fleet and retired all the Boeing 747-400s (passenger and combo) from its operational fleet.\n\nOver the longer term, fleet modernization will be reflected in the growth of the B787 fleet at KLM and that of the A350-900s within Air/uni00A0 France. The introduction of the A220-300 for Air/uni00A0France, which remains scheduled for 2021, and the EMB195 E2 for KLM will also enable the modernization of the Group's short and medium-haul fleet. Transavia (France and the Netherlands) will see its fleet adapt to the growth market in the leisure segment.\n\nThe Group will continue to invest substantial sums in cabin refurbishment, as is currently the case for its A330s and Boeing 777s, as well as in the satellite on board connectivity proposition, enabling customers to be o/ffered an in-flight WiFi connection in both medium and long-haul.\n\n1",

They also determine the powers of each of the advisory Committees established within the Board.\n\nThe last update to the Internal Rules took place on March/uni00A012, 2019. It concerned the missions of the newly-created Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee and the changes to the AFEP-MEDEF Code having taken place in June/uni00A02018.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors are available on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM website at http://www.airfranceklm.com (Governance section).\n\nOn June/uni00A017, 2004, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors adopted a set of Internal Rules based on the corporate governance principles established by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## 2.2.2/emspace Separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nDuring its meeting of May/uni00A015, 2018, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors decided to separate the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer. This decision followed Mr. Jean-Marc Janaillac stepping down as Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and the implementation of a transitional governance to, notably, enable the Chair of the Board of Directors to focus on the e/ffective functioning of the Board and on the search for candidates for the position of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nOn August/uni00A016, 2018, the Board of Directors confirmed the separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer within the framework of the implementation of the long-term governance with the appointment of Mr. Benjamin Smith as the new Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The Board of Directors considered that this was the best governance option for the Company at this stage in its development in that it enables the Company to benefit from a new dynamic with a Chair of the Board of Directors who is dedicated to governance matters and a Chief Executive O/fficer with recognized expertise in the air transport industry, who is focused on the Group's operations. The complementarity of their profiles and roles optimizes the Group's governance and ensures a balanced and respectful division of their respective missions. It also enables\n\nthe e/ffective coordination of the Board of Directors thanks to the presence of a Chair of the Board of Directors who is exclusively devoted to its functioning and guarantees a more e/ffective separation between the control and management functions.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, the Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit to the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting a resolution setting the age limit for the Chair of the Board of Directors at 72/uni00A0years (70/uni00A0years currently), when the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer are separate and as applied by a number of French listed companies. Pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the role and attributions of the Chair remain unchanged. The Board of Directors also decided that, in this eventuality, Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc would fulfil her functions as Chair of the Board of Directors until the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year. Within the context of the unprecedented public health crisis currently being traversed by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the Board of Directors stressed the importance of stabilizing the Group's governance and thus creating the most favorable conditions for the management to concentrate its e/fforts on the operational management and the exit from crisis.",

The proposed appointment, co-optation and re-appointment of Board directors formulated by the Board of Directors comply with the legal and regulatory provisions (including, notably, the rules on parity) and the recommendations formulated by the AFEP-MEDEF Code (including, notably, the rules on the independence of the Board directors)/thinspace (3) .\n\nPursuant to Article 8.2/uni00A0of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors referring to the provisions of the agreements signed on October/uni00A016, 2003 (Framework Agreement) within the framework of the business combination between Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the Appointments and Governance Committee submits to the Board of Directors proposals regarding:\n\n- a) the appointment as a Board director of the President of the KLM Supervisory Board;\n- b) the appointment or re-appointment as Board directors of two high-profile individuals residing in the Netherlands, chosen after consultation and on the recommendation of the KLM Supervisory Board; and\n- c) the appointment or re-appointment as a Board director of a high-profile individual residing in the Netherlands, chosen after consultation and on the recommendation of the Dutch State.\n\nIn addition, two Board directors are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State, in application of Ordinance No.2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the two Subscription Agreements signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 between, on one hand, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and, on the other, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines (outlined in section/uni00A02.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'), since October/uni00A02017 Delta Air Lines/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines have each had one representative on the Company's Board of Directors (4) .\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A0225-23 and L./uni00A022-10-5/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. L./uni00A06411-9/uni00A0of the Code des Transports and Article 17-2/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, two Board directors representing the employee shareholders and former employee shareholders are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the employee (and former employee) shareholders referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-102/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce:\n\n- -  one representative belonging to the flight deck crew category of sta/ff; and\n- -  one representative belonging to the other employee category of sta/ff.\n\nThe employee and former employee shareholders are invited to select their candidates for each of the two colleges (Flight Deck Crew and Other Employees), the appointments taking place based on a majority vote in two rounds of balloting. The candidate having obtained the absolute majority of the votes cast in each college, in either the first or second round, is then proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting/thinspace (5) .\n\nLastly, in that the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors is composed of more than eight Board directors, there are two directors representing the employees in the Board of Directors (6) . Pursuant to Article 17-3/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, the first Board director representing the employees is appointed by the Comit\u00e9 de Groupe Fran\u00e7ais as stipulated in Article L./uni00A02331-1/uni00A0of the Code de Travail, while the second is appointed by the European Works Council of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. Each Board director representing the employees is appointed for a two-year term of o/ffice, expiring at the end of the Annual",

The criteria and objectives of this policy set out below take into account the results of the evaluation of the Board of Directors as well as the skills matrix of its Board directors (see below).\n\n## Selection criteria for Board directors\n\nIn the context of the appointment and re-appointment of Board directors, and to preserve the balance of its composition, the Board gives preference to the following selection criteria:\n\n- -  openness to the world, professional experience abroad and diversity of nationalities. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was created through the merger of two companies of di/fferent nationalities with global reach and numerous international challenges;\n- -  General Management experience acquired within major French or foreign international companies; the Group numbers around 76,000/uni00A0employees working in three main businesses: the Network business (Passenger and Cargo transportation), the Maintenance business and the passenger transportation on low-cost flights business, operating in 116/uni00A0countries;\n- -  knowledge and experience of the transport and airline sector as well as of tourism, since these are the businesses in which the Group is primarily active;\n- -  the Board of Directors also ensures that expertise related to the Group's strategic areas is represented on the Board, particularly in the areas of brand strategy, digital and customer relations, human resources, and social and environmental responsibility (CSR).\n\n## Implementation of the diversity policy\n\nIn implementing this diversity policy, the Board has set itself clear objectives:\n\n- -  maintain the balance between the Company's various stakeholders and the balanced representation of men and women;\n- -  favor the independence of spirit of the Directors;\n- -  promote adherence to the Group's fundamental values;\n- -  ensure the availability of Board directors.\n\nIn connection with this policy, the following changes to the composition of the Board of Directors took place in 2020:\n\n## Consolidation of air transport industry expertise\n\nThe Board of Directors welcomed Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg as a new Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State. Mr. van den Berg replaces Mr. Jaap de Hoop Sche/ffer who stepped down as a member of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors with e/ffect as of the end of the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2020. He brings to the Board his expertise in the fields of economics and public a/ffairs. Ms./uni00A0Couderc and Mr. Wynaendts were also re-appointed as independent Board directors. They continue to bring to the Board their expertise in governance, public a/ffairs and General Management. Lastly, Mr. Wang, representing China Eastern Airlines, an airline company and shareholder of the Group, saw his mandate as a Board director confirmed by the Shareholders' Meeting following his co-optation by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Balance of nationalities and international openness\n\nThe arrival in the Board of Directors of Mr. van den Berg, appointed on the proposal of the Dutch State to replace Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer, and the re-appointment of Mr. Wynaendts, an independent Board director, both of Dutch nationality, and the ratification of the co-optation of Mr. Wang, a Board director appointed as proposed by China Eastern Airlines and of Chinese nationality, enables the Board to consolidate the diversity of its nationalities.\n\nFive Board directors, Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mssrs Bouts, 't Hart, Wynaendts and van den Berg are of Dutch nationality within the Board of Directors. Lastly, Mr. Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer and a Board director of the Company, holds dual Canadian and British citizenship and Mr. Mattson (4) , permanent representative of Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., is of US nationality.\n\nThe Board thus numbers six di/fferent nationalities and eight non-French Board directors, i.e. a proportion of 42%. These Board directors bring to the Board of Directors an in-depth knowledge of their respective markets.\n\n## A balance favorable to the exercise of the missions of each Committee\n\nIn addition, based on criteria like gender representation, professional qualifications and experience, and nationality, the Board of Directors ensures that there is a balance favorable to the performance of each Committee's duties.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.4/emspace Independence of the Board directors\n\nHaving examined the situation of each Board director as at December/uni00A031, 2020 in the light of the criteria stipulated by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, and as proposed by the Appointments and Governance Committee, at its meeting of February/uni00A017, 2021, the Board of Directors adopted the following position:\n\n- -  seven Board directors (Ms./uni00A0Aulagnon, Ms./uni00A0Boeren, Ms./uni00A0Bouillot, Ms./uni00A0Couderc (1) , Ms./uni00A0Idrac, Ms./uni00A0Parize and Mr. Wynaendts) are independent in that:\n- -  none of these seven Board directors has directly or indirectly a relationship with the company, its Group or its management that is such as to color their judgement,\n- -  No significant business relationships exist between the Group and each of these independent board directors, and\n- -  In her capacity as Chair of the Board of Directors, Ms./uni00A0AnneMarie Couderc receives only fixed compensation and no variable compensation in the form of either cash or shares;\n- -  although they were appointed as proposed by the Supervisory Board of KLM in accordance with the 2003 agreements relating to the business combination between Air/uni00A0France and KLM, Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts are independent with respect to \u00a79.2/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code insofar as they have no direct or indirect relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its Group or its management that could compromise the exercise of their freedom of judgement. Ms./uni00A0 Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have no special interest (significant shareholder, employee, other) in the Company or its Group. Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have been independent directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM since, respectively, May/uni00A02017 (first appointment as a Board director) and May/uni00A02020 (re-appointment date following a first appointment as a Board director in May/uni00A02016).\n- -  the other non-independent Board directors are:\n- -  a representative of the French State appointed by ministerial order: Mr.Vial,\n- -  Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State: Mr. Comolli and Ms./uni00A0Panosyan,\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State: Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg (2) ,\n- -  Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. (3) , whose permanent representative is Mr. Mattson/thinspace (4) ; and\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by China Eastern Airlines: Mr. Wang/thinspace (5) ,\n- -  representatives of the employee shareholders: Mr. Farges and Mr. Robardet,\n- -  representatives of the employees: Mr. Belabbas and Mr. Bouts; and\n- -  executive o/fficers of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM: Mr. Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Board director of Air/uni00A0France, and Mr. 't Hart, Chair of the KLM Supervisory Board.\n\nGiven the above, and pursuant to the provision of the AFEPMEDEF Code by which Board directors representing employee shareholders and Board directors representing the employees are not counted in the calculation of the percentages of independent shareholders within Boards of Directors and Committees (\u00a79.3 and 15.1/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code), the percentages of independent directors as of December/uni00A031, 2020 are:\n\n- -  47% in the Board of Directors;\n- -  67% in the Audit Committee (chaired by an independent director);\n- -  67% in the Appointment and Governance Committee (chaired by an independent director);\n- -  60% in the Remuneration Committee (chaired by an independent director);\n- -  50% in the Sustainability and Compliance Committee (chaired by an independent director).\n\nThe proportion of independent directors at December/uni00A031, 2020 is therefore 47%, i.e. below the 50% threshold recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code for non-controlled companies.\n\nThis gap is due to an exceptional situation linked to the Dutch government's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in February/uni00A02019. In e/ffect, on March/uni00A025, 2019, the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considered, based on a report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, that in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on February/uni00A026, 2019, Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer, a Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer qualify as an independent director as of that date. On May/uni00A026, 2020, Mr. van den Berg was appointed as a Board director of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State, replacing Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer whose term of o/ffice was expiring. Mr. van dan Berg is not an independent Board director.\n\nThe discussions initiated in 2019 on the composition of the Board of Directors have continued between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the French State and the Dutch State but no decision has been taken at this stage. The issues around these discussions have changed following the impact of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, the impact of the measures to reinforce Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's equity and quasi equity to be put in place in principle in the near future may, if necessary, also need to be taken into account in the change to the composition of the Board of Directors. This situation is thus temporary.",

This training is proposed and organized by the Company.\n\nThis training, which is paid for by the Company, is mostly carried out via a program designed by a professional body and is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the functioning of the Board of Directors and their roles as Board directors. Accounting and financing modules are also proposed to enable them to improve their financial know-how. A portion of this training time is carried out within the Company. Pursuant to the applicable regulation, during its meeting of February/uni00A019, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to terminate the training program in French and English o/ffered to the Board directors representing the employee shareholders and the employees.",

Every year, the Company sends the Board directors a questionnaire enabling confirmation that there are no conflicts of interest and the Company to be informed of any potential conflicts.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, none of the Board members are related and there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of the Board members with regard to the Company and their private interests and other duties.\n\nWith the exception of the agreements listed below, there are no arrangements or agreements between the main shareholders, customers, suppliers or other parties, in accordance with which a member of the Board of Directors has been selected:\n\n- (i) the agreements signed on October/uni00A016, 2003 between Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the Dutch government pursuant to which four Board directors are appointed to the Board of Directors as proposed by KLM and the Dutch government (see section/uni00A02.2.3/uni00A0'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Directors - Appointment and re-appointment of members of the Board of Directors'); and\n- (ii) the agreements signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 between, firstly, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines pursuant to which Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Mr. Wang were appointed to the Board of Directors (see section/uni00A02.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines').\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014 concerning the governance and transactions involving the share capital of public sector companies and the application decree-law No. 2014-949/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014, a Board director representing the French State is appointed by ministerial order and two Board directors are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State. In addition, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A0225-23 and L./uni00A022-10.5/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (French Code of Commerce), L./uni00A06411-9/uni00A0of the Code des Transports (French Transport Code) and 17.2/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, as proposed by the employee (and former employee) shareholders referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-102/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, two Board directors representing the employee and former-employee shareholders are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting. Lastly, in that the\n\nBoard of Directors is composed of more than eight directors, two Board directors representing the employees have seats on the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 22-10-7/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and Article 17-3/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation (see section/uni00A02.2.3/uni00A0'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Directors' - Appointment and re-appointment of members of the Board of Directors).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, there were no service level contracts binding any member of the Board of Directors to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to one of its subsidiaries and foreseeing the granting of benefits under the terms of the contract.\n\nWith the exception of Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., (see the Subscription Agreement signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 and detailed in section/uni00A02.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'), the Board directors have accepted no restrictions concerning the sale of their shareholdings in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, subject to respect of the rules relating to the prevention of insider trading and the statutory obligation to own at least ten shares in the Company during their terms of o/ffice/thinspace (1) .\n\n## Stock market and ethical compliance\n\nThe Compliance Rules, adopted by the Board of Directors on March/uni00A025, 2004, and as amended on November/uni00A017, 2017, remind notably company officers, senior executives of the Company, anyone with close personal ties with the latter and certain employees with access to inside information that, owing to their positions within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, they are required to refrain from trading in the Company's shares for a minimum of (i)/uni00A0thirty calendar days prior to the publication of the full annual and half-year financial statements and (ii)/uni00A0a minimum of fifteen calendar days prior to the publication of the full quarterly financial statements, the day of their publication being included in these periods. They also reiterate the specific obligations (particularly relating to access to inside information) applying to senior executives, Board directors and anyone with access to inside information relating to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM concerning the use of this information and their trading in the shares of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations relating to market abuse.\n\nIn the past five years, to the Company's knowledge, no Board director has been the subject of a fraud conviction or o/fficial public sanction by the statutory or regulatory authorities, associated with a bankruptcy, sequestration of goods or a placing of a company under administrative receivership nor has, lastly, been prevented by a court from acting as a member of a management or supervisory body of an issuer or from involvement in managing the business of an issuer. This information is confirmed every year via a questionnaire sent to the Board directors.",

This loan has a maturity of one year, renewable once for a period of one or two years; and\n- 2) a shareholder loan in the amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, granted by the French State. This loan was granted for a four-year period, with two consecutive one-year extension options and may be paid to the Company in several tranches.\n\nIn that the French State holds 14.3% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital, Ms./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State and Mr. Martin Vial, Board director representing the French State and appointed by ministerial order, were deemed to be indirectly concerned by the signature of the shareholder loan and the loan guaranteed by the French State.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors authorized the signature of the afore-mentioned loan contracts during its meeting of April/uni00A024, 2020. Ms./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan, Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli and Mr. Martin Vial did not take part in the deliberations or in the voting relating to the authorization of the loan contracts.\n\nThe loan contracts were signed with a view to enabling the Company to satisfy its urgent need for cash following the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. In that this crisis had considerably impacted the Company's activity, in the current state of a/ffairs, its financial situation would not have enabled a sustained recovery in activity. The signature of these agreements thus appeared necessary for the Company's long-term future. By covering, notably, the Company's general financial needs, these agreements will enable a viable recovery in activity.\n\nBased on the simultaneous draw down of all the funds made available in respect of each of the two loan agreements, the interest costs incurred by the Company over the first twelve-month period are expected to amount to:\n\n- -  around \u20ac50/uni00A0million in respect of the loan guaranteed by the French State; and\n- -  around \u20ac210/uni00A0million in respect of the shareholder loan.\n\n## Finalization of a Framework Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State\n\nOn August/uni00A07, 2020, within the framework of the financial support package granted by the Dutch State to KLM, a subsidiary of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into a Framework Agreement with KLM and the Dutch State, a shareholder in the Company with 14% of its share capital.\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a financing package for KLM in the total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion, backed by the Dutch State, composed of two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- -  a revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, granted to KLM by eleven banks and up to 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State; and\n- -  a direct loan in the amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with subordination to the revolving credit facility.\n\nThis financial support package aims to enable KLM to weather the current crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and to prepare for the future. A number of conditions were associated with the loan from the Dutch State. These conditions were the subject of a Framework Agreement entered into between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State foreseeing, notably, commitments made by the airline in terms of becoming more sustainable and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and a contribution made by employees. KLM has undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full. Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg, a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State, and Mssrs. Cees 't Hart and Benjamin Smith, both being Board directors in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM, were deemed to be indirectly concerned by the signature of the framework agreement given, in particular (i)/uni00A0the Dutch State's 14% shareholding in the Company, (ii)/uni00A0the ownership by the Company of the majority of the KLM share capital and (iii)/uni00A0Mr. Benjamin Smith's duties as Chief Executive O/fficer of the Company. Pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the signature of the Framework Agreement during its meeting of June/uni00A025, 2020. Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg, Mr. Cees 't Hart and Mr. Benjamin Smith did not take part in the deliberation or the vote relating to the Framework Agreement.\n\nThe Framework Agreement was finalized within the framework of the financial support package granted by the Dutch State to KLM, aimed at enabling KLM, a subsidiary of the Company, to meet its urgent need for cash following the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. This financing should enable KLM to weather the current Covid-19 crisis and prepare for the future.",

The finalization of the financing and the framework agreement thus appeared necessary for KLM's long-term future. By covering, notably, KLM's general financial needs and foreseeing various economic, social and environmental measures, it will enable a viable recovery in activity.\n\nThe Framework Agreement constitutes a key element in the Dutch State's financial support package for KLM in the total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion.\n\n## Amendment to the financial settlement mechanism for the joint-ventures entered into with (i)/uni00A0Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., and (ii)/uni00A0China Eastern Airlines (the 'joint-venture agreements') within the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors authorized:\n\n- 1) the amendment of the provisions relating to the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues and costs generated by the joint-venture) in the Blue Skies joint-venture agreement (entered into on May/uni00A015, 2018 and amended in October/uni00A02019), for the calendar year 2020. In this respect, each party waives all rights it may have with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. This waiver avoids the uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis. This waiver may be extended into 2021 by mutual agreement between the parties, based on the duration of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture operations; and\n- 2) the suspension of the provisions relating to the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into with China Eastern Airlines on November/uni00A026, 2018. In this respect, each party agrees to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for each party given the context linked to the public health crisis.\n\nThe other provisions of the joint-venture agreements remain unchanged.\n\nIn that Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. is a Board director and shareholder in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines is a shareholder of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and has a representative, Mr. Jian Wang, on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors, the supplementary clauses in the aforementioned joint-venture agreements enter into the application scope of the regulated agreements procedure referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines held more than 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM voting rights.\n\nOwing to the rapidly-changing health measures and regulations linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis, and to the highly uncertain environment, the parties wish to avoid unlimited financial exposure within the framework of the existing joint-venture agreements and thus decided to suspend the financial settlement provisions in the aforementioned two joint-venture agreements during the public health crisis period.\n\nGiven the amendment to the financial settlement mechanism foreseen in the joint-venture agreements, there is no need to calculate the impact that would have resulted from the application of these provisions.\n\nFor more information concerning the agreements between, firstly, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines, see section/uni00A02.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the strategic partnerships between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Agreements and commitments authorized and signed in previous financial years\n\n## Transatlantic partnership between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the agreements authorized during the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018 (see section 2.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'), so as not to proceed with the planned acquisition by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic Limited. This decision resulted in the amendment of the following agreements:\n\n- 1) termination of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS and Virgin Investments Limited, enabling Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, through its 100%-owned subsidiary Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS, to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, and termination of agreements ancillary to the SPA;\n- 2) amendment and updating of the Joint Venture Agreement between Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France, aimed at the implementation of a commercial joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France and KLM (signed on January/uni00A030, 2020 and e/ffective as per January/uni00A01, 2020) to reflect the termination of the SPA;\n- 3) amendment and updating of the Implementation Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Investments Limited, Virgin Atlantic Limited, Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and Sir Richard Branson (signed on January/uni00A09, 2020 and e/ffective as per January/uni00A01, 2020) to reflect, notably, the termination of the SPA;",

Any agreement, entered into directly or through an intermediary between, notably, the company and one of its Board directors, whether the latter has a direct or indirect interest, is subject to the prior authorization of the Board of Directors. Agreements between the company and another company are also subject to prior authorization by the Board of Directors if one of the Board directors of the company is an owner, an unlimited liability partner, a manager, a Board director, a member of the Supervisory Board or, in general, a director of this other company. The termination, amendment or waiving of regulated agreements must follow the same procedure as their signature, which begins with prior approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor more information on the July/uni00A02017 agreements between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic, see section/uni00A02.8.4/uni00A0'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines' in this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Commitments relating to the severance payment to the benefit of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\nOn August/uni00A016, 2018, pursuant to the provisions of the former Article L./uni00A0225-42-1/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (repealed by Ordinance No.2019-1234 of November/uni00A027, 2019), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors authorized the granting of a severance payment to the benefit of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, in some instances of forced termination and, namely, dismissal, non-renewal of his mandate as Chief Executive O/fficer or forced resignation linked to a change of control.\n\nIt is stipulated that the instances of forced termination enabling the implementation of this severance payment exclude any situation of serious misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the basis of the severance payment is equivalent to two years of his annual fixed and variable compensation (according to specific calculation modalities based, as applicable, on the target variable compensation in the event of a termination during the first 24/uni00A0months).\n\nA coe/fficient (between 0 and 100% inclusive) will be applied to the basis of the severance payment based on the achieved performance criteria relating to the annual variable component of his compensation over the two last financial years of his mandate (or since his appointment, in the event of termination during\n\nthe first 24/uni00A0months). The Board will assess the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nFor more information, see section 2.5.2 'Compensation of the company o/fficers in 2020'.\n\nThere were no agreements or commitments authorized and signed over the course of previous financial years whose execution continued during the last financial year.\n\n## Procedure for the qualification and regular evaluation of the current agreements signed in normal conditions\n\nDuring its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, as recommended by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors established a procedure enabling the qualification and regular evaluation of the agreements relating to current operations entered into under normal terms and conditions pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. The current and normal nature of an agreement is evaluated on a case-by-case basis during the signature, renewal or amendment of the said agreement, on the basis of objective criteria defined in the procedure.\n\nWithin the framework of this annual evaluation procedure, the Company:\n\n- -  draws up an inventory of all the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce;\n- -  reviews all the elements and documents having enabled the qualification of the agreements, and\n- -  as necessary, reviews the qualification of any agreements with interested parties (regulated agreement or free agreement, depending on the case).\n\nPersons with an interest in one of these agreements, entered into either directly or through an intermediary, do not participate in their evaluation.\n\nA presentation on the result of the inventory of the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, in respect of the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, was made to the Audit Committee on February/uni00A016, 2021 and to the Board of Directors on February/uni00A017, 2021.\n\n## Evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees\n\nAt least once a year, the Board of Directors conducts an evaluation of its functioning and organization, pursuant to Article 10/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and Article 2/uni00A0of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors. To inform this debate, a formalized evaluation is conducted annually via a questionnaire. This evaluation is steered by the Appointments and Governance Committee. It may also be entrusted to an independent external consultant.\n\nConcerning 2020, with the help of a specialized external consultant, the Board of Directors realized an evaluation in the form of a questionnaire submitted to each Board director accompanied by individual interviews. The following topics were addressed through the evaluation questionnaire:",

In the 2020 financial year, the Board of Directors was heavily involved in managing this crisis and a new organization of remote meetings was put in place to enable all the Board directors to participate, under good conditions and in an e/ffective manner, in Board of Directors and Committee meetings. The crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic has favored the bringing together of the Board directors who have shown themselves to be very committed despite the context.\n\nAs a general rule, the Board directors considered that the functioning of the Board of Directors had improved during 2020 since the previous evaluation. The evaluation revealed the following positive points:\n\n- -  strong mobilization of the Board directors and internal teams to ensure good management of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic;\n- -  the separation of powers between the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive O/fficer, adapted to the size and functioning of the Board;\n- -  marked improvement in the quality of the information made available to the Board directors;\n- -  improvement in the quality of the exchanges with the main shareholders;\n- -  satisactory complementarity of the expertise within the Board.\n\nThe results of the 2020 evaluation enabled the identification of a number of areas for improvement to be monitored during 2021 and, notably:\n\n- -  improve the sharing of information on the work of the Board's advisory Committees amongst all the Board directors;\n- -  increase the participation of the Group's key executives in meetings of the Board of Directors, to furthur explore the strategic options and engage in more in-depth discussions on the Group's operating model;\n- -  improve the management of speeches and questions asked during Board meetings to avoid redundancy and fluidify exchanges;\n- -  reestablish moments of conviviality between the Board directors to enable improved cultural integration and communication;\n- -  formalize the follow-up process for decisions taken by the Board of Directors.",

Boeren, Fran\u00e7ois Robardet, Paul Farges, Isabelle Parize, Martin Vial, Isabelle Bouillot and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. represented by George Mattson.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee benefit from financial and accounting competencies enabling them to exercise their functions.\n\nAt its meeting of November/uni00A09, 2011, the Board of Directors adopted the position whereby, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0823-19/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Company's Audit Committee includes at least one independent member with specific finance and accounting skills in the person of Ms./uni00A0 Aulagnon. It deemed that Ms./uni00A0Aulagnon's educational background and professional experience fulfill this requirement for specific financial competence, and that she has no relationships with the company, its Group or management that are such as to color her judgment. The seven other Committee members also have financial and/or accounting skills.\n\nThe principal executives responsible for accounting, legal a/ffairs, finance, internal control and Internal Audit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also attend meetings in an advisory capacity.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee. At the request of the Chair of the Committee and pursuant to Article 16.3/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, they were able to consult with Committee members outside the presence of the Group's senior executives on the occasion of the review of the annual financial statements.\n\n## Missions\n\nThe Audit Committee's principal missions are to review the interim and annual consolidated financial statements to inform the Board of Directors of their content, ensure that they are reliable and exhaustive, and that the information they contain, including the forward-looking information provided to shareholders and the market, meets high standards of quality. The Committee also oversees the auditing of the annual financial statements. In particular, the Audit Committee reviews the:\n\n- -  consolidation  scope;\n- -  relevance and consistency of the accounting methods used to draw up the financial statements;\n- -  principal estimates made by the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM;\n- -  principal financial risks with the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the material off-balance-sheet commitments;\n- -  comments and recommendations made by the Statutory Auditors and, if applicable, any significant adjustments resulting from audits.\n\nAs necessary, the Audit Committee formulates recommendations to guarantee the integrity of the process to establish the financial information.\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the e/ffectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary, Internal Audit, in terms of the processes relating to the establishment and treatment of the accounting and financial information, with no compromise to its independence. In this capacity, it reviews in particular the program and results of Internal Audit to ensure, notably, that, in the event of any malfunctioning, the appropriate action plans and follow-up monitoring have been implemented. The Committee discusses with the Statutory Auditors and reviews their conclusions on the half-year and annual financial statements. It also pays particular attention to the audit points identified by the Statutory Auditors and ensures compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements for financial and accounting information.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for steering the procedure to select the Statutory Auditors. It submits a recommendation to the Board of Directors when their appointment or re-appointment by the Shareholders' Meeting is envisaged pursuant to Article L./uni00A0823-3-1/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. It proposes the selection procedure to the Board of Directors and, in particular, whether a call to tender is appropriate. It verifies the independence and quality of the Statutory Auditors' work, examines issues relating to their amount of fees for the execution of statutory audit assignments, reviews and approves the fees submitted by each of the Statutory Auditors on an annual basis and ascertains that the joint system of Statutory Auditors is e/ffective.",

It rules on this point having first analyzed the risks of any compromise to the independence of the Statutory Auditors and the safeguarding measures applied by the latter.\n\nThe Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Group's overall financial, accounting and fiscal policy and its implementation.

The duration of the meetings averaged two hours and thirty minutes.\n\nThe following matters were notably reviewed by the Audit Committee during the 2020 financial year:\n\n## -Review of the financial statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quarterly, half-year and annual financial statements, and the budget, prior to their presentation to the Board of Directors. It conducted a detailed examination of the Statutory Auditors' summary reports on the half-year and annual financial statements as well as the significant points\n\nnoted in audits. The main accounting options adopted were the subject of a special presentation every quarter. In 2020, particular attention was paid to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a bond issue, the tender o/ffer to redeem three existing series of notes and the financial support packages granted by the French and Dutch States.\n\nThe review of the financial statements by the Audit Committee usually takes place the day before their review by the Board of Directors.\n\n## -Review and monitoring of the budget\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the budget prior to its presentation to the Board of Directors and oversees its tracking on a quarterly basis. This year the Audit Committee examined the major points in the 2021 budget prior to the review of the detailed budget.\n\n## -Internal control, risk management and Internal Audit\n\nDuring the Audit Committee meetings, Internal Audit gave a presentation on its half-year activity report.\n\nThe Company applies high standards of financial disclosure and corporate governance, and maintains a rigorous level of internal control across the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the summary sheet of the main operational and/or strategic risks on a half-yearly basis. The Committee also reviewed the financial risks (fuel and emission quotas, currency exchange rates, financing). It also reviewed and approved the process for reviewing the extra-financial risks. These extra-financial risks are submitted by Internal Audit to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee whose comments are taken into account in the presentations on risks made to the Audit Committee.\n\n## -Statutory  Auditors\n\nThe Audit Committee approved the budget for the Statutory Auditors' fees prior to the opening of the financial year together with their final amount as of the closing date. The Committee also addressed the matter of the appointment or re-appointment of the Statutory Auditors within the framework of the term of their mandates and in application of the requirement to organize a call to tender on the appointment of a new Statutory Auditor (Article 16/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) No.537/2014 of April/uni00A016, 2014).\n\n## -Approval of non-audit services\n\nTo execute this mission, the Audit Committee relies on an internal procedure deployed within the Group in 2004 and updated in 2016, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 2016-315/uni00A0of March/uni00A017, 2016 relating to Statutory Auditors, which came into force on June/uni00A017, 2016.\n\nAs foreseen by its annual work schedule, the Audit Committee also reviewed the following matters in 2020:\n\n- -  tracking of the cash and financing situation;\n- -  review of the financing and capex plan;\n- -  review of the principal litigation, fiscal risks and financial risks;\n- -  financial  transactions;\n- -  fraud detection and prevention;\n- -  monitoring of activity in the Group's subsidiaries;\n- -  review of the management report;",

The company's Board of Directors thus establishes a compensation policy which complies with the company's corporate interest (int\u00e9r\u00eat social), linked to its commercial strategy, and which contributes to its long-term sustainability. It outlines all the components of the fixed and variable compensation for the company o/fficers and explains the decision-making process followed for its establishment, revision and implementation. This compensation policy is the subject of a proposed resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, under the conditions provided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-32/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, on an annual basis and on any significant amendment to the compensation policy.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Shareholders' Meeting must also approve on an annual basis, firstly, the information referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-9, including notably the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid in respect of the mandate during the previous financial year or granted in respect of the mandate for the same financial year to all company o/fficers and, secondly, on the total compensation and benefits in kind paid during the previous financial year or granted for the same financial year to each executive o/fficer.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 is thus convened to approve:\n\n- -  the information relating to the compensation for each of the company o/fficers, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. This information is presented hereinafter in section/uni00A02.5.2/uni00A0'Compensation of the company o/fficers in 2020';\n- -  the fixed and variable elements composing the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid during the 2020 financial year or granted in respect of this financial year to Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc, Chair of the Board of Directors and\n\nto Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer, pursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce.

The work of the Remuneration Committee takes into account the examination of benchmarking studies carried out with the help of external consultants to compare this policy with the practices in comparable companies. The Committee also ensures that the compensation policy is aligned with the Company's strategy. On the basis of this work, the Committee formulates recommendations for the Board which then sets the compensation policy on an annual basis. The Remuneration Committee also formulates recommendations for the Board regarding its implementation.\n\nAs recommended by the Remuneration Committee, during the establishment of the compensation policy for company o/fficers, the Board of Directors takes into account the remuneration and employment conditions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's employees. As for all the employees of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors ensures the implementation of a simple, understandable and\n\nconsistent compensation policy in a fair manner. The Board of Directors takes particular care that, at their individual level, all the employees and company o/fficers have the material resources required for the fulfilment of their respective duties.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that any Board director in a situation of conflict of interests, even potential, must inform the Board of Directors and abstain from participating in the debate or vote for the corresponding deliberation. The executive o/fficers are not present during the discussions of the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee regarding their own compensation.\n\nShould a new Chair of the Board of Directors or a new Chief Executive O/fficer be appointed, the elements of compensation foreseen in the compensation policy for company o/fficers would also apply to them. As recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors will then determine, while adapting them to the situation of the interested parties, the targets, levels of performance, parameters, structure and maximum percentages relative to their annual fixed compensation which may not be higher than those approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe 2021 compensation policy for the company o/fficers outlines all the components of the fixed and variable compensation for Board directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.1/uni00A0hereinafter); the Chair of the Board of Directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0a. hereinafter); and the Chief Executive O/fficer (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0b. hereinafter), and explains the decision-making process for its establishment, review and implementation.\n\nThis 2021 compensation policy for the company o/fficers will be the subject of a proposed resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 under the conditions provided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-8/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and on any material amendment to the compensation policy.\n\n## 2.5.3.1/emspace Compensation for the Board directors in respect of 2021\n\nSubject to approval of the 2021 compensation policy for the company o/fficers by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021, the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors will receive, in respect of their Board directors' mandates, compensation (formerly 'directors' fees') amounting to a maximum which was set at \u20ac950,000 for the entire Board of Directors.",

The additional amount will be calculated pro rata temporis based on the attendance rates of the individual Board directors at these extraordinary meetings.\n\nThe Board directors (non-executive o/fficers) may not benefit from:\n\n- -  a long-term incentive plan or specific long-term incentive plan;\n- -  benefits in kind which are not linked to their duties;\n- -  an employment contract;\n- -  a non-compete indemnity;\n- -  an award of stock-options or free shares.\n\n## Modalities for the granting and payment of the compensation (formerly 'directors' fees') to representatives of the State and Board directors appointed on the proposal of the French State\n\nThe allocation rules for compensation paid to the Board directors outlined above are applicable to the State representatives and to the Board directors appointed as proposed by the French State.\n\nPursuant to Ordinance No. 2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014 and Article 1/uni00A0of the ministerial order of December/uni00A018, 2014, as amended by the ministerial order of January/uni00A05, 2018, the following rules apply:\n\n- -  for Board directors appointed directly by the French State, 100% of the compensation is paid to the French State (Article 5/uni00A0of the Ordinance),\n- -  for Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting on the proposal of the French State (Article 6/uni00A0of the Ordinance), there are two separate cases:\n- -  for public officials of the French State, 100% of the compensation is paid to the State;\n- -  for those not acting in the capacity of public o/fficials, the payment of the compensation must be shared as follows:\n- -15% paid to the State, and\n- -85% paid directly to the relevant director (with the application of the social and tax charges).\n\n## Commitment of the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors\n\nOn February/uni00A017, 2021, in view of the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis, the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors resolved to reduce by 25% their compensation paid in respect of the 2021 financial year until the Group's Current Operating Income (COI) returns to a positive amount.\n\n## 2.5.3.2/emspace Compensation of the executive o/fficers in respect of 2021\n\nBased on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the compensation packages of the Chair of the Board of Directors and of the Chief Executive Officer are set by the Board of Directors, pursuant to the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nPursuant to the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors also approves the compensation of the Chief Executive Officers of the principal subsidiaries (Air/uni00A0France and KLM). Furthermore, the Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Chief Executive O/fficer regarding the compensation of the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer and reviews the compensation of the members of the KLM Managing Board.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Remuneration Committee formulates and reviews these compensation policies, in relation to the",

It is also within this framework that the compensation policy has been set for 2021.\n\nDuring its meeting of February/uni00A017, 2021, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors defined the compensation structure composed of the fixed, variable and long-term elements, and the benefits of any kind, for the Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in respect of the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe performance criteria linked to the variable and long-term compensation within the framework of the 2021 compensation were set pursuant to the Board resolutions of February/uni00A017, 2021.\n\nIn view of the context of crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is specified that, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors will be able to use its judgement in determining any variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer. As a result, the Board of Directors will be able to determine the amount and payment of the variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/ffice consistent with (i)/uni00A0the performance achieved by the Group and the Group's financial situation at the end of the financial year, (ii)/uni00A0the compensation policy applied to the Group's employees, (iii)/uni00A0the protection of the Group's interests and those of its shareholders and/or (iv) any decision taken by the European Commission approving a State support measure in the form of a recapitalization, based on the provisions of the European Union's communication of March/uni00A020, 2020 relating to the Temporary Framework.\n\n## Structure of the compensation for the Air France-KLM Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2021 financial year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Amount of \u20ac900,000.\n- (2) 122% of the fixed compensation on achievement of the targets potentially rising to 150% should the targets be exceeded.\n- (3)   Two long-term incentive plans conferring the right to the granting of performance units, each in the amount of \u20ac1 million.\n- (4) The specific long-term incentive plan will be paid in Air France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares.\n- -Annual compensation (fixed and variable)\n\n## Description of the annual fixed and variable elements\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will benefit from annual gross fixed compensation of \u20ac900,000 and annual gross variable compensation potentially reaching between 0% and 122% of the annual gross fixed compensation on partial or full achievement of the targets (calculated on a linear basis), potentially rising to 122% of the annual gross fixed compensation on achievement\n\nof the targets, and potentially reaching a maximum of 150% should the targets be exceeded (calculated on a linear basis). It is specified that the structure of the annual compensation has remained unchanged since 2019.\n\nThe performance criteria for the annual variable compensation, which were set by the Board of Directors during its meeting of February/uni00A017, 2021, are 60% based on quantitative criteria linked to the Group's financial performance and targets, and 40% on qualitative criteria linked to the non-financial targets.",

Furthermore, medium-term\n\ntargets of a minimum of 33% women within the Group Executive Committee by 2030 and 40% women within the top 10% of the positions with the highest level of responsibility also by 2030 have been set by the Board of Directors. Concretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members, and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed to accelerate the taking into account of female profiles at all levels of management.

The settlement and delivery of the Tender O/ffer and the New Notes took place on January/uni00A016, 2020.\n\nThese transactions are part of the ongoing dynamic management of the Group's balance sheet structure. The issuance of the New Notes, combined with the Tender O/ffer, contribute to reducing the overall cost of the Group's debt and extending its maturity profile.\n\n## Redemption of the \u20ac600/uni00A0million of Undated Deeply Subordinated Notes (of which \u20ac403.3/uni00A0million were outstanding) issued in 2015\n\nOn September/uni00A01, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided to proceed with the redemption of all the outstanding perpetual subordinated notes issued in 2015 (ISIN Code FR0012650281 - 'the Notes') representing a total nominal amount of \u20ac403.3/uni00A0million, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5(b) (Optional Redemption) of the terms and conditions of the Notes.\n\nThe early redemption took place on October/uni00A01, 2020 at par, i.e. \u20ac100,000/uni00A0per Note, plus interest accrued since the last date on which interest was paid under the Notes (i.e. October/uni00A01, 2019) until the early redemption date (inclusive).\n\nThis early redemption was part of the Group's policy to reduce its interest costs.\n\n## 2.8.3/emspace Authorization to buy back Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's own shares\n\nEvery year, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors asks the Shareholders' Meeting for the authorization to buy back the company's own shares in the stock market, subject to a number of conditions.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Group neither purchased nor sold Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares within the framework of these authorizations.\n\nWithin the framework of the collective labor agreement reached in August/uni00A02015 between KLM and the VNV pilots' union, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM signed an agreement on\n\nDecember/uni00A08, 2016 with the VNV and an independent foundation established by the VNV for KLM pilots. Under this agreement, and in consideration for the gains resulting from the August/uni00A02015 agreement, on December/uni00A012, 2016 KLM financed the acquisition by the foundation of three million Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM treasury shares at the market price.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM held 1,208,005/uni00A0of its own shares, i.e. 0.3% of the share capital, of which 1,116,420/uni00A0shares held by KLM in respect of its various stock option plans.

(Delta) and China Eastern Airlines (CEA).\n\nOn July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had announced, firstly, the planned creation of a joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, the intensification of its partnership with CEA. These two commercial alliances were consolidated by equity links in 2017: Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern each acquired equity interests in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases authorized by the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of September/uni00A04, 2017 for a total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced its intention to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, in which Delta has a 49% stake, for around \u00a3220/uni00A0million.\n\nWithin this framework, on July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CEA on one hand, and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic on the other, signed partnership agreements aimed at defining the principles of their closer cooperation:\n\n- - on July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic signed Memoranda of Understanding laying the foundations for a future integration of the existing\n\njoint-ventures between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Alitalia, and between Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic, within a single joint-venture. Within this framework, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was expected to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. having held 49% of the latter since 2013, with the historic shareholder Sir Richard Branson retaining 20%. These agreements foresaw specific conditions intended to protect the interests of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in the event of any deterioration in the joint-venture's operating conditions linked to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (Brexit).\n\n- -  Air France - KLM and CEA also stepped up their commercial cooperation and reinforced their partnership within the framework of the existing joint-venture, through the signature on July/uni00A027, 2017, of a Marketing Agreement aimed at defining the principles of their closer cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, to proceed with the capital increases reserved to CEA and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., on July/uni00A027, 2017 China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. signed two Subscription Agreements with Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, wherein both investors agreed to subscribe to the reserved capital increases and containing the following commitments:",

In addition, following the expiry of the above-mentioned five-year lock-up undertaking, in the event of a trade sale of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to a third party via an over-the-counter transaction, both CEA and Delta have undertaken to first give Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the option of purchasing these shares, at the same pricing conditions.\n\nOn October/uni00A03, 2017, Eastern Airlines Industry Investment (Luxembourg) Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEA Global Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. both subscribed in cash to capital increases without shareholders' preferential subscription rights, each for a total (including issue premium) of \u20ac375,274,100, at a subscription price of \u20ac10/uni00A0per share (including issue premium). The acquisition of these shareholdings was accompanied by the appointment of two directors to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors designated, firstly, by China Eastern Airlines and, secondly, by Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc.\n\nLastly, on March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018, within the framework of the implementation of the future single joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, and following authorization by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors (see section 2.3.1/uni00A0'Activities and functioning of the Board of Directors' - Agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce) the following agreements were signed:\n\n- - a Share Purchase Agreement (the 'SPA') between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS and Virgin Investments Limited, allowing Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, through its 100%-owned subsidiary Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS, to purchase a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic for \u00a3220.1/uni00A0million. Within this framework, a Disclosure Letter relating to the SPA and compensation from Virgin Investments to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM linked to tax liabilities relating to the Virgin Atlantic Group (the Tax Deed) were also agreed between the parties;\n- -  a Shareholders' Agreement) between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance, Delta, Virgin Investments Limited, Virgin Atlantic Limited and Sir Richard Branson organizing the shareholding in Virgin Atlantic;\n- -  a Put and call Option Deed between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance, Virgin Investments and Delta relating to 31% of the Virgin Atlantic share capital;\n- -  a joint-venture Agreement aimed at the implementation of a commercial joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta, Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France and KLM together with the related bilateral Transition Agreement signed with Delta; and\n- -  an Implementation Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance SAS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta, Virgin Atlantic Limited, Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and Sir Richard Branson, concerning the realization of the transaction.\n\nOn November/uni00A021, 2019, the US Department of Transportation granted Antitrust Immunity (ATI) within the framework of the extension of the transatlantic joint-venture. This regulatory step enabled the airlines to move forward with their transatlantic partnership.\n\nIn parallel, the partners finalized the expanded joint-venture's governance, agreeing on simplified decision-making processes enabling the joint-venture to deliver its full synergy potential. Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Virgin thus finally considered that Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's acquisition of an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic was no longer necessary and negotiated an agreement whereby Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM would not acquire an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic with no impact on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's position in the commercial joint-venture between Delta Air Lines/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The Virgin Group was to retain its 51% majority shareholding in the capital of Virgin Atlantic while Delta was to retain the remaining 49%. This partnership is considered to be key to reinforcing the Group's leadership position between Europe and North America, and will o/ffer customers a seamless travel experience across the Atlantic.\n\nAs a result, on October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the relevant agreements so as to no longer proceed with the planned investment in a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic. This decision led to the following amendments to the agreements, whose signature had been authorized by the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and 15, 2018:\n\n- -  termination of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') for the acquisition of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, and termination of agreements ancillary to the SPA.",

In view of the impact on the implementation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's existing joint-ventures, in December/uni00A02020, the partners reviewed the financial conditions of their agreements and amended the provisions relating to the financial 'settlement' mechanisms provided in the Group's joint-venture agreements signed, on one hand, with Delta and Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and, on the other, with CEA.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors authorized the amendment of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues and costs generated by the joint-venture) in the Blue Skies joint-venture agreement (entered into on May/uni00A015, 2018 and amended in October/uni00A02019) for the calendar year 2020. In this respect, each party waives all rights it may have with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis. The duration of this waiver may be extended in 2021 by mutual agreement of the parties based on the duration of the impacts on the joint-venture operations of the Covid-19 pandemic. The other provisions of the joint-venture agreement remain unchanged.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors also authorized the suspension of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into with CEA on November/uni00A026, 2018. In this respect, each party agrees to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis.

This is because, over time, changes in the shareholder structure of an air transport company whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated market could jeopardize its operating license as an EU air transport carrier, the retention thereof being conditional on EU interests holding a majority of the shares and maintaining e/ffective control, or the tra/ffic rights held by the Company as a French air transport company, pursuant to bilateral international agreements concluded between France and other States outside the European Union.\n\n## Identification and monitoring of shareholders\n\nArticles 9 and following of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation set the conditions under which the Board of Directors can or must decide either to reduce the 5% threshold above which shares must be held in registered form to 10,000/uni00A0shares, or to require all shares in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to be held in registered form. Thus, when the 40% share capital or voting right threshold has been passed by non-French shareholders, the Board of Directors can decide to reduce this 5% threshold to 10,000/uni00A0shares.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM publishes a notice informing the shareholders and the public that non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation own, directly or indirectly, 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital or voting rights. If it appears that non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation represent, directly or indirectly, more than 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's capital or voting rights on a long-term basis, the Board of Directors must decide to make it mandatory for all Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to be held in registered form.

Based on this threshold, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be entitled to launch procedures requiring the sale of shares in order to safeguard its nationality.

Other risks of which the Group is currently not aware, or risks that as of the date of this document it does not consider to be amongst the most material, could also negatively a/ffect its activities.\n\nThis section includes the main risks which, as of the date of this document, could potentially impact the Group's activity, financial\n\nsituation, reputation, results and outlook, as notably identified within the framework of the establishment of the Group's risk mapping, which evaluates their criticality, i.e. their gravity and probability of occurrence, as well as the mitigation plans in place. In accordance with the provisions of Article 16/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) 2017-1129 of the European Parliament and the European Council, within each of the risk categories mentioned below, the risk factors considered to be the most significant (indicated by an asterisk) are presented first. The elements included as we finalize this 2020 Universal Registration Document, on April/uni00A07, 2021, appear in bold, blue and italic .\n\n## 3.1.1/emspace Geopolitical and macro-economic risks\n\n## 3.1.1.1/emspace Impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on the Group's activities*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe current Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak had a significant adverse impact on the Group's operational activity, financial position and results during the 2020 financial year and is expected to continue to negatively impact the Group in the near future.\n\nSince February/uni00A02020, the Group's activities have been strongly a/ffected by the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic. Characterized as a 'pandemic' by the WHO on March/uni00A011, 2020, the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic has resulted in numerous restrictive measures to limit its spread. The measures put in place by the public authorities in numerous States have notably led to the temporary suspension of airline operations and a significant reduction or suspension of travel, in particular bound for or near the many countries where the virus is circulating, thereby having a material and negative impact on the Group's activity in the countries where it operates. Inter-continental/business travel is in particular being impacted by these regulatory restrictions and the cost-saving plans of the Group's corporate customers. For the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's passenger tra/ffic (measured in thousands of passengers) thus fell by 67.3% compared to the previous year.\n\nGiven these travel restrictions and the collapse in passenger tra/ffic and sales, since March/uni00A02020, the Group has been obliged to significantly reduce its capacity and, notably, drastically curtail its flight activity.\n\nFor full year 2020, the Group's capacity (in millions of ASK) was thus reduced by 54% compared to the previous year.\n\nThis health crisis had a very strong impact on the Group's activities and results for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, with an operating loss of \u20ac(4.5) billion (versus \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion in 2019).\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also implemented substantial cost-saving measures, in terms of staff reductions and the curtailment of non-essential investment and expenditure, the implementation of which could in particular damage the Group's reputation due to negative reactions from public authorities or unfavorable media coverage, or even lead to labor disputes, with a negative impact on the Group's activity. In this context, at the end of 2020, the reduction represented more than 7,000/uni00A0Full Time Equivalents (FTE) and additional departures within the framework of restructuring are expected until the end of 2022.\n\nThe Group has also taken various measures to strengthen its cash and liquidity position which are outlined in the 'Mitigating principles and actions' paragraph below. As at December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's net debt amounted to \u20ac11/uni00A0billion.\n\nFurthermore, on April/uni00A06, 2021, the Group announced a major recapitalization plan enabling it to reinforce its financial position and weather the current crisis (see section 5.4 'Subsequent events'). Should the implementation of this plan not be possible, this would have a material negative impact on its financial position and outlook.\n\nIn view of the pandemic's progressive spread and the unfolding developments, the current and future measures implemented by the public authorities in many countries could further disrupt, or even prevent, any activity by the Group for an indefinite period. In this context, several countries where the Group conducts its activities, including France and the Netherlands, again implemented lockdowns and several other health measures at the end of 2020, in light of the proliferation of the pandemic. Given the uncertainties inherent in any health crisis, the Group does not expect this situation to stabilize in the short term. In particular, the stabilization in the health situation notably depends on the ability of States e/ffectively and rapidly to implement their vaccine strategies, whose deployment is currently encountering logistical di/fficulties in some countries. The Group's baseline scenario is a return to the pre-crisis level of capacity in 2024.",

        "page_content": "Were this scenario not to materialize or materialize only partially, the recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021 (which will include the future implementation of additional recapitalization measures, as outlined in section 5.4 'Subsequent events') would not provide the Group with the liquidity and equity required beyond twelve months to contend with a further and prolonged deterioration in the situation. These elements could, in the current state of visibility and analysis, and depending on their persistence, have a significant negative impact on the Group's operating results, financial performance and liquidity, despite the measures taken, and on those of some of its partners.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nEach airline is supported by a coordination structure responsible for prevention, crisis management, the circulation of health advice and liaising with the national and international authorities on outbreaks of epidemics or threats of epidemics. Concerning the management of the public health crisis associated with the Covid-19 virus, the Group's airlines are notably being supported by a dedicated coordination structure. The Group has also implemented a Network Contingency Planning process, for capacity and schedule optimization, in coordination with its partner airlines and is continuously monitoring the restrictions in various countries, adapting schedules and route planning accordingly. To this end, the processes for building and adjusting flight schedules had to be reinvented for all the Group's companies. A combined analysis of the latest routing results with the booking trends enables capacity to be adjusted to match demand as closely as possible. As a result, capacity has varied by a factor of four between periods of lockdown and vacation periods.\n\nTo strengthen its cash and liquidity position, the Group has taken various measures including, with regard to Air/uni00A0France, the implementation of a loan guaranteed by the French State (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - PGE) for a total amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, granted by a syndicate of nine banks, and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State; these two loans were drawn down in full respectively at July/uni00A031, 2020 for the PGE and December/uni00A031, 2020 for the shareholder loan, and the amounts borrowed allocated to the general needs of the business. With regard to KLM, the measures taken mainly relate to a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State (of which \u20ac665/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020) and a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion (of which \u20ac277/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020) (for a description of the main characteristics of these financing packages, see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0to the Group's consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020). The amounts borrowed were allocated to the general needs of the business.\n\nFurthermore, on April/uni00A06, 2021, the Group announced a major recapitalization plan to reinforce its financial position and enable it to weather the current crisis (see section 5.4 'Subsequent events').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group has also adopted budgetary measures in order to save cash:\n\n- -  downwards revision in the capex plan;\n- -  cut in operating costs;\n- -  labor cost reductions thanks to the partial activity in France and recourse to the employment support program from the Dutch government in response to Covid-19 (NOW);\n- -  halt of all non-safety and non-operational critical projects; and\n- -  significant reduction in all consultants and external sta/ff.\n\nBeyond that, with the crisis continuing and the conditions for a recovery remaining uncertain, the Group will continue to monitor the unfolding situation on a daily basis, to make adjustments as necessary and define/deploy protection resources like the appropriate health measures.\n\n## 3.1.1.2/emspace Terrorist attacks, threats of attack or geopolitical instability*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nSince 2016, the security situation resulting from terrorist attacks perpetrated in France, elsewhere in Europe and in the Group's operational zones, together with worldwide politico-security events (Middle Eastern and African countries) have all represented a range of security risks negatively impacting the Group. For example, the estimated impact of the Paris terrorist attacks in November/uni00A02015 on the Group's fourth quarter revenues in the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2015 amounted to \u20ac120/uni00A0million.\n\nThe occurrence of geopolitical instability, terrorist attacks or threats of attacks, closure of an airspace or military action could have a negative e/ffect on both the Group's passenger tra/ffic, and thus its revenues, and on the level of operating expenses.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nIn terms of security, the Group's airlines comply with national, European and international regulations and submit regular reports to the competent authorities of the measures and procedures in place.\n\nThe Group has no hedging in place for air transportation operating losses but is insured for the consequences of an attack on one of its aircraft, and has subscribed to war and assimilated risks insurance.\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of safety and security management processes in line with the sector's best practices and fully compliant with the IOSA requirements (IATA).\n\nProtecting individuals and assets from assault, terrorist attacks and threatened attacks, and potential threats to their integrity of any nature, is a major priority for the Group. The Security departments in each Air/uni00A0France and KLM company establish the security policies, analyze the threats and take all the appropriate measures, particularly in relation to the factors involved in geopolitical instability.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, a security adaptation plan to the Covid-19 crisis was implemented and a restart plan was carried out to ensure the operationality of the entire security system.\n\nThe Group has also developed emergency plans and temporary adaptation procedures (e.g. the suspension of flight operations) enabling an e/ffective response to diverse situations should an epidemic, geopolitical or other type of event occur. The aim of these plans is the e/ffective protection of passengers and sta/ff, operational and service continuity, and the preservation of the long-term viability of the Group's businesses. These plans are regularly adjusted to take into account the lessons learnt from events experienced.\n\n## 3.1.1.3/emspace Competition in the short, medium and long-haul air passenger transportation market*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs the leading group in terms of intercontinental tra/ffic on departure from Europe, the Group is a major global air transport player; in 2020, the Group carried 34/uni00A0million (104/uni00A0million in 2019) passengers between Europe and the rest of the world, as well as on intra-European routes on departure from its local markets.\n\nThe air transport industry is extremely competitive. Since the liberalization of the European market and the di/fferent Open Skies agreements signed, increased competition between carriers has led to a reduction in fares. This competitive pressure could be exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis and its long aftermath, impacting the demand for air transport. During the recovery period, a mismatch between airline overcapacity and low customer demand could lead to more aggressive pricing policies being implemented by airlines.\n\nIn short and medium-haul, the Group competes with other airlines and, in particular, the low-cost carriers which have seen very rapid growth over the last fifteen years. It also competes with alternative means of transportation like the high-speed train network. An extension to the high-speed rail networks in Europe is liable to have a negative impact on the air transport industry's activity and financial results.\n\nIn addition, self-connect platforms like Kiwi.com or easyJet Worldwide enable different point-to-point airlines to offer connecting journeys. Should these platforms be significantly expanded and prove successful, the current hub and spoke model of hub carriers like Air/uni00A0France or KLM could be a/ffected.\n\nThe competition is also very intense in long-haul, particularly on the routes between Europe and Asia, due to the development of rapidly-growing players like the Gulf State airlines, or on the transatlantic owing to the growth of low-cost, long-haul carriers. Meanwhile, manufacturers are selling narrowbody aircraft with extended range, which may open the way to competition from low-cost carriers in the medium-haul narrowbody segment.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Group's di/fferent strategic plans seek to respond to these risks, particularly via the restructuring of the point-to-point operations, the accelerated development of Transavia, cost reduction and fleet plan evolution, the product move up-market and the development of partnerships in large high-growth markets. In parallel, the Group is lobbying the authorities for a legal framework ensuring fair competition between carriers (see also sections/uni00A01.2 'Strategic outlook' and 1.3 'Activities in 2020').\n\nFurthermore, within the framework of the Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States, European airlines are authorized to operate flights to the United States from any European airport. While this agreement potentially opens the way to increased competition for Paris-CDG and AmsterdamSchiphol, it has also enabled Air/uni00A0France and KLM to expand their networks and strengthen cooperation within the SkyTeam alliance within the framework, notably, of a transatlantic joint-venture and their transatlantic partners.\n\n## 3.1.1.4/emspace Cyclical nature of the air transportation industry*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nLocal, regional and international economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Group's activities and, hence, on its financial results. Periods of crisis or post-crisis with an unstable economic environment are liable to a/ffect demand for transportation, both for tourism and business travel. Furthermore, during such periods, the Group may have to accept delivery of new aircraft or be unable to sell unused aircraft under acceptable financial conditions. The negative impact on the global economy of the current Covid-19 health crisis, combined with the tra/ffic restrictions imposed by several countries, has led to a significant reduction in business and leisure transport flows, which has also impacted many companies within the supply chain such as travel agents, ground handling companies and other suppliers and subcontractors involved in engineering and maintenance. The di/fficult financial position of suppliers may result in cost increases or worsened contractual conditions for the Group and the bankruptcy of certain suppliers, as the case may be, could lead to cost increases due to the monopolistic position of the remaining suppliers. Finally, airports are also bearing significant additional costs due to the health measures whose implementation is required by governments which may lead to increased airport charges, a/ffecting the profitability of the Group.",

        "page_content": "If the economic crisis were to continue or worsen, this would have a significant impact on air transportation activity and consequently on the Group's performance. The Covid-19 crisis and the associated travel restrictions have strongly impacted Business travel. New remote working habits and environmental expectations might have a lasting e/ffect on Business demand. Weaker Business demand would have an impact on yield and network structure.\n\nAccording to International Monetary Fund projections, world gross domestic product is expected to contract by 4.2% in 2020, a/ffected in particular by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic (source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Update, October/uni00A02020).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a balanced international geographical network and can address all customer segments enabling it to limit its exposure to risk.\n\nRegarding its subcontractors and suppliers which may be a/ffected by the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group closely monitors potential distress at all levels within the supply chain with the support of local teams, centralized teams, IATA and the Procurement department, and seeks to find alternative suppliers in the most distressed cases. Regarding airport charges, the Group is engaged in ongoing discussions with airports on lowering airport charges or improving the value for money and extending incentives.\n\n## 3.1.1.5/emspace Trend in the oil price*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe fuel bill is one of the largest cost items for airlines, making oil price volatility a risk for the air transportation industry. A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies (as an illustration, average annual oil prices increased by more than 40% between 2016 and 2018). Similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is generally favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.\n\nFor the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, the fuel bill amounted to \u20ac2,392/uni00A0million (including the cost of the related hedging but excluding the cost of the over-hedging booked in other financial income and expenses), down by 57% compared to the previous year due, in particular, to the significant drop in activity owing to the impact of the health crisis. This also led to the derivative positions implemented by the Group prior to the crisis exceeding the actual exposure, thus resulting in an over-hedging situation with a non-optimal remaining position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nIn addition to permanent e/fforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk. This strategy is however under review in the light of the Covid-19 public health crisis (see section/uni00A03.1.5.3 'Risks relating to the fuel price').\n\n## 3.1.1.6/emspace Competition and trends in the aeronautics maintenance market\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAirframers, engine manufacturers and aircraft component manufacturers are rapidly expanding their after-sales services to o/ffer customers increasingly-integrated aircraft maintenance solutions. This positioning corresponds to a long-term strategy based on leveraging intellectual property by selling licenses to maintenance providers seeking to exercise their business activity on certain products. This competition is putting pressure on the revenue side of the maintenance business (which represented 11% of the Group's revenues for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020 versus 8% in 2019) due to increased competition in the sale of services and, on the cost side, owing to an aggressive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) escalation policy. Ultimately, if it were to result in reduced competition in the aeronautics maintenance market, this trend could have a material adverse impact on airline maintenance costs.\n\nThis trend is escalating, especially with the arrival of new aircraft (E-jet, A350, Boeing 787,/uni00A0etc.). The ability to maintain balanced competitive conditions is a priority objective, both for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's commercial activity in maintenance and to contain the Group's maintenance costs.\n\nThe Maintenance, Repair, overhaul (MRO) market is showing healthy growth although most of this growth is outside the EU and especially in Asia. To maintain customer proximity and optimize the supply chain, further development of the AFI KLM E&M supply chain is needed via the expansion of local service centers and the regional industrial footprint.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the MRO market may lead to additional competitive pressure and thus a drop in sales prices and production overcapacity, resulting in a loss of profitability. In addition, several airlines which are also customers of the Group for engineering and maintenance services have incurred losses due to the crisis, which exposes the Group to a risk of delayed payment of its receivables or even the bankruptcy of such companies.",

With regards to production overcapacity issues related to the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group has implemented workforce restructuring plans. Regarding the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on its customers for engineering and maintenance services, and the risk of non-payment or bankruptcy of these customers, the Group conducts weekly monitoring of receivables and risks of non-payment, and adapts the services proposed to customers during the period according to their demand and financial capabilities. For airlines under financial administration, the Group continues its services with a commitment to payment by the administrators and the freezing of previous receivables, with for some companies, recourse to COFACE.\n\n## 3.1.2/emspace Risks relating to the air transportation activity\n\n## 3.1.2.1/emspace Risks related to airline safety*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAccident risk is inherent to air transportation which is why airline activities - passenger and cargo transportation, aircraft maintenance - are regulated by a series of European regulatory provisions directly applicable or for some of them transposed into French and Dutch law. Compliance with these regulations governs whether an airline is awarded the AOC (Air Operator Certificate).\n\nThe national Civil Aviation Authority carries out a series of checks on the proper application of these rules covering notably the:\n\n- -  designation of a senior executive and managers responsible for the principal operational functions;\n- -  appropriate organization of the flight, ground, cargo and maintenance operations;\n- -  deployment of a Safety Management System (SMS);\n- -  implementation of a quality assurance system.\n\nThe materialization of this risk could have a significant negative impact on the Group's reputation and legal or financial consequences.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the risks related to airline safety may increase as a result, notably, of reduced employee activity, the integration and respect of health measures, the partial availability of the infrastructures, and the grounding and re-entry into service of some aircraft.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Flight Safety is the absolute priority. Safety is fundamental to maintaining the confidence of customers and sta/ff and is a day-to-day imperative which determines the Group's activity and the long-term future of the air transportation industry.\n\nAll of the Group's businesses are subject to numerous checks and certifications, and meet extremely strict standards and the highest level of regulations in the industry, both at European level with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and globally with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational Safety Audit is a benchmark within the industry and leads to certification which must be renewed every two years.\n\nThe IOSA audits were carried out between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, enabling the certifications.\n\nTo reach the highest possible level of Flight Safety, each airline updates and reinforces its SMS which defines in concrete terms the conditions for the implementation of its risk management system. The SMS, which is an integral part of the organization, procedures and corporate culture, is supported by a commitment made at the highest level of management, and by training and awareness-raising programs for all sta/ff (see section/uni00A04.4.1 'Operational safety for stakeholders').\n\nThis risk is covered by the aviation insurance policy.\n\nAs of March/uni00A02020, the Covid-19 pandemic and the counter-measures implemented by governments and global aviation industry organizations refocused the individual airlines on re-engineering their procedures and working methodologies to ensure the safety and well-being of their customers, employees and the environment worldwide. The airlines played a crucial role in this period by determining the risks of the variability prior to implementation and, above all, indicating what was needed to make it feasible. In addition, the airlines identified, assessed and embedded all the restrictions imposed by local governments and agencies within the operation. To assure the safety of their passengers and sta/ff, the Covid-19 regulations have constantly been adapted and, where necessary, have been improved through the introduction of additional regulations as a result of safety studies and risk analysis.",

Furthermore, the unprecedented crisis triggered by Covid-19 has further questioned our societies' focus on economic growth and globalization at the cost of environmental impacts - with aviation very much remaining in the spotlight on these issues. As a result, the sector now finds itself confronted with a renewed and urgent societal acceptability challenge. This requires aviation to fully embrace sustainability as part of the necessary evolution of its business and economic model in the post-Covid-19 era.\n\nThe airline industry must pursue its e/fforts to reduce its impacts and step up communication on its commitments and the mitigating initiatives that are already in place. Airlines are accommodating their customers' growing need for mobility, while improving their energy e/fficiency and focusing on containing noise hindrance at an acceptable level for those living near airports. Public pressure never ceases to grow, at both local and global level, with regard to the environmental impacts linked to the air transport industry.\n\nIn this respect, the actions implemented by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to limit and reduce its environmental impacts directly influence its ability to manage and develop its activities ('license to grow') in all regions of the world and over the long-term.\n\nThe air transport industry is subject to a significant level of environmental legislation governing areas such as the exposure of people to aircraft noise and local emissions, air quality, the treatment of waste products, and the introduction of taxes on airlines and obligations to ensure the compliance of their operations. For example, from 2020, airline tickets issued by all airlines now attract a tax on all flights departing from France (but not on flights arriving), except connecting flights. This tax will raise funds for investment in greener transportation infrastructure, including rail.\n\nSuch legislation may have a significant negative impact on the Group's operations and growth which could be reflected in more substantial costs, and could lead to competitive distortions between airlines when applied solely to a specific geographical area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, in consideration of the support measures provided by the French State in May/uni00A02020, with the granting by the French State of a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan, Air/uni00A0France has notably undertaken to review the scope of its domestic routes to reduce the environmental footprint of its activities, taking into account in particular the existence of rail alternatives when they are shorter than two and a half hours (Article 36/uni00A0of the draft Climate Bill, currently in its first reading in the French Parliament, would also introduce a ban on operating airline services on domestic routes in the French territory whenever an alternative form of public transportation exists in under 2h30 and generating a lower level of/uni00A0 CO2 emissions). In consideration for the support measures provided by the Dutch State, KLM has set several targets on sustainability, among others the utilization of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe airline industry is amongst the sectors that are mobilizing the most to reduce their carbon footprints and was the first sector to commit to collectively reducing its/uni00A0CO2 emissions. As early as 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set an ambitious global commitment to stabilizing the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation at the 2020 level (Carbon Neutral Growth as of 2020), and to reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 50% in 2050 relative to their 2005 level.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a member of the representative associations for the airline industry (IATA, ATAG, A4E, FNAM) which engage in lobbying activities directed at the relevant national, European and international authorities and bodies (ICAO, European Union, supervisory Ministries in France and the Netherlands) to promote e/ffective solutions for the environment, but also to ensure that the measures which are put in place do not lead to any distortion in competition between the air transportation players. For example, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has always supported the implementation of a market-based mechanism for carbon emissions considering that, provided it is equitable, such a system is more e/ffective from an environmental standpoint than a simple tax.\n\nThe imposition of an 'eco-contribution' tax on the air transportation industry in France and the possible imposition of an environmental tax on airline passengers in the Netherlands as of 2021 are leading to additional costs for the Group and reduce its ability to invest in energy-e/fficient aircraft. Furthermore, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group considers it regrettable that none of the proceeds of the Eco Tax applicable in France have been allocated to the airline industry's energy transition, and notably to research into sustainable solutions like cleaner aircraft or the development of biofuels.",

During the public health crisis and within the framework of the Group's environmental strategy, a number of initiatives were announced to customers and the public at large (introduction of a high-energy-performance fleet, and accelerated phase-out of the most-polluting aircraft which are the least adapted to our environmental route map, launch of the Cargo Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program, enabling customers to invest in the development and use of SAF, thereby contributing to a cleaner future for air transportation, development of inter-modality by extending the Train + Air product with the SNCF business partner/uni00A0etc.).\n\nIn addition, to addressing all the matters relating to the e/ffects of air transportation activity around airports, regular discussion meetings take place with residents' associations, local elected representatives and the public authorities.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nTo meet the requirements relating to the carbon budget and low-carbon strategy stipulated in Article 173/uni00A0III of Act No. 2015-992/uni00A0of August/uni00A017, 2015 relating to the Energy Transition for Green Growth, the Group takes into account the financial risks related to the e/ffects of climate change and implements measures to reduce them through a low-carbon strategy in all the components of its activity. These risks are both operational (linked to the physical impacts of climate change) and financial in nature, the latter being linked to the political and regulatory impacts of the energy transition (e.g. environmental tax).\n\nClimate change will lead to more frequent extreme weather events that will have a greater or lesser impact on all world regions. Air operations depend on meteorological conditions and may be impacted by other natural phenomena (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods,/uni00A0etc.) which may lead to operational disruption such as flight cancellations or delays and diversions. As a general rule, the duration of such adverse natural events tends to be short and their geographical range limited but they may require the temporary closure of an airport or airspace, like in September/uni00A02017 when Hurricane Irma caused considerable damage in the Caribbean, mainly on St. Martin. Another emblematic illustration is the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland in 2010, during which nearly 100,000/uni00A0flights were cancelled in eleven European countries, leaving ten million passengers stranded. Such events may have significant operational and financial repercussions for the Group's activity given the regulations requiring the Company to assist passengers in the European Union territory (e.g. passenger repatriation and accommodation).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo adapt to the already-visible consequences of climate change such as more frequent extreme weather events, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a policy in place to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions, and regularly conducts comprehensive risk analyses to optimize these arrangements.\n\nThrough its international operations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is present in all continents and operates in di/fferent weather conditions, including the most extreme. It regularly reviews the operational risks to improve the existing procedures. The operation of a network balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility related to the composition of the fleet enable the financial consequences of these impacts to be minimized.\n\nWith its partners, the Group has deployed procedures aimed at guaranteeing its services as far as possible and also minimizing the consequences of these situations for its customers. In such circumstances, the Group deploys commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel if they so wish, or change their destination. The Group has no hedging in place for operating losses incurred due to such events.\n\nIn addition, during a major climate event, its aim is to reestablish flight operations as soon as possible to fulfil its mission of service continuity and ensure operations and the transportation of humanitarian assistance to the a/ffected regions.\n\nThe Group deploys measures to limit the impact on climate change via a low-carbon strategy. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Climate Action Plan stipulates the Group's priorities in terms of reducing its environmental impacts, like fleet modernization, improved fuel management, reducing the mass embarked on board aircraft and optimizing operational procedures.\n\nThe use of sustainable aviation fuel is a promising avenue towards reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions from aviation and a key element in achieving Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets, as well as those of the aviation industry as a whole. On the ground, the Group is investing in a fleet of electric ground support equipment and in sources of renewable energy to supply power to its buildings. The Group has set a carbon neutrality target for the Ground Operations activities in 2030.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM engages in lobbying directed at the French, Dutch and international authorities - both directly and through representative bodies - to ensure that they take into account the e/fforts already made by the industry to reduce its emissions and to deliver on its commitments for 2050.\n\nThe Group follows the format recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the management of the financial risks linked to climate change (see table in section/uni00A04.6.3 'Monitoring of Act No. 2017-399 known as the Duty of Vigilance Law\").\n\n## Carbon credit risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs an air operator, the Group is an emitter of carbon dioxide meaning that it has, since 2012, been subject to the European Union emission quota system (EU-ETS or European Union Emission Trading Scheme). It is thus required to o/ffset its emissions by purchasing carbon quotas in the financial markets.\n\nFor the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, the Group's/uni00A0CO2 emissions were significantly reduced to 14/uni00A0million tons, of which 2.8/uni00A0million tons fell under the EU-ETS requirement. Taking into account free allowances received, the Group purchased emission allowances in the",

In this context, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considers that its/uni00A0CO2 emissions are not simultaneously subject to both the European ETS and CORSIA. Furthermore - assuming a change to the provisions of the European ETS - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is calling for a detailed impact study to be conducted on the envisaged amendments. In addition, the Group is drawing attention to the need for the prior design of a carbon adjustment mechanism at the frontiers of the European Union, to protect the European airlines from 'carbon leakage' which neutralizes or even aggravates the environmental impacts and benefits their international competitors.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAt financial level, the Group has implemented a carbon credit risk hedging strategy in the form of forward purchases, a strategy whose components are approved by the Risk Management Committee.\n\nAt operational level, the Group is also committed to exploring all avenues potentially reducing its fuel consumption and carbon emissions:\n\n- -  at its own initiative within the framework of its Climate Action Plan, and\n- -  in cooperation with the authorities (SESAR project for the Single European Sky and optimization of air tra/ffic control).\n\nThe Group also uses an internal carbon price (price range) when taking a decision on whether to proceed with investments and projects, to factor the carbon risk into its decision-making scenarios (see section/uni00A04.3 'Environmental impact').\n\n## 3.1.2.3/emspace Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nDue to the saturation of major European airports, air carriers must obtain flight slots which are allocated in accordance with the terms and conditions defined in Regulation 95/93/uni00A0issued by the EC Council of Ministers. Pursuant to this Regulation, at least 80% of the flight slots held by air carriers must be used during the period for which they have been allocated. Unused slots will be lost by this carrier and transferred into a pool. The Regulation does not provide for any exemptions to this rule for situations in which, due to a dramatic drop in tra/ffic caused by exceptional events, air transport companies are required to reduce activity levels substantially and no longer use their flight slots at the required 80% level during the period in question.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe European Commission can, however, decide to temporarily suspend Regulation 95/93/uni00A0governing the loss of unused flight slots, as it has done on several occasions.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis, Regulation No. 95/93/uni00A0was thus amended to enable slots allocated for the period from March/uni00A01, 2020 to October/uni00A024, 2020 to be considered as having been operated by the air carrier to which they were initially granted. In view of the continuing health crisis and the low demand for air transportation in the coming months, on October/uni00A014, 2020 the European Commission decided to extend this exception to cover the entire winter season, until March/uni00A027, 2021. On February/uni00A016, 2021, the European Commission adopted a new amendment to the slot Regulation, potentially enabling maintained temporary relief from the usual slot utilization rules in view of the crisis. These provisions are applicable until the end of the Summer 2022 season. The precise parameters are defined for each IATA season depending on the health situation and specific provisions on slot relief have been implemented for the Summer 2021 season.\n\nAny loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots due to airport saturation could have an impact in terms of market share, results and even growth.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM applies the provisions of the European Regulation on the allocation of flight slots, guaranteeing an air carrier the ongoing use of these slots from one season to another provided they have been used for 80% of the time excluding exceptional circumstances. Air/uni00A0France and KLM also liaise with their national authorities to ensure the regular availability at their principal hubs of the capacity necessary to the Group's growth. They also liaise with the national and European Authorities to try to ensure that no revision of the current European Regulation takes place that would limit their accessibility to slots. Lastly, they ensure that specific provision is being made within the framework of the Covid-19 crisis to ensure that they can preserve their slot portfolio worldwide despite not being in a position to operate numerous flights given the health measures introduced by the public authorities.\n\n## 3.1.2.4/emspace Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\n## Description of the risk\n\n## a) European  regulations\n\nWithin the European Union, the rights of passengers in the event of flight delays, cancellation or denied boarding are defined by Regulation (EC) No.261/2004 of February/uni00A011, 2004 which came into force in 2005. It applies to all flights, whether scheduled or unscheduled, departing from an airport located in a European Union Member State (including Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol, the Group's two hubs) and establishes the European rules for compensation and assistance on denied boarding, substantial delay, flight cancellation and class downgrading.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nNumerous rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) have contributed to reinforcing passenger rights by reducing the possibilities for airlines to invoke 'extraordinary circumstances' to exempt them from the compensation foreseen in Regulation No.261/2004.\n\nThe ever-stricter regulations applying to the European airlines, but only partially applicable to airlines of third-party countries, only increase the existing distortions to competition. The emergence of companies specialized in passenger compensation is increasing the financial cost resulting from this risk. The amount of compensation is, however, the same for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, whether the customer contacts the company directly or via an intermediary.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has also highlighted the fact that the Regulation may not be appropriate to a situation of massive cancellations and needs to be revised to achieve a better balance between the rights of passengers and airlines in such circumstances.\n\n## b) US  regulations\n\nIn the United States, the regulation increasing US airline passenger protections came into e/ffect on August/uni00A023, 2011, and its provisions are now in force.\n\nThe US regulations in terms of passenger rights apply to all airlines operating in the US territory and/or marketing flights to/from the United States which means that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is concerned by these US protections.\n\n## c) National  regulations\n\nIATA has collated some fifty national regulations in a database to be able to monitor changes more e/ffectively.\n\nOver the course of 2020, owing to the Covid-19 health crisis and the resulting border closures, the Group was forced to reduce its capacity and cancel a large number of flights, customers then being able to request the refunding of their tickets or the issue of a voucher. At December/uni00A031, 2020, this line included \u20ac699/uni00A0million of tickets (fare and additional fee) whose date of transportation has passed and potentially giving rise to refunding, and \u20ac739/uni00A0million of vouchers to be used on future flights (or giving rise to a possible refund). The Group has also implemented a revised refund and voucher policy, which has led to a complex business process redesign.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo keep the e/ffects of these regulations as much as possible within financially-acceptable limits, the Group lobbies the national and European institutions, both directly and indirectly through the air transportation industry's professional associations (IATA, A4E), to obtain reasonable obligations which create no competitive distortions or major additional costs which could lead it either to increase its fares or decrease its margins. In this respect, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM continues to lobby for the revision of Regulation (EC) No.261/2004 of February/uni00A011, 2004.\n\nIn relation to the changes made to its refund and voucher policy in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group has implemented several actions including an intense cooperation with all the relevant Group departments to secure swift decision-taking so as adapt to changes in legislation worldwide, an extensive communication campaign for customers and trade partners via various platforms and the priority handling of cash refund requests to prevent litigation.\n\n## 3.1.2.5/emspace Changes in international, national or regional regulations and legislation\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAir transportation activities remain highly regulated particularly with regard to the allocation of tra/ffic rights for extra-community services and the conditions relating to operations (standards on safety, aircraft noise,/uni00A0CO2 emissions, airport access and the allocation of slots). Within this context, the EU institutions may adopt regulations which could prove restrictive for airlines and are liable to have significant organizational and/or financial impacts. Any changes to regulations and legislation may increase the Group's operating expenses or reduce its revenues.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group actively defends its positions with the French and Dutch governments, and the European institutions, both directly and through industry bodies such as the Airlines for Europe association (A4E) regarding changes to European and national regulations. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is engaged in direct lobbying of the European Commission and the national authorities to ensure a reasonable and balanced allocation of tra/ffic rights to non-European airlines. Coordination with like-minded carriers on this topic takes place within the framework of the Airline Coordination Platform (ACP).\n\n## 3.1.2.6/emspace Regulatory authorities' inquiry into the commercial cooperation agreements between carriers\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAlliance operations and commercial cooperation are required to comply with the competition law in force. In certain jurisdictions, these agreements are liable to be subject to prior investigation by the competition authorities prior to any implementation. In other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, airlines are required to ensure that their operations are compliant with the applicable competition rules. At any time, the European Commission also has the right to open inquiries into any cases of cooperation it considers of interest to the European Community. For example, the joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta and Alitalia was the subject of such an inquiry (resulting in a positive decision in 2015). Such inquiries could have a negative e/ffect on the Group's results, business, reputation, financial position and outlook.",

Two of the measures in this plan contain State Aid. The French authorities thus notified the European Commission of these two measures, the latter subsequently approving them in its decision of April/uni00A06, 2021 pursuant to the rules pertaining to State Aid. This decision foresees a number of commitments made by the French State with regard to the companies Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Air/uni00A0France, notably requiring Air/uni00A0France to make landing and take-o/ff slots available to its competitors at Orly airport but also other more general undertakings within the framework of the European Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (in particular, a limitation on acquisitions, share buybacks and dividend payments) ensuring respect of the competition rules (see also section 5.4 'Subsequent events') which could have an impact on the Group's activities.\n\nIn addition , the aforementioned decision of July/uni00A013, 2020 relating to KLM is being contested before the European Court of Justice which has yet to issue a ruling.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has ascertained that the eventual consequences of slot availability under the 2004 and 2015 remedies remain admissible and do not a/ffect the economics of the lines in question. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also regularly approaches the Commission to discuss the need to maintain these commitments adopted more than sixteen years ago.\n\n## b) State  Aid\n\nThe Group has ensured that the commitments made within the framework of the State Aid packages do not call into question its growth plan.

Their heavy dependence on IT and communication technologies makes airlines vulnerable to cyber-criminality. Should Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM fail to counter such incidents of cyber-criminality, this could have a negative impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo protect itself against this risk, the Group deploys substantial resources aimed at ensuring business continuity, data protection, the security of personal information pursuant to law and the safeguarding of at-risk tangible and intangible assets.\n\nThe Cybercrime program, approved by the Group's Audit Committee, covers the prevention and detection procedures such as Cyber-threat surveillance, evaluations of Information System security and tests to pinpoint any Information System incursions via the internet. There are regular awareness-raising campaigns on IT security for sta/ff across the Company. An audit of this program was realized in 2017 which confirmed the best practices in place and the orientations adopted. The recommended improvements have been added to the program. The Group complies with the Cyber standards of the Original Aircraft Manufacturers (OAM). Since 2020, the Group has subscribed to a permanent 24/7/uni00A0independent cybersecurity assessment by the world leading company BitSight to monitor in real time its cybersecurity posture and performance to stay ahead of the emerging cyber threats.\n\nIn 2018, the Group subscribed to a cyber insurance policy to transfer a part of this risk.\n\nAs an illustration of the e/ffectiveness of the security measures in place, a sophisticated cyber incident took place on December/uni00A02, 2020 which was swiftly detected and blocked before any negative e/ffect could impact the business. No partner interfaces were impacted. Immediate mitigation measures were taken to suspend the assets used by the cybercriminals to connect to the network. All the connexions in the Microsoft O365 cloud, and all user passwords and system passwords were reset as a mitigation measure. A special notification on how to protect and safeguard passwords was sent to all the employees in both airlines as a precautionary measure. External parties specialized in cyber investigation in the Netherlands and in France were involved in analyzing and cleaning all the assets. In addition, this incident was reported to the relevant parties such as Risk Management, the DPO (Data Protection O/fficer) and to the authorities.\n\n## Data security\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs airline companies, Air/uni00A0France and KLM collect personal data from their customers and employees. Management of the Group's assets is supported by rigorous management of the required data, whose consistency and integrity presents a permanent challenge for IT projects, and in the operation of digital services. Frequent changes to both applications and processes call for the ongoing adaptation of IT management tools and methods, in coordination with the businesses and their regulatory and operational requirements. If the Group fails to implement such frequent changes or to protect data of a personal nature pursuant to the relevant laws and regulation, this could have a negative impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Group's IT division implements security rules aimed at reducing the risks related to new technologies, particularly mobile data terminals. The access controls to IT applications and to the computer files at each work station together with control over the data exchanged outside the Company all comply with rules pursuant to national, European and international standards. Campaigns to raise the awareness of all sta/ff on the potential threats and encourage best practices are regularly carried out. Specialized companies, external auditors and Internal Audit all regularly evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\nData security is a priority for the Group, and specifically the protection of data of a personal nature pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is being applied via the GDPR and NIS compliance programs. Within each company, specialist teams ensure that the processing of personal information by the company complies with the relevant legislation.\n\nIn each Air/uni00A0France and KLM company, the Data Privacy O/fficers define the applicable policies, promote the data protection culture and ensure the e/ffective fulfilment of the regulatory standards.\n\n## Business continuity and regulatory compliance\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe IT systems, including revenue management systems and booking systems (including Altea) used by the Group, and the information they contain may be exposed to risks concerning continuity of functioning, data security and regulatory compliance.

The preventive measures include, for example, guidelines in the form of manuals, policies and instructions to clarify expected and acceptable behavior, training in the form of e-learning as well as personal training, and the ability to report any compliance concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to competition law, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has developed its policy to prevent anti-competitive practices by circulating a Competition Law Compliance Manual which is available in three languages.\n\nOther prevention-based tools include dedicated training modules. Having completed this training and taken an evaluation test, employees sign an individual declaration promising to respect the competition rules applying to their functions.\n\nRegarding corruption, further to the anti-bribery campaign at the end of 2017, ongoing e/fforts have been deployed to further strengthen the awareness and knowledge of employees regarding the prevention of bribery like, for example, presentations and discussions, improved access to compliance documents and communication by the Group's management.\n\nFor more detail see section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics'.\n\n## 3.1.3.3/emspace Operational performance and customer risks\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nFor customers, operational performance is a cornerstone of the product. In the day-to-day operations, where there is pressure on airlines and growing congestion in airports and airlines, and where regulations are increasingly complex (e.g. security and health measures), within a context of social unrest within the airline industry but also externally (air tra/ffic control and ground handler strikes), increased tra/ffic volume brings with it a risk of sub-optimal operational performance or a lower standard of customer service, leading to an increase in the costs of operational performance and a reduction in levels of customer satisfaction, which can result in a negative impact on the Group's reputation.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a result of needing to comply with governmental health and social distancing requirements, airports are open for limited hours and are experiencing runway closures leading to long turnaround times. The additional requirements in the departure and/or arrival processes are also causing delays and resulting in long passenger boarding and turnaround times. This can also a/ffect the restart of re-dimensioned operations and generate the associated costs.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nFor both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the Operations Control Center is at the heart of operations and any disruption is managed in an integrated manner. Numerous action plans are deployed on operational excellence, service disruption management and recovery, security, network agility, the compensation procedure (EU 261), and crew and other critical resources. The goal is to reduce the number of distortions, reduce the impact on customers, improve customer satisfaction and reduce the costs of sub-optimal performance. In 2019, there was a significant fall in the number of service disruptions while customer satisfaction saw a considerable increase (regularity, punctuality, baggage handling,/uni00A0etc.).",

Strategic changes and changes impacting the working conditions of sta/ff are applied pursuant to the legislation and protocols as defined for each of the entities comprising the Group.\n\nIn the past and potentially in future, the Group's operations may be disrupted by labor disputes such as strikes, walkouts, industrial action or other forms of social unrest, which could also have a negative impact on the Group's operations, profitability and image.\n\nIn particular, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis and its impact on the Group's activities, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and their subsidiaries have been forced to implement measures to reduce labor costs for the various categories of sta/ff and major sta/ff reduction plans, and may be forced to do so again in the future.\n\nThe measures taken by the Group in this context may result in a decline in employee engagement, motivation and commitment at work owing to, inter alia: uncertainty about the future of the Group and their own employment or worries about the economic situation; remote working and 'activit\u00e9 partielle' resulting in less contact with colleagues and management; Voluntary Departure Plans, salary reductions, an increasing workload and loss of expertise. Absenteeism may also rise due to employees being infected with Covid-19 at work or outside the professional environment, also leading to fear of infection (e.g. at work or in public transport). There is also a risk of the closure of crucial departments due to an internal Covid-19 outbreak, meaning that specialized functions cannot be performed, leading to serious operational problems for the Group.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Group recognizes the constraints and risks to which it is exposed and the need to adapt to a more rapid pace of change. At the same time, the Group seeks to preserve cohesion by fostering a constructive and transparent workplace dialogue and by pursuing a policy based on respect and responsibility. Internal communication was swiftly adapted to the new situation with sta/ff connecting remotely in terms of both frequency and resources, and with new interactive ways to share questions and concerns.\n\nTo ensure the e/ffective coordination of the workplace dialogue, responsibilities and accountabilities are defined for each entity and category of sta/ff. At Group level, coordination takes place between the di/fferent entities, specifically for transverse topics concerning categories of sta/ff across several entities. Significant changes to the HR policies and collective labor agreements are approved at the highest level of management within the airlines and the Group.\n\nVarious initiatives aimed at improving the workplace dialogue are planned and implemented in the di/fferent Group entities.\n\nIn Air/uni00A0France and KLM, an Employee Promotor Score indicator has been implemented to measure the engagement of employees. The results feed into local action plans aimed at improving employee engagement and opening up the dialogue between managers and their teams. Decreasing the distance between management and sta/ff is key to understanding the needs and concerns of sta/ff, tackling any issues in a proactive manner and avoiding any escalation.\n\nThe level of employee engagement is included in the targets for the highest level of management within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. Continuous monitoring takes place and the methodology will be subject to ongoing improvement (see section/uni00A04.2 'Human Resources').\n\nRegarding the consequences of the measures implemented by the Group within the context of the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group has maintained its openness and transparency with unions, with negotiations based on relationships of trust. The Group is also paying a great deal of attention to the design of departure plans, communication and workloads, and is seeking to minimize the impact on employees physically present at the Group's premises. The Group has also implemented a specific and detailed health protocol to ensure the mitigation of contamination risk, in close cooperation with the health and safety committees.\n\n## 3.1.3.5/emspace Pension  plans\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's main commitment in terms of defined benefit schemes was the pension plan for Ground Sta/ff based in the Netherlands.\n\nUnder IAS/uni00A019, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is exposed to changes in external financial parameters (e.g. discount rates, future inflation rate) which could lead to annual fluctuations in its income statement and equity with no impact on cash. The changes in the pension obligations together with the level of plan assets related to changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in equity and are not taken against profit and loss. The potential volatility is explained in Note/uni00A03 'Accounting policies - Employee benefits' and in Note/uni00A03 'Other provisions' in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.",

The regular premium level is fixed.\n\n## 3.1.4/emspace Legal  risks\n\nDuring their ordinary course of business, the Group's companies may be involved in legal, administrative, criminal, or arbitration proceedings, especially concerning civil liability, competition, industrial, fiscal, or intellectual property claims, or claims relating to the environment and discrimination. In some of these proceedings, significant monetary claims have been made or may be made against one or more Group companies. The relevant provisions, if any, that the Group may have to record in its financial statements may not be su/fficient, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on its business, financial position, results and outlook.

With regard to KLM,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe current calculations led to the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension plan figuring as an asset in the balance sheet at December/uni00A031, 2020, the assets in the funds being higher than the value of the defined benefit obligations.\n\nNext to the cash risk, there is a balance sheet volatility risk.\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks KLM reached agreement with the Ground Sta/ff unions on a change the defined benefit scheme to a (collective) defined contribution scheme in 2021. After a new funding agreement between the pension fund for Ground Sta/ff and KLM has been formalized and implemented, the pension plan risk for Ground Sta/ff based in the Netherlands will disappear.\n\narbitration proceedings (including, to the Group's knowledge, any proceedings under way or threats of proceedings) that could have or have recently had a material e/ffect on the Group's financial position or profitability in the past twelve months.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nOngoing procedures are regularly monitored and analyzed by the legal department, with the support of external legal counsel where necessary.\n\nIf necessary, provisions may be recorded in the Group's financial statements in respect of these disputes. The Group's estimate of its financial exposure to pending proceedings is regularly reassessed in light of changes in such proceedings, and the amount of the corresponding provisions is adjusted accordingly to the best of the Group's knowledge. These amounts are also reviewed and validated by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nCertain risks relating to these procedures are also covered, under certain conditions, by the insurance policies taken out by the Group, as described in paragraph 3.1.1/uni00A0of this 2020 Universal Registration Document.\n\nthe measures mainly involve a revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State (of which \u20ac665/uni00A0million was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020) and a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion (of which \u20ac277/uni00A0million was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020. As a result, the Group's net debt stood at \u20ac11/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020. The significant level of the Group's debt could notably require it to devote a substantial proportion of its cash flows from its operational activities to interest and repayments on its debt, thereby reducing the Group's ability to use its free cash flows to finance its organic growth and investment, and for the other general business needs.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn return for the support measures from the French State, the Group made a number of commitments including the implementation of a transformation plan (outlined in chapter /uni00A01 'Strategic outlook and Activities') aimed at increasing its long-term competitiveness and achieving its sustainability targets. As a condition of the loan package, the French government notably required Air/uni00A0France to achieve cost reductions on a par with its European peers and to commit to ambitious environmental objectives, like discontinuing the sale of routes where there is a rail alternative in under two and a half hours, a 50% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 consumption per ASK in 2030 relative to the 2005 baseline and increasing the share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel used to power its flights. In the Netherlands, KLM's restructuring plan submitted to the Dutch Ministry of Finance on October/uni00A01, 2020 contains a significant reduction in FTEs relative to the pre-Covid-19 situation and restrictions on remuneration. These measures should enable an improvement in the Group's long-term competitiveness. In the short term, they may however require significant adaptations to the organization of the Group's activities or cause social conflict, with a negative impact on the Group's activity. These loans also include various banking covenants. A significant reduction in EBITDA could lead to a breach of the banking covenants. In this case, KLM will need to negotiate a waiver with a majority of the revolving credit facility banks and with the Dutch State (see also Notes/uni00A02.1 and 30.3/uni00A0in section 5.6). Furthermore, the stipulations of the loan guaranteed by the French State and the loan granted by the French State notably prohibit the Company from distributing dividends and the mandatory partial early repayment of 75% of any net new money raised by any member of the Group from financial institutions or through debt capital markets, subject to some exceptions (and notably the refinancing of the Group's bond series maturing between 2020 and 2023), which may significantly constrain the Group's financing strategy.\n\nAs the public health crisis continues, particularly within the framework of the 'third wave', the conditions for a recovery remain very uncertain, both for the Group's air operations and more generally on the timeline for the recovery in the economy and demand. Furthermore, within a context of significant market volatility and in view of the situation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the external financing conditions for the Group could be significantly more di/fficult than those it has experienced in the past. Within this context, on April/uni00A06, 2021, the Group announced a recapitalization plan (see section 5.4 'Subsequent events'). The realization of these operations (including the future recapitalization measures, as outlined in the aforementioned section) is vital to the Group's continuing activities: were they not to be realized, this could have a material negative impact on the Group's financial position and its ability to pursue its\n\nactivities beyond twelve months. Furthermore, in the event of a deterioration in the health situation and/or the economic environment, the capital increase and the bond issues foreseen by the recapitalization plan may not prove su/fficient, and the Group could thus be obliged to proceed with new issues of securities/debt to further reinforce its financial structure.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are engaged in in-depth discussions with their respective governments and financial institutions to dispose of the resources that will enable them to secure and sustain adequate levels of liquidity by all means, notably within the framework of the European Commission's Temporary Framework on State Aid published on March/uni00A019, 2020, as amended. The banking covenants on KLM's revolving credit facility are the subject of permanent tracking, in cooperation with the banks responsible for the revolving credit facility and/or the Dutch State.\n\nThat being said, given the various options currently envisaged and the quality of the discussions with the two States and the financial partners, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is confident that it will be able to obtain the financing required to meet all its future financial obligations beyond twelve months, and enable it to ensure the recovery of its activity beyond the current crisis.\n\n## 3.1.5.2/emspace Financing  risks*\n\n## Financing strategy\n\n## Air/uni00A0France\n\nTo finance its investments, Air/uni00A0France prioritizes long-term resources by raising conventional bank debt secured by its assets (in the form of mortgage debt or finance leases) and, when available, by using export credit.\n\n## KLM\n\nTo finance its aircraft, KLM uses a number of di/fferent structures including traditional bank debt, finance leases and export credit.\n\nIn view of the application of prudential standards, the banks could reduce their balance sheets in future years and consequently make a more limited volume of lending available to businesses. Furthermore, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased pressure on fleet financing, with lenders requiring additional guarantees and charging higher interest rates, within a context where the renewal of the Group's fleet is important for the years to come, particularly owing to its/uni00A0CO2 reduction commitments.",

This also led to the derivative product positions contracted by the Group prior to the crisis exceeding its actual exposure, thereby leading to a situation of over-hedging. As soon as the Group considered that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe success of this plan (including the future recapitalization measures, as outlined in the aforementioned section) is vital to reinforcing the Group's financial position and to the pursuit of its activities, In addition, in the event of a further deterioration in the health situation and/or the economic environment, this plan could prove insu/fficient, potentially requiring the Group to again reinforce its financial structure with, as the case may be, the risk of not being able to raise funds in the capital markets under favorable conditions, in view of the economic context.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe financing strategy is decided by the Group in coordination with the Air/uni00A0France Group and the KLM Group. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's financing is mainly composed of unsecured bond debt and/or the issuance of equity or quasi-equity capital, and debt collateralized by assets at the level of the Companies. For the bonds, the issuer is mainly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0SA.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the Group's investment program, particularly in the fleet, Air/uni00A0France and KLM plan to be active in the financing market. In the current market conditions, the Group and its Companies thus intend to finance forthcoming aircraft deliveries using, notably, collateralized debt. These financing or refinancing operations will, as usual, be the subject of requests for proposals.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Group and the Companies plan to adapt their financing strategy:\n\n- -  priority recourse to capital market financing via Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM;\n- -  diversification of the asset-financing structures by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM subsidiaries;\n- -  diversification of the banking and/or financial counterparties.",

On their classification as over-hedging, the fair value of the derivatives booked in Other financial income and expenses was recycled in the income statement, under the financial result. The impact on cash takes place on the unwinding date of the hedge with the counterparty. At December/uni00A031, 2020, the impact of the over-hedging stood at \u20ac595/uni00A0million, of which \u20ac589/uni00A0million has already been paid and \u20ac6/uni00A0million relates to the January/uni00A02021-March/uni00A02021 period.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nRisks related to the jet fuel price are hedged within the framework of a hedging strategy defined by the Risk Management Committee (the 'RMC') and presented to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe hedging strategy sets the time span of the hedges and the target hedging ratios to be reached for the coming quarters. The hedging uses simple futures or option-based instruments, eligible for hedging pursuant to the accounting standards in force.\n\nIn respect of the application of IFRS/uni00A09, hedging by component has applied since January/uni00A01, 2018. Since the Group's fuel procurement is strongly correlated to the Jet Kerosene Cargoes CIF NWE Index, components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF NWE) to align the fuel hedging accounting and the Group's risk management policy more e/ffectively.\n\nWithin the framework of a dynamic risk monitoring approach, the Group tracks indicators capping the potential maximum loss and the potential maximum gain (value of the portfolio prompting its restructuring).\n\nAn indicator enabling the measurement of the extreme risk of the portfolio has been deployed. The level of this Value at Risk indicator is calculated and regularly analyzed and may also trigger a restructuring of the portfolio.\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 public health crisis and the unforeseeable reduction in the volume of fuel used during 2020, like most European airlines, the Group found itself in a situation of overhedging which led to a financial loss being recognized in the financial result. Faced with this situation, and the uncertainty which continues to weigh on capacity growth in 2021 and 2022, together with the tightening of the credit facilties granted by the financial partners, the Risk Management Committee (RMC) recently presented a new hedging policy to the Board which subsequently approved it. Compared with the previous policy, the latter is characterized by a reduction in the timespan of the hedges, from a rolling 24/uni00A0months to a rolling 12/uni00A0months, and a reduction in the hedge amounts, from an equivalent of 80% to 50% of the annual volume consumed. This new policy, approved by the Board of Directors on February/uni00A017, 2021, is now implemented by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM fuel departments.\n\n## 3.1.5.4/emspace Currency  risks\n\nMost of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's revenues are generated in euros. However, because of its international activities, the Group incurs currency exchange risks.\n\nThe Group's main exposure relates to the US dollar. Since expenditures on items such as fuel and maintenance exceed the amount of overall revenues in US dollars, the Group is a net buyer of US dollars, representing a residual structural risk. As a result, any significant appreciation in the US dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\nOn the contrary, the Group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of its revenues in currencies other than the US dollar exceeding its expenditures in the same currencies. This exposure is, however, much lower than with the US dollar. A significant decline in these currencies against the euro could nevertheless have a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results.\n\n## Operational exposure ('Transaction risk')\n\n| (in millions of currencies at December/uni00A031, 2020)   | US Dollar   | Sterling   | Yen      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n| Net position before hedging                               | (3,057)     | 283        | 39,242   |\n| Currency hedge                                            | 1,028       | (156)      | (11,650) |\n| Net position after hedging                                | (2,029)     | 127        | 27,592   |",

For airlines generating US dollar revenues, the revaluation of this debt in US dollars is neutralized at the accounting level through the recognition of this debt as a natural hedge against a fraction of the Group's US dollar revenues. With the Covid-19 public health crisis, as soon as the revenues in US dollars became too low relative to the lease payments, the hedge accounting was temporarily suspended for the coming periods. For airlines not generating US dollar revenues, US dollar-denominated assets and currency hedges are in place to mitigate the exchange rate risk.\n\nAs December/uni00A031, 2020, the exchange rate risk on debt, other than coming from operating leases, denominated in currencies other than the euro mostly concerns the yen (5%), the US dollar (3.3%) and the Swiss franc (2.2%).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe exchange rate risk on non-operating lease debt (non-IFRS/uni00A016) is limited. At December/uni00A031, 2020, 89.5% of the Group's gross debt, after taking into account derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt.\n\n## 3.1.5.7/emspace Counterparty risk exposure\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nExcept in the event of express dispensation from the RMC, counterparties must benefit from a minimum rating of BBB+ (S&P) with the exception of mutual funds where the risk is considered negligible. The maximum commitments by counterparty are determined based on the quality and ranking of their ratings. The RMC also monitors the trend in the respective proportion each counterparty represents in the overall hedging portfolio (fuel, currency and interest rate) and investments. The positions of both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, together with those of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company, are taken into account in the assessment of the overall exposure.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe rules concerning counterparty risk management are established by the RMC and applied within each company.\n\nA monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management of the two airline companies. It is supplemented by real time information in the event of any real risk of a rating downgrading for counterparties.\n\n## 3.1.5.8/emspace Interest rate risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nA portion of the overall debt is linked to floating rates and is thus exposed to volatility risk.\n\nAfter swaps, the exposure to floating rates of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's consolidated debt exposure represents 56% of the total debt. The interest rate on the Group's gross debt after swaps stood at 2.55% at December/uni00A031, 2020 (versus 2.54% at December/uni00A031, 2019).",

It thus aims to create and preserve value, and to safeguard the Group's assets and reputation.\n\nEach Group entity is responsible for managing its risks and for producing regular reports.\n\nThe overall risk management process also serves as a basis for the Universal Registration Document and makes a major contribution to establishing the annual audit program.\n\nAs a facilitator of risk management, Group Internal Audit regularly evaluates the risk management process. Its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, and for extra-financial risks to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee are taken into account by Group Internal Audit in the risk presentations made to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee also monitors the management of financial market risks that could have an impact on the financial statements (fuel price, currency exposure, etc.) on a quarterly basis.

The Audit Committee may decide to bring specific points to the attention of the Board of Directors. Reporting on strategic risks is part of the Strategic process.\n\nThe operational risk reporting process follows a bottom-up process starting in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0France and KLM divisions and the principal sub-subsidiaries. Every half year the Enterprise Risk Coordinators, who have been designated by the di/fferent businesses, entities and subsidiaries, establish the risk sheets and send them to Internal Audit, the latter being responsible for their consolidation at airline and Group level. Due to Covid-19, the 2020 first half report specifically reported on emerging risks related to the pandemic.\n\nThe risk sheets indicate and describe the inherent material risks and the action plans implemented for their mitigation or neutralization, together with an evaluation of their probability of occurrence and the resulting impact. The risk owners and those\n\nresponsible for the procedures to control risks are specifically named. To ensure the reliability of the process, the risk sheets for each entity are systematically reviewed during regular meetings between Internal Audit and the relevant Executive Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe Group's operational risk sheets (summarizing the operational risks of the entities), which detail any new risks or those which have been withdrawn, and the main changes, are the subject of approval by the Group Executive Committee prior to their presentation and review by the Audit Committee.\n\nTo be able to complete the Extra-financial performance statement (see chapter/uni00A04), the main environmental, social and societal risks, linked to the Group's activities across the entire value chain, are reviewed and assessed annually.

In December/uni00A02020, the GEC was composed of thirteen members (the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM CEO, the CEOs of Air/uni00A0France and KLM, and the ten heads of Group functions), plus a secretary to the GEC. The Committee meets every two weeks, alternating between Amsterdam and Paris. Its purview covers the following areas: Group Finance; Corporate Secretary, Sustainability, Communication; Engineering & Maintenance; Cargo; Information Technology; Human Resources; Strategy; Transformation; Commercial Sales and Revenue.\n\n## -Finance  functions\n\nA Group Finance division has been constituted around the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer, sta/ffed by some thirty people (Financial Communication and Investor Relations, Consolidation & Accounting, Central Management Control and MergersAcquisitions & Financial Operations). This division submits to the Group Executive Committee and the Board the Group's overall financial policy and orientations (the latter being applied at the level of the Group's two principal companies, which each have their own financial functions) and tracks the Group's financial performance.\n\nIn addition, some operations relating to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM holding company are entrusted to Air/uni00A0France, via a management mandate (notably treasury management).\n\n## -Insurance  functions\n\nThe insurance functions are responsible for identifying at-risk sectors of the Group that might impact the operations and financial results, so as to reduce their potential impact or transfer them either to insurers through insurance policies, particularly aviation policies, or to third parties under contractual mechanisms.\n\nThey also manage the claims and advise the Group's entities on reducing and controlling their risks.\n\nThere is an aviation insurance policy in place for the entire Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group to cover civil liability, damage to aircraft and risks of war, which constitute the major financial and legal risks of any airline.\n\n## -Legal  functions\n\nThe legal departments of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM perform a consulting mission for their management and decentralized organizations, notably in the areas of corporate law, competition law, transportation law, contract law and insurance law. They cooperate to establish the Group's legal policy.\n\nLegal A/ffairs draws up a systematic inventory of the disputes in process, to be able to assess the risks and constitute the corresponding provisions booked as liabilities.\n\n## -Compliance  functions\n\nThe Compliance O/fficers within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM pursue and monitor the implementation of the compliance framework components within the Groups. Within Air/uni00A0France and KLM, Data Privacy O/fficers are tasked with strengthening privacy\n\ncompliance while Export Control Managers are responsible for securing trade compliance on the export of goods or technology. The Compliance O/fficers report to the relevant governance bodies, like the Audit Committee. In addition, the Air/uni00A0France Compliance Committee and the KLM Compliance Committee monitor the respective compliance programs. Various legal experts also provide advice on compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Board of Directors decided to create a Sustainable Development & Compliance Committee, whose mission is to assist in reviewing the Group's policies.\n\n## -Internal  Audit\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Internal Audit is an independent function intended to improve the Group's various processes. It helps the Group to achieve its stated objectives by providing a systematic and formalized approach with which to evaluate and strengthen the e/ffectiveness of the decision-making, risk management, Internal Control and governance processes. The Internal Audit function objectively reviews the reliability of the overall Internal Control procedures implemented by the Group, as well as the controls in place for the processes specific to each business.\n\nGiven the Group's governance rules, each company has retained its own Internal Audit department; the coordination of Internal Audit at Group level has, nevertheless, been e/ffective since the beginning of the 2005-06/uni00A0financial year. The Group's Head of Internal Audit function, which is fulfilled by a Vice-President from within the airlines' Internal Audit departments, is responsible for overall coordination and has a functional reporting line into the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer. The Internal Control departments in the two sub-groups use identical methodologies (Group Charter, Group Audit Manual, etc.), while a common tool was adopted in early 2017 (Nasdaq Bwise).\n\nThe Internal Audit function carries out audits at the level of the Group and its subsidiaries (Air/uni00A0France and KLM). Audits are conducted in collaboration with the internal auditors of the two airlines.\n\nThe number of auditors' positions averages 22.5 in FTE (excluding management).\n\nThe Internal Audit division reports on its work to the Group Executive Committee and to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Audit Committee in a summary report presented twice yearly. Since 2020, Internal Audit has also been reporting on its work on extra-financial risks to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee on the review of extra-financial risks are then taken into account by Internal Audit in the risk presentations made to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nTo execute its mission, Internal Audit, which operates within the framework of the internal Audit Charter established by the Audit Committee of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, either acts on its own initiative or intervenes at the request of the Group Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee or the Board of Directors.",

When performing consulting services, the Internal Auditor must remain objective and not assume management responsibility;\n- -  fraud investigations: to prevent, detect and investigate significant suspected internal or external fraudulent activities;\n- -  enterprise Risk Management: to facilitate and improve the risk management process.\n\nOnce completed, the conclusions of the audits are summarized in a report highlighting the findings, the risks and the corresponding recommendations.\n\nThe audited entities then establish corrective action plans and a follow-up is conducted in the next few months.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's Internal Audit division has been awarded professional certification by the IFACI (Institut Fran\u00e7ais de l'Audit et du Contr\u00f4le Interne). This body has certified that, for the Group Internal Audit activities, all the procedures required to comply with the 2012 version of the Internal Audit Professional Practices Framework (PPF) and thus respect the international standards for Internal Audit have been implemented. This certification, which was renewed in 2018, is valid until July/uni00A02021.\n\n## Organization of responsibilities\n\nThe organization of the individual companies has been defined to ensure compliance with the principles of secure and e/ffective operations. It specifically takes into account the regulatory requirements governing air transportation, notably with regard to air operations (see section/uni00A03.2.2/uni00A0'Identification and evaluation of the risks'), ground operations and engineering and maintenance, as well as airline catering and security.\n\nThe managers of the relevant entities and subsidiaries are required to apply these principles and organization at their level, and ensure that the organizational charts, job descriptions and procedures defined by business process are up to date. They must ensure their consistency and adequacy, verify that they are taken into account in the main information systems and appropriately integrated within the organization.\n\n## Internal Control tools\n\n## Charters and manuals\n\nAir/uni00A0 France, KLM and their respective subsidiaries have a Social Rights and Ethics Charter that enshrines their individual commitments to Corporate Social Responsibility by orienting their corporate and ethical policy towards respect for individuals at the professional, social and citizenship levels.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Group deploys a Charter for the prevention of harassment in the workplace, which complies with French legislation and is part of a contractual approach through agreements signed for the benefit of employees. The legal purpose of this Charter is to set forth the principles of prevention, define the actions, stress everyone's individual legal and human responsibilities, and establish internal prevention procedures.\n\nFor its part, the KLM Group has published a Code of Conduct addressing the following principal matters: compliance with laws and regulations, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, the safeguarding of assets, environmental protection, Corporate Social Responsibility and intellectual property.\n\nKLM has also implemented a Code of Ethics intended principally for employees in the finance function (see also section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics').\n\n## Manuals to prevent non-compliance\n\nSta/ff have access to a series of manuals and policies on the intranet sites. With regard to the prevention of bribery, the Anti-Bribery Manual a/ffirms the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's commitment to conducting business with loyalty, fairness, transparency, honesty and integrity, and in the strict respect of anti-corruption laws wherever its companies or subsidiaries exercise their activities. The Manual establishes the guidelines for preventing corruption, and for identifying and handling at-risk situations in the light of the anti-corruption legislation. The related Gift and Hospitality Policy (the 'Policy') sets out the rules and guidelines with regard to Gifts and Hospitality in more detail.\n\nThe Competition Law Compliance Manual emphasizes the objectives of integrity and transparency, and contains instructions on the prevention of anti-competitive agreements and the abuse of market power. For more detail, see section/uni00A04.5.1 'Group reference texts'.\n\n## Internal Audit Charter\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's internal Audit Charter was signed by the Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer, the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Head of the Group Internal Audit in 2019.\n\nThe internal Audit Charter defines the mission of the Audit division and guarantees its independence as well as the conditions by which the division functions.\n\nIn accordance with the International Institute of Internal Auditors (The IIA) rules, the Charter formalizes the position of audit within the business and defines its sphere of operation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air/uni00A0France and KLM are also regularly audited by their customers and partners.\n\n## Monitoring of partners\n\nControl over sub-contractors and suppliers is undertaken within the framework of the regulatory monitoring program approved by the Civil Aviation Authorities.\n\nCode share partnerships are subject to an additional requirement to comply with IOSA standards that are recognized by the profession as the ultimate reference in Flight Safety and Security. The general rule is that partners are IOSA certified except in the specific case when, for example, the size of aircraft excludes the airline from the IOSA scope. In this case, the partner airline is not IOSA certified, Air/uni00A0France and KLM implement a special technical monitoring process aimed at providing a reasonable assurance of an equivalent level.\n\nIn terms of control over the monitoring process, the supervision of the e/ffective implementation of preventive/remedial actions resulting from this overall monitoring is ensured by the quality assurance departments, coordinated within each airline.\n\nMore generally, the sub-contractor control procedure addresses all the areas of risk. It is reflected in the realization of monitoring activities like audits, inspections and checks, sometimes carried out by the sub-contractors themselves. Monitoring is ensured on a quarterly basis. An expanded transverse action plan is in place, taking into consideration the new legislation on the duty of vigilance. More globally an action plan covering the monitoring of sub-contractor activity is deployed in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0France entities and coordinated at the corporate transverse level in dedicated steering committees.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe control procedures cover the information and telecommunication systems.\n\nThese procedures aim to ensure the:\n\n- -  reliability of the IT and telecommunications systems;\n- -  integrity of the data through the appropriate resources, infrastructure and checks;\n- -  continuity of IT services and the availability of data at the production sites through a local contingency strategy, secure architecture and a security system covering external access points;\n- -  confidentiality of information within the framework of national laws and the security of IT infrastructures through the establishment of secure, monitored and e/ffective accesses.\n\nThe managements of the Air/uni00A0France Group and the KLM Group ensure that the resources and expertise required by the information systems are developed within the framework of defined strategic objectives.\n\nProject management and software application development tools are also deployed: the so-called Symphony method for common Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM projects was based on the Tempo (Air/uni00A0France) and Prince2/Steelband (KLM) methods. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has adopted an 'Agile' development process based on the SCRUM and DEVOPS methodologies. The main aims are to generate business line added value more rapidly, accelerate 'Time to Market', align IT and business line objectives by prioritizing value, avoiding the development of rarely-used functionalities, reducing the risks at the earliest-possible opportunity, streamlining the development and maintenance processes and increasing the e/ffectiveness of the teams.\n\nThe work carried out in connection with Internal Control projects and the ongoing project to gradually establish a coordinated and optimized organization is leading to the launch of action plans designed to strengthen Internal Control, particularly with regard to risks like business continuity and personal data protection.\n\nThe Group's Information Technology division defines the policies establishing the framework for the functioning, security and consistency of the information systems deployed and has published a Security Information Manual (ISM ISO/uni00A027001/uni00A0standard), establishing a common security policy for information systems.\n\n## Procurement\n\nThe common Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement organization has been operational since September/uni00A01, 2008, and has been headed since its inception by a Group Chief Procurement O/fficer from KLM, seconded by an Air/uni00A0France Senior Vice-President, Procurement. It is structured around seven procurement teams. These procurement teams act in a transverse and coordinated manner for each of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM as well as for, when required, a number of the Group's airline subsidiaries.\n\nThe activity of the Procurement function aims to supply the entities with suitable products and services at the required time, at the best possible cost of ownership and at the lowest possible risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThis is achieved by applying a procurement policy focused on the expertise of the buyers, with separate responsibilities (buyer, prescriber and supplier), the establishment of contracts and the use of various (electronic) tools.\n\nThe CPO Board, comprising the Group Chief Procurement O/fficer from KLM and Air/uni00A0France's Senior Vice-President, Procurement, coordinates the Procurement teams through regular meetings and presents the procurement performance and developments to the CFOs on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Heads of Procurement meet on a regular basis in the di/fferent structures (e.g. the Quarterly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM DPO Meeting, a Quarterly Performance Meeting, direct meetings between Heads, etc.) to develop joint programs and share best practices.\n\nTo assess the risks related to sustainability (environmental, ethics, procurement, social) vendors are analyzed and evaluated by EcoVadis, a company mandated by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, with the emphasis on high-risk segments such as production in low-cost countries, and with a minimum score requirement. In addition, all procurement-managed vendors are required to commit to a Code of Conduct, reflecting Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's sustainability requirements.\n\nAll new vendors are assessed on their level of financial risk on the basis of the Dun & Bradstreet evaluation. Risk reduction strategies are required for vendors with a high level financial risk.\n\nLastly, to reduce the risks at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM level, all contracts with vendors include clauses on anti-bribery, personal data handling and other relevant risk areas.\n\n## Prevention of ticketing fraud\n\nA fraud prevention unit is responsible for preventing, insofar as possible, the risks relating to the:\n\n- -  fraudulent use of illegally-purchased tickets (credit cards and other means of payment);\n- -  protection of loyalty programs (individual and corporate clients) in terms of both earn and burn;\n- -  internal  fraud.\n\nA fraud prevention activity report was submitted to the Audit Committee in October/uni00A02020.\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM have put in place whistle-blower procedures and an e-learning anti-fraud training module aimed mainly at the sales teams.\n\n## Prevention of financial fraud\n\nDue to the proliferation of cases of attempted fraud, the Group has strengthened its internal control processes with detailed instruction notes, e-learning modules and training/information sessions.\n\n## Evaluation and monitoring of Internal Control\n\nWhen establishing its internal control framework and risk management process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM chose the COSO 2013 (Committee Of Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission) standard and the COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) as its starting point. This COSO reference framework positions Internal Control in the light of the following three categories of objectives (operations/ financial information/compliance) and defines the latter relative to five components:\n\n- -  control  environment;\n- -  risk  assessment;\n- -  control  activities;\n- -  information and communication;\n- -  monitoring  activities.\n\nThe COBIT identifies five processes:\n\n- -  evaluate, direct and monitor;\n- -  align, plan, and organize;\n- -  build, acquire and implement;\n- -  deliver, service and support;\n- -  monitor, evaluate and assess.\n\nTransactional level controls (process) are realized via design e/ffectiveness testing, followed by operational e/ffectiveness testing.\n\nSimilarly, the IT general controls are the subject of a formalized annual evaluation, followed by monitoring of the ensuing action and remedial plans.\n\n## 3.3.3/emspace Internal control relating to the establishment and processing of financial and accounting information\n\nBased on an analysis of the significant entries in the consolidated financial statements and an assessment of the risks, the Group has identified the most important companies and, within these entities, the processes that make a predominant contribution to the establishment of the financial statements.\n\nFor each of these significant processes, process documentation detailing the controls and separation of tasks has been established, followed by the implementation of existence and e/ffectiveness testing.\n\nThe Group's major divisions and subsidiaries had thus evaluated the e/ffectiveness of their Internal Control relating to financial information as at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nPursuant to Article L./uni00A0823-19/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Audit Committee oversees the process to establish the financial information and, when necessary, formulates recommendations to guarantee the integrity of the process to establish the financial information, the e/ffectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary, of Internal Audit, as regards the procedures required to establish and process the accounting and financial information, with no compromise to its independence.

This Group Investment Committee is composed of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Financial O/fficer and the Chief Financial O/fficers of Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nAll investments of more than \u20ac5/uni00A0million, together with operations relating to the fleet, and shareholding and divestment transactions, are submitted for approval to the Group Executive Committee by the Group's Management Controller and the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer.\n\nThe management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market risks is overseen by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which meets at least each quarter and, after examining the various Group risk reports, determines the hedges to be set up during the coming quarters, with notably, the hedging ratios to be achieved, the time period for respecting these targets and, potentially, the preferred type of hedging instrument.\n\nThese decisions are then implemented in each company by the respective Treasury Management departments, pursuant to the procedures for the delegation of powers.\n\nRegular meetings are organized between the Treasury Management departments of the two companies, to optimize the coordination of recommendations made to the RMC and subsequent decision implementation (hedging instruments, the strategies planned and counterparties).\n\nThe fuel hedges are covered in a weekly report forwarded to the General Managements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. A summary of the cash positions of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is communicated weekly to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's General Management.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM cash positions are the subject of monthly reports to the Finance departments. These reports include the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging operations, a summary of investments and financing by currency and a tracking statement of the risk exposure by counterparty. The Risk Management Committee sets the minimum thresholds in terms of the financial quality of counterparties, determines the maximum amount to be allocated to a single counterparty and is responsible for monitoring the quarterly positions.\n\nThe hedge strategies aim to reduce the exposure of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and therefore to preserve budgeted margins. The instruments\n\nused are futures, swaps and options. The internal risk management procedures prohibit instruments characterized as trading instruments unless expressly authorized by the Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. All the instruments used must qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to the IAS/IFRS accounting rules. Generally speaking, no trading or speculation is authorized.\n\nAny substantive change in the hedging strategy is the subject of a systematic presentation to the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Accounting and financial statements process\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group are prepared on the basis of the data provided by the finance departments of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM holding company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group is principally composed of the two operational sub-Groups, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, which prepare their own consolidated financial statements prior to their consolidation within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM financial statements.\n\nIt is imperative that the accounting information reported by the di/fferent companies complies with the Group's accounting rules, methods and standards as defined by the Group, and the presentation of the financial statements must comply with the format circulated by the Group.\n\nAll the companies within the Group refer to the Accounting Procedures Manual which is based on the International Financial Reporting Standards governing the establishment of the financial statements of European listed companies.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are submitted to the General Management then presented to the Audit Committee every quarter. Furthermore, the half-year and annual financial statements are also reviewed by the Statutory Auditors prior to their formal closure.\n\nThe parent company's financial statements are closed annually, reviewed by the Statutory Auditors and presented to the Management and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Process for reporting passenger and cargo revenues\n\nThis process is performed in each of the companies and enables monthly revenue figures to be communicated to management. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have established a procedure known as the 'progressive daily revenue' process making it possible to know the estimated amount of passenger revenues for the previous day.\n\nIn addition, departments of the Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM analyze the results by market and by route (unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer, per available seat-kilometer, per revenue ton-kilometer etc.) at the level of the passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nA monthly presentation on the level of transportation revenues (passenger and cargo) is also made to the Group Executive Committee by the senior managers of these entities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The same applies to the figures on cash-flow, and the cash and debt positions.\n\nThis monthly Group management report is distributed to the Group Executive Committee and presented to the CEO Committee by the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer.\n\nIn addition, a monthly report on the main financial KPIs is circulated to the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, management review meetings take place on at least a quarterly basis between the CEOs, CFOs and Executive VicePresidents of the Passenger, Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance and Transavia businesses.",

The reporting scope covers the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. When the information relates to a di/fferent scope, the scope of application is specified in the text.\n\n## 4.1/emspace CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## 4.1.1/emspace The Group's business model\n\nThe world is traversing a major public health crisis. The global fight against Covid-19 is underway and our economies and societies are being severely impacted. This is an unprecedented chapter in the history of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, as well as for the airline industry as a whole. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to tackling this crisis and demonstrating that we have all the assets we need to overcome it, as we have done time and time again throughout our history.\n\nThe Group's business brings together people, economies and cultures, and drives economic growth and social progress. The overarching ambition of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is to become an aviation champion in Europe, while assuming its role as a pioneer in sustainable aviation. As such, flight and health security are both an absolute imperative that the Group owes to its customers and sta/ff, and a daily commitment.\n\nThe value creation model shows the impact areas where the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group adds value and which, thanks to its fundamental strengths and unique competitive advantages, enables a response to the societal and sustainability challenges. As part of its day-to-day activities, the Group interacts with all its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, authorities, local communities and players in civil society like NGOs, etc), while its activities and operations have multiple impacts on wider society.\n\nThe main impacts, both quantitative and qualitative, are summarized in the 'reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks' paragraph in section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'. The policies implemented are outlined in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\nThe post-crisis world will no longer be the same. Within this context, the fundamentals of our strategy, in particular our commitment to sustainability, remain and will accelerate.\n\n## 4.1.2/emspace Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships\n\nOngoing dialogue and a mutual understanding of the challenges facing Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its environment are key to building long-term relationships with stakeholders.\n\n## Dialogue with stakeholders\n\nThe Group pays a great deal of attention to the expectations of its stakeholders, in particular its customers, shareholders, employees, the authorities and national policy makers, its suppliers, associations and local communities and players in civil society, like NGOs. A number of initiatives enable their perception to be evaluated on a regular basis through, notably:\n\n- -  internal barometers and meetings to gather employee suggestions;\n- -  customer perception and satisfaction surveys;\n- -  regular exchanges with individual shareholders, mainstream and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) investors together with recommendations from extra-financial ratings agencies;\n- -  dialogue with the authorities and national policy makers;\n- -  dialogue and evaluation of supplier CSR performance;\n\n- -  exchange of best practices and working groups within the industry, and with other large companies;\n- -  opinions and remarks gleaned from the dedicated email addresses, websites and the social media;\n- -  feedback channels deployed to enable stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any comments and complaints.\n\nEvery two years, the Group carries out materiality analyses, enabling the priorities key to the Group's activity to be re-evaluated and the results to be compared with those from previous materiality analyses. In 2019, nearly 130,000/uni00A0stakeholders were invited to participate in this survey with a response rate of approaching 7%: corporate clients, national and international individual customers, the Group's employees and managers, shareholders, investors, suppliers, NGOs, governmental organizations, politicians, local representatives from the Paris and Schiphol regions, CSR experts (extra-financial rating agencies, certification bodies, etc.), sustainability managers from leading companies and representatives of the airline sector and the Group's peers. For each topic, the respondents ranked the level of priority to be",

The materiality analysis also shows the emergence, alongside safety and customer satisfaction, of Fleet Development and/uni00A0CO2 Emissions within the most material issues. The detailed results highlight that the Group and its stakeholders agree on the perception of the priority nature of these issues.\n\nWithin the framework of this analysis, stakeholders also ranked a list of strategic priorities potentially impacting the sector's long-term growth, with the acceptability of the environmental impacts of aviation, the use of sustainable alternative fuels and transparency on/uni00A0CO2 emissions all heading the list.\n\nBetween the every-two-year materiality analysis campaigns, the Group commissioned an external study on the environmental responsibility of the airline industry among a representative sample of the population which was carried out in 2020. The results obtained were similar to the strategic priorities highlighted in the materiality analysis carried out in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, BlueLink, the Group's largest non-aviation subsidiary, developed its first materiality analysis, aimed at evaluating the BlueLink Group's challenges and identifying proprietary material issues linked to its customer relations activity. The materiality matrix will be realized in early 2021.\n\nAt Group level, a new materiality analysis will be carried out in 2021, to put into perspective the issues deemed to be the most important for the Group within the post-crisis world.\n\n## Analysis of the extra-financial risks\n\nThe extra-financial risks are monitored on a permanent basis and are an integral part of the Group's operational risk sheets. They are also an integral part of the Group's Sustainable Development strategy and are the subject of measures, monitoring procedures and action plans.\n\nThe Group reviews its main extra-financial risks and opportunities on an annual basis. The main environmental, social and societal risks resulting from its activities across the entire value chain are evaluated to establish a matrix of the extra-financial risks. The results are reconciled with those of the materiality matrix which illustrates the di/ffering perceptions of the internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWithin the Board of Directors, the main extra-financial risks are discussed and reviewed each year by the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, then validated by the Audit Committee. These risks and the policies implemented are outlined in chapter/uni00A03 'Risk and risk management' and in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\n## Reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks\n\nIn 2020, the extra-financial risks analysis enabled a re-evaluation of the main risks to which the Group must respond and these risks were outlined in its Extra-financial performance statement.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Group's priorities, the related risks and the opportunities deemed to be the most material, the policies in force to reduce their impacts, the performance indicators and the Group's contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For each topic, the risks are ranked by order of importance. The most material issues are marked with an asterisk. In addition, wherever possible, key performance indicators have been added.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Border closures, health measures to respect for travel and a climate of international alarm all devastated the aviation industry.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has done everything in its power to protect the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff thanks to strict and e/ffective health protocols. Against this backdrop of crisis and despite the context of remote and partial activity, employees have maintained a very high level of engagement.\n\nThe relations between the social partners and the General Management enabled all the negotiations on the reconstruction plan to take place in full transparency and in a constructive manner, despite the significant time pressure. In recognition of the loans guaranteed by the French and Dutch States, and recognizing the urgency, the entire social structure mobilized with agility around contributing to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term future.\n\nNow, more than ever, the strategy common to all the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's businesses remains fostering the commitment and motivation of its employees, by guaranteeing the working conditions enabling them e/ffectively to fulfil their\n\nprofessional functions, in support of the Group's levels of performance.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nWithin the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the Employee Experience is a key element of its People strategy and a pillar of its Sustainable Development strategy. 'Our people deliver our customer experience' and it is through this policy that the company can outperform its competitors. The roadmap is defined in a Flight Plan at the level of every division of the airlines and the Group, including notably an ongoing commitment to sta/ff development, support for initiatives, the promotion of team spirit and reinforcing levels of motivation which is key to weathering the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nTo measure the level of employee engagement, Air/uni00A0France and KLM use the Employee Promoter Score (EPS), the in-house equivalent of the Net Promoter Score which measures the level of customer satisfaction. In the two companies, a rotating random group of employees is regularly polled to ascertain whether they would recommend Air/uni00A0France and KLM as employers to their friends and family. The results are shared with all sta/ff. At Group level, the consolidated EPS increased by 1.6% between 2019 and 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Working conditions during the public health crisis\n\nAs of the onset of the public health crisis, in March/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implemented the company public health protocol stipulated by the French, Dutch and foreign governments, and sought to adapt this protocol to its various sta/ff categories during the di/fferent phases of the pandemic (lockdowns, curfew, etc.).\n\nThese health measures were communicated via the di/fferent digital communication channels in support of line managers and via a proactive Health and Safety in the Workplace network during the di/fferent phases of the crisis: protective measures, the availability of health kits, limitation on the number of days spent in the workplace, closure of the workplace canteens, remote working, certification of professional travel, etc. Meetings of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commissions (CCSSCT) were convened at every key stage to agree with the employee representatives the measures to be put in place.\n\nTo guarantee optimal working conditions for their employees, KLM, Transavia and Air/uni00A0France enabled the development of remote working, as already provisioned, or by adding this provison to the existing agreement between Air/uni00A0France and the unions, signed in 2018.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, 44% of ground sta/ff were able to work from home during the lockdown periods, having been equipped with computers and high-performance Web conferencing tools developed within the Group. A feedback exercize was carried out over the summer with the 12,200/uni00A0employees who worked from home during 2020. The results were very positive with 88% saying that they were satisfied with the resources put at their disposal. The company also took care to prevent the risk of isolation for employees working remotely by asking managers to maintain close links with their teams throughout the crisis and encouraging employees to return to their places of work one to three days a week between the two lockdowns.\n\nAt KLM, in line with government advice, working from home as far as possible has resulted in new insights and plans to further develop and implement a corporate policy for hybrid working (a balance between working from home and at the o/ffice) within KLM.\n\nFor frontline sta/ff in contact with customers or aircraft who were not eligible for remote working, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group very rapidly communicated the protection measures to be respected and equipped them with health protection kits.\n\n## Employee commitment despite the di/fficulties\n\n2020 was marked by a very signficant level of commitment from the employees of the Group. Within this unprecedented context, employees mobilized around the transportation of medical equipment and the repatriation of fellow European compatriots stranded abroad. In 2020, the Air/uni00A0France EPS\n\nincreased by 12/uni00A0points, after the introduction of the EPS tool in July/uni00A02019. The KLM Employee Promoter Score increased by nine points in the first quarter 2020 versus 2019. However, due to the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences for resource adaptation, the EPS then declined for April to November. The KLM EPS decreased by 17.9/uni00A0points in 2020.\n\nKLM's approach to promoting sustainable development at the scale of the organization also drove the establishment of programs aimed at making KLM a more welcoming and inspirational employer o/ffering diverse professional development opportunities. The aim is to stimulate employees and facilitate the activities enabling them to discover and develop their talents so that they can make better choices in a constantly-changing environment.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- -  WhatsUpp is a tool that facilitates dialogue within teams and helps determine the actions to improve the Employee Experience (empowerment);\n- -  employee events across the Group and in the divisions to create memorable individual experiences;\n- -  digital HR information sessions;\n- -  simplified processes to facilitate employees' daily lives;\n- -  selfroster pilot: as a result of the co-creation process between KLM's management and the unions, a Selfroster pilot has been rolled out within Passenger Services.\n\nIn 2020, after several years of organising employee events on KLM premises, it was time for a change. KLM is keenly aware of the important role it plays in society and the environment. KLM thus completely transformed the annual employee event, renaming it the KLM Blue Heart Event, consisting of two parts: the KLM Blue Heart Days and the KLM Blue Heart Broadcast.\n\nDuring the Blue Heart Days, held in February, KLM employees could volunter to take part in a sustainability project for a half-day during working hours. The choice of projects was broad, ranging from removing plastic waste from canals to helping manage the North Holland dune reserve. The Event ended with the KLM Blue Heart live broadcast, in which the company looked back at 2019 and forward to the rest of 2020 and beyond. The focus was on sustainability and the leading role played by KLM in pursuing innovation and improvements directed at reducing its ecological footprint and increasing its societal role and thus employee engagement.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all the Winning Way of Working (WWoW) projects have been temporarily put on hold. Only one project has continued involving the development of a new crew center to be opened in 2021. In KLM the focus has also shifted toward Covid-19-related actions. For example, a Protocol with all the Covid-19 social distancing and hygiene measures for the KLM o/ffices has been developed and implemented in all the o/ffice locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Dutch and French governments have supported the Group's e/fforts, each within the framework of their own country's social social systems.\n\nThis resource adaptation is accompanied by reorganization projects aimed at improving the Group's efficiency and restructuring its French domestic network, but also to take into account the new environmental conditions. The proposed measures have taken di/fferent forms adapted to the Group's companies and depending on the legislation in force.\n\nRight from the start, the calibration of the di/fferent plans and support measures have been systematically been discussed and negotiated with the unions within the framework of the procedures imposed by the country's legal framework.\n\nThis constant and intense employee dialogue has been maintained throughout the crisis, notably via the use of an in-house video conferencing system, enabling all the relevant players to exchange ideas, including during the lockdown periods.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the coordination of the workplace dialogue takes place in each Group entity and within the Group's European Works Council, bringing together the representatives of sta/ff whose head offices or entities are based in the European Community. In 2020, there were three meetings of the European Works Council.\n\nDuring 2020, Benjamin Smith (Chief Executive Officer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM), Pieter Elbers (KLM's President & Chief Executive O/fficer) and Anne Rigail (Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer) held regular meetings with employees in the various sites, mainly via webconferences due to the situation of public health crisis, to engage in dialogue on current topics.\n\nThe number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM employees needs to be adapted to the present level of activity but also with that of the future, particularly in the face of the crisis currently being traversed by the aviation industry. Demographic changes, digitalization, changes in the employment markets and the new aviation industry technologies are pressurizing the company to prepare its employees to adapt to these changes. Strategic planning combined with an HR and business-oriented approach is focusing on the sta/ffing outlook and the various future scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability, sta/ff recruitment and loyalty, and the management of the e/ffects of the digital transformation.\n\n## The implementation of emergency measures for all employees\n\nIn France, the company was able to extend the Partial activity scheme implemented as of March/uni00A023/uni00A0until December/uni00A031, 2020, with the benefit of the preferential regime. This support mechanism enabled a substantial saving on sta/ff costs in 2020 and the mitigation of the e/ffects of the crisis on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's cash. Furthermore, negotiations took place at the year end with the three sta/ff categories (Hostesses/Stewards, Ground Sta/ff and Pilots) to enable the company to benefit from the Long-Term Partial Working regime as of 2021, for a maximum of two years.\n\nIn April, the Dutch government launched a generic wage support grant for companies in the Netherlands whose revenues had been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. Both KLM and Transavia Netherlands applied for this so-called NOW-grant (whose literal translation is the Emergency Bridging Measure for Employment) and committed to respecting the conditions linked to this measure. The NOW-grant covers the period from March/uni00A02020 until June/uni00A02021. This support mechanism has prevented forced redundancies as much as possible in the short term.\n\n## Signature of major agreements in times of crisis\n\nIn parallel, an e/fficiency agreement was signed with the Air/uni00A0France Cabin Crew unions enabling the number of cabin crew on board the aircraft to be adapted as a function of load factors and the achievement of substantial cost savings during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Dutch government also facilitated a loan package to help mitigate the impact of this crisis. There are conditions attached to this loan package including a mandatory reduction in payroll costs. Employees earning a higher-than-median salary (\u20ac36,500/uni00A0on an annual, full-time basis) have to contribute to this via a reduction in salary. This reduction depends on the level of salary and rises to 20% for employees earning three times the average salary or more. In October, after intensive negotiations, KLM and the unions reached an agreement on the terms for this mandatory income reduction.\n\nWhile a workable Social Plan for Flight Deck Crew had already been part of an existing collective labor agreement, in 2020 KLM and the unions signed two new Social Plan agreements for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff. These agreements apply between October/uni00A02020 and December/uni00A02024. These two Social Plans for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff are based on measures aimed at limiting forced lay-o/ffs as far as as possible like a voluntary severance scheme and new career opportunities outside of KLM (e.g. a move into the healthcare or education sectors). Employees whose jobs are redundant after these measures will be forced to leave KLM. Agreements have been signed with the unions on one-o/ff payments in the event of dismissal, outplacement and assistance in finding new employment.",

        "page_content": "For Transavia Netherlands, a salary freeze is now in place while supplemenary compensation has been reduced or temporarily suspended.\n\nIn 2017, the pension schemes for Flight Deck Crews and Cabin Crews had been de-risked while the pension fund for Ground Sta/ff had remained a Defined Benefit scheme. In 2020, KLM and the unions reached agreement on a Defined Contribution Scheme (CDC-scheme), followed by the successful negotiation of an agreement with Ground Sta/ff, again on a Defined Contribution basis. The Pension Fund has been asked to approve and implement this scheme. This is expected in 2021.\n\nIn 2018, KLM had reached an agreement with the Ground Sta/ff unions on the replacement of the current two outdated salary scales for administrative and technical employees by a single new salary scale. The new salary scale is based on a commonly-used job evaluation and grading method. The new scale was implemented for more than 9,000/uni00A0employees as of October/uni00A02020.\n\nKLM has signed collective labor agreements for Pilots which apply until January/uni00A01, 2023 and for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff as from June/uni00A02019 until March/uni00A02022.\n\n## Resource adaptation via a number of measures\n\nAs of March, the Group implemented emergency measures via a recruitment freeze, meaning that initial plans for more than 1,100/uni00A0hires on permanent contracts and 1,000/uni00A0internships at Air/uni00A0France had to be put on hold, while recourse to external sta/ff also ceased. KLM implemented a hiring freeze while temporary contracts were not renewed.\n\nOver the summer, a number of schemes were proposed to Air/uni00A0 France employees to respond to the reduction in the company's sta/ffing requirement and to employee needs, and to generate payroll savings while prioritizing voluntary departures wherever possible.\n\nCollective contractual terminations (Ruptures Conventionnelles Collectives - RCC), which can be put in place rapidly from a legal and practical standpoint, were proposed as of June for flight crews, enabling 368/uni00A0pilots and 1,063/uni00A0cabin crew employees to volunteer to leave the company as of the summer of 2020.\n\nA Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l'Emploi - PDV-PSE) was implemented for ground sta/ff, enabling support for employees on career planning or for those nearing retirement. This Plan for ground sta/ff is calibrated at 3,655/uni00A0departures and is composed of two successive phases,\n\nthe first involving voluntary departures and open to 90% of ground sta/ff. The second phase involves a limited number of redundancies amongst short-haul sta/ff given the need to finalize the reorganization of the domestic network. The first ground sta/ff departures will take place at the end of January/uni00A02021 and will be staggered throughout the year (with a few departures not taking place until the summer of 2022). This Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan was the subject of negotiations and an information-consultation procedure with the unions which took place between July and November/uni00A02020. It was approved by the French Employment Ministry in December.\n\nTo support the redeployment of resources within the framework of the transformation projects associated with this Plan and, notably, the mobility of employees in the outstations and agencies in the French provinces, specific internal mobility steering processes (during the voluntary departure and reclassification phases) were deployed within the Group. Several external companies in Air/uni00A0France's regional employment catchment areas were also approached to enable short-haul sta/ff in the French Market and HOP! to be o/ffered job opportunities outside Air/uni00A0France.\n\nIn total, during the 2020 financial year, Air/uni00A0France convened 20/uni00A0Social and Economic Committee (Comit\u00e9 Social et \u00c9conomique - CSE) meetings, of which nine were ordinary and 11/uni00A0extraordinary, and four meetings of the Comit\u00e9 de Groupe Fran\u00e7ais, testifying to the intensive employee dialogue required to respond to an unprecedented crisis.\n\nConscious of the need to adapt to reality to ensure their long-term viability, KLM and Transavia Netherlands announced a restructuring plan involving changes in the business operations and a reduction in headcount. At KLM, headcount was reduced by around 5,000/uni00A0FTEs in 2020. In the last quarter of 2020, the Works Council approved the requests for advice on the restructuring of the company.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 crisis, KLM created the Loket Blauwe Inzet to help find temporary outplacements for employees in departments where posts are available. In 2020, over 1,500/uni00A0employees volunteered to be temporarily assigned to another workplace. These temporarily-assigned employees gave expression to their 'Blue Heart' driven by the feeling that they were doing the best they could for KLM. These temporary outplacements also helped fill gaps that might otherwise have been filled by external hiring and helped develop the skills of the employees concerned. Transavia Netherlands has a similar scheme in place via the WeCare platform.\n\n## 4.2.3/emspace Development of human capital and talent management\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nWithin this context of crisis, internal reorganization and headcount reduction, the development of human capital and securing the loyalty of talented individuals are imperative for transforming the companies within the Group.\n\nThe 2020-22/uni00A0campaign on the Forward Planning of Jobs and Skills (GPEC), combined with a business-focused approach, enabled the identification of the future sta/ffing needs based on a number of di/fferent scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability, research and employee loyalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This agreement notably foresees the deployment of a training and development path but also the recruitment of new talent and end-of-career support. It remains in force for the next three years even if some provisions have been improved within the framework of the Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan and the FNE (Fonds National pour l'Emploi), while others are no longer relevant in view of the current crisis.\n\n## A skills development plan adapted to the context of crisis\n\nDespite the crisis, the training initiatives went ahead, with the emphasis on regulatory and essential training (in particular, a supplementary training module for Air/uni00A0France pilots over the summer to enable the safe resumption of flights post lockdown) and remote training for all employees (nobably via the new Learning Management System rolled out last March),\n\nAir/uni00A0France encouraged its employees to benefit from training to maintain and develop their employability through various programs advertised on this new joint Learning Management System:\n\n- -  personal Training Account;\n- -  validation of Previous Experience;\n- -  FNE training: Air/uni00A0France raised nearly 7,000/uni00A0individual dossiers giving employees access to training thanks to FNE financing, i.e. around 140,000/uni00A0hours of training in di/fferent areas like Languages, Sustainable Development, Big Data, management and professional e/ffectiveness.\n- -  in-house digital training modules: Massive Online Open Courses, webinars, videos, career paths, etc.\n\nManagers played an important role in realizing Career Development interviews and proposing these di/fferent types of training to their teams on their days of partial activity.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Air/uni00A0France won the best Blended Learning program award and KLM won the best learning tech project in a commercial organization and the most innovative Blended Learning program award within the framework of the Brandon Hall Group Excellence Awards. These awards recognized the expertise of the Air/uni00A0France and KLM training teams in the creation of multimodal training programs, blending classroom-based training and digital modules.\n\nKLM renewed its MyLearning learning environment, a modern and user-friendly digital learning platform for its entire organization. This cutting-edge talent management system provides training, management and collaboration solutions as well as personalized learning solutions and has a state-of-the-art search function The system behind the new MyLearning environment was developed with the supplier Cornerstone.\n\nAs of March/uni00A02020 and the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, KLM realized it needed to raise its game to contend with the rapidly-changing situation. The result was the design of the SharePoint website whose goal is to help employees find the right support. The development possibilities it o/ffers are based on personae or imaginary employees asking typical questions like 'I am new to the role. How do I get up to speed?' or 'I have been in the same role too long. How can I keep adding to my skills?'.\n\nIn KLM's 2020 Flight Plan, the need for a vision and long-term ambitions on People Sustainability become more urgent. With a cross-section of company employees and under the supervision of the topic-owners, a vision on People Sustainability was defined and agreement reached on the main topics. This resulted in the establishment of a set of 2030 goals on Sta/ff Engagement & Development, Diversity & Inclusion, Engagement in the Communities where the Group operates and Human Rights (including the supply chain). People Sustainability puts the emphasis on human wellbeing. Our own people, our supply chain and the local and global community within which we operate are all key to People Sustainability. The foundations of a ten-year roadmap were also laid.\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will work on establishing quantifiable indicators so as to be able to monitor the progress made towards these goals.\n\n## Reinforced steering of mobility\n\nIn 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group rea/ffirmed its commitment to promoting skills-based mobility within the context of restructuring and voluntary departures. In December, a steering process for transverse mobility between the di/fferent Group companies was deployed to enable the more e/ffective matching of requirements and resources, and to foster the development of human capital.",

        "page_content": "During 2020, KLM adjusted rapidly to the numerous internal and external labor market changes. In March/uni00A02020, due to Covid-19, the entire labor market experienced significant change. Ground sta/ff recruitment procedures and advertised vacancies (internal and external) were immediately put on hold and only the most pressing hires were advertised internally. Hopefully, within the next few months, the airline sector will slowly recover but, until then, only the most essential posts will be advertised and to KLM sta/ff alone. The KLM Management Traineeships were adapted to the changing conditions due to Covid-19. Despite the current situation young top talents are finding their way within KLM and are using their skills to help create a more innovative, sustainable, people-orientated and e/fficient organization.\n\nDespite this exceptional situation, KLM has continued to build a strong employer brand with the focus having shifted from external to internal. To o/ffer its employees the same experience as customers, KLM further optimized the candidate journey, with updated communication and a leaner application process, with no motivation letter required. Due to its agile team structure, KLM was rapidly able to adapt to the sudden change in internal mobility forecasts.\n\n## Developing leadership and performance management\n\nIn early 2019, Air/uni00A0France had launched its new continuous performance management learning program. This program is supported by a tool developed internally and is positioned as a management transformation lever. It is based on two key concepts: continuous performance management and multi-evaluation. This new program has enabled the development of the feedback process to build employee skills and, consequently, enhance collective performance. In September/uni00A02020, in view of the crisis and partial activity, Air/uni00A0France asked its managers to conduct at least one annual interview with every member of their teams to address their 2020 performance and their potential development in 2021.\n\nKLM works with KLM Compass, which links the company's purpose to a set of values. In early 2020, sessions were held with a cross-section of company employees aimed at adjusting the KLM Compass with Sustainability as it had become clear that Sustainability is a spearhead in the KLM strategy. Sustainability has been added to the ambition (to be a leading European network carrier in customer centricity, e/fficiency and sustainability) and to the HOW? (We care for our customers, our people and our planet. We are KLM for you!).\n\nKLM and Air/uni00A0France continue to o/ffer talent and leadership programs like the Femmes de Talent training and coaching program, aimed at enabling high-potential women to develop their skills within the Group and occupy senior management positions, joint financial programs with the HEC business school for future managers and Focus on the Future programs to project talents into the company's future.\n\n## Internal coaching and mentoring continue to be o/ffered at the di/fferent levels of the company\n\nIn the shift from performance management towards performance development, KLM created a new format and process for performance appraisals in a forward-looking and appreciative approach with a focus on Talent, Performance and Development. In these individual conversations, KLM puts the emphasis on talent and the development of the expertise and actions needed to enhance an individual's value in both their current and future roles and activities. The aim is to help discover employees' talents and their individual growth potential, and thus maximize everyone's contribution to the company's results.\n\nBased on KLM's People Strategy, the transition to an inclusive Talent and Performance Development process was initiated. With this process, KLM aims to enable employees to make optimal use of their talents, improve their employability and thus add value to the organization. This new conversation method was developed in collaboration with the Works Council to discuss talent, performance and personal development. This contributes to a healthy in-, through- and out flow of KLM sta/ff.\n\nTo structure this process, the Talent Development Cycle has been developed: a yearly cycle for managers and employees with a specific route to be followed on Talent and Performance Development topics, based on the business priorities.\n\nIn response to the Covid-19 crisis, KLM adjusted the content of its leadership development program, with classroom-based training being replaced by free online learning, such as webinars as well as other online options, curated and o/ffered through a Sharepoint site for leadership development: The Optimal Leadership hub. The baseline of leadership development building on the Optimal Leadership framework - remains in place in 2021. Transavia continued to pursue its leadership program of the last three years, while responding to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nA presentation on the strategy for retaining talented people and establishing succession plans was made to the Executive Committee in the autumn of 2020. People reviews are regularly organized to encourage transverse mobility and o/ffer talented individuals attractive career opportunities. The Next Gen program, aimed at young executives, has been adapted to respond to the retention needs created by the crisis.\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France moved up nine places in the Glassdoor ranking of the best French employers.\n\nAs seen in prior years, KLM remains an employer of choice. The 2020 Intermediar Employer of Choice study showed that KLM is the number two employer of choice in the Netherlands, compared to its number one position in the previous year. The Randstad study, however, showed some decline in KLM's appeal, the airline being ranked the fourth most attractive employer in the Netherlands for 2020 compared with its top ranking in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This o/ffers a gateway to scientific knowledge on HR themes and the opportunity to invite a Masters student to work on a specific HR assignment. Another important network is the HR Bedrijvennetwerk. Members\n\n## 4.2.4/emspace Diversity and equality\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAs a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is committed to respecting the universal principles relating to the respect of Human Rights.\n\nIn The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles, the Group affirms its commitment to fostering a climate of trust and mutual respect in a working environment where no form of discrimination or harassment is tolerated. Various initiatives have been implemented at Air/uni00A0France and KLM to support this commitment.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM strongly believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce has a positive impact on the performance of the organization and thus continues to support all forms of action to encourage equal opportunity, equality between men and women, LGBTI networks, the vocational integration of young people, the transmission of knowledge and skills, and the maintained employment and recruitment of persons with disabilities.\n\nWithin the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis, as with all of the Group's activities, the CSR diversity actions have been significantly impacted. However, the goal remains to maintain an ambitious diversity policy by carrying out actions adapted to the context.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nThe current global pandemic, with its far-reaching societal and economic implications, presents both opportunities for and challenges to promoting Diversity & Inclusion within the workplace. Prior to Covid-19, the business imperatives for Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) had become increasingly clear with a management commitment to and investment in D&I. The Group now needs to embrace inclusion and make optimal use of the diversity within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has set itself a long-term objective of reaching parity between men and women within the Group Executive Committee and within the top 10% highest levels of management. In addition, medium-term targets of a minimum of 33% women within the Group Executive Committee and 40% of the top 10% management level positions to be held by women by 2030 have also been set by the Board of Directors. Concretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed to accelerate the taking into account of female profiles at all levels of management. In 2020, 30.8% of the members of the Group Executive Committee were women.\n\nIn 2020, the proportion of women in managerial positions increased for all categories of sta/ff: ground sta/ff (34% of the 10%\n\nof this business network have the opportunity to exchange relevant knowledge and best practices.\n\nIn 2020, Transavia Netherlands introduced a pilot 'POWER' (Persoonlijke Ontwikkeling Waarderen in Eigen Regie) project, a scheme aimed at personal development.\n\nhighest levels of management were women compared to 33% in 2019), pilots (5.7% of Flight Captains were women compared to 5.2% in 2019), cabin crew (65.7% of Pursers compared to 65.5% in 2019).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has pursued its policy of promoting diversity and reiterated the need to combat all forms of prejudice and discrimination by putting the emphasis on the power of diversity and inclusion via coordinated interventions and reinforced commitment. More diverse and inclusive organizations are known to attract more talent and be more customer driven, have higher levels of employee engagement, take better decisions and are more innovative and creative. All of these factors are key to the shared ambition set by the two airlines in terms of equal opportunity and combating all forms of prejudice and discrimination.\n\n## Promoting gender equality\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, professional and wage equality between women and men is a major business priority and an area in which the company would like to make progress in terms of human resources management. This undertaking was reflected in the signature with the unions of a fifth agreement on Professional Gender Equality.\n\nTo ensure equal treatment between men and women, a number of male-female comparative indicators are tracked annually within the framework of an audit carried out within each division of the company (training, careers, vocational safety, remuneration, etc.). Special wage equalization and equitable salary management measures are in place, together with an annual audit of male and female comparative remuneration.\n\nTo encourage women to access the highest management positions, coaching and mentoring initiatives are in place to promote their career progression. In 2020, despite the unfolding public health crisis, the Femmes de Talent coaching program was maintained and adapted (digitalized content and optimized duration) thanks to FNE financing. Fifty participants were able to benefit from this program this year.\n\nThe internal Women For Tomorrow (WoTo) network, aimed at reinforcing the recognition of women within the Group, currently numbers some 600/uni00A0members. Air/uni00A0France is also a member of the Elles Bougent external network, whose female business mentors encourage young girls to join the engineering and technical professions. More than 60/uni00A0female mentors belong to this network. In 2020, Air/uni00A0France won the Jury's Favorite award for its entry to the Equality Trophies, showcasing action to promote diversity.",

        "page_content": "In the 2020 financial year, Air/uni00A0France continued its awareness-raising and actions to prevent sexism and sexual harassment, notably in November/uni00A02020 with the deployment of an e-learning module for all sta/ff realized in partnership with several other large French companies having signed up for the #StOpE au Sexisme initiative.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion has been identified as an enabler that will drive employee engagement during the recovery and restructuring. Sta/ff engagement is an integral part of the restructuring agenda (formerly transformation agenda) and thus a strategic topic for the KLM Board of Directors.\n\nIn early 2020, KLM participated in the annual Talent to the Top monitor and, thanks to the e/fforts made in 2019, the monitor showed an improvement in four of the six criteria. In March/uni00A02019, the KLM President & CEO had signed the Talent to the Top Charter, a manifesto aimed at increasing the number of women in management positions. This Charter helps to bring the right focus to the company's diversity policy and activate the appropriate dialogue. The Charter contains guidelines and clear agreements that help KLM purposefully work towards durable and e/ffective results. Every year KLM's progress is monitored based on six criteria: Leadership, Strategy and Interventions, HR Management, Communication, Knowledge and Skills, and Work Climate.\n\nIn 2020, the D&I circle continued with four workstreams led by Executive Vice-Presidents. The focus remained on gender diversity since research has shown that this is the entry point to driving an improvement in other diversity topics. Since 2018, a Diversity Circle composed of KLM Executive Committee members and internal ambassadors has been responsible for defining and executing a clear D&I strategy.\n\nThe 2030 People Sustainablity Goals have been defined, including the ambitions for Diversity & Inclusion: by 2030, the target is for 100% of KLM employees to experience a diverse and inclusive working environment within the company.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, KLM carried out numerous actions in favor of diversity and inclusion:\n\n- -  commitment sessions with the divisional management teams; the aim is to create awareness, encourage buy-in and come up with concrete measures within the divisions and a company-wide policy to enhance a diverse and inclusive culture. In 2020, owing to Covid-19, some of the workshops could not take place, including the workshop that was to have been attended by the Executive Committee;\n- -  KLM organized a high-impact workshop for HR professionals (bias test, awareness, etc.) to identify concrete measures to improve D&I in its HR processes and approach (e.g. to foster diversity in recruitment);\n- -  KLM launched a Female Leadership training program with 14/uni00A0participants at top management level. Due to Covid-19, the first group went ahead on a virtual basis. The female leaders developed a D&I survey to measure the importance and experience of D&I among their own informal network within KLM (around 450/uni00A0participants), thus collecting insightful information;\n- -  dashboards based on HR data are used and updated to monitor the number of promotions, and the inflow and outflow of men and women. In 2020, HR implemented a data collation process (including survey and exit interviews) to gain insights into the reasons why people choose to leave KLM and, in particular, the most talented;\n- -  the Women on Board and the LGBTI Over the Rainbow networks continue to work closely with the D&I Circle. The focus of Over the Rainbow has been on increasing awareness and enhancing discussion. The Women on Board network organizes inspirational events giving women opportunities to connect and learn from each other. Despite the crisis, these internal networks, supporting the importance of Diversity & Inclusion for Women and LGBTI colleagues, were able to proceed with the organization of a number of events.\n\n## Equal opportunities within the Group\n\nThe 2020 financial year was marked by the negotiation of the 2020-23/uni00A0agreement on Disability, signed in January/uni00A02021. Through this eleventh agreement and despite the crisis, Air/uni00A0France reaffirmed its commitment to the ongoing recruitment of persons with disabilities by pursuing its actions on maintained employment, training and professional support via, in particular, coaching and co-development.\n\nTo maintain links with employees with disabilities within the context of the public health crisis, two questionnaires were sent to them in 2020 to gain feedback on their support needs and expectations. Awareness-raising initiatives went ahead as planned, notably during European Disability Employment Week. For the second year running, Air/uni00A0France also took part in the DuoDay (six events in digital form and one in a face-to-face setting) and organized remote internships for school children with disabilities.\n\nIn 2020, owing to the Covid-19 public health crisis, the success rate in finding alternative employment for people who were unable to return to their original jobs due to disability was not as high as in 2019. Finding alternative employment means not only suitable positions within KLM but also the redeployment of employees outside the airline. These measures are part of the dedicated support provided by the Reintegration O/fficers. To find alternative employment opportunities outside KLM, the company works with various service providers to ensure a better match on the external labor market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Di/fferentiating between employees on the basis of disability or chronic disease is not permitted. It is only when people with a disability or health condition are unable to fulfil the tasks necessary to do a job e/ffectively can the employer refuse to hire them, especially if health or safety is a major issue. It is also mandatory for an employer to investigate whether an adjustment in tasks or the working environment might help a disabled person to execute the relevant work.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has a long history of proud engagement with the LGBT+ community. In 2019, Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer, Anne Rigail, signed the association L'Autre Cercle's LGBT+ commitment Charter. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France also renewed its partnership with the Personn'ailes LGBT and Gay Friendly employee association, which takes part in the Paris Gay Pride.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, plans for Coming Out Day and Amsterdam Pride went ahead but in modified form with KLM hoisting the rainbow flag for several days. For Coming Out Day, an online session was organized to boost dialogue and inspire others with personal stories and experiences. The stories are used as inspiration for other leaders to amplify the importance of an inclusive climate and leadership. 2020 saw KLM participate for the third time in the Work Place Pride Global benchmark, whose report showed an increase in the commitment and representation of the LGBTI community within the airline. Potential areas for improvement will be aligned with the D&I strategy and actions for 2021.\n\n## An adapted welcome for young people, both physical and remote\n\nDespite the public health crisis and its financial impact on the company, Air/uni00A0France continued to welcome interns and school children on work experience placements. These programs took place both at the company's premises in the respect of the health rules and remotely, notably via digital sessions with the company's Tous En Stage partner association.\n\nIn 2020, support for Air/uni00A0France interns nearing the end of their contracts was if anything an even greater priority for the company. The resources in place were adapted to the situation and individual support prioritized in partnership with Sodesi. Remote workshops on job-seeking techniques, building self confidence and starting a business were thus proposed to interns as of June. A dedicated website enabling them to access numerous job o/ffers, training and internships but also training content was put at their disposal.\n\nAs part of a growing commitment to the territories in which it exercizes its activities, this year Air/uni00A0France reinforced its partnership with Paris CDG Alliance by taking part in labs under the leadership of the P\u00f4le Emploi French government agency, around the question of the orientation and showcasing of internship as a center of excellence but also by supporting the launch of the Cit\u00e9 des M\u00e9tiers and Envol Pro initiatives enabling young French people to benefit from linguistic immersion to improve their English.\n\nLastly, in November/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France pilots proposed a ground-breaking initiative enabling the children of employees aged between 13/uni00A0to 25/uni00A0years to train for an Aeronautics Initiation Certificate (Brevet d'Initiation A\u00e9ronautique) delivered by the DGAC. The training will be carried out remotely and for free, by pilot cadets whose training has been slowed by the Covid-19 public health crisis.\n\n## 4.2.5/emspace Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, health, safety and the quality of life in the workplace is a major priority on which there may be no compromise. Everyone working for or with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has the right to a working environment that guarantees their health and safety, and takes into account their physical and mental well-being.\n\nIn addition to the financial impacts, the current public health crisis has major human consequences for every one of us and thus for the Group's employees.\n\nRemote working, partial activity but also and especially the Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan formalized in 2020 have human repercussions that the company must foresee and support.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nOn an annual basis, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group measures and reports the indicators related to health and safety at work: absenteeism, number of workplace accidents, frequency rate\n\nand severity rate of workplace accidents (see sections 4.2.6.2 and 4.2.6.3).\n\nAir/uni00A0 France's policy on Health and Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace (formalized in 2012) was revised in 2018. It focuses on five priority themes:\n\n- -  prevent serious accidents;\n- -  reinforce compliance and respect of regulations;\n- -  develop ergonomic approaches;\n- -  improve the quality of life in the workplace and the prevention of psychosocial risks;\n- -  structure and organize prevention measures around a steering system deployed in a cross-cutting manner.\n\nThe steering and coordination of the health, safety and quality of life in the workplace networks by the Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace division within HR, which numbers representatives in all the entities, ensures the coordinated deployment of the policy and its actions and targets, and promotes the sharing of best practices, priority actions and investment. Accidentology analysis enables the adjustment",

        "page_content": "of the policy and actions designed to safeguard human health and safety. The monitoring of indicators ensures the ongoing adaptation of the initiatives.\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France signed an agreement to prevent and take action against violence and harassment in the workplace. This agreement establishes simplified, more e/ffective and swifter procedures for the handling of the relevant employees, but also awareness-raising and training actions together with the diagnostics to be realized.\n\nWithin both Transavia Netherlands and KLM, safety and compliance are achieved via a continuous system of processes and procedures known as the Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The ISMS guarantees the safety performance of all processes, in all domains, through the e/ffective management of safety risks. Safety and compliance are continuously improved via collaboration between the tasks and responsibilities of the Integrated Safety Services Organisation (ISSO) and the divisions/business units. The ISMS identifies hazards, threats and safety issues, collects and analyses data, assesses safety risks, implements mitigations and monitors the results. The ISMS supports the mitigation of risks in order to keep accident and incident rates below an 'acceptable level'.\n\nIn the first two months of 2020, the focus was fully on improving the occupational safety and health performance. The mitigation team of occupational experts continued to support the line management and their departments in the implementation of the KLM's Occupational Safety and Health policies and mitigation of the occupational safety and health risks.\n\nAs of March/uni00A02020, the Covid-19 pandemic and the worldwide response from governments and aviation industry organizations saw KLM's e/fforts refocused on re-engineering the airline's procedures and working methodologies to ensure safe and secure operations for both employees and customers on a global basis.\n\n## Permanent adaptation and application of the health measures\n\nAs of March, the 2020 focus turned to managing the impacts and consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic while adjusting and pursuing the risk prevention measures for the Group's activities.\n\nThe first of these measures consisted of implementing procedures to protect employees from the risk of the epidemic in line with the recommendations from the public health authorities and the national protocol in response to the unfolding public health crisis. The deployment of these measures was accompanied by the reinforcement of the intelligence teams and the monitoring of the cases and contacts by the vocational medical teams, a statistical focus on the declarations and the permanent availability of medical experts to approve the prevention measures.\n\n## Reinforced prevention of psycho-social risks\n\nTo provide the best-possible support for staff confronting personal or professional difficulties, the network of social assistants rapidly mobilized. As of March, the social assistants established telephone hot lines functioning five days a week to listen to and assist callers, and provide appropriate responses. Counseling was also available from the vocational psychiatrist for situations requiring their specialist input, with direct action or the appropriate referrals for employees or their families.\n\nContinuous company-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/introduction of new regulations, procedures and methodologies have ensured the appropriate measures and mitigations are in place to maintain safety. To guarantee the safety of all employees, the Covid-19 regulations have constantly been adapted and wherever possible improved with more rules added as a result of safety studies and risk analysis. The mental health of employees working under increased pressure and/or from home is monitored via surveys. Initiatives to safeguard social coherence are also carried out throughout the company.\n\n## Support for remote workers during the lockdowns\n\nIn addition and to support the implementation of imposed remote working, a number of di/fferent measures were deployed to facilitate the realization of remote activities as of March/uni00A02020 (equipment for employees, ergonomic advice on working from home, communications enabling the sharing of best remote working practice and prioritizing the maintenance of dialogue within the teams and with the line management).\n\nAs of June, on the gradual emergence from lockdown, a survey was realized with 12,200/uni00A0employees having experienced remote working within this highly unusual context, to enable the company to improve the conditions for remote working in 2021. In this internal survey, 61% of the respondents noted an improvement in the quality of life in the workplace for their teams and gave a positive score for the reinforced e/ffectiveness of their teams during the remote working period of the first lockdown.\n\nLastly, to ensure the optimum level of flight safety, the company took into account the risks linked to part-time working by putting in place protocols negotiated with the Pilot unions for the resumption of flights and the entry into commercial service of new aircraft.\n\nThe company also regularly communicated with managers on the importance of maintaining links with their teams, adapting work loads and optimizing the organization of team working by taking into account the activity levels so as to avoid the risk of overload and, inversely, isolation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital support was quickly increased and employees were allowed to take o/ffice equipment home. A feedback survey about the working conditions at home was conducted and 64% of the respondents indicated that their workplace was adequate. At the end of 2020, KLM conducted a survey to ascertain the level of well-being of its employees; the results of this survey are expected early next year.\n\nSince the Covid-19 public health crisis, KLM has adapted the content, look and feel of the KLM Health Portal for the di/fferent target employee groups; O/ffice, Operations, Flight Operations and Inflight Services.\n\nA new format with the following three themes has been implemented:\n\n- -  How can I stay physically healthy?\n- -  How can I stay mentally healthy?\n- -  How can I work healthily from home?\n\nThe content on the MyHealth portal relating to these three main themes has been regularly updated, to ensure su/fficient relevant information is available for returning visitors. Almost all KLM employees have visited the renewed MyHealth portal at least once.\n\nWebinars, organized by theme and target group, have also been very well received. As in the previous year, in November/uni00A02020, the KLM focus was on the Week van de Werkstress, or Stress in the Workplace Week, whose theme this year was 'Stay in balance!' The content was updated on MyHealth and a Digital Detox webinar was organized. KLM employees were supported with information, inspiration and concrete advice on how to maintain a balance during this challenging time. In early December, KLM organized the KLM Thuiswerk-Weken with a range of webinars relating to various aspects of working from home. All this information is available on MyHealth, which also o/ffers appropriate interventions to help colleagues work from home in a healthy, adapted and productive manner.",

Airline Services, representing 88% of the employees in the subsidiaries of the KLM Group.\n\nIn 2019, Barfield/uni00A0Inc. was included in the reporting scope for the Air/uni00A0France subsidiaries.\n\nThe KLM reporting scope did not change relative to 2019, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe reference number of employees for calculating the coverage rate of the social reporting is the average number of employees in\n\nFull Time Equivalent during 2020, derived from the Management Control division's BFC tool.\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's social information is based on the calendar year to ensure consistency with the social performance indicators of other French companies.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThis year the reporting has been carried out using the MS Excel tool. Consistency tests have been incorporated within the tool together with precise definitions of each indicator. The data are verified and approved locally at the level of each subsidiary by a manager who is responsible for the HR statistical data.\n\nThis tool is supplemented by a general coordination of the process and by a general reporting procedure which defines the process for compiling, calculating and consolidating the indicators, based on an instruction memorandum circulated by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's Finance division.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's social information is carried out by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Sustainability & Compliance department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Employee Promoter Score (EPS)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM (employees on French or Dutch contracts).\n\nThe Employee Promoter Score (or EPS) is the score given to Air/uni00A0 France and KLM in their capacity as employers by their employees. Since July/uni00A02019, this indicator has been measured at Air/uni00A0France and KLM on a weekly basis, based on a random group of 1,500/uni00A0employees representing all the Air/uni00A0France and KLM businesses, in the form of a question sent by mail: 'How likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as an employer to friends and family?', on a scale of 0/uni00A0to 10. The EPS corresponds to the di/fference between the percentage of employee promoters (score of 8/uni00A0to 10) of the employer brand and the percentage of detractors (scores 0/uni00A0to 5).\n\nThe indicator measured is the annual change in the consolidated EPS for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## Percentage of women in management functions (ground sta/ff, pilots, cabin crews)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees (expressed as 'headcount') on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term (CDD) contracts, on the payroll as of December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\nThe indicator measured is the percentage of women in the three sta/ff categories:\n\nGround sta/ff: percentage of women in the top 10% management level. The percentage of women is calculated by combining all the levels of management, classified in descending hierarchical order, until the threshold of 10% of the total salaried workforce of",

Note also the massive implementation of remote working. These action plans had a significant impact on the changes in many of the indicators.\n\nAll of this has led to substantial changes in the year-on-year variation for many of the indicators.\n\n## 'Consolidated social data for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group' table\n\nThis table presents the indicators relating to the number of employees, hires and departures, the proportion of female employees and the percentage of sta/ff working part time. These indicators are consolidated at the level of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nThe following notes refer to the references in the social indicator tables (section/uni00A04.2.1).\n\n## Employees\n\nNote/uni00A01 : The number of people employed by the Group (expressed as headcount) on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term contracts (CDD) on December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Recruitment under permanent contracts\n\nNote/uni00A02 : The indicator concerns employees hired on permanent contracts (CDI).\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, the calculation of the number of employees recruited on permanent contracts includes those initially recruited on fixed-term contracts (CDD) transferring to permanent contracts (CDI) during the year.\n\nFor KLM, only employees recruited directly on permanent contracts are taken into account.\n\nThis year, it was not possible to include the Transavia Netherlands data on this topic in the Group's social indicators.\n\n## Percentage of women - Organization of working time\n\nNote/uni00A03: These indicators enable the percentage of women to be evaluated relative to the workforce and the proportion of part-time employees on both permanent and fixed-term contracts at December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Employees by geographical zone at December/uni00A031\n\nNote/uni00A04: In 2020, the Air/uni00A0France Group employees in the French Overseas Departments and Territories, i.e. 596/uni00A0employees, have been included in the Caribbean-Indian Ocean geographical zone.\n\n## Training\n\nNote/uni00A05 : The 'Number of training hours by employee' indicator is calculated based on all the training sessions, divided by the average monthly headcount. For the first year in the social indicators, this indicator is presented at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group consolidated level. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Campus, which is responsible for training ground sta/ff, changed its e-learning tool. This change led to a loss of information which was not considered material. The implementation of a new tool guarantees the exhaustiveness of the e-learning data for 2021.\n\n## -Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France subsidiaries\n\nFor the first time this year, the 'Number of training hours by employee' indicator includes the number of hours of training at Bluelink International CZ (this data not having been available in the preceding years).\n\n## -KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe hours of external training dispensed to KLM Group administrative employees and the hours of training given to employees of the Transavia Netherlands subsidiary (less than 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's headcount) are not included in the 'Training Hours' indicator due to there being no information collation process in place. Measures will be taken to progressively expand the reporting scope of the indicator in the coming financial years.\n\n## 'Other social data' tables\n\nThe indicators reported in the 'Other social data' tables are subject to di/fferent qualification and legal reporting obligations in France and the Netherlands, meaning that they are not comparable and need to be presented separately for Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The subsidiaries concerned in these tables are listed in the reporting scope section above.\n\n## Absenteeism - Health and safety in the workplace (Note/uni00A01)\n\nA significant portion of the work-related accidents reported by Air/uni00A0France is due to cases of barometric otitis and musculoskeletal disorders which are recognized as work-related accidents in France whereas they are recorded as sick leave by KLM in accordance with Dutch law.\n\n## -Air/uni00A0France\n\nThe absenteeism rates are calculated based on the hours of absence expressed as a ratio of the hours theoretically worked (excluding leave). For Air/uni00A0France flight crews, absenteeism is broken down into days then converted into hours by multiplying by five hours.\n\nThe absenteeism rate for accidents in the workplace also takes into account travel-related accidents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Part-time working for health reasons is booked as sick leave. The total period of sick leave is booked in the month of the accident. The 21/uni00A0accidents in the workplace for the Air/uni00A0France International entity (local contracts) have not been included in the calculation of these indiactors. The impact of this exclusion is not significant.\n\n## -KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe frequency and severity rates are calculated for all sta/ff based on the hours theoretically worked.\n\nThe days lost for work-related accidents are tracked based on figures declared by the KLM entities in the Netherlands.\n\n## Number of disabled employees (Note/uni00A04)\n\n## -Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France subsidiaries\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, the number of disabled employees are those who, based in Continental France and the French Overseas Departments and Territories, were present for at least one day during the year and for whom a valid certificate, pursuant to French law (Article L./uni00A05212-2/uni00A0of the French Labor Code), is available.\n\nNote that the data for international employees are reported based on local legislation.\n\nThe number of disabled employees recruited corresponds to the number of permanent and fixed-term employment contracts signed during the year; an employee recruited on a fixed-term contract who then transfers to a permanent contract during the year will be reported twice.\n\n## -KLM and KLM subsidiaries\n\nThe definition of a disabled person varies according to the local legislation governing the entities in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor KLM and KLM's Dutch subsidiaries, an individual is deemed to be disabled if unable to carry out his or her work or any other work at an equivalent salary level. This requires the employer and the employee to look for another position with a salary as near as possible to the previous level and gives the employee the right to government benefits to compensate for any di/fference.\n\nFor KLM's UK subsidiaries, the reported number of employees with disabilities refers to the employees on the payroll at December/uni00A031, 2020, for whom a valid certificate, pursuant to national legislation, is available.",

Despite the Covid-19 public health crisis and if no action is taken, the forecasts for global air tra/ffic growth in the coming years could, however, see this proportion increase.\n\nThe aviation industry is the first economic sector to have set ambitious long-term reduction targets and to have adopted a worldwide carbon o/ffsetting system within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to guarantee carbon-neutral growth for global air transportation as of 2020.\n\nIn 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) thus set ambitious worldwide targets for reducing the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from air transportation:\n\n- -  1.5% average annual fuel e/fficiency improvement until 2020;\n- -  carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards;\n- -  a 50% reduction in net aviation/uni00A0CO2 emissions in 2050 relative to the 2005 level.\n\nWhile international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry's e/fforts respond to the latter's target of limiting the global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C. In its Energy Technology Perspectives 2017, the International Energy Agency considers that the airline industry's target for 2050 is more ambitious than what would be required for a 2\u00b0C scenario (2\u00b0C Scenario - 2DS) and close to a scenario of beyond 2\u00b0C (Beyond 2\u00b0C Scenario - B2DS) without taking into account the e/ffects of carbon o/ffsetting.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM endorses the IATA's targets and has set itself proprietary intermediate targets aimed at reducing its/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2020, 2030 and 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, the Covid-19 public health crisis had a very material impact on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activity and results. Border closures, health measures to be respected for travel and a climate of international alarm devastated the air transport industry. Thus, all the published indicators have been impacted and do not reflect Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term commitments or its environmental performance in recent years.\n\nWhile kerosene consumption and carbon emissions may have been reduced by nearly 50% in 2020 (as with/uni00A0NOx, LTO and noise hindrance), the carbon footprint (in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passenger kilometer) deteriorated given the redeployment of the network and a collapse in the load factor (from 87% in 2019 to 65% in 2020).\n\nWithin this context the Group reduced its/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 5.6% in 2020 relative to 2005 (operational and market-based measures).\n\nTo attain these targets and reduce its carbon footprint by activating all the available levers, the Group has established a Climate Action Plan. This Plan is composed of six main mitigating priorities, for which targets have been identified and action plans implemented:\n\n- -  fleet modernization and contributing to aeronautical research;\n- -  sustainable aviation fuel and participating in research into renewable energies;\n- -  operational  measures;\n- -  supporting the implementation of the global climate agreement (CORSIA) with a fair contribution for aviation;\n- -  regulatory and proactive o/ffsetting;\n- -  supporting environmental programs;\n- -  carbon o/ffsetting programs for customers.\n\nThe European aviation sector believes that its recovery is fully compatible with, and should be accompanied by, broader e/fforts to reduce its environmental footprint, provided the right policies are in place. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and European aviation players are thus committed to maintaining their e/fforts to reduce their negative environmental impacts, both locally and globally. The latter implies, in particular, all stakeholders and all policy-makers working together to achieve net zero/uni00A0CO2 emissions from all flights within and departing from the EU by 2050.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions: Scopes 1, 2 and 3\n\nMost of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are generated by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's direct activities (scope 1), and mainly by the flight operations which represent 99.7% of the Group's total direct emissions. The ground operations (testing bench, runway vehicles, etc.) represent 0.3%.\n\nThe ground operations, like the aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, also generate indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope 2), through energy consumption in buildings (electricity and air conditioning). The Group implements measures to reduce ground energy consumption.\n\nThe indirect Scope 3/uni00A0greenhouse gas emissions mostly come from the upstream phase (extraction, production, distribution, etc.) in aviation kerosene production and carbon emissions from runway vehicles and equipment. The other scope 3/uni00A0components are the purchasing of goods and services, passenger road travel to and from airports, and employee commuting. Air/uni00A0France and KLM implement measures to reduce scope 3/uni00A0emissions. For the air operations, scope 3/uni00A0emissions account for around 16% of total emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n\nEvery year, the Group reports 100% of its scope 1 and 2/uni00A0CO2 emissions, and the scope 3/uni00A0emissions resulting from the upstream phase in aviation kerosene production (according to internal estimates, these emissions represent approximately half of the total scope 3/uni00A0emissions). These emissions are reported in the form of indicators presented in the environmental indicator tables, accompanied by a definition of the respective scopes (see section/uni00A04.3.6).\n\n## Fuel-saving measures\n\nAll possible avenues of fuel-savings are identified and, when feasible, implemented, subject to strict respect of the rules on Flight Safety. All the airlines within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are involved in the Fuel Plan, to improve the Group's energy e/fficiency and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n## Fleet modernization\n\nThe most impactful way to reduce the carbon footprint is to invest in a more fuel-e/fficient fleet. The Group focuses on simplification and rationalization to make the fleet more competitive while its transformation is being pursued with the arrival of more modern, high-performance aircraft with a significantly-lower environmental impact. The Covid-19 public health crisis has accelerated the phase-out of the most-polluting aircraft which are the least adapted to the environmental route map; A340 and A380 for Air/uni00A0France and Boeing 747 for KLM. In 2020, the average age of the aircraft in the Group's fleet was 12.1/uni00A0years. For more information on the Group's fleet see section/uni00A01.4.\n\n## Sustainable aviation fuel\n\nThe use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the most impactful measures for reducing the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from aviation. They enable an 80% to 100% reduction over the entire life cycle for the most innovative technologies. Such fuels will be key to supporting the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's energy transition but also that of the aviation industry as a whole.\n\nAfter analysis phases during which Air/uni00A0France and KLM respectively demonstrated no operational impact and the ability to conduct safe air operations in any type of aircraft powered by all engine types, for several years the Group has been committed to fostering the development of a sustainable alternative fuel industry for aviation. By mobilizing the eco-system, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have established innovative partnerships with corporate clients,",

For its part, Air/uni00A0France was behind the Engagement for Green Growth (Engagement pour la Croissance Verte - ECV), a public-private initiative to study the conditions necessary to establish French and European industries, whose report was submitted to the government in 2019. In 2020, the airline made a commitment to various consortia supporting French production projects. Strong governmental support, for example by incentive mechanisms, is however required to ensure the economic viability of such biofuels, in terms of both their more widescale deployment and the creation of production facilities for producers and operators alike.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is very exacting as regards the sustainability criteria of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel it uses requiring, for example, a substantial reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions, a minimal impact on biodiversity, no competition with food production or access to food resources, and a positive impact on local development.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM have been members of a sustainable certification body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), since 2008, in their capacity as founder members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG). This body takes into account 12/uni00A0criteria ranging from food security to rural development, the quality of air, soil and water resources, and waste management.\n\n## Stimulating the industry\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM are members of working groups and support research projects aimed at the creation of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel market. For example:\n\n- -  Air France has joined forces with ATAG (Air Transport Aviation Group) to promote, with the French Civil Aviation Research Council, greater knowledge of biofuels for aviation and thus raise public authority awareness of the need to support a French biofuels industry. The airline is also actively participating in the establishment of the French national road map on aviation biofuels managed by the National Alliance for Coordination of Research on Energy (ANCRE);\n- -  in 2020, KLM continued to purchase 15,642/uni00A0liters of SAF for its V\u00e4xj\u00f6 (Sweden) flights, i.e. 5% of the total fuel use on all flights to/from this destination. Together with S\u00f6dra and the City of V\u00e4xj\u00f6, KLM and SkyNRG are investigating the feasibility of producing SAF locally;\n- -  in 2017, Air/uni00A0France signed an Engagement for Green Growth (Engagement pour la Croissance Verte - ECV) with the French Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition, the French Ministry of Transport and the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance, along with four other major French industrial companies (Airbus, Safran, Suez and Total). This Engagement for Green Growth aims to promote the emergence of sustainable aviation biofuel industries, in economically viable conditions that fully integrate circular economy principles. Its conclusions were published in January/uni00A02020, together\n\nwith a French governmental roadmap to set, on the basis of the ECV recommendations, the principles and ambition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel incorporation.\n\n- -  since July/uni00A02020, within the framework of calls for Expression of Interest, Air/uni00A0France has supported several new Sustainable Aviation Fuel production programs in France and elsewhere in Europe. By actively seeking industrial and logistics partners to combine forces in consortia, the Group is supporting all the innovative technologies, with alternative fuels originating from the circular economy (e.g. used cooking oils, wood residues, household waste, etc.) and, in future, synthetic fuels whose design is based on green electricity and carbon capture.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM forms part of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) coalition, which was established within the Global Economic Forum to ensure adequate supplies of SAF so as to be able to fly/uni00A0C O 2-neutral by the middle of this century. In cooperation with McKinsey & Company, the coalition compiled the Sustainable Aviation Fuels as a Pathway to Net-Zero Aviation Report, which focuses on themes such as feedstock availability and sustainability, production capacity and the technical possibilities of the most promising SAF production pathways. The coalition has also launched a joint policy proposal to accelerate the deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in Europe. This involves aligning on a proposed policy package to be submitted to the European Commission to inform a clearly-defined European strategy to increase the adoption of SAF.\n\n## Supporting regulatory incentives in France and the Netherlands, and at international level\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM are actively involved in the European Advanced Biofuels Flightpath initiative. They are also members of the ART Fuels Forum.\n\nFurthermore, Air/uni00A0France is participating in the Ini-FCA French Future Alternative Fuels Initiative, spearheaded by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC). With the Council for Civil Aeronautical Research (CORAC), the company is actively participating in formulating a sustainable biofuels strategy involving coordinated actions to further technological research and innovation towards the attainment of ecological transition objectives within a global context.\n\nKLM is actively involved in the BioPort Holland, a collaboration between the Dutch Government and several private parties with a collective ambition of launching sustainable aviation fuel production in the Netherlands.\n\n## Innovating in the supply chain\n\nKLM is one of the founders of SkyNRG, the worldwide market leader for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Since 2016, all KLM flights from Los Angeles airport have been operated with SAF produced by the local World Energy (former AltAir Fuels) refinery and supplied by SkyNRG. Additionally, KLM has purchased SAF for flights out of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. This sustainable fuel produced by Neste from used cooking oil will bridge the gap until the coming on stream of the SAF production plant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

KLM is the first airline in the world to invest in SAF on this scale. SkyNRG will develop Europe's first dedicated plant for the production of SAF. The construction of this facility, which is scheduled to open in 2022, is a concrete step towards fulfilling KLM's sustainability ambitions.\n\n## Involving customers and partners\n\nAs part of its WWF-Netherlands partnership and Green Deal commitment, in 2012 KLM launched the KLM Corporate BioFuel program, a first for aviation. In 2020, the program was also extended to Air/uni00A0France and regrouped the following partners: ABN Amro, Accenture, Arcadis B.V., Arcadis N.V., Loyens & Loe/ff, Air Tra/ffic Control The Netherlands (LVNL), Microsoft, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, Neste, the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR), PGGM, Schiphol Group, SHV Energy, S\u00f6dra, the University of Delft, Lavazza, Finco Fuel, Hans Grohe SE and IMS Gear.\n\nIn addition to the programme for corporate travellers, in 2020 Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Martinair (AFKLMP) Cargo launched the Cargo SAF Programme, enabling freight forwarders and shippers to also reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is currently making a substantial investment in innovation alongside scientists and participating in research projects, notably on hydrogen-based synthetic fuels, to support the future of aviation.\n\n## Operational measures\n\nWeight reduction: the lighter the aircraft, the less fuel it consumes. All the divisions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are working to reduce weight on board. This includes, for example, reducing the weight of seats, galley and service equipment, products such as paper documentation for cargo and flight decks, magazines and the loading of drinking water.\n\nRoute and flight path optimization: improvements in fuel e/fficiency are achieved through the optimization of routes, flight paths and altitudes, and a reduction in aircraft waiting times. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is proactively involved in the SESAR program, which contributes to the targets of the Single European Sky (SES) for the better management of air tra/ffic. SESAR aims to contribute to the SES's 10%/uni00A0CO2 reduction target by reducing fuel burn.\n\nFlight operations optimization: pilots apply, when possible, the most-fuel-e/fficient procedures: Flight Plan precision, speed adjustments and optimized trajectories, and, on the ground, taxiing with one engine shut down. New e/fficient tools based on artificial intelligence are being implemented, in partnership with innovative startups. For example, Transavia is partnering OpenAirlines, a start-up having been awarded the Solar Impulse\n\nE/fficient Solution label by Bertrand Piccard's Solar Impulse Foundation. The SkyBreathe tool enables the highly-precise tracking of the application of fuel-e/fficiency practices for each flight. Transavia was the first airline to deploy this solution in France and is pursuing its e/fforts on eco-flying. The airline has thus announced a new partnership with OpenAirlines for the roll-out of SkyBreathe OnBoard, a real-time, eco-flying solution. Lastly, with the deployment of the Optidirect tool, which proposes alternative flight routes enabling a reduction in fuel consumption, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group airline benefits from high-performance and innovative tools enabling a reduction in its inflight/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, KLM took advantage of the decline in activity linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis to appoint an energy e/fficiency team composed of pilots with more free time. This team conducted research into other fuel e/fficiency initiatives and established a plan to involve the pilot community. KLM data scientists also participated in a sustainable development hackathon focused on energy e/fficiency.\n\n## Mandatory/uni00A0CO2 compensation\n\nSince 2012, all intra-European flights have been subject to the application of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emission quotas (EU-ETS) (for the 2020 figures, see section/uni00A04.3.6/uni00A0'Environmental indicators table').\n\nThe global market-based mechanism established by the ICAO, known as CORSIA (Carbon O/ffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), aims to limit the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation by targeting carbon neutral growth relative to the 2020 baseline. In 2020, due to the impact of the public health crisis on aviation, the baseline was changed to 2019. Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the other IATA airline members are preparing for the implementation of this new system on January/uni00A01, 2021.\n\nFor the implementation of CORSIA, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group contributed to the calculation of the/uni00A0CO2 emission baseline data as of January/uni00A01, 2019. The implementation of CORSIA o/ffsetting will begin with a first phase from 2021 to 2026, based on the States volunteering to contribute: i.e. currently 88/uni00A0countries, representing around 77% of international aviation activity.\n\nThe European Union will implement the ICAO's CORSIA scheme within the framework of the current EU-ETS regulation for the scope of international flights. In this context, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considers that the same/uni00A0CO2 emissions should not be subject to both the EU-ETS and CORSIA. Assuming a change to the provisions of the EU-ETS, the Group is calling for a detailed impact study to be conducted on the envisaged amendments and is drawing attention to the need for the prior design of a carbon adjustment mechanism at the borders of the European Union, to protect the European airlines from 'carbon leakage'.",

        "page_content": "## Voluntary carbon o/ffsetting and support for environmental programs\n\n## Ground energy consumption\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM offer their individual and corporate customers the opportunity to o/ffset their/uni00A0CO2 emissions on a voluntary basis, by making/uni00A0CO2 emission calculators available to customers on their websites. These calculators are directly linked to an emission evaluation system, enabling passengers to o/ffset the carbon emissions associated with their travel, should they so wish.\n\nWith the Trip and Tree program, Air/uni00A0France is partnering the A Tree for You association which brings together, in total transparency, donors and tree-planting projects from all over the world. When purchasing a flight ticket, customers can volunteer to help the planet by making a donation in the amount of their choice to finance one of the tree-planting projects supported by the Trip and Tree program.\n\nKLM's CO2ZERO compensation service also enables passengers to o/ffset their carbon emissions. Customer contributions are invested directly in a carbon-offsetting project in Panama certified by the Gold Standard for the Global Goals label that focuses on planting new trees, preserving existing forests and supporting the local community. In 2020, the number of journeys booked including a/uni00A0CO2 compensation request declined owing to the reduction in activity and represented the purchase of 44,000/uni00A0tons of carbon credits.\n\nTransavia also o/ffers its customers the opportunity to o/ffset their/uni00A0CO2 emissions on a voluntary basis when booking thanks to the CO2ZERO program. Every month, between 5% and 8% of customers thus o/ffset their emissions. This figure has remained stable despite the Covid-19 public health crisis.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2020, Air/uni00A0France has been proactively o/ffsetting 100% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions generated by its domestic flights. This represents a daily average of more than 450/uni00A0flights. In cooperation with its partner EcoAct, this compensation takes the form of participation in projects certified by the highest international standards, and selected for their e/ffective contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their significant benefits for the local populations, to support reforestation, preserve forests and biodiversity, and develop renewable energies. Air/uni00A0France is one of the first airlines in the world to o/ffset the emissions generated by its domestic flights.\n\nLastly, Corporate customers can also volunteer to o/ffset up to 100% of the emissions generated on their short, medium and long-haul flights thanks to a dedicated o/ffer.\n\nFor more information on these programs see section 4.3.5/uni00A0'Biodiversity'.\n\nEnergy consumption in the ground operations, such as the fuel used by ground support equipment, gas for heating purposes and electricity for aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, generates direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and scope 2).\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM had been targeting a 20% improvement in ground operation energy e/fficiency by 2020 (relative to the 2011 level), by optimizing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable energies. Air/uni00A0France reached this target in 2017 and has pursued its initiatives to maintain and build on these results, despite the fluctuations in consumption linked to climate events.\n\nIn 2019, Air/uni00A0France and KLM set themselves a target of carbon-neutral ground operations by 2030. In 2020, the Group reduced its/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 17% compared to their 2019 level.\n\nWithin the framework of its zero-emission target for the ground operations by 2030, the Group pursued and stepped up its actions to reduce its energy consumption in 2020, by upgrading its equipment and including this target in supplier contracts with, notably, an energy-e/fficiency commitment based on a bonus/malus principle and the implementation of a five-year action plan aiming for carbon neutrality.\n\nIn 2020, a plan to rationalize the Group's floor area and di/fferent buildings also enabled an increase in the per/uni00A0m/two.sup utilization ratio and thus a reduction in the associated energy footprint. For example, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM sales teams for the French market moved to more suitable premises in central Montreuil. In November/uni00A02020, it was the turn of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM delegation in Dubai to move into its new LEED OR (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) ecological-excellence-certified permises.\n\nOther initiatives are based on the increased use of renewable energies. For example, at Toulouse and Valbonne in the south of France, where the bulk of the IT servers are located, 100% of the heating needs of the tertiary buildings are met by recycling the heat generated by the air conditioning system. Photovoltaic energy projects will be deployed in the Group's facilities at the Roissy-CDG head o/ffice.\n\n2020 was the last year of KLM's third multi-year energy e/fficiency agreement with the Dutch Ministry of Economic A/ffairs, aimed at increasing energy e/fficiency by at least 2% a year. To comply with the energy e/fficiency directive that replaces this agreement from January/uni00A01, 2021, KLM has begun the process to obtain ISO5001 certification for its energy management system.\n\nTo reduce fuel consumption, all the ramp equipment transporting baggage has been replaced by electrically-powered alternatives, thereby increasing the proportion of electrically-powered ground assistance equipment to 64% at Roissy-CDG airport. KLM has trialed electrical alternatives to the ground propulsion units, and push back and towing equipment. All this equipment is responsible for 72% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from ground equipment, meaning that pursuing these trials in 2021 o/ffers a promising path towards reducing direct emissions at the airport.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This aircraft towing vehicle can replace the use of aircraft engines during taxiing. The pilot project was realized to gather information on its feasibility, the impact on safety and capacity, and emission reductions.\n\n## Environmental management/ISO/uni00A014001/uni00A0certification\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM's Environmental Management Systems (EMS) have been ISO/uni00A014001/uni00A0certified, respectively, since 2008 and 1999, for all air and ground operations in France (metropolitan and Saint-Denis de La R\u00e9union and Papeete outstations) and the Netherlands. This certification was renewed for a three-year period in 2017 for Air/uni00A0France and in 2018 for KLM. Internal and external audits verify the e/ffective implementation of the Environmental Management System.\n\nIn addition to compliance with the regulations in force, the Environmental Management System is used to drive an improvement in environmental performance and innovation, both within the Group and at its suppliers.\n\n## Mobilizing partners and supporting research and development\n\nThe Group is mobilizing the industry and is committed to research and development into innovative solutions, in both design, aeronautical and engines maintenance and navigation tools, and in Sustainable Alternative Fuels.\n\nIn December/uni00A02019, Air/uni00A0France announced the signature of a partnership with the Solar Impulse Foundation, to promote the identification and rapid implementation of economically and ecologically-viable solutions for aviation. Air/uni00A0France and the Solar Impulse Foundation are calling for clean, e/fficient and profitable solutions to accelerate the ecological transition of the aviation sector. The PROGNOS solution, deployed by Air/uni00A0 France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance, has already obtained the Solar Impulse Label. This predictive analysis program is based on harnessing big data technologies to o/ffer an e/ffective and innovative aeronautics maintenance service. The environmental benefits of PROGNOS stem from reducing flight cancellations leading to extra flights to recover grounded passengers, as well as reducing the number of Quick\n\nReturn Flights (return of the aircraft to its departure airport) on technical alerts, which require fuel tanks to be emptied prior to landing. It also optimizes overall aircraft fuel consumption by monitoring the status of equipment more precisely.\n\nAt the end of 2019, Air/uni00A0France invited partners, experts, high-profile individuals, innovation players and business leaders to participate in a round table on the theme Acting Together For Responsible Travel (Agir Ensemble Pour un Voyage Responsable). In a series of figures and using concrete examples, this meeting was aimed at outlining the airline's commitments to reducing the impact of its activity on the environment and to mobilizing the players around responsible travel.\n\nIn 2019, TU Delft and KLM announced the start of the design of the Flying-V aircraft. The Flying-V is a design for a very-energy-e/fficient long-haul aircraft. The improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight of the aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today's most advanced aircraft. After extensive wind tunnel and ground tests, the first successful test flight with a scale model of the Flying-V took place in 2020.\n\n## Principles of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20 in December/uni00A02015 during the United Nations COP21 conference to draft recommendations for use by financial and non-financial companies in their public disclosure of the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities. These recommendations, which are applicable across all sectors and can be included in existing financial reports, aim to increase the transparency between companies and investors, thereby reducing investment risks and reconciling short-term financial decisions with the longer-term consequences of climate change.\n\nIn 2019, the Group realized the TCDF Climate Maturity Assessment developed by KPMG, to evaluate the concordance of its environmental reporting with the principles of the TCDF. The actions implemented by the Group are presented in the table below.\n\nAs a result, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided to become an o/fficial supporter of the TCFD principles with a commitment to continuing to improve its knowledge and reporting.",

The Group has formalized its commitment to noise mitigation by making it a requirement enshrined in The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles.\n\nFleet modernization and improved operational procedures are the two pillars of the Group's noise reduction strategy. All of the aircraft in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM fleet meet the criteria established by the ICAO Chapter/uni00A04/uni00A0Noise Standard, the most exacting standard covering the acoustic quality of civil aircraft. Fleet renewal enabled a 67% reduction in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's noise footprint between 2000 and 2020, whereas the number of aircraft movements increased by 46% over the same period.\n\nSpecific solutions are also sought to reduce the noise emissions from aircraft. Whenever possible, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM thus implements continuous descent or NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) procedures which significantly reduce noise pollution. The SESAR program also aims to improve the management of noise and its impact through precision landing procedures using satellite navigation and optimized flight paths, including optimized climb and descent operations.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nThanks to the actions implemented for several years, the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group reduced overall noise energy per movement (take-o/ff and landing) by 39% between 2000 and 2020.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM are committed to ensuring a permanent dialogue with stakeholders in all territories. They meet with the representatives of local communities, the airport authorities and air tra/ffic control to identify measures enabling a reduction in noise hindrance potentially a/ffecting the inhabitants of areas located near airports.\n\nIn 2020, KLM took part in the Minder Hinder (less hindrance) program with Schiphol and Air Tra/ffic Control The Netherlands to reduce noise hindrance and improve the quality of the local environment. KLM is committed to contributing to a 2% annual reduction in serious disruption around Schiphol airport and has undertaken to contribute to the government's and Schiphol's local emission reduction plans covering ultrafine particles and nitrogen. KLM will make a proportional reduction in its night flights from 32,000/uni00A0to 25,000/uni00A0at Schiphol in return for, amongst other conditions, an increase in the number of aircraft movements at Schiphol to 540,000, the opening of Lelystad airport and the development of rail replacement services for destinations like Brussels and D\u00fcsseldorf, the latter within the framework of the Air Rail program in which KLM participates.\n\nIn the Netherlands, KLM participates in Het Regioforum which addresses issues surrounding noise with the local community. In France, this dialogue is mainly conducted within the context\n\nof the CCEs (Environmental Consultative Commissions) and CCARs (Advisory Residents' Assistance Commissions) in which Air/uni00A0 France participates at all the French airports where it has operations.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has been actively involved in the Night Flights working group, overseen by the Prefect of the Paris-CDG airport region. This working Group has notably proposed new 'dead of night' continuous descent procedures and welcomed the voluntary retirement of noisy aircraft, including Air/uni00A0France's Boeing 747s. Air/uni00A0France rea/ffirmed this commitment with the announcement of the phase-out from the fleet of the Airbus A340s. In 2019, during the French National Air Transportation Debate (Assises du Transport A\u00e9rien), the government announced a commitment to the widespread application of continuous descent procedures in the medium-term (2023). Lastly, the punctuality of flights scheduled for late at night or early in the morning is the subject of a specific expert monitoring group.\n\nIn 2020, the Air/uni00A0France Group's (Air/uni00A0France, Air/uni00A0France HOP! and Transavia France) contribution to the Airport Noise Tax (TNSA) paid to the French State amounted to \u20ac10/uni00A0million. Its proceeds are allocated to the financing of sound-proofing for homes located around the main airports. Since the TSNA was put in place, around \u20ac770/uni00A0million has been allocated to the sound-proofing of housing, to which the Air/uni00A0France Group has made a substantial contribution.\n\nAround Schiphol airport, all the measures to reduce the noise footprint have been implemented. Over the past two decades, KLM has contributed most of the total \u20ac754/uni00A0million in noise taxes, devoted to the sound-proofing and compensation for loss of value in property around Schiphol airport.\n\n## Air quality\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group monitors its atmospheric emissions for both the flight and ground operations, including low altitude emissions which impact the quality of the air around airports. The indicators cover emissions of/uni00A0CO2,/uni00A0SO2 and/uni00A0NOx.\n\nMost of these gas and particle emissions come from aircraft movements. The remainder is produced by the ground operations and maintenance activities, airport logistics and road travel by passengers, employees and suppliers.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reduces its local emissions via a number of levers:\n\n- -  a modern fleet with more energy-e/fficient aircraft;\n- -  electric or more efficient ground vehicles and runway equipment, powered by cleaner fuels;\n- -  optimized operational procedures for the ground operations: taxiing time, taxiing using just one engine, the use of ground power units (GPUs) to ensure the functioning of on-board systems, replacing the Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) on kerosene-powered aircraft.",

For ground vehicles, hybrid petrol and electric engines are prioritized when renewing the fleet.\n\nThe replacement of the diesel engines on twelve conveyor belt vehicles with electric motors powered by a new type of lithium-ion batteries from recycled car batteries has enabled/uni00A0CO2 emissions to be reduced by 3/uni00A0tons per year and per conveyor belt. The company has set itself a target of 90% of its ramp vehicles and equipment to be electrically-powered by 2025.\n\nSimilarly, Air/uni00A0France is accelerating the use of electric power converters (ACUs) for the air conditioning of aircraft on the ground. This enables a reduction in emissions due to the use of thermal ACUs, APUs and GPUs.\n\nKLM increased the proportion of full-electric ground support equipment to 62% in 2020, thereby reducing/uni00A0CO2 and local emissions. For progress on the electrification strategy, see section/uni00A04.3.1/uni00A0'Ground energy consumption'. Since 2019, all the ground support equipment at Schiphol airport has been powered by Gas-to-Liquid (GTL), a transition initiated by KLM to ensure a substantial reduction in the related local emissions.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has participated in the Paris Region's Atmosphere Protection Plan since 2008 through its Mobility Plan and, at the outstations in the French provinces, has launched the roll-out of proprietary Mobility Plans.\n\nWith more than 80% of sta/ff commuting to work by car, the aim of the Mobility Plan is to reduce the pollutant emissions linked to their travel. This is thus a major challenge for the company, in terms of both the environment and health and safety in the workplace.\n\nIn 2020, the Air/uni00A0France Mobility Plans were based on the same actions as in 2019. However, these actions were pursued at a slower pace in view of the health situation. Remote working, which become mandatory to contend with the unfolding health emergency, was the main focus. The statistics for the results of this action are exceptional and are not representative: 13,175/uni00A0employees worked remotely in France during 2020, i.e. a 131% increase versus 2019. The related unrealized home-workplace commuting represented close to 26/uni00A0million kilometers and the avoidance of 6,912/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2.\n\nThe initiatives under way include the:\n\n- -  promotion of public transport;\n- -  implementation of charging terminals for electric vehicles in car parks;\n- -  participation in the development of the car share platform available free of charge to employees of Air/uni00A0France and those of sixteen other companies. In the French provinces, car sharing is also encouraged and supported;\n- -  raising employee awareness of the link between air quality and methods of commuting to/from work;\n- -  making temporary o/ffices available;\n- -  implementing collective initiatives with the other companies located at each work site to maximize the e/ffectiveness of the measures.\n\nOther avenues are also being studied like carpooling and the development of environmentally-friendly transportation methods like cycling.\n\nIn addition, a questionnaire was sent to all Ile de France employees in the last quarter of the year, aimed at understanding travel habits and envisaging adapted solutions for the post-crisis world. Analysis of this questionnaire will begin in early 2021.\n\n## 4.3.3/emspace Waste and the circular economy\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM handles many forms of waste, mostly arising from flight operations and maintenance, within a context of strict regulatory requirements. Across the entire supply chain, the Group strives to minimize waste and increase the proportion that is recycled or reprocessed.\n\nIn 2019, Air/uni00A0France and KLM set themselves a target of halving residual waste (non-recycled waste from the cabin and ground activities) by 2030 compared to 2011. In 2020, while the public health crisis caused operating disruption meaning that this result does not directly reflect its strategy, the Group reduced non-recycled waste by 56% compared to the 2011 baseline.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France had set itself a target of recycling or reprocessing 100% of non-hazardous waste and 60% of hazardous waste by\n\n2020. KLM achieved its 2020 target of reprocessing or recycling 100% of non-hazardous waste.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM base their actions on the four principles of the circular economy: rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\n## Inflight waste\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM run programs aimed at a constant improvement in the overall management of flight waste: waste prevention, increasing the recycled portion, the eco-design of products and the identification of appropriate reprocessing facilities, with the main goal being a reduction in residual waste. For example, a significant proportion of reusable obsolete equipment, like trays, drawers, blankets and trolleys, is recycled.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This sorting, realized on all the short, medium and long-haul flights bound for Paris, concerns plastic bottles, cardboard juice cartons and aluminium cans. The articles are sorted on board by the cabin crews then handled by Servair at Paris-CDG and Paris-Orly, before being recycled in France or elsewhere in Europe. Every year, some seven million bottles, three million juice cartons and six million cans are used on the company's flights. The possibility of expanding the initiative to flights on departure from Paris is being studied based on regulatory and process analyses at each destination.\n\nAt KLM, the use of less product packaging and overall product design have been a focus of e/fforts. In 2020, KLM was nominated for an Onboard Hospitality Award for the design of its closed loop food tray. The trays are washed and reused unless they are damaged in which case they are recycled by the supplier for the design of new trays.\n\nOn all the European flights, on-board waste is sorted and the trolleys have been adapted to collect plastic and cardboard cups. Glass, cans, aluminum lids, paper, EPS boxes, PET plastic bottles and other forms of plastic are also sorted and recycled by the catering teams.\n\nWhether for reasons of hygiene and food safety, or to reduce the weight embarked, the inflight service uses a substantial quantity of single-use plastic products (SUPs). The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to reducing the environmental impact of SUP in its operations. The Group achieves this via a number of levers: by eliminating SUPs wherever possible; by replacing these plastics with other materials if more sustainable alternatives are available (based on Life Cycle Assessments or other environmental proofs); by redesigning SUP items to decrease material use; and by using recycled plastic or ensuring SUPs are recycled wherever possible.\n\nIn 2019, to reduce its environmental footprint, Air/uni00A0France set itself a target of replacing 80% of single-use plastic items with sustainable alternatives between now and 2025, while respecting the airline regulations and health requirements. At the end of 2019, Air/uni00A0France progressively eliminated 210/uni00A0million single-use plastic items, i.e. 1,300/uni00A0tons (100/uni00A0million plastic cups replaced by cardboard versions, 85/uni00A0million plastic cutlery items replaced by versions manufactured and packaged using bio-based materials, 25/uni00A0million plastic stirrers replaced by wood versions).\n\nIn 2019, Transavia also committed to the progressive and significant reduction of single-use plastic items on board its aircraft by proposing, on its scheduled flights, certified alternatives to single-use plastic (Duty Free bags in Kraft paper and cups, stirrers and cutlery kits of plant origin, etc.). In total, more than seven million single-use plastic items are no longer distributed each year on the scheduled flights, or 41/uni00A0tons of plastic.\n\n## Action to combat food waste and food insecurity\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM handles food waste from flight operations in the respect of a permanent commitment to guaranteeing food safety and security, within a context of strict regulation. The regulations vary depending on the context of each station and are often very exacting, like the European Regulation requiring the incineration of any elements potentially having been in contact with foods of animal origin for flights arriving from outside the EU.\n\nTwo main levers enable a reduction in food waste: the adjustment of the catering embarked on flights and a strict policy of merchandise inventory management.\n\nBased on statistics and historic flight load factors, and on passenger habits, the number of meals actually embarked is regularly re-evaluated. This re-evaluation prevents waste arising and reduces both production and transportation costs, and overall wastage. This also reduces the onboard weight, resulting in lower/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nHowever, due to the impact of the Covid-19 public health crisis causing disruption to flight schedules and resulting in unpredictable load factors, these measures have been temporarily suspended. New measures have been established and will be implemented as soon as there is return to a higher volume of flight operations.\n\nThanks to technological developments, the pre-selection of the hot meal in the Business cabin has been available since early 2020. These adaptations help to limit the amount of food and disposable cutlery waste, and to reduce the mass embarked on board.\n\nRethinking some offers also contributes to a reduction in food waste. In 2019, the kit containing a stirrer and sachets of sugar and creamer was revisited. It was decided to leave out the creamer and o/ffer this to passengers on request, thereby avoiding the embarkation and wastage of around 30/uni00A0tons of products per year.\n\nDuring the public health crisis, the sudden and significant reduction in the number of flights led to the non-consumption of many food products. Thousands of articles were thus donated to charitable associations like the L'Agence du Don en Nature, Les Restaurants du C\u0153ur, Le Samu Social, Les \u0152uvres de la Mie de Pain, the Food Bank and a number of hospitals across France. The inventory management policy has also been revised in cooperation with the catering suppliers to optimise the ordering and storage of perishable products.\n\nA key indicator is in place to track the waste avoided thanks to the policy governing the loading of food services on board and is calculated every quarter. Meetings of the steering bodies are held annually during which a summary presentation is made on the donations along with updates on combating waste and the tracking indicator, with a view to a continuous improvement.",

        "page_content": "Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Martinair Cargo is active in the perishable goods transportation segment. The teams maintain a permanent relationship with all the players in the value chain (producers, exporters, importers, supermarkets, airport authorities, etc.) to promote sustainable development in the agricultural and air transportation sectors. Numerous initiatives are under way: joint communication actions with the Paris-CDG plant protection department and exporter customers, an improvement in perishable goods handling capacity and management of the cold chain, etc. The Group is also a member of the Cold Chain association and contributes to its work on reducing food waste. Within this framework, 2019 saw the definition of the priority measures to be implemented for the sustainable development of air-shipped exports of West African mangoes, at both technical (combatting fruit flies which degrade the quality of the fruit) and logistical level (improvement in airport infrastructures, notably at Burkina Faso and in Senegal, and verification procedures at Paris-CDG).\n\n## Aeronautical waste\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM have a procedure in place for recycling metal aeronautical waste. Wherever possible, the cradle-to-cradle principle is applied to reintegrate waste in a new production cycle. The process foresees procedures to reuse and recycle spare parts. This program has been extended to other types of waste: furniture, equipment, pallets and blankets.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, the move up-market for the medium and long-haul cabins with the installation of new seats has been accompanied by the implementation of a recycling and dismantling process for the old seats ranging from the reuse and recycling of components to the recovery of foams and metals.\n\nHazardous waste from the maintenance activities is the subject of a comprehensive tracing system and its management is harmonized in the di/fferent maintenance sites. This approach is also reflected in the optimized management of suppliers and costs, and the search for more relevant solutions in the light of regulatory changes. In 2020, KLM employees revisited the key points in the collection of hazardous and non-hazardous waste\n\n## 4.3.4/emspace Biodiversity\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe impact of air transportation on biodiversity is linked to the e/ffects of climate change induced by the/uni00A0CO2 emissions that it generates. The Group supports a number of projects and initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity around its hubs and destinations.\n\nin the hangers and implemented an awareness-raising campaign to involve all employees in attaining the waste reduction target for 2030.\n\n## Promoting the principles of the circular economy\n\nThe companies are working on initiatives to up-cycle waste for new uses like, for example, the recycling of used uniforms.\n\nA permanent recycling system is in place for Air/uni00A0France uniforms and work clothing. Sta/ff are invited to adopt good recycling practice by depositing uniforms and work clothing in secure containers in the Air/uni00A0France premises. Uniforms are collected (30.2/uni00A0tons of textiles since September/uni00A02018 at the Roissy site) from the various sites and are recovered by di/fferent partners including a French Support and Work Assistance Establishment (ESAT for the employment of disabled workers), before subsequently being up-cycled. Uniforms are thus up-cycled via the help of energy recovery in the form of textile pellets while the ashes are used in the manufacturing of cement. In addition, employees have launched the 100% Uniforms initiative to recycle these uniforms into other products such as a new collection of non-aeronautic accessories (pouches, etc.).\n\nTo avoid the destruction of products and promote their reuse, in January/uni00A02017 Air/uni00A0France signed a framework agreement with the Agence du Don en Nature (ADN). By donating new, re-modeled and recycled products like crockery and blankets, Air/uni00A0 France supports the work of the ADN association which collects and redistributes new non-food everyday products to combat exclusion in France. In 2019, during the upgrade to Air/uni00A0France's cabin decor, more than 25,000/uni00A0blankets in Business were donated to ADN. In addition, on termination of the Joon operations, more than 6,500/uni00A0items of Joon uniforms were recycled via a donation to the SAMU Social organization.\n\nKLM sorts over 14/uni00A0types of waste, with wood, plastic and metal being its main residual forms. In cooperation with its partners, KLM for example up-cycles old cargo straps into bags, pillows and laptop cases, recycles uniform fibers into cabin carpets, furniture and KLM goodies, and up-cycles old furniture.\n\nThe investment in other projects, aimed at advancing knowledge and preserving biodiversity, also contributes to a better understanding of the issues associated with ecosystem services like sustainable biofuel production. Although certain types of biofuel for road transportation can have a negative impact on biodiversity, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is committed to guaranteeing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels with the lowest possible impact on the food chain and biodiversity, and a positive impact on local communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

On purchase of a flight ticket, customers have the opportunity to make a donation in the amount of their choice to reduce their environmental footprint and contribute to a reforestation project in France and across the world. Having been selected by a committee of recognized and independent experts, these projects also include a citizenship dimension with the creation of jobs in these countries.\n\nAt the end of 2020, more than 38,000/uni00A0donors had contributed to the comprehensive financing of 25/uni00A0projects across four continents, i.e. more than 200,000/uni00A0trees planted.\n\n## Supporting projects via the o/ffsetting of domestic flights\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2020, Air/uni00A0France customers have been able to undertake carbon-neutral travel in mainland France thanks to a proactive scheme to compensate 100% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions on the airline's domestic flights. In liaison with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this o/ffsetting scheme takes the form of a contribution to reforestation, forest preservation and biodiversity projects, and those dedicated to the development of renewable energies, while guaranteeing the protection of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nEight first projects across four continents (France, Brazil, Peru, Cambodia, India and Kenya) were selected and launched with EcoAct, a pioneer in carbon o/ffsetting in France.\n\nFor the ninth project, Air/uni00A0France offered its customers the opportunity to become players in this scheme by voting on line for their preferred project. Three projects were proposed (a forestry preservation project in Brazil, a photovoltaic program in Senegal and a bio-gas from waste production program in Vietnam). The forestry preservation program in Brazil received the largest number of the 27,000/uni00A0votes cast and now figures in Air/uni00A0France's portfolio of carbon o/ffsetting projects.\n\nAll the projects selected have received the highest certification standards in the voluntary carbon o/ffset market, The Gold Standard, VERRA's VCS and CCBA's additional CCB standard.\n\n## CO2ZERO program\n\nSince 2008, KLM has contributed to preserving and restoring forests via its CO2ZERO-projects in Panama and a number of African countries. The Gold Standard for the Global Goals-certified project in Panama, CO2OL Tropical Mix, turns formerly degraded pasture land into mixed forestry by planting a blend of mainly native tree and some exotic species. In addition to the numerous environmental benefits such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration, the project's activities enable skills development and the creation of long-term employment with\n\na sustainable source of income for the local population which improves their living conditions.\n\nSince January/uni00A02020, Transavia has also o/ffered its customers this service.\n\n## An association to promote the preservation of biodiversity in the areas around airports\n\nGoing against the tide of received wisdom, airports are home to enclosed and protected areas: their grasslands constitute a preserved environment which hosts a rich and sometimes remarkable level of biodiversity, thereby contributing to the development of the local ecosystem.\n\nThis is why the scientific community, public administrations and aviation players all come together around common and shared objectives: expanding knowledge, improving and promoting biodiversity in airport spaces in the respect of the safety requirements.\n\nCreated in 2015 after two years of preliminary studies, the A\u00e9ro Biodiversit\u00e9 association (ex-HOP! Biodiversit\u00e9) is thus tasked with evaluating and highlighting airport biodiversity, identifying best practices and acting as the link between the industry players to promote more responsible management of biodiversity while taking into account the operational constraints.\n\nThe work takes place within a methodological framework scientifically approved by the French Natural History Museum, a member of the association. They involve local employees thanks to the protocols of the participatory sciences. The data amassed supplements the national databases of knowledge on biodiversity. While always giving priority to aviation safety - the French Civil Aviation Authority (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile) is also a member of the association - this work shows that It is possible to enrich the biodiversity of the relevant spaces by, for example, practicing the appropriate strategies (mowing management, elimination of crop protection products, etc.).\n\nAt the end of 2020, the association brought together three airline members (Air/uni00A0France, Air Corsica, Air Saint-Pierre) and 18/uni00A0active airports (including five ADP Group sites). All of them have included this project in their sustainable development policies while the in-field engagement was recognized in respect of the French National Biodiversity Strategy (Strat\u00e9gie Nationale pour la Biodiversit\u00e9 - SNB) in 2016-17.\n\nSince 2013, more than 2,900/uni00A0plant and animal species have been recorded on the land of partners in France, including 252/uni00A0species of birds. As active members, Air/uni00A0France and the ADP Group ensure the continuity of the work and contribute to its promotion to employees and the general public through awareness-raising forums, citizenship days and participative observation exercizes with employees, school children and the general public (more than 900/uni00A0people reached in 2019 through the initiatives carried out with the association).\n\n## Contributing to combating the tra/ffic in protected species\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM are signatories of the Buckingham Palace Declaration which formalizes their resolute commitment to combating illegal trading in protected species.",

(KLC), Martinair and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nFor the ground operations, the consolidation scope for the environmental reporting covers nearly 100% of the sites in France and the Netherlands (some very small subsidiaries being excluded). The international stations are not taken into account (partially for the French Overseas Departments and Territories).\n\n- -  The Air/uni00A0France consolidated subsidiaries: HOP!, CRMA, Sodexi, Blue Link and Transavia France.\n\nFurthermore, for Air/uni00A0France, the indicators in the French stations are not reported when there is no detail available on the charges invoiced by airports. The contribution from the relevant stations is, however, marginal compared with the reported data.\n\n- -  The KLM consolidated subsidiaries: KLC (KLM Cityhopper), KES (KLM Equipment Services), KCS (KLM Catering Services), KHS (KLM Health Services), Transavia Netherlands, Martinair and EPCOR (for a portion of the indicators).\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThe environmental indicators are assembled at local level via di/fferent reporting tools: Osyris (Enablon software), Tennaxia for waste, SAP finance (invoicing) for Air/uni00A0France and CaeSaR for KLM.\n\nThe reliability of the reporting process is supported by definitions of each indicator and tool user guides made available to the contributors. Consistency tests have also been implemented.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's environmental data is carried out by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Sustainability & Compliance department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level, the regulatory requirements and the reporting and consolidation principles are outlined in a joint document which is updated annually.\n\nWithin the framework of an improvement-based approach, methodological details are provided on some indicators, and particularly on their definitions. When these changes have a significant impact on the data, comparison with the figures for previous years is not meaningful.\n\nWhen the data is not available, the figure reported for the year (N) is estimated based on the value reported for the previous year (N-1).\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's environmental data is based on a rolling twelve-month period from October/uni00A01/uni00A0N-1/uni00A0until September/uni00A030/uni00A0N.\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Comments on changes in the indicators\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 public health crisis had a very material impact on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activity and results. Border closures, health measures to be respected for travel and a climate of international alarm devastated the air transport industry. Thus, all the published indicators have been impacted and do not reflect Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term commitments and its environmental performance in recent years.\n\nWhile kerosene consumption and carbon emissions may have been reduced by nearly 50% in 2020 (as with/uni00A0NOx, LTO and noise hindrance), the carbon footprint (in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passenger kilometer) deteriorated given the redeployment of the network and a collapse in the load factor (from 87% in 2019 to 65% in 2020). This indicator returned to its 2005 level. Note also that, in 2020, passenger tra/ffic collapsed by more than 70% and the outlook looks similar for 2021. To a lesser extent, the indicators for the ground operations were also impacted by this major crisis.\n\n## CO2 e/fficiency per passenger kilometer\n\nThe operational/uni00A0CO2 e/fficiency is expressed as grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passenger kilometer. It is calculated using the actual jet fuel consumed and the number of passengers flown over the actual flight distance planned. For international flights, the fuel burned is divided between passengers and cargo based on mass. The distance used is the flight distance planned which is on average around 6% longer than the great circle distance due to various restrictions (no fly zones, local air tra/ffic control, weather conditions, etc.). The standard mass for a passenger plus luggage amounts to 100kg (ICAO-standard).",

        "page_content": "The fuel e/fficiency with the market-based measures compares the e/fficiency of the current year with the value in 2005. The actual/uni00A0CO2 from mandatory and voluntary o/ffsetting is deducted, as well as the/uni00A0CO2 emission savings from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The mandatory offsetting per calendar year is based on an estimate since the final data will be reported after the publication of this document. To determine the/uni00A0CO2 o/ffsetting, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM deducts the free allowances from the total/uni00A0CO2 emissions subject to the EU ETS.\n\n## CO2 emissions from ground operations\n\nThe/uni00A0C O 2 emissions from the ground operations include all scope 1 and 2/uni00A0emissions at locations in France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Non-recycled waste\n\nThe total non-recycled waste is defined as the total waste disposed (Eural D code) plus incinerated waste (Eural R1 code).\n\n## Noise footprint\n\nThe trend in noise energy and tra/ffic is determined by comparing the total noise energy calculated for the reporting period with the value for the year 2000. The number of movements and the noise energy per aircraft are the main parameters of this indicator.\n\n## Comments on changes in the environmental indicators\n\n## Carbon emissions\n\nThe direct and indirect/uni00A0CO2 emissions are reported in line with the greenhouse gas Protocol. Since 2017, scope 3/uni00A0emissions have been reported. These are solely based on the reported scope 3/uni00A0emissions from the flight operations (upstream emissions from Jet fuel). According to Ademe, the/uni00A0CO2 emissions correspond to 98% of all the greenhouse gasses.\n\n## Scope 1 - Aviation fuel\n\nThe scope 1/uni00A0emissions generated by the combustion of aviation fuel are reported for all the kerosene used in Air Framce-KLM's flight operations. The used emission factor of 3.16/uni00A0kg/uni00A0CO2 per kg kerosene is in line with the emission factor from the ICAO CORSIA (Carbon O/ffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Note that there are di/fferences between the scope of the reported/uni00A0CO2 emissions and those in the EU ETS for greenhouse gas emission quotas, so comparison is not meaningful.\n\n## Scope 1 -/uni00A0CO2 savings from Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThe/uni00A0C O 2 savings from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are calculated based on the specific percentage/uni00A0CO2 saving for the particular SAF batch and the total volume purchased.\n\n## Scope 1 - Ground operations\n\nThe direct emissions from the ground operations are based on the consumption of energy coming from di/fferent sources and\n\ntheir corresponding emissions= factors. The factors are based on national standards or are delivered by the energy supplier.\n\n## Scope 2 - Electricity\n\nThe emissions from electricity use are based on the consumption volume and the corresponding emission factors. The/uni00A0CO2 saving from purchasing Certificates of Origin for renewable electricity are subtracted from the total.\n\nThe electricity supply is 100% renewable for KLM.\n\n## Scope 3 - Upstream emissions from fuel production\n\nThese emissions are generated during the production, transportation and distribution of kerosene. The emission factor for scope 3/uni00A0calculations is the ICAO full life cycle GHG emissions factor (89gCO2e/MJ for jet fuel A1).\n\n## O/ffsetting - Mandatory carbon o/ffsets\n\nThe volume of reported mandatory carbon o/ffsets is based on the annual reporting of the EU ETS and, in future, of CORSIA. Free allowances and the trading costs are excluded.\n\n## O/ffsetting - Voluntary carbon o/ffsets\n\nThe volume of voluntary carbon o/ffsets is calculated based on the calendar year. Voluntary/uni00A0CO2 compensation paid by customers is not included. The reported o/ffsets are purchased and paid by Air/uni00A0France and KLM (for example for duty trips and 100% of/uni00A0CO2 emissions from domestic flights at Air/uni00A0France as of January/uni00A02020) and are Gold Standard Certified.\n\n## O/ffsetting - Customer carbon o/ffsets\n\nThe volume of voluntary carbon o/ffsets is calculated based on the calendar year. This concerns the voluntary/uni00A0CO2 compensation paid by customers via the Air/uni00A0France and KLM o/ffsetting programs.\n\n## Flight operations\n\n## Consumption of raw materials - Conventional Aviation Fuel\n\nThis is the actual conventional aviation fuel consumption for each flight. It includes the fuel consumption for the use of the APU.\n\n## Consumption of raw materials - Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThis is the quantity of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) purchased during the reporting period.\n\n## Fuel e/fficiency -/uni00A0CO2 emissions for passenger transportation\n\nThe fuel efficiency is expressed in both liters of fuel per passenger-kilometer and in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passengerkilometer. The calculation is based on an allocation of fuel between passengers and cargo. The fuel consumption for passengers is divided by the RPKs and adjusted by the Flight Plan distance/ground circle distance ratio. The/uni00A0CO2 emissions for passengers are based on fuel use, from which are deducted the/uni00A0CO2 savings from SAF use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The calculation is based on an allocation of fuel between passengers and cargo. The fuel consumption for cargo is divided by 0.1TK and adjusted by the Flight Plan distance/ground circle distance ratio. The/uni00A0CO2 emissions for cargo are based on fuel use, from which are deducted the/uni00A0CO2 savings from the use of SAF.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0NOx low altitude\n\nThe methodology used for the calculation of low-altitude emissions (i.e. below 3,000/uni00A0feet) is common to Air/uni00A0France and KLM. It is based on the LTO (Landing-Take O/ff) cycle and on engine data communicated by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). The taxiing time taken into account is the actual taxiing time, which is more precise than the standard values recommended by the ICAO methodology. Note that, since the actual taxiing time is not available for Transavia France, the standard ICAO values have been used for this subsidiary.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0SO2 low altitude\n\nNote: the 'low altitude' and 'LTO' for Landing-Take O/ff cycle denominations are equivalent.\n\nThe calculation of the/uni00A0SO2 emissions from flight operations is based on the average sulfur content of the fuel loaded, respectively, on the Amsterdam and Paris platforms which is applied, respectively, to all fuel used during the year by KLM and its subsidiaries, and by Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Noise impact - Global noise energy indicator\n\nThe total noise energy indicator is calculated according to the methodology defined by the DGAC (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Aviation Civile or French Civil Aviation Authority). The flights concerned are those which are operated, franchised and chartered under the AF or KLM codes, with the exception of code shares.\n\n## Ground operations\n\n## Consumption - Electricity (of which renewable)\n\nThis is the total volume of electricity use in/uni00A0MWh. For KLM the volume of renewable electricity is based on the purchase of EU Certificates of Origin coming from wind energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Fuels\n\nThe total volume of fuel use for the ground operations includes:\n\n- -  kerosene (Jet fuel A1) for testing engines;\n- -  non-road diesel fuel for the Air/uni00A0France runway equipment;\n- -  gasoline, diesel and GTL for the ground support equipment.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Natural gas\n\nThe total quantity of natural gas is mainly used for heating buildings, maintenance hangars and cargo warehouses. The conversion factor for the quantity of gas used is based on the characteristics of the gas specific to France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Steam/other heating/ cooling (of which renewable)\n\nThis includes superheated and iced water for climate comfort. For Air/uni00A0France, superheated and iced water is supplied by ADP (A\u00e9roports de Paris) at the Orly and Roissy sites. The KLM facilities do not consume this type of energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other: Water consumption\n\nThe consumption of water is taken into account for all the ground activities. The water used on board the aircraft is not included.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0NOx\n\nThe/uni00A0NOx emissions related to engine testing are calculated based on a methodology similar to the one used for Flight Operations, which reflects the actual testing conditions. Other sources of/uni00A0NOx include combustion by ground support vehicles and runway equipment. For Air/uni00A0France, the calculation is based on the European standards EURO 1/uni00A0to 6 for light vehicles, and Stage I to IV for diesel engines (European Directive 97/68/EC for non-road mobile machinery), setting the emission limits based on engine power. For KLM, the/uni00A0NOx emissions from gas installations and vehicles are determined by direct measurements, from manufacturer data or external databases.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0SO2\n\nThe calculation of the/uni00A0SO2 emissions is based on the average sulfur content of kerosene used in engine testing and the fuel used to power the ground vehicles and runway equipment. The change in/uni00A0SO2 emissions is mainly explained by the variations in sulfur content from one year to the next.\n\n## Waste - Non-hazardous industrial waste and percentage recycled\n\nNon-hazardous waste is monitored and reported by specialized waste management suppliers. The KLM scope includes KLM Catering Services and thus includes catering waste, unlike the Air/uni00A0France scope. The reported percentage of recycled non-hazardous waste covers all waste that is collected separately for recycling purposes. The recycling percentage does not cover the waste that is incinerated with energy recovery (EURAL R1 code).",

Customer satisfaction is notably measured through the Net Promoter Score (NPS), the reference indicator driving customer recommendations. Performance indicators and tools have been developed to track the results on a daily basis.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is above all based on their trust in the Group's activities. As a responsible airline Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM must ensure the safety and health of its customers, employees and partners. This commitment covers flight safety, health security, the safety of the food services o/ffered on board and in the lounges, the protection of personal data and also occupational health and safety (see section/uni00A04.2.3). The Group is also committed to facilitating access to its products and services, particularly for passengers with disabilities or those with reduced mobility.\n\n| Key Performance   Indicator   | Definition                                            | Companies             | 20/19  variation   | 2020   target   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Net Promoter Scores           | Change in the NPS (expressed as an annual             | Air/uni00A0France     | +13/uni00A0pts     | Yes             |\n| (NPS)                         | average) of Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Transavia (France | KLM                   | +12/uni00A0pt      | Yes             |\n| (NPS)                         | and the Netherlands) between 2019 and 2020            | Transavia France      | +20/uni00A0pt      | Yes             |\n| (NPS)                         | Achievement of the 2020 target                        | Transavia Netherlands | +6/uni00A0pt       | Yes             |\n\n## Definition\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (or NPS) is a recommendation indicator given by customers to the products and services of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia (France and the Netherlands) in their capacity as airlines, ranging from 0/uni00A0to 10 (0/uni00A0corresponding to 'I will definitely not recommend' and 10/uni00A0to 'I will definitively recommend'. Corresponds to the difference between the percentage of promoter customers (scores 9 and 10) and the percentage of customers critical of the brand (scores 0/uni00A0to 6). This concerns the response to the first question asked in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's e-Score online customer satisfaction questionnaire: 'Based on\n\nyour opinion and experience, how likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/KLM/Transavia to your friends/colleagues?'.\n\nFor each brand, the indicator measured is the annual change in the NPS (calculated as an annual average). Note that, since they are reported via two di/fferent measurement tools, the Net Promoter Scores for Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands cannot be consolidated.\n\nFor each brand, whether or not the annual target has been achieved is also indicated.\n\n## 4.4.1/emspace Operational safety for stakeholders\n\n## Flight safety\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFlight Safety is paramount for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. It is key to retaining the trust of both customers and sta/ff, and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations and of air transportation as a whole.\n\nWithin a context of crisis and a changing environment, the Group does whatever it takes to maintain the highest level of Flight Safety thanks to its Safety Management System and by supporting its Flight Safety players through specific measures.\n\nAll of the Group's activities are subject to numerous checks and certifications, in particular via the supervisory actions carried out by the Civil Aviation authorities in each country and via the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational Safety Audit is a benchmark within the industry. Air/uni00A0France and KLM's IOSA certifications were last renewed in 2019; the renewal audit for KLM was successfully executed in 2020 and the renewal of the certification is scheduled for 2021.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 in chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management'.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nTo achieve the highest attainable standard of Flight Safety, each company updates and reinforces its Safety Management System (SMS) which concretely defines the modalities in place to manage aviation risks.\n\n## Management of Flight Safety risks\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM both use the evaluation method for operational risks recommended by the European Aviation Safety Agency. They have deployed this method in all the operational entities and at all levels of the business. The management of Flight Safety risks, notably through systems compiling flight parameters and situation reports, enables threats to be identified, risks to be evaluated, the implementation of remedial measures and the monitoring of the results obtained. It enables proactive management of the risks to maintain them below the level that is deemed acceptable to the responsible management and monitored by the Corporate Safety Department. An internal",

        "page_content": "quality assurance procedure continuously evaluates the proper functioning of Flight Safety Risk Management.\n\nMore broadly, Air/uni00A0France develops synergies between an array of progress-oriented and risk management approaches - Flight Safety, Health & Safety in the Workplace, Customer Service Quality, Operational Performance, Environmental & Sustainable Development, Food Safety & Hygiene. This quality-based approach is the vector for the steering and management of the businesses, aimed at a continuous improvement in results.\n\nKLM deploys a similar approach. The company is building on the best safety and security practices through an Integrated Safety Managment System (ISMS), a working environment of continuous learning and improvement, and independent oversight of the four safety domains: operational, occupational, environmental safety and operational security. KLM thereby continuously aims to improve its industry-leading, risk and performance-based Safety Management System in which risk-based decisions can be taken by the responsible management at all levels within KLM. The ISMS is outlined in KLM's Integrated Safety Management Manual (ISMM) and has been approved by the Dutch Civil Aviation authorities as part of the Air Operator Certificate.\n\nKLM's Safety Culture program, which includes promotion, communication, training and learning interventions, is embedded throughout the company to enhance safety awareness and the relevant safe attitude and behavior at all levels.\n\nThe specific situation linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis saw the Group realize safety studies aimed at identifying the risks generated by the situation and defining risk mitigation measures enabling the level of safety to be maintained. These actions form part of the international cooperation framework via, notably, participation in the work of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Flight Safety Foundation, and by generating synergies within the SkyTeam alliance and sharing information with the partner airlines.\n\n## Governance\n\nCorporate Flight Safety Committees, chaired by the Executive Vice-Presidents responsible for the operational entities, meet every quarter within Air/uni00A0France. Their task is to approve the action plans established to apply the orientations set by the companies, the results of inquiries and the results of supervisory acts.\n\nThese committees are also tasked with sharing information on the emergence of new Flight Safety issues originating from feedback or risk analysis, by ensuring that the resources and action plans in place are adapted to the issues.\n\nFlight Safety Committee meetings are also held four times a year at the level of each company, to evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the existing action plans.\n\nAt KLM, the Corporate Safety Committee within the KLM Board of Directors meets every quarter to analyze the Safety Indicators. In 2020, KLM continued its focus on Occupational Safety hazards by renewing the main Occupational Safety Policy to provide structure for the required mitigating action. However, the main focus in 2020 was the Covid-19 pandemic. Occupational risk analyses were performed on the transmission of the virus followed by the implementation of mitigating measures. All working environments, whether these be aircraft, o/ffices or operational work spaces, have been set up to facilitate a safe working and living environment. Safety Action Groups (SAGs), chaired by the Nominated Persons and/or Head of Divisions are in place across the company with, at the highest level, the Corporate Safety Action Group chaired by the COO and Accountable Manager. The SAGs decide on the safety action plans and are held either weekly or fortnightly.\n\nIn cooperation with the aviation industry stakeholders at Schiphol Airport, like the airport authorities and Dutch Air Tra/ffic Control, KLM has carried out a number of joint safety risk assessments and conducted mitigating actions to improve safety around the airport. These activities were carried out within the joint sector Integrated Safety Management System, a unique collaboration between the aviation players at the airport which was established in 2018.\n\nFurthermore, in that flight safety is an absolute priority for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the flight safety KPIs, results and measures in place to mitigate the impact of the risks.\n\n## Developing a Safety-first culture\n\nBuilding a company-wide awareness of the prerequisite for a safety-first culture across all the operations is a gradual yet ongoing approach aimed at raising the ambition of the airlines in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Vocational training is a cornerstone of this culture and thus primarily takes into account the skills and expertise to be acquired in matters of safety: safety training for pilots and cabin crews, training relating to the maintenance professions and ground operations.\n\nThe quintessential idea that concerns all employees is a comprehensive safety awareness and a safe working environment, both physical and mental/social. Everyone working in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group should feel safe and free to report mistakes and incidents, even caused by themselves. By embracing a Just Culture we learn, develop and improve on a permanent basis.\n\nKLM is further embedding safety in the attitude of every employee and the execution of every function by making safety awareness an integral part of every 'onboarding' and 'cross boarding' program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence the launch of the Safety Attitude program at the end of 2018, aimed at further reinforcing this culture and promoting industry best practices. The Safety Attitude program began with a comparative study of five benchmark companies, supplemented by a diagnostic phase carried out by an independent body. 22,500/uni00A0employees from all the Air/uni00A0France business lines replied to a questionnaire and more than 600/uni00A0people were interviewed. This in-depth diagnostic enabled the identification of areas for work that will federate all employees around a shared Safety-first Culture embedded in operations, based on transparency and trust. In 2020, the implementation process continued with the involvement of sta/ff and the various divisions to maintain a culture of transparency, respect of the procedures, evaluation of non-technical skills and inter-business-line exchanges.\n\nTo this end, a three-year program of concrete actions adapted to each business line has been structured: mobilization of the line management, a culture of transparency, respect of the procedures, evaluation of non-technical skills and inter-business-line exchanges.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nNo accidents or serious incidents took place during 2020. The drafting of reports rate on Flight Safety events by employees was in line with the objective set, thus contributing to the e/ffective functioning of the Safety Management System.\n\nThe measures taken during the resumption of operations post the first lockdown to reduce the risk associated with a low level of activity have born fruit. Vigilance nonetheless remains the order of the day hence the launch of a new safety study. The Flight Safety network teams are mobilized to analyse the signals coming from the Safety Management System and to take the appropriate action. The current Flight Safety indicators show no deterioration in the level of flight safety.\n\n## Health security and commercial measures\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nIn 2020, the world had to contend with one of the gravest public health emergencies in its history, a/ffecting all populations across all continents. As of the emergence of Covid-19, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group implemented never-before-seen measures to guarantee the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff.\n\nFurthermore, unprecedented commercial measures were put in place by the Group's airlines to enable their customers to plan their travel with peace of mind.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nKLM, Transavia and Air/uni00A0France under its new label Air/uni00A0France Protect have implemented specific measures at each stage of the\n\ncustomer journey guaranteeing the strictest health conditions. Since June/uni00A01, 2020, the wearing of an FFP1, 2 or 3/uni00A0surgical mask has thus been mandatory as of arrival at the airport and on board the aircraft for the whole duration of the flight. For their protection and that of customers, all employees are also equipped with masks.\n\nAt the airport, posters, announcements and floor signage remind people of the physical distancing measures. All the sales, check-in and boarding counters are equipped with plexigras protective screens. The check-in counters and self-service kiosks are regularly disinfected. Hydroalcoholic gel dispensers are available throughout the customer journey. Body temperature checks may be implemented on the departure of certain flights.\n\nAll the health measures are also implemented in the lounges: hydroalcoholic gel dispenser at the entrance, mandatory wearing of masks, organized physical distrancing and cleaning of all surfaces. The bu/ffet, bar, beauty treatment and children's spaces have been adapted or closed.\n\nOn board, prior to every departure, all the aircraft are thoroughly cleaned: vacuuming of carpets, seats and headrests. All contact surfaces (tablets, armrests, entertainment screens, remote controls, baggage racks, windows and toilets) are cleaned and disinfected. Furthermore, the aircraft are equipped with air recycling systems consisting of HEPA (High E/fficiency Particulate Air) filters, identical to those used in operating theaters, which trap 99.9% of particles. The air is thus renewed every three minutes.\n\nDuring the lockdown phases in Europe, the inflight service was adapted to minimize contact. The teams received detailed instructions and new procedures to be able to work in safety and guarantee respect of the new standards. Lastly, the press and magazine o/ffer and inflight sales was suspended.\n\nSince the onset of the public health crisis, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has adapted its communication to support customers and help them plan their travel. To facilitate customers in the event of unforeseen developments, the Group's airlines have adapted their commercial policies with the booking of 100% flexible tickets, postponement and reimbursement solutions, and special commercial measures to enable a maximum amount of flexibility.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Air/uni00A0France Protect measures, customers were rapidly consulted to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the hygiene measures deployed throughout the customer journey and their in-flight experiences. Since June/uni00A02020, they have thus been invited to complete a questionnaire.\n\nNearly 90% of Air/uni00A0France customers say they are satisfied or very satisfied with the measures in place and approaching 60% reply that they felt comfortable during their journeys; around 23% say they are enthusiastic/happy; feelings of aggravation, anxiety or stress are reported by 8.5% of the customers polled.",

        "page_content": "## Operational measures to take into account the impact of climate change\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor air transportation, the impacts of climate change could have consequences for the routes and destinations served. In particular, the more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events could a/ffect the safety of flight operations and service continuity (re-routing, flight cancellations and delays, etc.) causing disruption for customers.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nSince they are present across all continents, the Group's airlines already operate in all weather conditions. They have thus already deployed the procedures and resources to ensure operations in extreme climate conditions. Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia have developed special training programs for employees on the management of emergency situations.\n\nThe companies also work in cooperation with airports to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions and, in such circumstances, deploy commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel should they so wish, or change their destinations.\n\nLastly, the size of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM network, with services balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility obtained through fleet composition, are all valuable assets when it comes to minimizing the economic and commercial consequences of these impacts, and adapting flight schedules to market requirements.\n\n## Food safety\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to guaranteeing food services that are safe for its customers and flight crews. As the years go by the relevant regulations are becoming increasingly exacting. This is why food safety is a key priority for the Group. Air/uni00A0France and KLM both deploy quality-control procedures to fulfil these requirements.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nThe management system is based on four processes, steered by a centralized unit within Air/uni00A0France. The first process is cross-cutting and applies to the whole risk area: regulatory intelligence, risk analysis and definition of the measures to mitigate these risks, sta/ff training, establishment and updating of the reference standards, monitoring of the action plans, etc. The three other processes are operational and are detailed based on the activity: on board services, water on board and services o/ffered in the lounges.\n\nThe management measures are deployed by a Food Safety specialist in each relevant entity: procurement, air operations, ground services, maintenance, operations, international stations, logistics and flight product, etc. They are the guarantors that the measures have been applied within their business lines and report back on functioning together with the associated action plans. The management measures are regularly monitored through indicators and decision-making committees ensuring the e/ffectiveness of the provisions in place relating to Food Safety.\n\nDespite the significant reduction in the number of flights linked to the public health crisis, the monitoring of Air/uni00A0France's catering suppliers has been maintained while adapting the model. Food safety audits have continued for some catering suppliers. In-house microbiological checks, water analyses and temperature checks have been maintained proportional to the Air/uni00A0France flight schedule.\n\nAt KLM, risk control relating to food safety is managed in several di/fferent ways. Firstly, all KLM caterers are audited at least once a year by an external company, specialized in food safety for inflight catering. These audits are executed by specially-trained auditors, and are unannounced and on-site. The audits verify compliance with the QSAI Food Processing Safety and Food Processing Quality standards, based on the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) principles. E-audits are conducted to verify the exhaustiveness and e/ffectiveness of the traceability within all KLM caterers.\n\nIn addition, all food product suppliers are referenced based on very strict specifications and are the subject of close microbiological monitoring, carried out by KLM's in-house ISO/uni00A017025-accredited laboratory.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nBack in 2006, Air/uni00A0France became the first airline in the world to attain ISO/uni00A022000/uni00A0certification. An annual audit carried out by an external body verifies that the management system complies with the standard and with the regulatory requirements. In 2020, in response to the standard's new requirements, Air/uni00A0France made some changes to its management system which were approved by an external audit in November/uni00A02020. Internal audits are also realized based on a three-year plan across all the relevant business lines.\n\nA series of key indicators, one per operational process, form part of a monthly dashboard presented to the Executive Committee. Any malfunctioning flagged, notably, by flight crews or customers, is also studied to be able to implement remedial and/or preventive measures. Throughout the year, several meetings of in-house steering bodies are held, enabling the monitoring of current events in this area and the tracking of performance via indicators and action plans, with a view to ensuring a continuous improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Privacy and data protection constitutes a major operational and financial challenge for the business, and for customer trust.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group manages its cybersecurity risks in liaison with the national authorities and cooperates with the relevant European agencies (EASA, ENISA). Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also takes part in the cybersecurity working groups of the main professional airline associations (IATA, A4E, etc.) and contributes to research by associations specialized in cybersecurity (CLUSIF, CESIN, CIGREF, R2GS, European Aviation ISAC).\n\nPermanent benchmarking and an independent cyber rating agency enable Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to be compared with other companies in the air transportation industry. In December/uni00A02019, the Group was ranked amongst the leading large companies. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also calls on the expertise of leading consultants in the cybersecurity market and actively cooperates with companies with which its Information System is connected.\n\nTo offer the best level of protection on the ground and in the air, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has developed four major cybersecurity programs in recent years:\n\n- -  a program directed at more effective cybersecurity techniques, to adapt to the evolving cyber threats;\n- -  an awareness-raising program for all sta/ff;\n- -  a program to ensure regulatory compliance;\n- -  a program to support the digital transformation to o/ffer a simplified user experience.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nAn annual presentation on these programs is made to the Group Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, guaranteeing sponsorship at the highest level of the company. These programs are supported by Cybersecurity Governance composed of:\n\n- -  a cybersecurity regulatory framework for ground IT and onboard systems (safety policy based on a series of international ISO/uni00A027000/uni00A0regulations and other standards or regulations concerning Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activities);\n- -  an annual monitoring plan for risks linked to the digital technologies (audits) and testing of the Cyber Crisis mechanism overseen by the Operations Control Center and the Authorities;\n\n- -  three management committees with complementary perspectives. The Group's IT Executive Committee notably evaluates the coherence between the cyber risks and investment in IT. The Cyber Plane Committee, chaired by the Accountable Manager, decides on the orientations to be adopted to reduce the potential cyber risks for Flight Safety. Lastly, the Safety Performance Committee, chaired by the Head of Safety, evaluates the e/ffective mitigation of generic safety risks, including cybersecurity;\n- -  a report on the residual cybersecurity risk in the major operational risk sheets managed by Internal Control.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.3 in chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management'.\n\n## Data privacy\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nIn force since May/uni00A025, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect personal data firstly extended the rights of data subjects and, secondly, strengthened the accountability and obligations for data controllers, requiring proof of compliance on personal data protection.\n\nTo respond to the GDPR requirements, in 2018 Air/uni00A0France and KLM deployed a broad-ranging program to reinforce their cybersecurity policies and define a strengthened personal data management framework to ensure compliance with privacy by design and by default principles.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nIn 2020, based on a Customer Digital audit, several key points were identified which can also be applied more generally to data privacy governance:\n\n- -  several steps forward were achieved on improving progress monitoring within a sole governance framework with, notably, the implementation of improved meeting structures and a dashboard;\n- -  the register of processing activities was finalized and aligned between Air/uni00A0France and KLM;\n- -  the roll-out of a privacy tool, suspended in March/uni00A02020 owing to the public health crisis, resumed in November/uni00A02020;\n- -  the data breach procedure was also reinforced in 2020.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThe overall e/ffectiveness of the privacy compliance framework is assessed on a regular basis thanks to a dedicated Internal Audit program. This framework was improved and reinforced in 2019 and 2020. An ex post audit will be carried out to ensure the adequacy of the improvements made.",

Passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility (PDRM) are welcome, providing that air travel is not counter to medical advice.\n\nThis calls for the appropriate assistance involving a degree of complexity owing, notably, to the di/fferences between EU and US regulations. In the US, the responsibility falls solely to the airline and there are no reporting requirements for US citizens and passengers on flights to/from the US. In the European Union, however, the airport authority is responsible for the end-to-end assistance of PDRMs during their journeys through airports and customers are invited to transmit this information to the airline 48/uni00A0hours before departure, the airline then being responsible for forwarding this information to the airport authority 36/uni00A0hours prior to departure. At Paris-CDG, for example, where more than 80% of PDRM passengers are traveling with Air/uni00A0France, Paris A\u00e9roport (ADP Group) oversees special assistance for Air/uni00A0France passengers via its Passerelle CDG and Samsic service providers. At Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport, PDRM assistance is supplied by Axxicom Airport Caddy.\n\nFor disabled and reduced mobility (PDRM) customers, within the context of the public health crisis, the airlines have reinforced their protocols to guarantee their health and well-being (wheelchairs disinfected daily and after every use, the wearing of masks and gloves by airport assistance personnel, etc.). Lastly, all the communication channels are updated to help customers comply with all the travel conditions (entry documents, tests, etc.).\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France dedicated assistance service for passengers with reduced mobility, known as Saphir (Service d'Assistance aux Personnes Handicap\u00e9es pour les Informations et la R\u00e9servation), o/ffers an array of adapted services, such as facilitated booking procedures, airport assistance, baggage assistance and special equipment on board. With some twenty dedicated advisors, Saphir fielded around 56,000/uni00A0calls in 2020: telephone and online services enable ticket bookings and the provision of the appropriate assistance. A special telephone assistance service for the hard of hearing or deaf customers is also o/ffered. Nineteen other Customer Relations Centers around the world are able to process requests from our PDRM customers via business partner, Acc\u00e9o.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has also long partnered multiple associations dedicated to disability and has forged strong links with national and European bodies in this field, to cooperate on the design and development of service improvements.\n\nKLM Cares is a dedicated service assisting PDRM customers with the planning and booking of flights. At the airport and on board, KLM o/ffers specially-adapted facilities and equipment to ensure a seamless travel experience.\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM cabin crews are specially trained in the assistance needs of customers with disabilities and have received specific instructions to contend with the public health crisis.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThe number of people with disabilities or reduced mobility flying with the Group is growing year after year. Despite the Covid-19 public health crisis, nearly 215,000/uni00A0PDRM customers traveled with Air/uni00A0France in 2020, more than 78% of whom were looked after at Roissy-CDG.\n\nWith around 127,000/uni00A0PDRM passengers flying KLM, the breakdown in the nature of the requests in 2020 was similar to 2019 (+/- 1.1%). In early 2020, the increasing trend in the number of wheelchair assistance requests continued, showing year-on-year growth of about 10%. Due to Covid-19, this trend finally stabilized leading to figures very similar to those of 2019: 94% of PDRM customers requested wheelchair assistance, of whom about half requested the most basic service (for customers unable to walk long distances).\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, a Key Customer Club with PDRM passengers has been created. Their feedback has helped to improve certain services, particularly better information, both up-stream and during the journey, for both customers and frontline sta/ff, in terms of Air/uni00A0France's Attentive Relationship.\n\nOther new initiatives have also been deployed, such as the upgraded pages on the Air/uni00A0France and KLM websites devoted to PDRMs, providing a wealth of travel tips and pushing tailored information to all passengers based on their type of disability.\n\nFor customer-facing staff, onboard and at the airport, awareness-raising workshops focusing on the appropriate forms of words and actions to adopt with PDRM customers have been launched, together with IT tools to facilitate their care.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes, in particular, respect for Human Rights and the fight against corruption, tax fraud and tax evasion.\n\nAs a signatory of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact since 2003, the Group supports its ten principles and actively promotes them with partners and suppliers.\n\n2020\n\nThe measured indicator is the number of employees having completed the entire training program as of December/uni00A031, 2020 divided by the total number of employees invited to undertake this training. The training is considered to have been completed if the individual passes the test with a score of at least 70%.\n\n## Further guidance on business conduct\n\nThe importance of respecting ethical principles in everyday business conduct is underscored in a number of documents. For issues applying to all employees, like combating corruption and promoting fair competition, training programs, manuals and other forms of information sources are brought to their attention while there are specific codes for certain functions like, for example, procurement. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Anti-Bribery Manual, supported by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Gift & Hospitality policy, is publicly available on the airfranceklm.com website.\n\nFollowing the publication of recommendations from the French Anti-Corruption Agency (AFA) on September/uni00A011, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is currently updating its Gift & Hospitality policy and has clarified other policies such as those relating to conflicts of interest and facilitation payments.\n\nThe Procurement divisions have contributed to the establishment of a Sustainable Development Charter for suppliers. As the application of ethical, social and environmental principles constitutes an important criterion when selecting suppliers, the latter must confirm their respect of these principles. This Charter has been supplemented by a Supplier Code of Conduct which specifies the commitments on Human Rights, health and safety, the environment and ethics.\n\n| Key Performance Indicator                                        | Definition                                                                                                            | 2019   results   | results   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|\n| Realization rate of the e-learning  program on the prevention of | Number of employees having completed the entire training  program as of December/uni00A031, 2020 divided by the total |                  |           |\n| corruption                                                       | number of employees invited to undertake this training                                                                | 86%              | 85%       |\n\nDefinition\n\nScope: Target group of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees.\n\nFor the target group of employees, the training is mandatory.

Its aim is to rea/ffirm to all employees the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual trust, respect, transparency and confidentiality in a work environment where health, safety and the quality of life is a major priority on which there may be no compromise. The Principles apply above all to every employee in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, including those on part-time and temporary contracts. They serve as a shared foundation for all the companies within the Group and support new initiatives, procedures, rules, and Codes of Conduct. This 'The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles' document was developed in cooperation with the European Works Council.\n\nFor the most part, these Principles apply to all Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM stakeholders irrespective of their form and the Group encourages all its customers, shareholders, business partners and local communities to respect them.",

Every employee of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has the right to working conditions that respect their health, safety and dignity, and guarantee a social dialogue.\n\nWithin the framework of its activities, the Group has identified the risk factors relating to Human Rights. The measures put in place to mitigate these risks fall into a number of di/fferent areas: health and safety of individuals, equal opportunity, achieving\n\n## 4.5.3/emspace Business  ethics\n\n## Fair business practice\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe prevention of bribery and anti-competitive behavior is an important factor in honest and fair business practice. As unethical or inappropriate behavior can have considerable negative consequences, both financial and in terms of the Group's reputation, preventing unfair practices is key.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's commitment to conducting business in good faith, founded on equity, transparency, honesty and integrity, and in the strict respect of the anti-corruption laws in all the countries where its companies or subsidiaries exercise their activities, is a/ffirmed in The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles and in the Anti-Bribery Manual. This Manual acts as a Code of Conduct for all employees and establishes the guidelines for preventing corruption, and for identifying and handling at-risk situations with regard to the anti-corruption legislation.\n\nSince 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been required to comply with the French Sapin II Act (Act No.2016-1691) and has accordingly improved its anti-bribery compliance program. Work is ongoing on improving its e/ffectiveness within the Group. For example, the Anti-Bribery Manual and the Gift & Hospitality Policy were both updated and supplemented in 2020. This Policy aims to provide clear guidelines for sta/ff, including financial limits, on giving and receiving gifts and hospitality. Both the Anti-Bribery Manual and the Gift & Hospitality Policy documents are available in three languages and can be consulted by sta/ff on the intranet sites.\n\na better work/life balance and data protection procedures to protect the personal data of customers and employees (see sections 4.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.6.3).\n\nIn its relationships with suppliers, the Group is committed to ensuring that the fundamental principles and social rights are properly respected, everywhere in the world. Suppliers are invited to sign a Sustainable Development Charter based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (see sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3).\n\nAir/uni00A0France carries out awareness-raising actions for its employees on human tra/fficking, to help them to identify at-risk situations and take action against this form of international organized crime, comparable with modern-day slavery. Whether it is tra/fficking for the purpose of forced labor or crime, sexual exploitation, illegal adoption or forced marriage, child soldiers, organ tra/fficking or other forms of human exploitation, the ground sta/ff and flight crews must be able to recognize behavior that may be considered abnormal or worrying and, in the event of suspected human tra/fficking, report the event as soon as possible and in accordance with the instructions. These actions were initiated in 2019 will continue in 2021.\n\nIn terms of anti-competitive practices, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is developing its policy aimed at the prevention of anti-competitive acts by circulating to sta/ff a Competition Law Compliance Manual which was updated in 2020.\n\nThe KLM Group has adopted a Code of Conduct which stipulates all the rules governing the activities exercised by the KLM Group and its suppliers. The KLM Code of Conduct covers the following areas: Safety, Business Integrity, Social Responsibility and reporting violations. The KLM Group has also deployed a Code of Ethics for the Finance Function.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nCompliance program and governance bodies: The Compliance activities are based on compliance programs, executed within the context of a formalized framework. New legislation or requirements relating, for example, to anti-bribery or data privacy are taken into account when establishing the compliance programs and their increased appropriation is ensured via, amongst other initiatives, awareness-raising campaigns, and dedicated processes or projects which are organized to ensure compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Compliance Officers within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Compliance programs within the Group. They are supported by a network of compliance correspondants in the activities or departments and subsidiaries. Depending on the type of business transaction and the complexity within the activities or departments and entities, subject matter experts and compliance correspondants facilitate compliance with specific legislation and the roll-out of the relevant elements of the compliance program.\n\nTraining and awareness: The compliance program is mainly based on training and awareness-raising. Matters that require greater awareness and transcend businesses, like the prevention of bribery and anti-competitive behavior, are the subject of information campaigns. These campaigns are supplemented by dedicated training which is available to individual employees. Employees can also raise questions or concerns with the Compliance O/fficers and legal experts.\n\nWhistle-blower procedure: Since all employees are required to respect these rules, employees in all the Group's entities are encouraged to discuss any compliance concerns with their line managers. They can also contact a Compliance O/fficer directly. Employees also have the option of flagging any issues via the Whistle Blower procedures. These procedures also include the possibility of reporting any serious situations relating to the duty of vigilance (Human Rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety, environment), pursuant to the regulation in force.\n\nBefore entering into any undertakings and during commercial relationships with customers, suppliers and intermediaries ('Third Parties'), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group ensures that the compliance and fair business conduct rules are duly respected through an evaluation by a third party.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nAn anti-bribery e-learning training campaign has been deployed to maintain and reinforce the anti-bribery awareness and knowledge of sta/ff. At the end of 2020, the realization rate for this training reached 85%. Awareness is also reinforced through, for example, information meetings and discussions, improved access to compliance documents and regular communication by the Group's General Management.\n\nReports under the Whistleblowing procedures are investigated and the appropriate corrective actions are taken and implemented.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n## Tax strategy\n\n## Group tax policy\n\nThe foundations of the tax policy implemented by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are based on three key principles: Compliance, Transparency and Risk Management.\n\n## Compliance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recognises the important role fiscal compliance plays in its strategy and undertakes to act with integrity and transparency in all tax matters.\n\nThe Group's tax policy aims to act at all times in accordance with the applicable local and international laws (bilateral tax treaties, OECD and UN guidelines), and to prevent tax evasion. Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM complies with the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan and files all the required transfer pricing documents, including a Country-by-Country Report. Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM complies with the letter and spirit of the tax law and regulations wherever the Group has a taxable presence.\n\nPursuant to the specific guidelines relating to the taxation of international air transportation services, wherein operational income is taxed in the country of domicile, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM appropriately reports most of its airline income in France and the Netherlands. Specific local taxation rules require the Group to also report a relatively small portion in foreign jurisdictions where the Group operates.\n\nTax returns are filed in a timely and accurate manner that meets the fiscal obligations of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to the tax authorities and taxes due are paid on time.\n\n## Transparency\n\nTax is an integral part of the Finance function within Air/uni00A0France and KLM and supports Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's corporate strategy. Tax a/ffairs are managed in a way which takes into account the Group's corporate values. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM seeks to establish and maintain an open and constructive dialogue with the tax authorities and other government bodies. The Group participates in the development of tax policies by contributing constructive inputs to public consultations.\n\nOn March/uni00A014, 2019, a fiscal partnership was signed between the French tax authorities and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the consolidating entity of the French tax group. This partnership is aimed at improving the relationship with the French tax authorities within the framework of the day-to-day operations and ongoing tax audits.",

In the event of an elevated or severe risk, suppliers must be assessed by the CSR rating agency EcoVadis or an equivalent body on the following four themes: environmental, social, ethical and responsible purchasing. All other suppliers are invited to carry out this evaluation on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe indicator measured is the number of suppliers evaluated by EcoVadis or an equivalent body (end December of the reference year).\n\n## 4.6.1/emspace Local  development\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Group's direct and indirect activities contribute to economic development at national level in France and the Netherlands, and in particular around its Paris and Amsterdam hubs. These hubs o/ffer multiple connecting oppportunities in Europe and with the rest of the world, and are part of an extensive, high-quality network that generates an attractive business environment. According to an Opinionway survey of international investors carried out in 2019, the presence of a hub o/ffering direct and frequent international connections is the second most important criterion in choosing a location.\n\nWith more than 90% of the Group's employees based in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a significant contributor to direct job creation in the regions around its two main hubs. With more than three-quarters of the jobs linked to sub-contracting located in Europe, the Group's activities also generate numerous indirect and induced jobs: assistance and catering in the outstations, cleaning and sub-contracted services required for the operation of an aircraft.\n\nThe hubs create highly-attractive business environments while airport proximity leads to the development of other activities (hotels, conferences, company show-rooms, commercial and marketing functions, business services and activities linked to innovation).\n\nAs the number one air operator carrying international tourists visiting France, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM makes a significant contribution towards promoting France and the Netherlands as destinations, and to the development of tourism.\n\nKLM's extensive network has contributed to making the Netherlands an attractive location for both Dutch and international companies. The Air/uni00A0France Group, with operations at 43/uni00A0French airports (in mainland France and overseas), reinforces the appeal of the regions and contributes to the growth in local activity (more than \u20ac710/uni00A0million of contractual procurement).\n\nHistorically, the Group has also played an active role in promoting international development, particularly through its support of NGOs and projects sponsored by its own employees.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\n## Contributing to national and local development\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has supported the development of small and medium-sized companies to which it entrusts a significant part of its procurement. The Group also promotes innovation and working with start-ups via its involvement in initiatives such as the creation of an innovation counter, and participation in special business incubators.",

        "page_content": "At local level, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are involved in various initiatives to promote sustainable development, and build human capital and the attractiveness of the territories around their hubs. Air/uni00A0 France is working in cooperation with local o/fficials and companies as a member of the Board of the Club des Acteurs du Grand Roissy. This association aims to foster harmonious and balanced development of the Grand Roissy area, in synergy with the airport platform, and to promote public transport, housing and infrastructure projects that are vital to the development of this area.\n\nIn 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was significantly impacted by the consequences of the Covid-19 public health crisis. It nonetheless maintained an intensive dialogue with stakeholders at both local and national level to adapt and optimize its schedule, operations and network to take into account, as far as possible, the expectations and connectivity needs of the regions. During the various lockdown phases, particularly in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia thus maintained a minimum schedule enabling the repatriation of fellow French and Dutch compatriots, and ensuring the basic needs for regional access and connectivity. Furthermore, the Air/uni00A0France Group maintained territorial continuity between France and the overseas departments and territories, while the whole Group mobilized around operating the air bridge for the transportation of masks and medical equipment.\n\n## Creating social impact\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM support initiatives enabling the development of skills, the vocational integration of young people and the social inclusion of vulnerable individuals. This also includes promoting access to training leading to professions in the airline industry, through numerous associations and educational programs for young people.\n\nAir/uni00A0France is a founder member and partner of four associations involved in information and training programs on aviation careers (AirEmploi, Jeremy, AFMA\u00e9, and Engineers for Schools). The company organizes skills sponsorship initiatives by mobilizing its in-house teams and leveraging the expertise of associations like Nos Quartiers ont du Talent, Article 1 and Tous En Stage, an association for which Air/uni00A0France was a founder member. Tous En Stage organizes multi-company internships for school children in the regions (mainland France, French Overseas Departments and Territories) and young people with disabilities.\n\nThe KLM Group supports a number of educational programs to attract and develop future talent through collaboration with ROCs, Schiphol Aviation College, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and the JINC foundation. The KLM Maintenance division o/ffers internships to students training for the aeronautical mechanics professions: around 75/uni00A0students from MBO College Airport and 25/uni00A0students from higher professional or university education benefited from internships at KLM in 2020. KLM is also pursuing its partnership with Schiphol Aviation College.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM continue to support workers with disabilities by using companies in the sheltered and adapted sector for multiple projects (e.g. upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board), and by entrusting them with highly-critical services\n\n(four sheltered sector suppliers work with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM IT department).\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM support employee citizenship initiatives. In 2020, the third Air/uni00A0France Citizenship Day took place involving 2,000/uni00A0employees who volunteered to assist 66/uni00A0associations in 12/uni00A0French regions around six areas for action: supporting children in need, education-training-employment, disability and health, combating insecurity, the environment and intergenerational solidarity. Despite the public health crisis, one third of the actions went ahead as planned.\n\n## Social partnerships\n\nAir/uni00A0France provides practical support to development projects through five long-standing partnerships: the Air/uni00A0France Corporate Foundation, the Air/uni00A0France Humanitarian Aid Department, Acting for Life, Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Gawad Kalinga.\n\nIn 2020, the Air/uni00A0France Foundation adapted its projects while pursuing its primary objective: supporting children. The long-standing projects on the themes of education for sick, disabled and vulnerable children are being pursued and now include environmental issues. The Foundation finances educational projects contributing to fostering new kinds of behavior and increased understanding of climate issues, together with training and awareness-raising projects on sustainable practices respecting natural resources.\n\nIn this particularly challenging year, the Air/uni00A0France Foundation also supported six projects directly linked to the social and health crisis while o/ffering Air/uni00A0France employees the opportunity to get involved. In 2020, the Air/uni00A0France Foundation was active in 36/uni00A0 projects and 18/uni00A0countries with 110,000/uni00A0beneficiaries. The Friends of the Air/uni00A0France Foundation network mobilises more than 4,800/uni00A0employees around di/fferent volunteer working, skills-sharing and donation-based initiatives.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Humanitarian Aid Department supported 27/uni00A0NGOs helping children in need of medical care. In response to the 2020 health situation linked to Covid-19, 157/uni00A0tickets were issued for the transportation of medical teams and the repatriation of sick children. Furthermore, within this same context, free carriage of excess baggage was also o/ffered to more than 19/uni00A0NGOs for the transportation of medical and emergency equipment.\n\nIn 2020, Acting for Life, which Air/uni00A0France has partnered for more than forty years, ran 26/uni00A0development projects in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Oceania. Acting for Life is involved in the promotion of sustainable social and economic territorial development.\n\nThanks to the financial support and transportation facilities donated by Air/uni00A0France, the emergency aid organization Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res accompanied more than 400/uni00A0sick children on the airline's flights and shipped nearly 4,500/uni00A0packages of medecines and minor medical supplies to 26/uni00A0destinations. In addition, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Flying Blue loyalty program enables Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res to benefit from numerous miles, thereby notably reducing the transportation costs incurred in accompanying sick children. There are many active and retired Air/uni00A0France employees amongst the Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res teams of volunteers. This year, as of the onset of the public health crisis, many of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This initiative, supported by Transavia employees, organizes holidays for young people between the ages of 13 and 20/uni00A0years who are unable to enjoy a 'normal' holiday due to illness or di/fficult circumstances. Transavia also works closely with JINC, an organization that arranges activities for children from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds. Transavia employees are invited and encouraged to actively participate in these initiatives during which children notably visit companies to gain valuable insight into the working world and its functioning, and become familiar with the concept of networking. These initiatives illustrate the Transavia conviction that 'Everybody deserves to be seen' and contribute to a more inclusive society.\n\nFor several years, Transavia has supported the Louis Carlesimo association, enabling sick children to travel on its flights. Every year, between 50 and 80/uni00A0children have the opportunity to travel to Lapland and meet Father Christmas on the outbound flight as part of a magical and unforgettable experience with the airline. In 2020, due to the public health crisis, this journey was not possible. However, Transavia donated Christmas gifts to children in the Villejuif and Bic\u00eatre hospitals.\n\nTransavia also supports the men and women combating diseases via its commitment to associations like Les H\u00f4tesses de l'Air Contre le Cancer and Les Hommes de l'Air. In October/uni00A02020, Transavia operated a special flight in the colors of the Les H\u00f4tesses de l'Air Contre le Cancer association while, in November/uni00A02020, this operation was repeated for the Les Hommes de l'Air association, the aim of these initiatives also being to raise customer awareness.\n\nSince 2019, Transavia has fostered diversity by supporting Personn'Ailes, Air/uni00A0France's LGBT and gay-friendly association. On December/uni00A02, 2020, Transavia organized a special flight to raise awareness of the fight against AIDS.\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France has been involved in promoting sustainable and responsible tourism within the travel profession ecosystem, and particularly the most proactive like Agir Pour Un Tourisme Responsible (ATR). Air/uni00A0France also acts as an information conduit on the devastation caused by child sex tourism, by financing ECPAT International's prevention campaign and handing out literature on the airline's long-haul flights. During 2020, ECPAT and Air/uni00A0France had to release additional resources to provide support for local centers treating children sick with Covid-19.\n\nIn the event of natural disasters, Transavia, Air/uni00A0France and KLM Cargo participate in the shipment of emergency equipment. Thus, in solidarity with Lebanon which su/ffered substantial damage from two explosions, more than 15/uni00A0tons of donations collected by sta/ff volunteers were carried and delivered to the\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM delegation in Beirut, which redistributed them to local associations.\n\nKLM works in partnership with Wings of Support and six other organizations: WWF, the Ocean Cleanup, Close the Gap, the Red Cross, UNICEF and Giro555. In 2019, the Wings of Support Foundation was the main charity to be backed by KLM, with KLM flight crews and ground sta/ff having been actively involved in the Foundation's projects. In 2020, Wings of Support assisted more than 100/uni00A0projects in 17/uni00A0countries worldwide.\n\nLastly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM customers who are members of the Flying Blue loyalty program are o/ffered the opportunity to donate their Miles to 18/uni00A0NGOs selected by Air/uni00A0France and KLM. In 2020, 119/uni00A0million Miles were donated to NGOs. Furthermore, in a one-o/ff campaign for medical sta/ff realized during June/uni00A02020, 130/uni00A0million Miles were donated to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Hospitali\u00e8re de France (FHF), i.e. 2,463/uni00A0beneficiaries, and 128/uni00A0million Miles to Verpleegkundigen & Verzorgenden Nederland (V&VN), i.e. 2,000/uni00A0beneficiaries.\n\n## Solidarity chain linked to the public health crisis\n\nThe global public health crisis caused by Covid-19 led to the largest repatriation operation ever seen worldwide: Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia operated more than 5,200/uni00A0flights enabling the repatriation of more than 500,000/uni00A0fellow European compatriots. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group mobilized and worked in close cooperation with the competent government departments to identify and prioritize the needs in the di/fferent countries, in liaison with the embassies and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM representations across the world.\n\nThe Group also actively participated in the air bridge between China and Europe for the transportation of masks and medical equipment with, for example, the operation of seven flights a week in Air/uni00A0France's Boeing 777 and Boeing 777 cargo aircraft.\n\nAs of the onset of the crisis, across all the divisions and professions, and at all levels of the business, multiple personal and collective solidarity initiatives have taken place in support of medical sta/ff and/or individuals a/ffected by the virus and its economic consequencies. Several thousand comfort and well-being articles initially intended for customers were donated in over twenty hospitals across France: in total, more than 17,000/uni00A0amenity bags and thousands of sleeping masks and ear plugs were donated to intensive care patients and nursing sta/ff, along with 20,000/uni00A0kits containing basic items and audit headsets originally intended for inflight entertainment. Numerous food items normally o/ffered to customers and unused given the collapse in activity were donated to charitable associations like L'Agence du Don en Nature, Les Restaurants du C\u0153ur, Le Samu Social, Les \u0152uvres de la Mie de Pain and the Food Bank. Six thousand five hundred meal boxes for customers in the event of service disruption (substantial delay, cancellation, etc.) were distributed to Restos du C\u0153ur, thus avoiding food wastage.",

        "page_content": "## Results and performance\n\n## National and regional economic impact\n\nIn France:\n\nEconomic impact in France, according to an EM Strasbourg research report published in early 2020 on the basis of 2019 figures (pre-Covid-19):\n\n- -  \u20ac40/uni00A0billion positive economic impact attributable to the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's activity, representing 1.6% of French GDP;\n- -  475,000/uni00A0FTE jobs depend on the Group's activity;\n- -  for every job created by the Group, 8.7/uni00A0jobs are created in the French economy;\n- -  for every euro invested, the Group generates two euros in the national economy;\n- -  the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's activity directly generates \u20ac3.6/uni00A0billion (including the taxes and social contributions paid by the Group and its employees);\n- -  Air France is a leading private sector employer in the \u00cele-deFrance.\n\nIn the Netherlands:\n\n- -  At the end of 2020, KLM was one of the five largest private sector employers in the Netherlands. The KLM Group accounted for more than 28,000/uni00A0jobs.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.2.2 'Resource adaptation and employee dialogue' for the impact of the Covid-19 public health crisis on the number of employees.\n\n## 4.6.2/emspace Sustainable  procurement\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAs a service company, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's business activity is heavily dependent on procurement which represents around \u20ac13/uni00A0billion per year although this figure was down in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 public health crisis and air transport operations twice coming to a virtually total standstill. Fuel purchasing amounts to some 40% of this expenditure, followed by aircraft maintenance and components, airport and navigation fees, and airport handling.\n\nGiven the significant proportion of external expenses relative to total revenues, optimizing, innovating and making the supply chain more sustainable are priorities for the Group, and contribute to improving profitability. The Procurement Department deploys an ambitious policy and encourages the adoption of responsible practices within its processes. For a number of years, this responsible procurement policy has aimed to factor societal responsibility principles into relationships with suppliers by reinforcing control over ethical, social, environmental and supply chain risks. In its Flight Plan, the Procurement Department includes Corporate Social Responsibility as a pillar of its actions. A transformation plan is underway within the department, seeking to go even further on this topic and dedicating resources that will support the overall purchasing actions to respond to the Horizon 2030 corporate strategy.\n\n## Contribution to the sheltered and adapted sector\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France renegotiated its eleventh three-year agreement on jobs and the maintained employment of persons with disabilities. Within the framework of this agreement, one of the commitments concerns rea/ffirmed support for the sheltered and adapted sector.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has invested \u20ac22/uni00A0million in supply contracts, on-site operations, subcontracting and services in favor of the protected and adapted sector. This corresponds to a 5% increase within a context of relentless optimization of the company's costs. Air/uni00A0 France maintains long-term partnership relations, thus enabling these companies to develop in a sustainable context.\n\nSince the 2000s, Air/uni00A0France has been developing one of the most important support initiatives in the national territory for workers with disabilities by using companies in the adapted and protected sector (STPA) for multiple projects (e.g. maintenance of green spaces at certain sites, shipment of uniform packages) and is constantly looking for new projects in sectors where the STPA innovates and branches out into new areas of human expertise (four companies in the protected sector work for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's IT department).\n\n## Contribution to community projects\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM allocated \u20ac3.3/uni00A0million to supporting NGOs and other social and environmental initiatives. A key performance indicator to measure the impact of the sums allocated is in the development phase.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\n## Pursuing a responsible procurement policy throughout the whole process\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM pursues a responsible procurement policy throughout the process:\n\n- -  during the supplier referencing process, the Group send suppliers a supplier questionnaire, addressing a number of themes such as safety, environmental management, HR policy, etc;\n- -  suppliers are invited to sign the Sustainable Development Charter for suppliers based on the principles of the UN Global Compact or provide their own equivalent document which can be approved following analysis. Since 2015, this Charter has been supplemented by a Supplier Code of Conduct;\n- -  the tender documents frequently list the criteria enabling the evaluation of the environmental impact of the product or service, which are then taken into account during the evaluation of the di/fferent supplier proposals. This is an integral part of the assessment of the total cost of ownership and the life cycle analysis;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

There are six levels of risk;\n- -  in the event of an elevated or severe level of risk, suppliers are contacted so that they can be evaluated by EcoVadis or an equivalent organization on the following four themes: environment, social, ethics and sustainable procurement (as defined in the EcoVadis system);\n- -  if the risk category of the supplier is lower than 'high risk', buyers are advised to encourage their supplier to be evaluated in order to improve their weak points. The suppliers can then share their scores with other companies, which may prove to be a competitive advantage in terms of winning bids and contracts.\n\nFollowing their evaluation, suppliers having failed to reach an acceptable level will need to put in place corrective measures to meet the Procurement Department's requirements. At Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, these cases are discussed during quarterly Steering Committee meetings, overseen by the Procurement and CSR Departments.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France is pursuing its ambitious Purchase Plan launched in 2018, aimed at capturing more innovation with its suppliers and, in particular, with small and medium-sized companies and start-ups. Purchasing from the sheltered and adapted sector rea/ffirms Air/uni00A0France's values and thus underscores its commitment to Societal and Environmental Responsibility. In 2019, Air/uni00A0France organized four Purchasing meetings aimed at increasing procurement with SMEs, the sheltered sector and innovative companies.\n\nSince March/uni00A02020, through a risk manager, the Procurement Department has monitored suppliers to guarantee the financial health of its partners. The Covid-19 public health crisis requires the Group to secure its supply chain and take into account the specific situations being traversed by its suppliers, particularly the smallest. The local, SME and ESAT purchasing mindset was a focus of concern this year.\n\nThe KLM Fuel Procurement Department has made a decade-long commitment to developing and purchasing 75,000/uni00A0tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. To this end, KLM is contributing, alongside SkyNRG, the world leader in sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), to the development of the first European plant dedicated to the production of SAF in Delfzijl. The construction of this facility, scheduled to open in 2023, is a concrete step towards\n\nachieving KLM's ambitions for sustainable development and contributes to the broader 'Smart and Sustainable' industrial plan. As of 2023, the plant will produce 100,000/uni00A0tons of SAF annually, as well as 15,000/uni00A0tons of bioLPG, as a by-product. This will mean an annual/uni00A0CO2 reduction of 270,000/uni00A0tons for the aviation sector. This is an important milestone for the industry in its quest to reduce carbon emissions and meet the growing demand for sustainable fuel for aviation.\n\n## Empowering the buyers\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM buyers are committed to respecting the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility commitments. On their first day in the o/ffice, they sign a Code of Ethics outlining the ethical rules to be followed when dealing with suppliers. In the light of the Anti-Bribery legislation, a reminder of the Code of Ethics is sent to the prescribers. These documents, the Procurement Sustainable Development Charter and the Code of Ethics are available on the Procurement website. This year, the Group worked on the updating of these documents and a new Code of Conduct will be gradually rolled out.\n\nAn internal process has also been established to develop the buyers' skills, with training modules, seminars and web links providing more information on best environmental practices. All Procurement sta/ff have completed an anti-corruption e-learning module. All new buyers receive training on the department's CSR commitments, the duty of vigilance and the anti-bribery processes, and on how to use a scoring tool (EcoVadis).\n\nThe Procurement function encourages the maintenance of a watching brief on information relating to CSR (news, legislation, events, conferences, webinars, etc.) and the sharing of experience.\n\nThe Procurement Action Plan sets out the CSR undertakings as a strategic lever; this Plan has been distributed to the team and forms part of the induction documentation for new recruits. More than ever, CSR is a focus for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which places sustainable development at the heart of its priorities and projects: the buyers seek suppliers who can help the Group make progress on this issue and contribute suggestions and innovative ideas.\n\n## Mobilizing and innovating with suppliers\n\nThe Supplier Relations Management Program (SRM) is based on building long-term relationships between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its strategic suppliers. This program enables issues like Corporate Social Responsibility to be central to discussions and to move forward together on these issues.\n\nIn November/uni00A02020, an Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Supplier Summit took place during which one of the subjects was CSR. The aim was to ensure that the Group's suppliers understand that CSR is a strategic priority for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and for them. Thus, 67.7% of the Group's suppliers have CSR as one of their Top 3/uni00A0strategic goals for 2020, while research and development, CSR compliance, a reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions and local procurement are all part of their mindset.",

        "page_content": "The Procurement function sees its suppliers as bona fide partners in mutually-beneficial growth. In this capacity, it supports their quest for innovative solutions and analysis of the environmental impact of products. During the drafting of a product specification, the prescriber and buyer work together to identify the environmental and societal characteristics, thereby encouraging the supplier to not only develop the environmental performance of its products but also make a wider commitment to sustainability.\n\nAir/uni00A0France thus entrusts a significant proportion of its procurement to SMEs. Through a formalized action plan, the Procurement function promotes the development of SMEs and start-ups through initiatives such as the creation of an innovation counter and participation in incubators and on specific themes. Procurement is committed to building high-quality relationships with SMEs. To promote and protect this ecosystem, Air/uni00A0France is a member of the SME Pact and establishes an action plan on an annual basis within the context of its relationships with SMEs (midcaps, start-ups and VSBs). These actions include a reduction in payment terms thanks to the extension of Tradeshift (cloud-based business network and platform for supply chain payments) and also the strengthening and deployment of innovation via a 'Start-up Kit', enabling the company to work more nimbly with start-ups and promote POC ('Proof of Concept').\n\nAir/uni00A0 France cooperates with associations and companies in the sheltered sector on multiple projects which represented approximately \u20ac21/uni00A0million of the Group's purchasing in 2020 (e.g. upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones, etc.).\n\nKLM Procurement is working with its suppliers on the recycling of plastic waste, transforming this waste into a material for 3D printing. KLM thus collects tons of plastic bottles on flights and then sorts and recycles them to obtain recycled plastic pellets. This recycled plastic will be used, for example, to print tools for the maintenance of aircraft. For its part, Air/uni00A0France has put in place measures to recycle and upcycle its waste, and minimize the utilization of single-use-plastic. The Procurement teams have made a significant contribution to the quest for new innovative partnerships.\n\n## Taking into account social and environmental priorities\n\nThe obligations of suppliers in terms of the environment and vocational health and safety are stipulated in the product or service specifications. To prevent the risks linked to joint-activity during interventions, the establishment of prevention plans is systematic. This approach is the subject of a General Occupational Health and Safety Procedure. For Air/uni00A0France, the accident record for sub-contractors is tracked in the Company's annual social reporting.\n\nFurthermore, an environmental clause figures in Air/uni00A0France's catering contracts which includes measures to reduce the environmental footprint, such as the sorting and recycling of waste and the use of seasonal products.\n\n## Measures in favor of responsible catering\n\nOne of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's priorities is to develop an ever-more-ecoresponsible onboard product. Air/uni00A0France is thus working on the development of responsible catering, in terms of both the food services and the tableware used.\n\nFor catering procurement, in partnership with its different caterers and suppliers, whenever possible Air/uni00A0France prioritizes local products which are responsible and seasonal. Certified protected origin products (produits d'appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e et prot\u00e9g\u00e9e - AOC/AOP), particularly cheese, are part of a broad range of products. Organic food products are also o/ffered, particularly in the meal trays for children. Seafood originating from sustainable fishing is an integral part of the catering proposition.\n\nFor on-board tableware, multiple criteria are taken into consideration: weight of the articles, materials used, place of manufacturing, mode of transportation, management of the material's end of life. Environmental labels and certifications like FSC or PEFC are also prioritized. The selection of new articles is made in cooperation with the suppliers to envisage products with the lowest-possible environmental impact from a long-term perspective.\n\nA key performance indicator enables the quantity of single-use plastic eliminated on a change in product to be evaluated. Aimed at reducing its usage by 80% by 2025, the potential for eliminating single-use plastic on board is also monitored. Lastly, during 2020, collaboration between the Solar Impulse Foundation and Air/uni00A0France enabled the launch of an innovation challenge to find a viable alternative to replace the current champagne glass in Economy class.\n\nWhenever feasible, to contribute to the overall objective of attaining the Sustainable Development Goals, KLM chooses products and partners that share its values. KLM's responsible catering policy mainly focuses on environmental preservation in production areas, Human Rights, working conditions and animal welfare. The catering policy applies to all flights departing from Schiphol Airport and elsewhere in Europe and, where possible, responsible products are included in the catering products on board flights on departure from other countries. For KLM, it is important that the ingredients used in meals, such as fish, chocolate, palm oil and soy, are sourced responsibly. To this end, KLM is a member of the Responsible Soy (RTRS) and Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Round Table and o/ffers certified products on board its aircraft such as MSC and ASC-certified fish, 'better life' egg, chicken and veal, and UTZ-certified co/ffee, tea and chocolate.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThrough its website (www.af-KLM.com/procurement), Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM maintains an ongoing dialogue with suppliers, informing them, amongst other things, of its policy and commitment to sustainable development. Right from the inception of the procurement process, suppliers thus become aware of these issues and are invited to sign the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Sustainable Development Charter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of a continuous-improvement process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to evaluate 100/uni00A0additional suppliers in 2021.\n\n## 4.6.3/emspace Monitoring of Act No. 2017-399/uni00A0known as the Duty of Vigilance Law\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is subject to the obligations introduced by the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance for parent companies and ordering companies.\n\nSince 2018, in response to the regulatory requirements, the Group has implemented a vigilance plan in compliance with the legal provisions, it being understood that the Group already had processes in place enabling it to comply directly or indirectly with the requirements of the new Act. In particular, having established verification processes in the areas required to be covered by the vigilance plan, the Group has ensured that it is in a position to benefit, as e/ffectively as possible, from the contributions of its various entities. In 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM pursued these actions and focused on measuring their e/ffectiveness within the Group and its subsidiaries. This will also be the case in 2021.\n\n## Identification and regular risk evaluation procedures\n\nThe identification and evaluation of the various risks relating to the duty of vigilance are part of the overall risk management process established within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. As a facilitator of risk management, Group Internal Audit regularly evaluates the risk management process and its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's overall sub-contracting management system applies to all risk areas. It is based on contract reviews, compliance monitoring and supervision acts such as audits, inspections and checks, carried out by the sub-contractors themselves where appropriate.\n\nEvery year, the Group conducts a review of the non-financial risks generated by its activities. This analysis verifies the relevance and comprehensiveness of the measures and action plans aimed at the e/ffective prevention, control and mitigation of the non-financial risks deemed to be the most material.\n\nSee chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.\n\n## Measures deployed to prevent and mitigate the risks and monitoring mechanisms\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's policy enshrines the respect of fundamental rights as established in the leading international principles: Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) guiding principles.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and is committed to respecting and promoting its ten principles in the areas of Human Rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. This undertaking is rea/ffirmed each year by the Group's top management.\n\nThe duty of vigilance is a multi-risk approach. The management of risks is at the heart of the steering of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's business activities, based on a rational of prevention and homogeneous management via common methods and tools.\n\n## Human rights and fundamental liberties\n\nIn 2019, the Social Rights and Ethics Charter was reviewed by a working group bringing together the relevant Group entities and the European Works Council, to develop its content towards the formalization of principles fostering the respect of Human Rights. This new document, intended for both internal and external use, entitled The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles, was published in 2020.\n\nThese Principles a/ffirm the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual trust and respect amongst sta/ff, and ensuring a safe working environment. The Group undertakes to apply the labor legislation of the European Union and its Member States and all national collective agreements, and to respect the exercise of trade union rights in all the relevant countries. The Group also undertakes to scrupulously respect Human Rights, oppose child and forced labor, apply laws and ask its service providers and suppliers to uphold these principles.\n\nIn view of its organization, the Group delegates to its subsidiaries the responsibility of respecting and promoting the content of these commitments locally, in the respect of the national provisions and legislation specific to each country.\n\nSee sections/uni00A04.2 'Human Resources' and 4.5.2 'Respect of Human Rights'.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the health and safety of both customers and sta/ff is an absolute priority.\n\nFlight Safety is paramount for the Group. It is key to retaining the trust of customers and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations. All the Group's activities are the subject of multiple checks and certifications, and comply with extremely strict norms and the highest standards in the industry.\n\nEach Group airine deploys a Safety Management System, which is integral to their business organizations, processes and corporate cultures.\n\nSee chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.",

        "page_content": "Safeguarding health and safety in the work place is a human priority to which the Group responds by preventing vocational risks and improving the quality of life in the workplace.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.2 'Human resources'.\n\nThe Group must guarantee its customers and flight crew safe catering services and, to this end, has put in place a Food Hygiene and Safety process to respond to the regulatory requirements linked to the preparation and supply of meals.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.\n\n## Environment\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Climate Action Plan embodies the Group's strategy and main priorities for reducing its impact on climate change. In November/uni00A02019, the Group unveiled its global strategy through to 2025, based on environmental sustainability.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France and KLM Environmental Management Systems (EMS) aim to prevent and mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations. They have ISO/uni00A014001/uni00A0certification and internal and external audits enable the verification of their e/ffective deployment.\n\nIn 2019, the Group adopted the format recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the management of financial risks linked to climate change (TCFD concordance table, section/uni00A04.3.2).\n\nSee section/uni00A04.3 'Environment'.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nIn its relations with sub-contractors and suppliers, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM ensures that the fundamental social rights and principles, and environmental protection provisions, are properly respected everywhere in the world.\n\nA supplier selection process has been implemented to respond to the duty of vigilance requirements. To this end, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Procurement function provides awareness training on these risks for its buyers.\n\nA risk-mapping process is in place with, for each segment and procurement domain, an evaluation of the environmental, social and ethical risks. Risk is also evaluated by country.\n\nFor all new contracts or contract renewals, the signature of the Sustainable Development Charter or an equivalent commitment\n\ncovering the four areas (environment, social, ethical and supply chain) is mandatory and is included in the contract's appendix.\n\nIn the segments most exposed to risks, suppliers are asked to submit an evaluation of their sustainability performance, carried out by a specialized organization or the equivalent. This evaluation must address four areas: environment, social, ethics, supply chain. The 'Supplier supply chain' section provides visibility for tier 2/uni00A0suppliers.\n\nSuppliers failing to reach an acceptable level are required to put in place a remedial action plan. Independent in-situ audits may also be triggered.\n\nIndependently of the level of risk, all suppliers are encouraged to carry out evaluations of their CSR performance.\n\nIn 2020, at the Group's request, 262/uni00A0suppliers had their sustainability performance evaluated.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.6 'Societal value'.\n\n## Listening to stakeholders and whistle blower mechanism\n\nIn 2019, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM realized a new materiality analysis by questioning a representative panel of internal and external stakeholders. The comparison of these results with those of the analysis carried out in 2017 enabled confirmation of the relevance of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's strategic choices in the light of the issues deemed to be priorities for its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nSeveral processes enable the Group to regularly evaluate the perception of its stakeholders and to understand the related risks. The Group also has a number of feedback channels in place enabling stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any complaints.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has updated the scope of its internal whistle-blower procedures to enable employees to report any situations arising within the scope of the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies. For reporting under the Whistleblowing procedure see section/uni00A04.5.3/uni00A0'Business ethics'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities4 and covers between 36% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n\nWe assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgment, is su/fficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work was carried out by a team of eight people between November/uni00A02020 and February/uni00A02021 and took a total of ten weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility. We conducted ten interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, on 18/uni00A0February/uni00A02021\n\n## KPMG S.A.\n\nFanny Houlliot Partner Sustainability Services\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9 Partner",

Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its two main subsidiaries, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, represent 92% of revenues and 94% of the balance sheet. The other\n\nsubsidiaries are principally involved in air transportation (Hop!, KLM Cityhopper), maintenance and low-cost transportation (Transavia).\n\nAs far as possible, the changes in the like-for-like figures have been estimated on a constant currency basis.\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                                | 2020    | 2019   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|\n| Revenues                                      | 11,088  | 27,189 | (16,101) |\n| EBITDA                                        | (1,689) | 4,128  | (5,816)  |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations         | (4,548) | 1,141  | (5,689)  |\n| Income/(loss) from operating activities       | (6,000) | 1,010  | (7,010)  |\n| Net income/(loss) from continuing operations  | (7,083) | 293    | (7,377)  |\n| Net income/(loss), Group part                 | (7,078) | 290    | (7,368)  |\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per share, Group (in \u20ac) | (16.56) | 0.64   | (17.20)  |\n\n## Revenues\n\nConsolidated revenues for the period amounted to \u20ac11.1/uni00A0billion, a decrease of 59.2% and 59.1% on a constant currency basis. The 2020 financial year was characterized by a 15.8% decrease in unit revenues on a constant currency basis, due to the combined performances of the passenger (-32.4%) and cargo (+76.8%) transportation activities, both these activities being included in the Network business, and the performance of Transavia (-17.4%). In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reduced its overall capacity by 54.4% (ASK). Air/uni00A0France and KLM reduced their passenger capacity by 53.9% (ASK), and their Cargo capacity by 30.7% (ATK). Transavia's capacity decline stood at 59.5% (ASK).\n\nRevenues from the Network business decreased by 60.4% while third-party maintenance revenues decreased by 41.6%. Transavia revenues fell by 65.2%.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses declined by 40% to \u20ac15.6/uni00A0billion.\n\nExternal expenses decreased by 49.8% to \u20ac7.98/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac15.89/uni00A0billion over the previous twelve months.

At December/uni00A031, 2020, the foreign exchange result mainly included a \u20ac302/uni00A0million unrealized foreign exchange gain, composed of a gain of \u20ac277/uni00A0million on return obligation\n\nliabilities and provisions on aircraft leased in US dollars and a \u20ac42/uni00A0million foreign exchange gain on the debt in US dollars (\u20ac28/uni00A0million) and Japanese yen (\u20ac29/uni00A0million). At December/uni00A031, 2019, the foreign exchange result had mainly included a \u20ac82/uni00A0million unrealized foreign exchange loss, composed of a loss of \u20ac42/uni00A0million on return obligation liabilities and provisions on aircraft leased in US dollars, and a \u20ac36/uni00A0million foreign exchange loss on the debt in US dollars (\u20ac15/uni00A0million) and Japanese yen (\u20ac26/uni00A0million).\n\n- -  a \u20ac(561) million impact from the change in fair value of financial and equity instruments in 2020 (versus \u20ac33/uni00A0million in 2019). In 2020, due to the significant reduction in fuel consumption for 2020 and expected for the beginning of 2021, the Group was over-hedged. An amount of \u20ac(595) million was recycled to the income statement. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, an amount of \u20ac(589) million of these derivatives had been settled and \u20ac(6) million relates to the period JanuaryMarch/uni00A02021.\n- -  an accretion e/ffect on long-term return obligation liabilities on aircraft: \u20ac(165) million in 2020 versus \u20ac(212) million in 2019, the variation being linked to a decrease in the discount rate from 6.0% in 2019 to 4.5% in 2020.\n\n## Net result - Group part\n\nIncome taxes stood at a charge of \u20ac(97) million in 2020 versus \u20ac(76) million in 2019. The e/ffective tax rate as of December/uni00A031, 2020 was (1.4) %. The 2020 tax losses have not been recognized in deferred tax assets.\n\nShare of profits/(losses) from associates contributed a loss of \u20ac(58) million in 2020 versus a \u20ac23/uni00A0million profit in the previous year. This was principally the result from the Servair Group and from partnerships in the maintenance business.\n\nThe net result, Group part stood at loss of \u20ac(7,078) million in 2020 versus \u20ac290/uni00A0million income in 2019.\n\nThe contributions to the net result by quarter were, respectively, \u20ac(1,801) million at March/uni00A031, 2020, \u20ac(2,612) million at June/uni00A030, 2020, \u20ac(1,665) million at September/uni00A030, 2020 and \u20ac(1,000) million at December/uni00A031, 2020.",

To analyze the company's overall cost performance, the Group uses the net cost per ASK. This net cost is obtained by dividing the total net cost\n\nby the capacity produced expressed in available seat-kilometers (ASK). The net cost is calculated by subtracting the revenues other than those generated by the three transportation activities (passenger, cargo and Transavia) from total operating expenses. The capacity produced by the two passenger transportation activities is combined by adding the capacity of the passenger business (in ASK) to that of Transavia (in ASK).\n\n|                                                              | 2020     | 2019     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Revenues  (in \u20acm)                                            | 11,088   | 27,189   |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm)               | (4,548)  | 1,141    |\n| Total operating expense  (in \u20acm)                             | (15,637) | (26,048) |\n| Network business - other network revenues  (in \u20acm)           | 635      | 1,021    |\n| Third-party revenues in maintenance  (in \u20acm)                 | 1,248    | 2,138    |\n| Transavia - other revenues  (in \u20acm)                          | 20       | (10)     |\n| Other businesses  (in \u20acm)                                    | 28       | 34       |\n| Net cost (in \u20acm)                                             | 13,706   | 22,864   |\n| Capacity produced, reported in ASK                           | 151,480  | 332,473  |\n| Net cost, per ASK (in \u20ac cents)                               | 9.05     | 6.88     |\n| Gross change                                                 |          | +31.6%   |\n| Currency e/ffect on net costs  (in \u20acm)                       |          | +121     |\n| Change at constant currencies                                |          | +32.3%   |\n| Fuel price e/ffect  (in \u20acm) /thinspace (1)                   |          | +771     |\n| Change on a constant currency and fuel price basis           |          | +36.9%   |\n| Net cost per ASK on a constant currency and fuel price basis | 9.05     | 6.61     |\n\n- (1) Adjusted for 2019 capacity.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 1/emspace BUSINESS  DESCRIPTION\n\nAs used herein, the term 'Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM' refers to Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM SA, a limited liability company organized under French law. The term 'Group' is represented by the economic definition of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its subsidiaries. The Group is headquartered in France and is one of the largest airlines in the world.\n\nThe Group's core business is network activities which includes passenger transportation on scheduled flights and cargo activities. The Group's activities also include aeronautics maintenance,\n\n## NOTE 2/emspace SIGNIFICANT  EVENTS\n\n## 2.1/emspace Covid-19 and going concern\n\nThe worldwide spread of Covid-19 since the beginning of 2020 has had and continues to have a major impact on air tra/ffic around the world. After the drastic reduction in tra/ffic during the second quarter following very stringent constraints on worldwide travel, the recovery expected in the second semester was delayed with the resurgence of Covid-19 at the end of the summer. Further measures were implemented by the French and Dutch governments to slow the spread of the virus in the final quarter of 2020 (lockdowns, curfew). Since early January/uni00A02021, the restrictions on travel have been reinforced at global level following the emergence of new variants of the virus.\n\nThe Group has already taken a number of strong measures to mitigate the e/ffect of Covid-19 on its business and continues to closely monitor and evaluate further developments. These actions include, amongst others, a substantial reduction in network capacity, structural changes to the fleet, cash preservation and salary measures.\n\n## Reduction in capacity and costs\n\nAvailable seat-kilometers for the Passenger network and Transavia were down by 54.4% for full year 2020 compared to last year. As a consequence, the Group's revenues amounted to \u20ac11,088/uni00A0million, a decrease of 59.2% compared to last year, with network revenues decreasing by 60.4%, Maintenance revenues down by 41.6% and Transavia down by 65.3%.\n\nIn parallel, the reduction in capacity linked to Covid-19 and the specific cost-saving initiatives led to a decline in the Group's external expenses excluding fuel to \u20ac5,588/uni00A0million, i.e. a 46.2% reduction compared to 2019.\n\nWithin external expenses, fuel costs fell by 56.6% versus 2019, in line with the reduction in capacity. However, following the drastic reduction in fuel consumption over the April-December/uni00A02020 period and the 2021 first quarter, the Group has been in a position of over-hedging. In this regard, an expense of \u20ac595/uni00A0million has been booked under 'Other financial income and expenses' at December/uni00A031, 2020 (see Note/uni00A011/uni00A0'Net cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses').\n\n'low-cost' passenger transportation (Transavia) and other air-transport-related activities.\n\nThe limited company Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, domiciled at 2, rue Robert Esnault-Pelterie 75007/uni00A0Paris, France, is the parent company of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\nThe presentation currency used in the Group's financial statements is the euro, which is also Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's functional currency.\n\nSalaries and related costs stood to \u20ac5,300/uni00A0million, down by 34.9% compared to 2019.\n\nAs of March/uni00A023, 2020, Air/uni00A0France and its French subsidiaries implemented partial activity measures ('Activit\u00e9 Partielle') and KLM received support from the Dutch government thanks to 'Temporary Emergency Bridging Measures for Sustained Employment' (NOW), applicable from March/uni00A01, 2020.\n\nThese measures had a positive impact of around \u20ac2,050/uni00A0million for the year 2020. The impact has been booked under Salaries and related costs (see Note/uni00A07 'Salaries and number of employees').\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group also announced and implemented restructuring and sta/ff reduction plans (see Note/uni00A02.2 'Events occurring during the period').\n\nThe fleet was rescaled to adapt to the lower demand. It was thus decided to accelerate the phase-out from the fleet of the A380, A340, Boeing 747, CRJ and ERJ145 aircraft (see Note/uni00A010/uni00A0'Other non-current income and expenses'). The rationalization in the number of aircraft types in operation will progressively generate cost savings and e/fficiency gains.\n\n## Asset valuation\n\nIn the current context, the Group also paid particular attention to the recoverability and the valuation of its deferred tax assets (see Note/uni00A012 'Income taxes'), its segment assets (see Note/uni00A016 'Impairment'), its trade receivables, inventories and margin rates on long-term contracts.\n\n## Liquidity position\n\nWithin the framework of the financial support packages from the French and Dutch States, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group signed the legal documentation relating to the four financing mechanisms, approved by the European Commission on May/uni00A04, 2020 (Air/uni00A0France Group) and on July/uni00A013, 2020 (KLM Group), in the total amount of \u20ac10.4/uni00A0billion (see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0'Financial support by the French and the Dutch states'). These financing packages thus enabled an improvement in the Group's liquidity position.",

        "page_content": "In addition, the Group decided to defer non-essential capital expenditures and internal projects, defer payment of the employee profit-sharing scheme and variable compensation, and defer payment of the wage tax, social contributions and aeronautical charges.\n\nLastly, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group o/ffered customers whose flights had been cancelled the option of exchanging their tickets for vouchers, with a 15% uplift in their value.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's liquidity position consisted of total cash of \u20ac9.82/uni00A0billion, of which \u20ac7.36/uni00A0billion in liquidity (see Note/uni00A032/uni00A0'Net debt') and \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion in undrawn credit lines (see Note/uni00A030/uni00A0'Financial debt').\n\nDespite these measures and a gradual resumption of activity, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's financial performance for the coming period will continue to be a/ffected by a significant fall in revenue, lost ticket sales and substantially negative cash flows in a proportion and for a duration that currently remain uncertain.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn determining the appropriate basis for preparing the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, the Board of Directors considered the Group as a going concern by evaluating the financial forecasts over a time horizon of at least one year and by analyzing, in particular, the trading position of the Group in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic and taking into account the following elements.\n\nAs indicated above, the Group had total cash of \u20ac9.82/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe 2021 budget, as modelled by the management and approved by the Board of Directors, assumes a gradual ramp-up in passenger demand with a stronger recovery in tra/ffic in the second part of year thanks to the vaccination roll-out.\n\nThis plan will ensure a level of liquidity considered to be adequate thanks to the following elements:\n\n- - the adjustment of the flight schedule and capacity to the expected demand in order to operate only flights having a positive incremental impact in terms of operating cash-flow;\n- -  the continued specific mechanisms from the French and Dutch governments to partially cover sta/ff costs through the 'NOW' program in the Netherlands and the Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') in France;\n- - a high level of variable costs linked to a reduction in capacity;\n- - the reduction in the capital expenditure plans;\n- -  the systematic refinancing secured by assets of new aircraft delivered from manufacturers.\n\nBased on these financial forecasts, the banking covenants applicable in 2021, including the \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion Revolving Credit Facility at the level of KLM (see Note/uni00A030 'Financial Debt'), are met.\n\nIn addition, the Group is working on financing projects, pursuant to the European Regulation, which would increase the stockholders'\n\nequity, provide further liquidity and secure access to additional financing secured by assets.\n\nLastly, and more generally, the French and Dutch States have shown their support to enable Air/uni00A0France and KLM to weather the current di/fficulties.\n\nAs the timing for the resumption of flights is uncertain, the Management has also modelled a more pessimistic, but plausible, scenario assuming a further 10% decline in activity during 2021 relative to the aforementioned budget, to assess the liquidity position over a period of at least 12/uni00A0months from the date of the year end closing.\n\nOn this scenario, thanks to the high level of variable costs and the measures supporting payroll costs, the Group would have enough cash to continue its activities over this 12-month period.\n\nWere this scenario to transpire, the Management has considered additional mitigating actions, including:\n\n- -  further optimization and reduction of the network and capacity;\n- -  asset  disposals;\n- -  further sta/ff restructuring;\n- -  other cost-saving measures; and\n- -  the deferral of capital expenditure and charges.\n\nWithin a context of significant uncertainty linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis, the Board of Directors nonetheless considers that there are pessimistic scenarios which could cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, in particular were the pandemic, including the uncontrolled spread of new variants and the maintenance or even reinforcement of the related health measures, to call into question the gradual recovery in demand, especially in the 2021 second semester.\n\nFurthermore, the non-realization of financing projects, the inadequacy of the aforementioned mitigation measures, the possibility that the banking covenants might, in certain situations, not be respected, the lack of alternative sources of finance like the sale and leaseback of aircraft, the impact of a possible forced reduction in slots and a potentially negative change in some behavior relating to air travel also constitute, to various degrees, factors of additional uncertainty in the short and medium term.\n\nIn the event that these factors of uncertainty were to materialize, the Group might not be able to realize its assets and repay its debts within the normal framework of its activity while the application of the IFRS accounting rules and principles in a normal context of a going concern, concerning notably the assessment of the assets and liabilities, could prove inappropriate. This situation creates a situation of significant uncertainty with regard to operating as a going concern.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Board of Directors does not consider those pessimistic scenarios to be likely or that they are likely to have an impact su/fficient to call into question the business as a going concern. It thus considers it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis of going concern principle.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.2/emspace Events occurring during the period\n\n## Sales of Amadeus shares\n\nOn January/uni00A09, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM sold its remaining shares in the Spanish company Amadeus IT Holding SA ('Amadeus'), for an amount of \u20ac356/uni00A0million. The fair value of the shares stood at \u20ac360/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019. Since the entire 1.11/uni00A0per cent Amadeus shareholding was covered by a hedge contract, the result of the transaction is nil in the income statement in 2020. The cash proceeds of \u20ac356/uni00A0million are included in 'Proceeds on disposal of subsidiaries, of shares in non-controlled entities' in the cash-flow statement.\n\n## Issue of notes and tender o/ffer on series of existing notes\n\nOn January/uni00A010, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM issued a \u20ac750/uni00A0million senior notes with a 5- year maturity and bearing coupon at an annual rate of 1.875%.\n\nPart of the net proceeds of this issuance were used to fund, in whole or in part, the tender o/ffer on existing notes launched by the Company on January/uni00A06, 2020 and finalized on January/uni00A014, 2020. On the existing notes brought to the tender offer, \u20ac350/uni00A0million were accepted of which \u20ac311.2/uni00A0million of notes with a maturity date in 2021 and \u20ac38.8/uni00A0million of notes with maturity date on 2022.\n\n## Phase-out of A380, A340, CRJ and Boeing 747 aircraft from Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's fleet\n\nFollowing the drastic reduction in air tra/ffic in relation with Covid-19, it has been decided to speed up the phase-out from the fleet of the A380, A340, Boeing 747 and CRJ. The related impact of \u20ac(670) million has been accounted for in 'other non-current income and expenses'.\n\n## Drawn down of revolving credit facility during the first quarter 2020\n\nOn March/uni00A013, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM drawn down its revolving credit facility for a total amount of \u20ac1,1/uni00A0billion divided into two tranches of \u20ac550/uni00A0million each. On May/uni00A07, 2020, following the financial support package backed by the French State for Air/uni00A0France Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reimbursed the \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion credit facility and terminated the revolving credit facility.\n\nFurthermore, on March/uni00A019, 2020, KLM drawn down its revolving credit facility concluded on May/uni00A023, 2018 for the full amount of \u20ac665/uni00A0million. On August/uni00A026, 2020, following the financial support package backed by the Dutch State, KLM reimbursed the \u20ac665/uni00A0million credit facility and terminated the revolving credit facility.\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac7.0/uni00A0billion backed by the French State\n\nOn 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group signed the legal documentation relating to the financing for a total amount of 7/uni00A0billion euros, announced in its press release of 24/uni00A0April/uni00A02020 and approved by the European Commission on 4/uni00A0May/uni00A02020. This financing intends to support the liquidity needs of Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries and includes two loans:\n\n- -  a loan of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, 90% guaranteed by the French State, provided by a syndicate of nine banks, with an initial 12-month maturity and a one-year or two-year extension option exercisable by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM (see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0'Financial support by the French and the Dutch states');\n- -  a subordinated shareholder loan of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, granted by the French State to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, with a maturity of four years, with two consecutive one-year extension options exercisable by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM (see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0'Financial support by the French and the Dutch states').\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has withdrawn the \u20ac4/uni00A0billion of the loan guaranteed by the French State and the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion of shareholders loan.\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion backed by the Dutch State\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, following discussions with the Dutch State and several international banking institutions, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and KLM were able to finalize the various components of a financial support package.\n\nIt includes two sections for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- - a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State and a maturity of 5/uni00A0years (see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0'Financial support by the French and the Dutch states');\n- -  a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with a maturity of 5.5/uni00A0years (see Note/uni00A030.3/uni00A0'Financial support by the French and the Dutch states').\n\nMain conditions associated with the direct state loan are linked to the airline becoming more sustainable, cut cost e/ffectively, as well as the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and contributions made by employees.",

The presentation of this restructuring plan was a key condition in obtaining the aforementioned government loan and guarantees to the value of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion. The plan outlines how KLM intends to fulfil the conditions imposed by the Netherlands government. The presentation of the plan is a very important milestone. Substantively, the plan includes elements such as the reassessment of strategy, cost-cutting initiatives, financial considerations and how KLM sta/ff will contribute by way of reduced employment conditions. On November/uni00A03, 2020, the ministry has approved the plan. Consequently, KLM has the possibility to draw additional amounts under the financial support package.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, KLM has withdrawn \u20ac942/uni00A0million of the financial support package (\u20ac665/uni00A0million from the revolving credit facility and \u20ac277/uni00A0million from the direct loan).\n\n## Restructuring plan for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group\n\nTo face the Covid-19 crisis and forecasts expecting a return at the same level of activity of 2019 in 2024, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM must accelerate its transformation to regain its competitiveness and strengthen its leading position in terms of sustainable development. In this context, Air/uni00A0France Group and KLM Group announced the restructuring of the company and a reduction of sta/ff.\n\n## KLM Voluntary Resignation Scheme\n\nThe Covid-19 has had a major impact on KLM and, to the contend with the reduction of workload expected until 2024, the option to leave the company on a voluntary basis with financial compensation was opened for KLM employees for a period starting June/uni00A01, 2020 and ending July/uni00A012, 2020. The 2020 Voluntary Resignation Scheme o/ffers a financial incentive, the level of which depends on the number of years in service.\n\nThe option to leave the company on a voluntary basis with similar financial compensation was reopened, for specific divisions and departments in order to minimize involuntary dismissals, for a period starting October/uni00A019, 2020 and ending November/uni00A09, 2020 (December/uni00A02020 for cockpit crew).\n\nThe impact of \u20ac(175) million, net of KLM ground sta/ff pensions curtailment, has been accounted for in 'Other non-current income and expenses'\n\nIn addition, a restructuring plan has been announced in the last quarter 2020 for ground sta/ff. The impact of this decision is estimated at (16)/uni00A0M\u20ac and has been accounted for in 'Other non-current income and expenses'.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France Group\n\nIn July, 2020, Air/uni00A0France and HOP! announced their strategic orientations and planned to adapt their workforce in the coming months. Within the framework of these strategic orientations, the negotiations have been conducted by Air/uni00A0France and HOP! with their representatives of pilots, cabin crew, and ground sta/ff.\n\nDuring the meeting of the Social Economic Establishment Committee ('CSEE') Flight Operations of June/uni00A026, 2020, the management of Air/uni00A0France presented the mutual agreement on termination of contract ('RCC') for its pilots.\n\nOn July/uni00A06, 2020, during the meeting of the Social Economic Establishment Committee ('CSEE'), Flight Operations, the management of Air/uni00A0France presented the project of mutually agreement on termination of contract ('RCC') for flight attendants.\n\nOn July/uni00A024, 2020, during the meeting of the Social Economic Central Committee ('CSEC'), the management of Air/uni00A0France presented the project of Voluntary Departure Plan for ground sta/ff.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the Hop! Departure Plan ('PDVPSE') for ground sta/ff, pilots and flight attendants, presented in August/uni00A02020, has been submitted to the Central Committee ('CSE'). Hop! is waiting for the approval of the plan by the French Labour Ministry.\n\nThe impact of these decisions of \u20ac(584) million, net of pensions curtailment, has been accounted for in 'Other non-current income and expenses' as of December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM International Commercial sta/ff\n\nIn July/uni00A02020, the management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM presented the project of reorganization of international sales force. The impact of this decision is estimated at \u20ac(33) million and has been accounted for in 'other non-current income and expenses' as of December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Redemption of the EUR/uni00A0600/uni00A0million undated deeply subordinated notes (of which EUR/uni00A0403.3/uni00A0million are outstanding) issued in 2015\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has decided to redeem all the outstanding perpetual subordinated notes issued in 2015 representing a total nominal amount of \u20ac403.3/uni00A0million.\n\nRedemption has been made on 1 st /uni00A0 October/uni00A02020 at par, i.e. \u20ac100,000/uni00A0per note, plus interest accrued since the last date on which interest were paid under the notes (i.e. 1 st /uni00A0O c tober/uni00A02019) until the early redemption date (included).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main areas of estimates are disclosed in the following notes:\n\n- -  3.6/uni00A0Revenue recognition related to deferred revenue on ticket sales;\n- -  3.7/uni00A0Flying Blue frequent flyer program;\n- -  3.11/uni00A0Financial  instruments;\n- -  3.13/uni00A0Intangible  assets;\n- -  3.14/uni00A0Tangible  assets;\n- -  3.15/uni00A0Lease  contracts;\n- -  3.19/uni00A0Employee  benefits;\n\n## 3.3/emspace Consolidation  principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nIn conformity with IFRS/uni00A010 'Consolidated Financial Statements', the Group's consolidated financial statements comprise the financial figures for all the entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by the Group, irrespective of its level of participation in the equity of these entities. The companies over which the Group exercises control are fully consolidated. An entity is controlled when the Group has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in this entity, and has the ability to use its power to influence the amounts of these returns. The determination of control takes into account the existence of potential voting rights if they are substantive, meaning they can be exercised in time when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity need to be taken.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control begins until the date this control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented within equity and on the income statement separately from Group stockholders' equity and the Group's net income, under the line 'non-controlling interests'.\n\nThe e/ffects of a buyout of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary already controlled by the Group and divestment of a percentage interest without loss of control are recognized in equity. In a partial disposal resulting in loss of control, the retained equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the date of loss of control. The gain or loss on the disposal will include the e/ffect of this re-measurement and the gain or loss on the sale of the equity interest, including all the items initially recognized in equity and reclassified to profit and loss.\n\n- -  3.20/uni00A0Return obligation liability and provision for leased aircraft;\n- -  3.21/uni00A0Other  provisions;\n- -  3.24/uni00A0Current and deferred tax.\n\nThe Group's management makes these estimates and assessments continuously on the basis of its past experience and various other factors considered to be reasonable.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the financial year have thus been established on the basis of the financial parameters available at the closing date.\n\nThese accounting estimates are based upon the most-recently available, reliable information.\n\nThe actual results could di/ffer from these estimates depending on changes in the assumptions used or di/fferent conditions.\n\n## Interest in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A011 'Joint Arrangements', the Group applies the equity method to partnerships over which it exercises control jointly with one or more partners (joint-venture). Control is considered to be joint when decisions about the relevant activities of the partnership require the unanimous consent of the Group and the other parties with whom control is shared.\n\nIn cases of a joint activity (joint operation), the Group recognizes assets and liabilities in proportion to its rights and obligations regarding the entity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A028 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', companies in which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions are also accounted for using the equity method. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 20/uni00A0per cent of the voting rights.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group's share in the net result of associates and joint ventures from the date the ability to exercise significant influence begins until the date it ceases, adjusted for any impairment loss.\n\nThe Group's share of losses of an associate exceeding the value of the Group's interest and net investment (long-term receivables for which no reimbursement is scheduled or likely) in this entity are not accounted for, unless the Group has:\n\n- -  incurred contractual obligations to recover losses; or\n- -  made payments on behalf of the associate.",

In accordance with this standard, for a first consolidation, all assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The time period for adjustments to goodwill/negative goodwill is limited to 12/uni00A0months from the date of acquisition (except for non-current assets classified as assets held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell).\n\nGoodwill corresponding, at the acquisition date, to the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree minus the net amounts (usually at fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate in e/ffect at the closing date.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies assessed on an historical cost basis are translated using the rate in e/ffect at the transaction date or the hedging rate, when applicable.\n\nThe corresponding exchange rate di/fferences are recorded in the income statement. Changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded using the accounting treatment described in Note/uni00A03.11 'Financial instruments'.\n\nCosts other than those related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recognized immediately as an expense when incurred.\n\nFor individual acquisitions, the Group has the option of using the 'full' goodwill method, where goodwill is calculated by taking into account the fair value of non-controlling interests at the acquisition date rather than their proportionate interest in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquiree.\n\nIf the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, the resulting negative goodwill is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nContingent considerations or earn-outs are recorded in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed number of the acquirer's equity instruments (according to IAS/uni00A032).

Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the acquisition date and insofar as the initial measurement had still been presented as provisional. Any other subsequent adjustments which do not meet these criteria are recorded as receivables or payables through the income statement.\n\nIn a step acquisition, the previously-held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value. The di/fference between the fair value and the net book value must be accounted in profit or loss as well as elements previously recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Business combinations carried out before April/uni00A01, 2010\n\nBusiness combinations carried out before April/uni00A01, 2010 were accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with\n\n## 3.6/emspace Sales\n\n## Passenger and freight transportation\n\nSales related to air transportation operations, which consist of passenger and freight transportation, are recognized as revenue when the transportation service is provided, net of any discounts granted. The transportation service is also the trigger for the recognition as external expenses of the commissions paid to agents (e.g. credit card companies and travel agencies) and the booking fees.\n\nBoth passenger tickets and freight airway bills are consequently recorded as 'Deferred revenue upon issuance date'. The recognition of the revenue known as 'ticket breakage' is deferred until the transportation date initially foreseen. This revenue is calculated by applying a statistical rate on tickets issued and unused. This rate is regularly updated.\n\nThe Group applies the exemption provided by IFRS/uni00A015/uni00A0which allows the balance of the outstanding transactions to remain unspecified as well as their planned recognition date for the performance obligations related to contracts with an initial term set at one year or less. If the tickets are not used, the performance obligations related to passenger and freight transportation e/ffectively expire within one year.\n\nPursuant to the European Union's Regulation EC 261/uni00A0the Group compensates passengers in the event of denied boarding and for flight cancellations or long delays. This compensation is booked as contra revenue. The Group recognizes a corresponding amount in liabilities for future refunds to passengers. The determination of this liability for future refunds relies on a statistical approach.\n\nPassenger ticket taxes calculated on ticket sales are collected by the Group and paid to the airport authorities. Taxes are recorded as a liability until such time as they are paid to the relevant airport authority as a function of the chargeability conditions (on ticket issuance or transportation).\n\nThe Group considers that the company that issues the airway bill acts as principal since the latter has control over the achievement of the performance obligation.

In accordance with this standard, all assets, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities were measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The time period for adjustments to goodwill/negative goodwill did not exceed 12/uni00A0months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe goodwill that arose from the difference between the acquisition cost (including any equity instruments issued by the Group to gain control over the acquired entity and other costs potentially dedicated to the business combination) and the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, were subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicated that goodwill might be impaired.\n\nWhen the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the cost of acquisition, the resulting negative goodwill was recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nissues freight airway bills for its goods carried by another carrier (airline company or road carrier), the Group acts as principal. Therefore, at the time of transportation the Group recognizes as revenue the amount invoiced to the customer in its entirety as well as the chartering costs invoiced by the other carrier for the service provision.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe main types of contracts with customers identified within the Group are mainly:\n\n## Sales of maintenance and support contracts Power by the hour contracts\n\nSome maintenance and support contracts cover the airworthiness of engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment. The invoicing of these contracts is based on the number of flight hours or landings of the goods concerned by these contracts.\n\nThe di/fferent services included within each of these contracts consist of a unique performance obligation due to the existing interdependence between the services within the execution of these contracts.\n\nThe revenue is recognized: (i)/uni00A0if the level of completion can reliably be measured; and (ii)/uni00A0if the costs incurred and costs to achieve the contract can reliably be measured.\n\nAs there is a continuous transfer of the control of these services, the revenue from these contracts is recognized as the costs are incurred. As long as the margin on the contract cannot be measured in a reliable manner, the revenue will only be recognized at the level of the costs incurred.\n\nForecast margins on the contracts are assessed through the forecast future cash flows that take into account the obligations and factors inherent to the contracts as well as other internal parameters to the contract selected using historical and/or forecast data.",

Inversely, any revenue that has been recognized but not yet invoiced is recorded under assets on the balance sheet at the year-end.\n\n## Sales of spare parts repair and labor - Time & Material contracts\n\nThese services which relate to engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment, are generally short term.\n\n## 3.7/emspace Loyalty  programs\n\nThe airlines of the Group have a common frequent flyer program 'Flying Blue'. This program enables members to acquire Miles as they fly with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and airline partners and from transactions with non-airline partners (credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies). These Miles entitle members to a range of benefits such as free flights with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and their airline partners or other free services with non-airline partners.\n\nMiles are considered as separate elements of a sale of a ticket with multiple elements and one part of the price of the initial sale of the ticket is allocated to these Miles and deferred until the Group's commitments relating to these Miles have been met.\n\nThey consist of a unique performance obligation. The revenue is recognized as costs are incurred.\n\n## Third-party  procurement\n\nThe Group also purchases equipment on behalf of third-parties. In this situation, the revenue recognition method is as follows:\n\n- -  when the Group serves as a broker between its suppliers and end customers, the Group acts as an agent and hence, recognizes the margin that results from this operation as revenue;\n- -  when the Group puts in place Sale & Lease back agreements, the Group recognizes the proceeds on disposal as well as a net book value.\n\nThe deferred amount due in relation to the acquisition of Miles by members is estimated:\n\n- -  according to the fair value of the Miles, defined as the amount for which the benefits could be sold separately;\n- -  after taking into account the redemption rate, corresponding to the probability that the Miles will be used by members, using a statistical method.\n\nWith regard to the re-invoicing of Miles between the partners in the program, the margins realized on sales of these Miles are recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\n## 3.8/emspace Distinction between income from current operations and income from operating activities\n\nThe Group considers it relevant to the understanding of its financial performance to present in the income statement a subtotal within the 'income from operating activities'. This subtotal, entitled 'Income from current operations', excludes unusual elements that do not have predictive value due to their nature, frequency and/or materiality, as defined in recommendation No. 2013-03/uni00A0from the France's accounting standards authority.\n\nSuch elements are as follows:\n\n- -  sales of aircraft equipment and disposals of other assets;\n- -  accelerated aircraft phase-out;\n- -  income from the disposal of subsidiaries and a/ffiliates;\n- -  restructuring costs when they are significant;\n- -  modification of pension plans;\n- -  significant and infrequent elements such as the recognition of badwill in the income statement, the recording of an impairment loss on goodwill and significant provisions for litigation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3.9/emspace Aggregates used within the framework of financial communication\n\nEBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization): by excluding the main line of the income statement which does not involve cash disbursement ('Amortization, depreciation and provision') from income from current operations, EBITDA provides a simple indicator of the cash generated by the Group's current operational activities. It is thus commonly used for the calculation of the financial coverage and enterprise value ratios.\n\nOperating free cash-flow : this corresponds to the net cash-flow from operating activities net of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, plus the proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. It does not include the other cash flows linked to investment operations, particularly investments in subsidiaries and other financial assets and net cash-flow from the operating activities of discontinued operations.\n\nOperating free cash-flow adjusted : this corresponds to operating free cash-flow net of the payment of lease debts.\n\n## 3.10/emspace Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the equity holders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by the average number of shares outstanding during the period. The average number of shares outstanding does not include treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the equity holders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, adjusted for the effects of dilutive instrument exercise, by the average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the e/ffect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.\n\n## 3.11/emspace Financial  instruments\n\n## Valuation of trade receivables and non-current financial assets\n\nTrade receivables, loans and other non-current financial assets are considered to be assets issued by the Group and are initially recorded at fair value. They are subsequently valued using the amortized cost method. In addition, they are written o/ff based on the expected loss.\n\nRegarding the impairment of trade receivables, the Group has chosen the simplified method approach in that the automated customer invoicing and settlement processes for the Passenger and Cargo businesses significantly limit the credit risk. The Group also uses credit insurance to reduce the risk of potential default regarding trade receivables concerning the clients of the Maintenance activity.\n\nThe Group considers that the change in credit risk on the non-current financial assets since their initial recognition is limited due to the current selection criteria (e.g. type of instrument, counterparty rating and maturity). The impairment recorded by the Group consists of the expect credit loss over the 12/uni00A0months following the closing date.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are booked as of the transaction date.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity securities qualifying as equity instruments are recorded at fair value in the Group's balance sheet. For publicly-traded securities, the fair value is considered to be the market price at the closing date. For non-quoted securities, the valuation is made on the basis of the financial statements of the entity.\n\nThe valuation of equity instruments is either in fair value through the income statement or in fair value through other comprehensive income:\n\n- -  when the instrument is deemed a cash investment, i.e. it is held for the purposes of monetary transactions, its revaluations are recorded in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n- -  when the instrument is deemed to be a business investment, i.e. it is held for strategic reasons (as it mainly consists of investments in companies whose activity is very close to that of the Group) its revaluations are recorded in 'Other comprehensive income' non-recyclable. Dividends are recorded in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the risks incurred on shares, exchange rates, changes in interest rates or fuel prices and the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme).\n\nForward currency contracts and options are used to hedge exposure to exchange rates.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Most of the swaps traded convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.\n\nThe exposure to fuel risk is hedged by swaps or options on jet fuel, diesel or Brent.\n\nFinally, the risk related to the ETS is hedged by forwards.\n\nMost of these derivatives are classified as hedging instruments if the derivative is eligible as a hedging instrument and if the hedging relationship are documented as required by IFRS/uni00A09 'Financial Instruments'.\n\nThese derivative instruments are recorded on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for the market value of the Group's credit risk (DVA) and the credit risk of the counterparty (CVA). The calculation of the credit risk follows a common model based on default probabilities from CDS counterparties. The method of accounting for changes in fair value depends on the classification of the derivative instruments.\n\nThere are three classifications:\n\n## Derivatives classified as fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded through the income statement and o/ffset within the limit of its e/ffective portion against the changes in the fair value of the underlying item (asset, liability or firm commitment), which are also recognized through the income statement.\n\n## Derivatives classified as cash-flow hedge\n\nThe changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion and are reclassified as income when the hedged element a/ffects earnings. The ine/ffective portion is recorded as financial income or losses until the termination of the derivative. When the termination occurs, the residual ine/ffective portion is recycled on the hedged item.\n\n## Derivatives classified as trading\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as financial income or losses.\n\nFor options, only the intrinsic risk can be hedged. The time value is excluded as it is considered as a cost of hedging. The change in fair value of the option time value is recognized in other comprehensive income in so far as it relates to the hedged item. When the latter occurs (if the hedged item is transaction related), the change in fair value is then recycled and impacts the hedged item or is amortized over the hedging period (if the hedged item is time-related).\n\nThe di/fference in time value between non-aligned structured options and the related 'vanilla' ('aligned') options is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\nRegarding forward contracts, only the spot component is considered as a hedging instrument, since the forward element is considered as a hedging cost and accounted for similarly to the option time value.\n\nThe currency swap basis spread is also excluded from the hedging instrument and considered a hedging cost.\n\n## Convertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are deemed to be financial instruments comprising two components: a bond component recorded as debt and a stock component recorded in equity. The bond component is equal to the discounted value of all the coupons due on the bond at the rate of a simple bond that would have been issued at the same time as the convertible bond. The value of the stock component recorded in the Group's equity is calculated by the di/fference between this value and the bond's nominal value at issuance.\n\nThe di/fference between the financial expense recorded and the amounts e/ffectively paid out is added, at each closing date, to the amount of the debt component so that, at maturity, the amount to be repaid if there is no conversion equals the redemption price.\n\n## Financial assets, cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets include financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (French mutual funds such as SICAVs and FCPs, certificates, etc.) that the Group intends to sell in the near term to realize a capital gain, or that are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments managed collectively and for which there is evidence of a practice of short-term profit taking. They are classified in the balance sheet as current financial assets.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Financial debt\n\nFinancial debt is recognized initially at fair value. Subsequent to the initial measurement, financial debt is recorded at its net book value for bonds, based on amortized cost calculated using the e/ffective interest rate for the other financial debt.\n\nUnder this principle, any redemption and issue premiums, as well as issue costs, are recorded as debt in the balance sheet and amortized as financial income or expense over the life of the loans using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair values are classified using a scale which reflects the nature of the market data used to make the valuations.\n\nThis scale has three levels of fair value:\n\n## 3.12/emspace Goodwill\n\nGoodwill corresponds, at the acquisition date, to the aggregation of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree minus the net amounts (usually at fair value) of the identifiable amounts acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\n\nFor acquisitions prior to April/uni00A01, 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under French GAAP. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations taking place prior to April/uni00A01, 2004 were not modified at the time international standards were adopted, on April/uni00A01, 2004, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A01 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'.\n\n## 3.13/emspace Intangible  assets\n\nIntangible assets are recorded at initial cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIT development costs are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. The Group has the tools required to enable the tracking by project of all the stages of development, and, in particular, the internal and external costs directly related to each project during its development phase.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives from the date they are available for use.\n\nThe KLM and Transavia brands and slots (takeo/ff and landing) acquired by the Group as part of the acquisition of KLM are identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. They are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. If necessary, impairment as described in Note/uni00A03.16/uni00A0is recorded.\n\nLevel/uni00A01 : Fair value calculated from the exchange rate/price quoted on an active market for identical instruments,\n\nLevel/uni00A02 : Fair value calculated from valuation methods based on observable data such as the prices of similar assets and liabilities or scopes quoted on an active market,\n\nLevel/uni00A03 : Fair value calculated from valuation methods which rely completely or in part on non-observable data such as prices on an inactive market or multiple-based valuation for non-quoted securities.\n\nGoodwill is valued in the functional currency of the entity acquired. It is recorded as an asset in the balance sheet.\n\nIt is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists. As discussed in Note/uni00A03.16, once recorded the impairment may not subsequently be reversed.\n\nWhen the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration transferred, there is negative goodwill which is recognized and immediately reversed in the Group's income statement.\n\nAt the time of the sale of a subsidiary or an equity a/ffiliate, the amount of the goodwill attributable to the entity sold is included in the calculation of the income from the sale.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, airlines have been subject to the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) market regulations as described in Note/uni00A03.22 and the 'Risks on carbon credit' paragraph in Note/uni00A036.2.4. As such, the Group is required to purchase/uni00A0CO2 quotas to o/ffset its emissions. The Group records the/uni00A0CO2 quotas as intangible assets. These assets are not depreciable.\n\nIntangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following periods:\n\n| Software                            | 1/uni00A0to 5/uni00A0years          |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Licenses                            | Duration of contract                |\n| Information Technology developments | Up to 20/uni00A0years/thinspace (1) |",

        "page_content": "## 3.14/emspace Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Principles applicable\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition or manufacturing cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nPursuant to IAS/uni00A023, the financial interest attributed to advance payments made on account of investments in aircraft and other significant assets under construction is capitalized and added to the cost of the asset concerned. As prepayments on investments are not financed by specific loans, the Group uses the average interest rate on the current unallocated loans of the period.\n\nMaintenance costs are recorded as expenses during the period when incurred, with the exception of programs that extend the useful life of the asset or increase its value, which are then capitalized (e.g. maintenance on aircraft airframes and engines including parts with limited useful lives).\n\n## Flight equipment\n\nThe purchase price of aircraft equipment is denominated in foreign currencies. It is translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, if applicable, at the hedging price assigned to it. Manufacturers' discounts, if any, are deducted from the value of the related asset.\n\nAircraft are depreciated using the straight-line method over their average estimated useful life which is between 20 and 25/uni00A0years for all types of aircraft except in specific cases.\n\n## 3.15/emspace Lease  contracts\n\nLease contracts, as defined by IFRS/uni00A016 'Leases', are recorded in the balance sheet and lead to the recognition of:\n\n- -  an asset representing a right of use of the asset leased during the lease term of the contract and;\n- -  a liability related to the payment obligation.\n\nAssets (aeronauticals and buildings) which are not eligible for an accounting treatment according to IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0are those:\n\n- -  which were acquired by the airline or for which the airline took a major share in the acquisition process from the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and;\n- -  which, in view of the contractual conditions, will almost certainly be purchased at the end of the lease term.\n\nSince these financing arrangements are 'in substance purchases' and not leases, the related liability is considered as a financial debt under IFRS/uni00A09 and the asset, as an asset, according to IAS/uni00A016.\n\nDuring the operating cycle, and when establishing fleet replacement plans, the Group reviews whether the amortizable base or the useful life should be adjusted and, if necessary, determines whether a residual value should be recognized and the adequate useful life.\n\nAny major aircraft airframe and engine overhaul including parts with limited useful lives are treated as a separate asset component with the cost capitalized and depreciated over the period between the date of acquisition and the next major overhaul.\n\nAircraft spare parts (maintenance business) which enable the use of the fleet are recorded as fixed assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated residual lifetime of the aircraft/engine type on the world market. The useful life is limited to a maximum of 30/uni00A0years.\n\n## Other property, plant and equipment\n\nOther property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives as follows:\n\nBuildings\n\n20/uni00A0to 50/uni00A0years\n\nFixtures and fittings\n\n8/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nFlight simulators\n\n10/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nEquipment and tooling\n\n3/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years\n\n## Measurement of the right-of use asset\n\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost and comprises:\n\n- -  the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, to which is added, if applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\n- -  where relevant, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee for the conclusion of the contract. These are incremental costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded;\n- -  estimated costs for restoration and dismantling of the leased asset according to the terms of the contract. At the date of the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset, the lessee adds to these costs, the discounted amount of the restoration and dismantling costs through a return obligation liability or provision as described in Note/uni00A03.20. These costs also include maintenance obligations with regard to the engines and airframes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing the initial recognition, the right-of-use asset must be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets (lease term for the rental component, flight hours for the component relating to engine maintenance or on a straight-line basis for the component relating to the airframe until the date of the next major overhaul).\n\n## Measurement of the lease liability\n\nAt the commencement date, the lease liability is recognized for an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\n\nAmounts involved in the measurement of the lease liability are:\n\n- -  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments; meaning that even if they are variable in form, they are in-substance unavoidable);\n- -  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or the rate in force at the lease commencement date;\n- -  amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- -  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured based on a process similar to the amortized cost method using the discount rate:\n\n- -  the liability is increased by the accrued interests resulting from the discounting of the lease liability, at the beginning of the lease period;\n- -  less payments made.\n\nThe interest cost for the period as well as variable payments, not taken into account in the initial measurement of the lease liability and incurred over the relevant period, are recognized as costs.\n\nIn addition, the lease liability may be remeasured in the following situations:\n\n- -  change in the lease term;\n- -  modification related to the assessment of the reasonably certain nature (or not) of the exercise of an option;\n- -  remeasurement linked to the residual value guarantees;\n- -  adjustment to the rates and indices according to which the rents are calculated when rent adjustments occur.\n\n## Types of capitalized lease contracts\n\n## Aircraft lease contracts\n\nFor the aircraft lease contracts fulfilling the capitalization criteria defined by IFRS/uni00A016, the lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period of each contracts except in cases where the Group is reasonably certain of exercising the renewal options contractually foreseen. For example, this may be the case if substantial cabin customization has taken place whereas the\n\nresidual lease term is significantly shorter than the useful life of the cabins. The accounting treatment of the maintenance obligations related to leased aircraft is outlined in Note/uni00A03.20.\n\nAircraft lease contracts concluded by the Group do not include guaranteed value clauses for leased assets.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit interest rate induced by the contractual elements and residual market values. This rate is easy to calculate due to the availability of current and future data concerning the value of aircraft. It is recalculated on each contract renewal (prolongation). The implied rate of the contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregated present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value. This present value should be equal to the sum of the fair value of the leased asset and any initial direct costs of the lessor.\n\nSince most of the aircraft lease contracts are denominated in US dollars, starting from January/uni00A01, 2018 the Group put in place a cash-flow hedge for its US dollar revenues via the lease debt in US dollars. Consequently, the revaluation of the Group's debt at the closing rate is accounted for in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## Real-estate lease contracts\n\nBased on its analysis, the Group has identified lease contracts according to the standard concerning surface areas rented in its hubs, lease contracts on building dedicated to the maintenance business, customized lounges in airports other than hubs and lease contracts on o/ffice buildings.\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period, with most of the contracts not including renewal options. The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment. This rate is achieved by the addition of the interest rate on government bonds and the credit spread. The coupon on government bonds is specific to the location, currency, period and maturity. The definition of the spread curve is based upon reference points, each point consisting of asset financing on assets other than aircraft.\n\n## Other-assets lease contracts\n\nThe main lease contracts identified correspond to company cars, pools of spare parts and engines. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period. Most of the contracts do not provide renewal options. The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature debt. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment (for the method used to determine the incremental borrowing rate, see the 'Real estate lease contracts' paragraph above).",

Within the Group, they mainly relate to leases of:\n\n- - surface areas in our hubs with a reciprocal notice-period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- - accommodations for expatriates with a notice period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- - spare engines for a duration equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months.\n\n## Low value lease contracts\n\nLow-value lease contracts concern assets with a value equal to or less than US$5,000. Within the Group, these include, notably, lease contracts on printers, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.\n\n## 3.16/emspace Impairment  test\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A036 'Impairment of Assets', tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, right-of-use assets and goodwill are tested for depreciation if there is an indication of impairment, and those with an indefinite useful life are tested at least once a year on September/uni00A030.\n\nFor this test, the Group deems the recoverable value of the asset to be the higher of the market value less cost of disposal and its value in use. The latter is determined according to the discounted future cash-flow method, estimated based on budgetary assumptions approved by management, using an actuarial rate which corresponds to the weighted average cost of the Group's capital and a growth rate which reflects the market hypotheses for the appropriate activity.\n\n## 3.17/emspace Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of their cost and net realizable value.\n\nThe cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location. These costs include the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group qualifies as sale and leaseback transactions, operations which lead to a sale according to IFRS/uni00A015. More specifically, a sale is considered as such if there is no repurchase option on the goods at the end of the lease term.\n\n## Transactions deemed to be a sale\n\nIf the sale by the vendor-lessee is qualified as a sale according to IFRS/uni00A015, the vendor-lessee must: (i)/uni00A0de-recognize the underlying asset, (ii)/uni00A0recognize a right-of-use asset equal to the retained portion of the net carrying amount of the asset sold.\n\n## Transaction not deemed to be a sale\n\nIf the sale by the vendor-lessee is not qualified as a sale according to IFRS/uni00A015, the vendor-lessee maintains the goods transferred on its balance sheet and recognizes a financial liability equal to the disposal price (received from the buyer-lessor).\n\nThe depreciation tests are carried out individually for each asset, except for those assets to which it is not possible to attach independent cash flows. In this case, these assets are regrouped within the CGU to which they belong and it is this which is tested. The CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments: network, maintenance, leisure and others which are homogeneous asset groups whose use generates identifiable cash inflows.\n\nWhen the recoverable value of an asset or CGU is inferior to its net book value, an impairment is recognized. The impairment of a CGU is charged in the first instance to goodwill, the remainder being charged to the other assets which comprise the CGU, prorated to their net book value.\n\ndirect and indirect production costs incurred under normal operating conditions.\n\nInventories are valued on a weighted average basis.\n\nThe net realizable value of the inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.",

The commitments are covered either by insurance or pension funds or by provisions recorded on the balance sheet as and when rights are acquired by employees.\n\nThe Group recognizes in 'other comprehensive income' all the actuarial gains or losses relating to post-employment plans, the di/fferential between the actual return and the expected return on the pension assets, and the impact of any asset ceiling.\n\nWhen a defined benefit pension plan is converted into a defined contribution pension plan or closed, the amounts recorded in the other comprehensive income will be reclassified in the other reserves.\n\nThe actuarial gains or losses relating to termination benefits (mainly jubilees) are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe Group recognizes all the costs linked to pensions (defined contribution pension plans and defined benefit pension plans) in the income from current operations (salaries and related costs).\n\n## Specific information related to the recognition of some pension plan assets\n\nPension plans in The Netherlands are generally subject to minimum funding requirements ('MFR') that can involve the recognition of pension surpluses. These pension surpluses constituted by the KLM sub group are recognized in the balance sheet according to the IFRIC/uni00A014/uni00A0interpretation (IAS/uni00A019 'The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction').\n\n## 3.20/emspace Return obligation liability and provision on leased aircraft\n\nThe Group recognizes return obligation liabilities and provisions in respect of the required maintenance obligations within the framework of the leasing of aircraft from lessors. The constitution of these return obligation liabilities and provisions depends on the type of maintenance obligations to fulfill before returning these aircraft to the lessors: overhaul and restoration work, airframe and engine potential reconstitution as well as the replacement of limited life parts.\n\n## Overhaul and restoration works (not depending on aircraft utilization)\n\nCosts resulting from work required to be performed just before returning aircraft to the lessors, such as painting of the shell or aircraft overhaul ('C Check') are recognized as provisions as of the inception of the contract. The counterpart of these provisions is booked as a complement through the initial book value of the aircraft right-of-use assets. This complement to the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term.\n\n## Airframe and engine potentials reconstitution (depending on the utilization of the aircraft and its engines)\n\nThe airframe and the engine potentials as well as the limited life parts are recognized as a complement to the right-of-use assets since they are considered as fully-fledged components, as distinct from the physical components which are the engine and the airframe. These components are the counterparts of the return obligation liability, recognized in its totality at the inception of the contract. When maintenance events aimed at reconstituting these potentials or replacing the limited life parts take place, the costs incurred are capitalized. These potentials and the limited life parts are depreciated over the period of use of the underlying assets (flight hours for the engine potentials component, straight-line for the airframe potentials component and cycles for the limited life parts).",

        "page_content": "## 3.21/emspace Other  provisions\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision in the balance sheet when it has an existing legal or implicit obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The amounts recorded as provisions are discounted when the e/ffect of the passage of time is material. The e/ffect of the time\n\n## 3.22/emspace Emission Trading Scheme\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, European airlines have been included in the scope of companies subject to the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). In the absence of IFRS standards or interpretations governing ETS accounting, the Group has adopted the accounting treatment known as the 'netting approach'.\n\nAccording to this approach, the quotas are recognized as intangible assets in the following way:\n\n- -  free quotas allocated by the State are valued at nil; and\n- -  quotas purchased on the market are accounted at their acquisition cost.\n\n## 3.23/emspace Capital increase costs\n\nCapital increase costs are deducted from paid-in capital.\n\n## 3.24/emspace Current and deferred taxes\n\nThe Group records deferred taxes using the balance sheet liability method, providing for any temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for the exceptions described in IAS/uni00A012 'Income Taxes'.\n\nThe tax rates used are those enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nNet deferred tax balances are determined on the basis of each entity's tax position.\n\nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary di/fferences and tax losses carried forward are recognized only to the extent it is probable that a future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilized at the tax entity level.\n\nDeferred tax assets corresponding to fiscal losses are recognized as assets given the prospects of recoverability resulting from the budgets and medium-term plans prepared by the Group. The assumptions used are the same as those used for the impairment tests on assets (see Note/uni00A03.16).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvalue of money is presented as a component of 'Other financial income and expenses'.\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized once the Group has established a detailed and formalized restructuring plan which has been announced to the parties concerned.\n\nThese intangible assets are not amortized.\n\nIf the allocated quotas are insufficient to cover the actual emissions then the Group recognizes a provision. This provision is assessed at the acquisition cost for the acquired rights and, for the non-hedged portion, with reference to the market price as of each closing date.\n\nAt the date of the restitution to the State of the quotas corresponding to actual emissions, the provision is written-o/ff in exchange for the intangible assets returned.\n\nA deferred tax liability is also recognized for the undistributed reserves of the equity a/ffiliates.\n\nTaxes payable and/or deferred are recognized in the income statement for the period, unless they are generated by a transaction or event recorded directly in other comprehensive income. In such a case, they are recorded directly in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Impact of the Contribution on Added Value of Enterprises\n\nThe CAVE (Contribution on Added Value of Enterprises/Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout\u00e9e des Entreprises - CVAE) is calculated by the application of a tax rate to the added value generated by the company during the year. As the added value is a net amount of income and expenses, the CAVE meets the definition of a tax on profits as set out in IAS/uni00A012.2. Consequently, the expense relating to the CAVE is presented under the line 'Income taxes'.",

        "page_content": "## 3.25/emspace Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nAssets or groups of assets held for sale meet the criteria for this classification if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale rather than through their continuing use. This condition is considered to be met when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or group of assets intended for sale) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to a plan to sell, with the expectation that the sale will be realized within a period of twelve months from the date on which the asset or group of assets were classified as assets held for sale.\n\nThe Group determines on each closing date whether any assets or groups of assets meet the above criteria and presents such assets, if any, as 'non-current assets held for sale'.\n\nAny liabilities related to these assets are also presented on a separate line in liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nAssets and groups of assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their book value or their fair value minus exit costs. As of the date of such a classification, the asset is no longer depreciated.\n\nThe results from discontinued operations are presented separately from the results from continuing operations in the income statement.\n\n## NOTE 4/emspaceCHANGE IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2020\n\nNo significant acquisitions or disposals took place during 2020.\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2019\n\nNo significant acquisitions or disposals took place during 2019.\n\n## NOTE 5/emspace INFORMATION BY ACTIVITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREA\n\n## Business segments\n\nThe segment information is prepared on the basis of internal management data communicated to the Executive Committee, the Group's principal operational decision-making body.\n\nThe Group is organized around the following segments:\n\nNetwork : The revenues from this segment, which are composed of Passenger network and Cargo operating revenues primarily come from passenger transportation services on scheduled flights with the Group's airline code (excluding Transavia), including flights operated by other airlines under code-sharing agreements. They also include commissions paid by SkyTeam alliance partners, code-sharing revenues, revenues from excess baggage and airport services supplied by the Group to third-party airlines and services linked to IT systems.\n\nThe revenues also including income from freight transport on flights under the companies' codes, including flights operated by other partner airlines under code-sharing agreements. Other cargo revenues are derived principally from sales of cargo\n\ncapacity to third parties and transportation of shipments on behalf of the Goup by other airlines.\n\nMaintenance : Third-party maintenance revenues are generated through maintenance services provided to other airlines and customers worldwide.\n\nTransavia : The revenues from this segment come from the 'low-cost' activity realized by Transavia.\n\nOther : The revenues from this segment come from various services provided by the Group and not covered by the four segments mentioned above.\n\nThe results of the business segments are those that are either directly attributable or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to these business segments. Amounts allocated to business segments mainly correspond to the EBITDA, current operating income and to the income from operating activities. Other elements of the income statement are presented in the 'non-allocated' column.\n\nInter-segment transactions are evaluated based on normal market conditions.",

The related impact amounts to \u20ac (553) million as of December/uni00A031, 2020\n\nAt the end of December/uni00A02020, five A380 aircraft are still owned and four are leased.\n\n## Phase-out of KLM's Boeing 747 aircraft\n\nA \u20ac19/uni00A0million impairment has been recorded to revalue the eight KLM Boeing 747s at their estimated market value.\n\n## Phase-out of Air/uni00A0France's A340 aircraft\n\nA \u20ac72/uni00A0million impairment has been recorded to revalue the four Air/uni00A0France A340 aircraft at their estimated market value following the phase-out decision on May/uni00A06, 2020.\n\nAt the end of December/uni00A02020, one A340 aircraft is still owned.\n\n## Phase-out of HOP! CRJ aircraft\n\nThis line includes the impact of the early phase-out of the 25/uni00A0CRJ aircraft from the HOP! fleet for \u20ac(26) million. Depreciation slopes have been revised so that the net book value as of the date of the aircraft's phase-out expected in 2022 converges with the estimated realizable value.\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2019\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2019, this mainly includes the new provision relating to a Voluntary Departure Plan for Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff.\n\n## Impairment of fleet\n\nThis line corresponds to the impact of the early phase-out of the A380 aircraft from the Air/uni00A0France fleet for \u20ac126/uni00A0million in 2019. This significant non-recurring operation is considered by the Group to be a disposal of assets and a restructuring of the business activities. It includes:\n\n- -  the di/fference between the initial depreciation plan, i.e. an expected 20-year operational life for this type of aircraft and the accelerated depreciation following the early phase-out, amounting to \u20ac52/uni00A0million. Depreciation slopes have been revised so that the net book value as of the date of the aircraft's phase-out converges with the estimated realizable value;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period. However, there is a limitation on the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year to 50/uni00A0per cent of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros. The recoverability of the deferred tax losses went from seven to five years as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and consistent with the Group's visibility.\n\nFollowing the current Covid-19 crisis, the prospects of recoverability within the five-year horizon have been revised downwards leading to a write-o/ff of \u20ac408/uni00A0million of deferred tax assets for tax losses compared to the opening position of the fiscal year. Moreover, \u20ac1.375/uni00A0million of deferred tax assets on fiscal losses have not been recognized for the yearly period ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Dutch fiscal group\n\nIn The Netherlands, the tax rate is 25/uni00A0per cent in 2020 and would have been lowered to 21.7/uni00A0per cent in 2021. Following the current Covid-19 crises the Dutch Government announced that the tax rate remains 25/uni00A0per cent going forward. Under income tax law in The Netherlands, the maximum future period for utilising tax losses carried forward is currently six years. As from January/uni00A01, 2022, this period is likely to become indefinite for tax losses. However, the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year is limited to 50/uni00A0per cent of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros. The Dutch Parliament has not formalized these changes in the Dutch tax law yet.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the Dutch fiscal group has deferred taxes assets on fiscal losses amounting to \u20ac10/uni00A0million, relating to an interest deduction allowance which can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax assets on fiscal loss excluding interest for 2020 amounted to \u20ac352/uni00A0million. KLM has used the carry back facility from 2019, amounting to \u20ac82/uni00A0million. The remaining \u20ac270/uni00A0million of deferred tax assets have not been recognized.\n\n## Other\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, this line mainly includes premiums paid on early reimbursement on part of the bonds with maturity dates in 2021 and 2022. The total premium is \u20ac22/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A02).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tests were realized for all the CGUs on the basis of a five-year Group plan, presented by the management to the Board early December/uni00A02020.\n\nRevenues (network, leisure and maintenance), costs and investments forecasts are based on reasonable hypothesis and are the management's best estimates. They are subject to the uncertainties related to the current situation. They forecasts a return to the level of 2019 activity in 2024 and lie on savings related to pursuance of reorganization/restructuring plans set up by the Group.\n\nThe discount rate used for the test corresponds to the Group's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This stood at 6.3/uni00A0per cent as at December/uni00A031, 2020 versus 5.9/uni00A0per cent as at December/uni00A031, 2019. Growth rate for revenues varies between 2 and 5/uni00A0per cent depending on the CGUs over the intermediary period (2026-2032). Long term growth rate for the calculation of the terminal value is 1/uni00A0per cent.\n\nAfter the aforementioned test, no impairment was recognized on the Group's CGUs, including with a WACC 100-basis point higher combined with a decrease of 100-basis point in the long-term growth rate or a decrease of 100-basis point in the target operating margin.\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2019\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2019, no impairment was recognized on the Group's CGUs.",

With about 36/uni00A0establishments in 19/uni00A0countries and approximately 10,500/uni00A0employees, Servair has a leading position in Paris\n\nand Africa. Servair numbers more than a hundred air carrier customers worldwide and proposes a set of services grouped around three core businesses: inflight and collective catering, airport services and additional services like engineering and the integration of services.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of gategroup by HNA on December/uni00A022, 2016, Air/uni00A0France and gategroup finalized the agreement for the sale to gategroup of 49.99% of the Servair share capital. On conclusion of this transaction, the operational control of Servair was transferred to gategroup in application of the governance planned in the agreements between Air/uni00A0France and gategroup. As a consequence, the Servair group has been consolidated according to the equity method since December/uni00A031, 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This pension agreement is expected to have the characteristics of a collective defined contribution scheme. It will require before implementation, amongst others, the approval of the Board of the KLM Ground pension fund and should qualify as a defined contribution scheme under IFRS. It is expected that in the course of 2021 these conditions will be met and subsequent derecognition of the related pension asset.\n\nAs per December/uni00A031, 2020, the pension plan for Ground Sta/ff in the KLM entity is a defined benefit plan based on average salary with reversion to the spouse on the beneficiary's death. The retirement age as foreseen by the plan is 68/uni00A0years.\n\nSince September/uni00A01, 2018, the Board of the pension fund has been composed of members appointed by the employer, employees and an external expert. The Board is fully responsible for the execution of the plan. KLM can only control the financing agreement between KLM and the pension fund.\n\nTo satisfy the requirements of Dutch regulations and the rules set between the employer and the Board of the pension fund, the plan imposes a mandatory funding level of approximately 125/uni00A0per cent of the projected long-term obligation. The projection of these commitments is calculated according to local funding rules. The mandatory funding ratio is based on the new Financial Assessment Framework (nFTK) in force since January/uni00A01, 2015. One impact of the nFTK is a requirement for higher minimum solvency levels. On the other hand, pension funds have more time to recover from immediate and material shortfalls through a rolling ten-year recovery plan that also includes the projected future return on investment.\n\nBased on the criteria under Dutch Pension Law, as set by the Dutch Central Bank, the funding ratio of the Ground Sta/ff pension fund is 97.9/uni00A0per cent as of December/uni00A031, 2020 versus 108.2/uni00A0per cent as of December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nIf the coverage ratio is under the funding ratio detailed above, the pension funds are required to implement a recovery plan that aims for compliance with the 125/uni00A0per cent threshold within ten years and includes projected future returns on investment. As a consequence, the recovery plan for the Ground Sta/ff plan was updated as of April/uni00A01, 2020. If the threshold is not reached within ten years, additional contributions are payable by the company and the employee (transitional period of 12/uni00A0years as of 2015).\n\nThe amount of regular and additional employer contributions is not limited. Any additional employee contributions are limited to two per cent of the pensionable contribution basis.\n\nA reduction in contributions is possible if the pension indexation is fully funded. Furthermore, according to Dutch Pension Law, this reduction is not limited and can be realized either by a reimbursement in contributions, or a reduction in future contributions. Since 2015, the new Dutch fiscal rules have foreseen a maximum pensionable salary of \u20ac 110,111 as of January/uni00A01, 2020, and a lower future accrual rate for pensions.\n\nThe return on plan assets, the discount rate used to value the obligations and the longevity and characteristics of the active population are the main factors potentially impacting both the coverage ratio and the level of the regular contribution for future pension accrual. The regular contribution for the yearly pension accrual is limited to 22/uni00A0per cent of the pension base.\n\nThe funds, fully dedicated to the KLM Group companies, are mainly invested in bonds, equities and real estate. The management of most of the assets is outsourced to a private institution, under a service contract.\n\nThe required funding of this pension plan also includes a bu/ffer against the following risks: interest rate risks, equity risks, currency risks, credit risks, actuarial risks and real estate risks. For example, to reduce the sensitivity to a decline in interest rates, a substantial part of the sensitivity to an interest rate shock on all maturities is covered by an interest hedge.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France pension plan (CRAF) - France\n\nThe employees covered by this plan are the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff a/ffiliated to the CRAF until December/uni00A031, 1992.\n\nThe participants receive, or will receive on retirement, an additional pension paid monthly or a lump sum based on the monthly annuity and definitively calculated based on the data known as of December/uni00A031, 1992 and expressed in the form of points. The value of each point is adjusted every year based on the weighted increases seen in the CNAV and ARRCO schemes over the last twelve months.\n\nUntil 2009, the CRAF had the legal form of a supplementary pension institution (pursuant to the 'Code de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale'). With this status, the CRAF was responsible, on behalf of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff employed in France, for managing the pension plan resulting from the merging of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff plan with the mandatory pension plan for the private sector.\n\nFollowing the 2003 law on pension reform foreseeing the disappearance of supplementary pension institutions as of December/uni00A031, 2009, the CRAF's Board of Directors opted to transform it into an institution managing supplementary pensions. The CRAF is now responsible for the administrative functions linked to the plan.\n\nThe pension rights were not amended by this reform. Air/uni00A0France is directly responsible for the pension obligations.",

        "page_content": "As of December/uni00A031, 2009, all the funds managed by the CRAF had been transferred to two insurance companies. On December/uni00A031, 2012, one of the insurance contracts was terminated and its funds were transferred to the other, which thus became the only insurer. This guarantees a capital of 17/uni00A0per cent equal to the amount of capital invested in units of account in its collective fund, this percentage being automatically set to increase over time.\n\nThe annual payments made by Air/uni00A0France to the insurance company are governed by the agreement signed with the employee representative bodies on December/uni00A014, 2009. The minimum annual payment defined by this agreement amounts to \u20ac32.5/uni00A0million as long as the life annuity guaranteed by the insurer does not reach 85/uni00A0per cent of the benefits payments for this plan without future revaluations. If the value of the funds falls below 50/uni00A0per cent of the total obligations calculated for funding purposes, Air/uni00A0France is required to make an additional payment to achieve a minimum 50/uni00A0per cent coverage rate.\n\nThe funds are invested in bonds, equities and general assets of the insurance company. Studies of assets/liabilities allocation are carried out regularly, to verify the relevance of the investment strategy.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France end of service benefit plan (ICS) - France\n\nPursuant to French regulations and the company agreements, every employee receives an end of service indemnity on retirement.\n\nIn France, this indemnity depends on the number of years of service, the professional category of the employee (flight deck crew, cabin crew, ground sta/ff, agent, technician and executive) and, in some cases, on the age of the employee at retirement.\n\nOn retirement, employees consequently receive an end of service indemnity based on their final salaries over the last twelve-months and on their seniority. The indemnity is only payable to employees on their retirement date.\n\nThere is no mandatory minimum funding requirement for this scheme. Air/uni00A0France has nevertheless signed contracts with three insurance companies to partly pre-finance the plan. Air/uni00A0France has sole responsibility for payment of the indemnities, but remains free to make payments to these insurance companies.\n\nThe relevant outsourced funds are invested in bonds and equities.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension plan and the two French plans presented above represented a respective 74/uni00A0per cent and 16/uni00A0per cent of the Group's defined benefit obligation and 89/uni00A0per cent and 5/uni00A0per cent of the Group's pension plan assets.\n\n## 28.2/emspace Description of the actuarial assumptions and related sensitivities\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's benefit obligation were made as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThese calculations include:\n\n- -  assumptions on sta/ff turnover and the life expectancy of the plan beneficiaries;\n- -  assumptions on salary and pension increases;\n- -  assumptions on retirement ages varying from 50/uni00A0to 68/uni00A0years depending on the localization and applicable laws;\n- -  inflation rates determined with reference to the inflation swaps applied to the Group's cash-flows and based on the duration of the schemes:\n\n| As of December/uni00A031                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone - Duration 10/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years | 1.25%  | 1.30%  |\n| Euro zone - Duration 15/uni00A0years   and beyond | 1.35%  | 1.40%  |\n\n- -  discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations.\n\nThe discount rates for the different geographical areas are thus determined based on the duration of each plan, taking into account the average trend in interest rates on investment grade bonds, observed on the main available indices. In some countries, where the market in this type of bond is not su/fficiently broad, the discount rate is determined with reference to government bonds. Most of the Group's benefit obligations are located in the Euro zone, where the discount rates used are as follows:\n\n| As of December/uni00A031                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone - Duration 10/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years | 0.45%  | 0.75%  |\n| Euro zone - Duration 15/uni00A0years   and beyond | 0.75%  | 1.15%  |\n\nThe duration of between 10 and 15/uni00A0years mainly concerns the plans located in France while the duration of 15/uni00A0years and beyond mainly concerns the KLM Ground Sta/ff plan located in The Netherlands.\n\n- -  discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the service cost.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2016, by using adequate flows, the Group has refined its calculations on the discount rate used for the service-cost calculation.

The weighted average duration of the obligation is 18.9/uni00A0years.\n\nThe funding, capitalization and matching strategies implemented by the Group are presented in Note/uni00A028.1.\n\nAs indicated above, the fiscal rules for accruing pensions and the new Financial Assessment Framework, as part of the Dutch pension law, in The Netherlands changed as of January/uni00A01, 2015. Amongst other things, this resulted in a requirement for higher\n\nminimum solvency levels. For the Group, the risk could be that, in the event of a long term shortfall of KLM ground sta/ff, based on existing or future financing agreements, KLM could be required to make additional cash payments (the actual funding ratios are presented in Note/uni00A028.1).\n\nFor 2021, this additional payment risk concerning the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension plan is mitigated by the solvency levels and the rolling ten year recovery plan noted since December/uni00A031, 2020.",

On March/uni00A017, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level was \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On May/uni00A029 and 30, 2017 the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The Group has maintained a provision covering the total amount of these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are challenging a decision imposing a \u20ac4/uni00A0million fine before the relevant court. The Group has provisioned the totality of this fine.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the total amount of provisions in connection with proceedings which have yet to give rise to definitive decisions amounts to \u20ac346/uni00A0million.\n\n## 29.1.5/emspace Other  provisions\n\nOther provisions relate principally to provisions for onerous contracts, provisions for the portion of/uni00A0CO2 emissions not covered by the free allocation of quotas and provisions for the dismantling of buildings.\n\n## 29.2/emspace Contingent  liabilities\n\nThe Group is involved in several governmental, judicial and arbitration procedures for which in most cases provisions have not been recorded in the financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting rules. Indeed, with respect to\n\nmost cases the Group is not in a position at this stage in these procedures to give a reliable estimate of the potential loss that would be incurred in connection with these disputes.",

For Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair the main civil claims still pending are those in the Netherlands and in Norway.\n\n## 29.2.2/emspace Litigations concerning anti-trust laws in the passenger sector\n\n## Canada\n\nA civil class action was reinitiated in 2013 by claimants in Ontario against seven airlines including Air/uni00A0France and KLM.

The case has been referred to the investigating chamber of the Paris Court of Appeals and a hearing will be held on March/uni00A04, 2021. Air/uni00A0France has taken note of the position of the Public Prosecutor's O/ffice, which is requesting the referral of Air/uni00A0France and Airbus to the criminal court. Air/uni00A0France, which contests having committed a fault that caused the accident, intends to seek confirmation of the dismissal order issued by the investigating judges. It will now be up to the Investigating Chamber to rule on the matter.\n\n## US Department of Justice investigation related to United States Postal Service\n\nIn March/uni00A02016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) informed Air/uni00A0France and KLM of a civil inquiry regarding contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In September/uni00A02016, a Civil Information Demand from\n\nallege that the defendants participated in a conspiracy in the passenger air transport service from Canada on the crossAtlantic routes, for which they are claiming damages. Air/uni00A0France and KLM strongly deny any participation in such a conspiracy.\n\nthe DOJ has been received seeking certain information relating to these contracts. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act. Air/uni00A0France and KLM are cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n\n## Case brought against KLM by (former) Martinair Cargo pilots\n\nIn 2015, a case was brought against KLM by 152 (former) Martinair airline pilots on the basis that the cargo department of Martinair was transferred to KLM and that all former cockpit crew are entitled to remuneration from KLM, taking into account the Martinair seniority. The lower Court in 2016 and the Court of appeal in 2018 rejected all claims made against KLM. The Martinair airline pilots appealed the 2018 judgment. In November/uni00A02019, the Supreme Court ruled that the judgement of the court of appeal lacked su/fficient motivation and referred the case to another Court of appeal. Proceedings at this court, that will have to reconsider certain arguments that were brought forward by the airline pilots, are pending.\n\nExcept for the matters specified under the paragraphs 29.1 and 29.2, the Group is not aware of any governmental, judicial or arbitration dispute or proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, or that are pending or threatened against it) that could have a significant impact on the Group's financial position, earnings, assets, liabilities or profitability, for a period covering at least the past twelve months.",

As from this date, the fixed JPY interest was reset to 4% per annum applicable on residual notional amount.\n\nThis perpetual loan can be redeemed at KLM's discretion on each fifth anniversary of the first interest payment date, August/uni00A028, 1999. The next repayment option date at Par is therefore set on August/uni00A028, 2024. Note that an indemnity is due if the JPY loan is redeemed in another currency than JPY.\n\nThis loan debt is subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.\n\n## 30.1.2/emspace KLM Perpetual subordinated debt in Swiss francs\n\nThe perpetual subordinated bond debt in Swiss francs was issued by KLM in two tranches, one in 1985 and one in 1986. The initial nominal amount for these two perpetual bonds combined was CHF 500/uni00A0million. Over the years, KLM has proceed several partial buy back transactions to partially redeem debt.\n\nThe total amount now outstanding is CHF 375/uni00A0million, i.e. \u20ac347/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nConcerning the perpetual bond debt issued in 1985, KLM is entitled to early redeem at Par the then prevailing outstanding residual amount on each tenth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is February/uni00A012, 2025. The coupon reset date is fully aligned with the above mentioned frequency. If not Called, the next coupon reset date is set on February/uni00A012, 2025. The current outstanding coupon is 0.75% per annum.\n\nConcerning the perpetual bond debt issued in 1986, KLM is entitled to early redeem at Par the outstanding residual amount on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is May/uni00A015, 2021. The call price amount in 2001 was 101.75/uni00A0per cent of the notional face value, and thereafter with a premium declining by 0.25/uni00A0per cent on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. Therefore from May/uni00A015, 2036, the call price amount will be set at Par. The fixed interest coupon is 5.75% per annum.\n\nThe bond debt is subordinated to all other existing and future KLM debts.\n\nThe two CHF perpetual bond debts are ranked 'pari passu' with the JPY perpetual loan debt.",

This financial support package includes two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- - a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, for 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State and with a maturity of 5/uni00A0years. This revolving credit facility has an interest of EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 1.35%. The cost of the associated Dutch State guarantee equals to 0.50% in year 1, 1.00% in year 2 and 3 and 2.00% after year 3;\n- -  a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with a maturity of 5.5/uni00A0years and an interest of EURIBOR 12/uni00A0months (floored at zero) plus a margin of 6.25% for year 1, 6.75% for year 2 and 3, and 7.75% for year 4 and 5. This loan is subordinated to the new revolving credit facility.\n\nBoth the revolving credit facility and the direct loan are drawn simultaneously on a pro rata basis.\n\nKLM's first drawing under the new revolving credit facility amounts to \u20ac665/uni00A0million, which was drawn on 26/uni00A0August/uni00A02020. It has replaced the existing revolving credit facility drawn on 19/uni00A0 March/uni00A02020 (see Note/uni00A021.5/uni00A0'Credit facilities'). KLM first drawing under the Dutch State loan is \u20ac277/uni00A0million, which was drawn also on 26/uni00A0August/uni00A02020.\n\nMain conditions associated with the direct state loan are linked to manageable cost improvements, the airline becoming more sustainable and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and contributions made by employees. KLM has undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\nThe European Commission has approved both the Dutch state aid on July/uni00A013, 2020. On November/uni00A03, 2020, approval has been obtained from the Netherlands Ministry of Finance for the restructuring plan. Following this, KLM has the possibility to draw additional amounts under the financial support package.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, KLM has drawn down \u20ac942/uni00A0million of the financial support package (\u20ac665/uni00A0million of the revolving credit facility and \u20ac277/uni00A0million of the direct state loan). The loans have been recorded at amortized cost based on a 5 and 5.5/uni00A0 year drawn down assumptions with the E/ffective Interest Rate method (3.95/uni00A0per cent for the revolving credit facility and 7.05/uni00A0per cent for the direct state loan).\n\nBoth the revolving credit facility and the State loan are presented as non-current liabilities based on IAS/uni00A01 (presentation of financial statements). The revolving credit facility has a contractual maturity of 5/uni00A0years and the State loan has a contractual maturity of 5.5/uni00A0years. With that, the loans are not due for settlement in the coming 12/uni00A0months after balance sheet date. Furthermore, covenant testing is not required per balance sheet date, and therefore it is not relevant to the assessment.\n\nThe classification of loans as current or non-current as described in IAS/uni00A01/uni00A0is amended, with an e/ffective date in 2022. Future conditions need to be incorporated in a hypothetical test at reporting date. For the revolving credit facility and the State loan this would entail a covenant test per balance sheet date, while the covenant test is contractually only required as of September/uni00A02021. In the hypothetical test per balance sheet date, KLM is meeting the covenant requirements in September/uni00A02021 for both the revolving credit facility and the State loan. Following that, there is a right to defer the settlement for at least 12/uni00A0months after balance sheet date, and both the revolving credit facility and the State loan would also required to be classified as non-current if the amended version of IAS/uni00A01/uni00A0would have been applied.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Covid-19 crisis and the lockdown of borders cause the Group to reduce the capacity and cancel an important number of flights. In that case, customers can either ask for the refund of the ticket or\n\nthe issuance of a voucher. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, this line includes \u20ac699/uni00A0million of air tickets (fare and carrier imposed charges) for which the date of transportation has passed and which are eligible to refund and \u20ac739/uni00A0million of vouchers that can be used for future flights (or which can be refunded).\n\n## NOTE 34/emspace LOYALTY  PROGRAM\n\nWithin Air-France-KLM, there are two loyalty programs: Flying Blue and BlueBiz.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the deferred revenues relating to the outstanding miles of the Flying Blue customer loyalty program\n\namounts \u20ac832/uni00A0million. This will be recognized as revenue once the miles are redeemed. The Group expects that 53/uni00A0per cent of the miles will be recognized as revenue over the next five years.\n\nThe breakdown of the Flying Blue program is as follows:\n\n| Flying Bue - Deferred revenues  (in \u20ac millions)   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As of January/uni00A01                            | 774    | 763    |\n| Accumulation                                      | 130    | 319    |\n| Redemption                                        | (72)   | (308)  |\n| As of December/uni00A031                          | 832    | 774    |\n\n## NOTE 35/emspace OTHER  LIABILITIES\n\n| As of December/uni00A031 (in \u20ac millions)   | 2020  Current  Non-current   | 2020  Current  Non-current   | 2019/thinspace (1)  Current Non-current   | 2019/thinspace (1)  Current Non-current   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Tax liabilities                            | 565                          | 625                          | 892                                       | -                                         |\n| Employee-related liabilities               | 1,134                        | 545                          | 1,033                                     | -                                         |\n| Non-current asset payables                 | 96                           | -                            | 96                                        | -                                         |\n| Deferred income                            | 836                          | 36                           | 739                                       | 17                                        |\n| Prepayments received                       | 342                          | -                            | 469                                       | 1                                         |\n| Other                                      | 203                          | 88                           | 220                                       | 98                                        |\n| Total                                      | 3,175                        | 1,294                        | 3,448                                     | 115                                       |\n\n- (1) Derivatives instruments are reported on a specific line in the balance sheet.\n\nNon-current deferred income mainly relates to long-term contracts in the maintenance business.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 36/emspace FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 36.1/emspace Risk  management\n\n## Market risk management\n\nThe aim of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's risk management strategy is to reduce its exposure to such risks. Market risk coordination and management is the responsibility of the Risk Management Committee (RMC) which is composed of the Chief Financial O/fficer and Senior Vice-President Financial Operations of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the Chief Financial O/fficers of Air/uni00A0France and of KLM.\n\nThe RMC meets each quarter to review the Group reporting of the risks relating to fuel price, main currencies and interest rates and counterparties. RMC decides on the hedging policies to be implemented, targets for hedging ratios and periods and instrument types. Formalized RMC decisions are then implemented by the respective Treasury Management departments within each company, in compliance with the procedures governing the delegation of powers.\n\nEach company centralizes the management of the market risks of its subsidiaries.\n\nRegular meetings are organized between the Treasury Management departments.\n\nIn order to implement the strategy most appropriate to each circumstance, any type of instrument may be used provided it qualifies as hedging within IFRS unless explicitly approved by the Risk Management Committee. As a rule, no trading or speculation is allowed.\n\nThe treasury management departments of each company circulate weekly information on the level of cash and cash equivalents to their respective General Managements. The level of the Group's consolidated cash is communicated every week and the end on the month to the Group's General Management.\n\nEvery month, a detailed report including, amongst other information, the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging instruments, a summary of investments and financing by currency and the monitoring of risk by counterparty is send to the General Managements.\n\nThe hedging strategy on fuel and emission permits is fully under the responsibility of the Treasury Management departments. The General Managements receive a weekly fuel report, mainly covering the transactions carried out during the week, the valuation of the positions, the percentages hedged as well as the breakdown of the instruments and underlying used, the average hedge levels and the resulting net prices. All this data covers rolling 24/uni00A0months. Furthermore, a weekly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group report (known as the Fuel Hedge report) consolidates the figures from the two companies relating to fuel hedging and carries out a budget update.\n\n## Fuel price risk\n\nThe fuel bill is one of the largest cost items for airlines making oil price volatility a risk for the air transport industry. A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies. Similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines Pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.\n\nRisks linked to the jet fuel price are hedged within the framework of a hedging strategy defined by the RMC for the whole of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nThe hedging strategy, approved by the Board of Directors, sets the time span of the hedges at two years (a rolling 24/uni00A0months) and the target hedging ratio at 60/uni00A0per cent. Furthermore, the hedging is based on the use of simple futures or option-based instruments. These hedging instruments must also be compatible with IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nWith the application of IFRS/uni00A09 as of January/uni00A01, 2018, the hedging strategy of the Group has evolved and involves now component on non-financial item (crude oil and gasoil oil are specified as components of jet fuel prices). These components are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable as required by IFRS/uni00A09.\n\n## Main characteristics of the hedge strategy\n\nHedge horizon: two years rolling\n\n## Minimum hedge percentage, to reach at the end of the current quarter:\n\n- -  quarter underway: 60% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 1/uni00A0to quarter 3: 60% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 4: 50% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 5: 40% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 6: 30% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 7: 20% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 8: 10% of the volumes consumed.\n\nIncrement of coverage ratios: 10% by quarter\n\nUnderlyings: Brent, Gas Oil and Jet Fuel\n\nInstruments: Swap, call, call spread, three ways, four ways and collar.\n\n## Implementation of monitoring indicators on positions:\n\nTo ensure more e/ffective monitoring of the marked-to-market positions and a dynamic management of its exposure, the Group uses the VAR (Value at Risk) metric to help measure the risk incurred by its portfolio. This monitoring is also reinforced by taking into account the maximum loss and maximum gain which limit the scale of variation of this same portfolio and enable the appropriate reaction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Currency  risk\n\nMost of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's revenues are generated in euros. However, because of its international activities, the Group incurs a foreign exchange risk. The management of the currency risk for the subsidiaries of the two companies is centralized by each company. The principal exposure relates to the US dollar. Since the expenditure on items such as fuel and components exceeds the amount of revenues in dollars, the Group is a net buyer of US dollars. As the result, any significant appreciation in the dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's activity and financial results.\n\nInversely Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of revenues in these currencies exceeding its expenditure. This exposure is far less significant than with the US dollar. As a result, any significant decline in these currencies against the euro would have a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results.\n\nThe management of the Group's exchange rate risk is carried out on the basis of the forecast net exposure for each currency. Currencies which are highly correlated to the US dollar are aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is a rolling 24-month period, the first four quarters having more hedging than the following four. The RMC sets the hedging targets for the dollar, sterling and the yen.\n\nAir/uni00A0France uses some zero-cost structured options, as hedging instruments. These generate volatility in the financial result because of their non-aligned time value, unlike vanilla options whose time value is aligned. Changes in aligned time values are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nAircraft are purchased in US dollars, meaning that the Group is exposed to an appreciation in the dollar relative to the euro in terms of its investment in flight equipment.\n\nThe hedging strategy provides for the implementation of a graduated level of hedging between the date aircraft are ordered and their delivery.\n\nThe exchange rate risk on the Group's financial debt is limited. At December/uni00A031, 2020, 89% of the Group's debt, after taking into account derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt. The exchange rate risk on debt denominated in other currencies mostly concerns the Yen 5%, the US dollar 4% and the Swiss franc 2%.\n\nAs of January/uni00A01, 2018, the Group has applied IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0meaning that aircraft leases mostly denominated in US dollars, are accounted for in the Group's debt. These loans have been requalified as hedging for the network's future revenues in USD dollars. Consequently, the impact of foreign exchange di/fferences in\n\nUS dollars is accounted in other comprehensive income. For both Transavia and KLM Cityhopper which have no US dollar revenues, hedging programs specific to these commitments have been defined.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nA portion of the debt is contracted at floating rates. However, to limit its volatility Air/uni00A0France and KLM have used option and swap strategies involving the use of derivatives to convert a significant proportion of their floating-rate debt into fixed rates; after swaps, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's debt contracted at fixed rates represents 44/uni00A0per cent of the overall total. The interest rate on the Group's gross debt after swaps stood at 2.55/uni00A0per cent at December/uni00A031, 2020 versus 2.54/uni00A0per cent at December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\n## Risks on carbon credit\n\nTo meet its regulatory obligations, the/uni00A0CO2 emission quota acquisition strategy has been monitored and reviewed during every RMC meeting since October/uni00A02011. Its implementation led to the progressive hedging of the future requirement through the use of forwards contracts meaning that the 2021 requirement and a portion of the 2022 requirement are hedged.\n\nUnderlyings: EUA, EUAA and CER quotas\n\nInstruments: Forwards, delivery and payment during the quarter preceding the compliance application date.\n\n## Investment  risks\n\nThe cash resources of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are currently invested over a short-term time horizon, primarily deposits, money market mutual funds and certificates mainly rated A1/P1, the other lines being rated A2/P2.\n\nLastly, in order to reduce the currency risk on the debt, a portion of KLM's liquid assets is invested in high-quality foreign-currency denominated bonds.\n\n## Equity  risks\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group holds a limited number of shares which are listed for trading. The value of these investments may vary during their period of ownership. These investments are accounted for using either the equity method (associates) if the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence, or at their fair value. If the fair value cannot be determined from a practical point of view, the value of the investment is measured at its acquisition cost.\n\nThe treasury shares held by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are not deemed to be investments. Furthermore, the treasury shares are not deemed to be exposed to risk, since any variation in the value of these shares is only recognized directly in equity when they are sold in the market, with no impact on the net result.",

        "page_content": "## Counterparty risk management\n\nThe rules concerning the management of counterparty risk are established by the RMC and applied by the companies. Except in the event of express dispensation from the RMC, counterparties must benefit from a minimum rating of BBB+ (S&P) with the exception of mutual funds where the risk is considered negligible. The maximum commitments by counterparty are determined based on the quality of their rating. The RMC also monitors the trend in the respective proportion each counterparty represents of the overall hedging portfolio (fuel, currency and interest rate) and investments. The positions of both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, together with those of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company, are taken into account in the assessment of the overall exposure. A monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management in the two companies. It is supplemented by real time information in the event of any real risk of a rating downgrade for counterparties.\n\nThe transactions involving potential counterparty risk are as follows:\n\n- -  financial  investments;\n- -  derivative  instruments;\n- -  trade  receivables.\n- -  Counterparty risk linked to financial investments and derivative instruments is managed by the Risk Management Committee which establishes limits by counterparty, for all instruments except investments in money market funds (OPCVM) for which the counterparty risk is deemed not to be significant. The Group's counterparty-risk reporting is circulated each month to the executive managements, the risk being measured at the fair market value of the various instruments. Any exceeding of a limit immediately results in the implementation of corrective measures.\n\n- -  The counterparty risk linked to derivative instruments is taken into account in the valuation of their market value as described in Note/uni00A03.11. Derivative instruments are governed by the ISDA and FBF compensation master agreements. Within the framework of these agreements, compensation (in the event of default) must be made by counterparty for all the derivatives governed by each type of agreement.\n- -  Counterparty risk relating to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and geographical diversity of the customers comprising the trade receivables portfolio.\n\nThe Group has identified the following exposure to counterparty risk:\n\n## Total exposure (in \u20ac millions)\n\n| LT Rating   (Standard & Poors)   | As of  December/uni00A031,  2020   | As of  December/uni00A031,  2019   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| AAA                              | 257                                | 242                                |\n| AA                               | 66                                 | 393                                |\n| A                                | 898                                | 2,280                              |\n| BBB                              | -                                  | 16                                 |\n| Total                            | 1,221                              | 2,931                              |\n\nThis presentation does not include money market funds (OPCVM) and current accounts.\n\n## Liquidity  risk\n\nThe liquidity risk relates to the credit lines held by the Group, as described in Note/uni00A030.7.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the methods and assumptions used to provide the information set out below are theoretical in nature. They include the following inherent limitations:\n\n- - the estimated market values of financial instruments are estimated on the basis of the market price as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and December/uni00A031, 2019.\n- - the estimated amounts as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and December/uni00A031, 2019 are not indicative of gains and/or losses potentially arising on maturity or in the event of cancellation of a financial instrument.\n\nThe application of alternative methods and assumptions may, therefore, have a significant impact on the estimated market values.\n\nThe methods used are as follows:\n\n- - Cash, trade receivables, other receivables, short-term bank facilities, trade payables and other payables:\n\nThe Group considers that, due to their short-term nature, net book value can be deemed a reasonable approximation of their market value.\n\n- - Marketable securities, investments and other securities:\n- The market value of securities is determined based mainly on the market price or the prices available on other similar securities. Securities classified under equity instruments are recorded at their stock market value.\n\nWhere no market comparable exists, the Group uses their book value, which is deemed a reasonable approximation of their market value in this instance.\n\n- - Borrowings, other financial debts and loans:\n- The market value of fixed and floating-rate loans and financial debts is determined based on discounted future cash flows at market interest rates for instruments with similar features.\n- - Derivative instruments:\n\nThe market value of derivative instruments corresponds to the amounts that would be payable or receivable were the positions to be closed out as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and December/uni00A031, 2019, calculated using the year-end market rate.",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European Regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended December 31, 2020\n\nTo Air France KLM S.A. Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM S.A. for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nposition of the Group as at December/uni00A031, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de D\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5/thinspace (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern\n\nWe draw attention to Note/uni00A02.1 'Covid-19 and going concern' to the consolidated financial statements which describes the material uncertainty resulting from events or conditions that\n\nmay cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, and in addition to the matter described in the 'Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern' section, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.",

        "page_content": "These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, approved in the conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion\n\nthereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment test for non-current assets and impairment of flight equipment assets (notes/uni00A03.16, 14 and 16/uni00A0of consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\nFlight equipment assets amounted to \u20ac11,031/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (2019: \u20ac11,334/uni00A0million). The resizing of the network activity in 2020 led to the early phase out of certain fleets (A380, A340, Boeing 747, CRJ) leading to the recognition of an impairment loss of \u20ac670/uni00A0million under non-recurring items.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, the carrying amount of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life amounted to \u20ac215/uni00A0million (2019: \u20ac217/uni00A0million).\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A036 'Impairment of Assets', property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets and goodwill are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment, and at least once a year as of September/uni00A030 for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Assets that cannot be directly linked to independent cash flows are grouped together into Cash Generating Units (CGU) to perform the impairment test.\n\nThe Group concluded that the CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments - the network, Maintenance and Transavia activities - which represent the smallest independent groups of assets whose use generates identifiable cash inflows.\n\nTheir value in use is determined based on particularly sensitive forward-looking assumptions, given the current health and economic situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the calculation of discounted cash flows estimated from 5-year budget assumptions validated by Management and communicated to the Board of Directors, the discount rate corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital, and growth rates reflecting assumptions relating to mid- and long-term business development.\n\nWe considered the valuation of those assets to be a key audit matter in light of the high degree of judgment and estimates required by Management to determine the value of its assets in a context characterized by economic uncertainty.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe assessed the procedures and controls implemented by the Group to identify indicators of impairment, calculate the book value of non-current assets by CGU and determine their recoverable amount. We tested the key controls used by the Group in the design process of the asset impairment test.\n\n## Our work includes:\n\n- -  assessing whether the methodology used by Management complies with current accounting standards (IAS/uni00A036), including validating the CGU independence and consistency criteria as well as the frequency of impairment tests;\n- -  reconciling the book value of the non-current assets of each CGU with the accounting balances and the corresponding analyses;\n- -  verifying (i)/uni00A0the cash-flow projections with the Management-approved 5-year plans, (ii)/uni00A0the intermediate period and perpetual growth rates, as well as (iii)/uni00A0profit margin rates used;\n- -  assessing discount rate calculation assumptions such as risk-free rate, industry gearing, financing spread and specific risk premium;\n- - assessing the sensitivity scenarios retained by Management by verifying arithmetic accuracy and re-performing sensitivity calculations based on WACC, perpetual growth rate and long-term profitability;\n- -  calculating enterprise value from Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market capitalization to corroborate the impairment test based on value in use.\n- -  assessing and analyzing the impacts of impairment recorded under non-recurring items following the early phase out of the A380, A340, Boeing 747 and CRJ fleets;\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in notes/uni00A03.16, 14 and 16/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impacts for financial year 2020 have been recorded, net of the reversal of retirement obligations, in the income statement under non-recurring expenses and amounted to \u20ac822/uni00A0million. Pilots, cabin crew and ground sta/ff accounted for \u20ac584/uni00A0million for Air/uni00A0France and Hop! and \u20ac205/uni00A0million for KLM. Air/uni00A0France and KLM international commercial sta/ff accounted for \u20ac33/uni00A0million.\n\nWe considered the restructuring provision to be a key audit matter due to the significant judgments and estimates made by the Group for the assumptions used to determine the recognized amounts.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe examined the events relating to the implementation of the restructuring plans and assessed the judgments, estimates and assumptions made by the Group to determine the need to recognize a provision and, where applicable, its amount.\n\n## Our work included:\n\n- -  conducting interviews with Management and the Human Resources departments to obtain an understanding of the restructuring plans and the estimates underlying the recorded provisions;\n- -  verifying the design and implementation of controls set up by Management to assess the amount of liabilities;\n- -  obtaining the required approvals and authorizations from the respective French and Dutch administrations to ensure that the terms and conditions of the plans are correctly reflected in the provisions;\n- -  analyzing the assumptions used by Management in establishing the provision with regard to the eligibility conditions for departure plans, and data from the payroll system;\n- -  reconciling the Group's calculation of provisions with recognized amounts;\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in notes/uni00A02.2, 3.21, 10, 28.3 and 29/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.",

As of December/uni00A031, 2020, a net amount of \u20ac260/uni00A0million in deferred tax assets was recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the global scope. The amount comprised \u20ac285/uni00A0million in deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards for the French tax consolidation group as presented in Note/uni00A012.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements. These deferred tax assets are recognized based on their likelihood of recovery pursuant to budgets and medium-term plans prepared by the Group. As presented in Note/uni00A012.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the recovery horizon for these deferred tax assets of the French tax consolidation group was reduced to five years as of December/uni00A031, 2020 compared with seven years as of December/uni00A031, 2019. Unrecognized deferred tax assets relating to the tax losses of the French tax consolidation group amounted to \u20ac3,265/uni00A0million as presented in Note/uni00A012.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe identified this issue as a key audit matter due to the significant amount of French tax loss carryforwards and the high degree of judgments and estimates made by the Group to assess the validity of the related deferred tax assets recognized.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach consisted in examining the compliance of the Group's approach with IAS/uni00A012 and assessing the probability of the Company making future use of the tax loss carryforwards generated to date, particularly with regard to:\n\n- -  deferred tax liabilities in the same tax jurisdiction, where the base could be o/ffset against deferred tax assets with the same maturity; and\n- -  the Group's ability to generate future taxable profits in the French tax jurisdiction in order to use prior-year tax losses recognized as deferred tax assets.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group to identify existing tax loss carryforwards that will be utilized, either through deferred tax liabilities or future taxable profits.\n\nTo determine future taxable profits, we assessed the forecasting process by:\n\n- -  examining the procedure for preparing the last taxable income forecasts used as a basis for estimates;\n- -  comparing income forecasts for prior years with actual results;\n- -  comparing the assumptions used by Management to prepare taxable income forecasts with the ones adopted for non-current asset impairment tests.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in notes/uni00A03.24 and 12/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The outcome of these procedures and litigations depends on future events, and the Company's estimates are inherently based on the use of Group assumptions and assessments.\n\nWe considered the measurement of the litigation provisions to be a key audit matter due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of current procedures, the high degree of Group estimates and judgment and the potentially material nature of the impact of provision amounts on consolidated net income and equity should these estimates change.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe specifically assessed the estimates and assumptions adopted by the Group in determining the need to recognize a provision and, where applicable, its amount.\n\nBased on discussions with the Group, we familiarized ourselves with the latter's analysis of the risks and status of each significant litigation, whether reported or potential.\n\nWe assessed the items justifying the recognition or not of a provision. We analyzed the lawyers' replies to your enquiries, familiarized ourselves with the exchanges between the Company, its lawyers and other parties to the suits and considered any new developments up to the issue date of our report.\n\nBased on these items, we conducted a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted by the Group.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in notes/uni00A03.21 and 29/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L./uni00A0225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) is included in Group management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L./uni00A0823-10/uni00A0of the code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an Independent Third Party.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L./uni00A0451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code Mon\u00e9taire et Financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive O/fficer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation N\u00b0/uni00A02019/815/uni00A0of 17/uni00A0December/uni00A02018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended\n\nto be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM S.A. Company by the Annual General Meetings held on September/uni00A025, 1998 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and on September/uni00A025, 2002 for KPMG Audit, department of KPMG S.A.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2020, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s was in the 23 rd /uni00A0 year of total uninterrupted engagement and KPMG Audit, department of KPMG S.A. was in the 19 th /uni00A0 year of total uninterrupted engagement, which are the 22 nd /uni00A0year and 19 th /uni00A0y ear since securities of the Company were admitted to trading on a regulated market respectively.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n- -  evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- -  assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- -  evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- -  obtains su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\n## 1./emspaceAccounting policies and procedures\n\nGenerally accepted accounting policies have been applied, consistent with the prudence principle and in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable in France and to the base assumptions whose aim is to provide a true and faithful representation of the company:\n\n- -  going  concern;\n- -  consistent accounting methods from year to year;\n- -  independence of financial periods;\n\nand in accordance with the general rules for establishing and presenting annual financial statements.\n\nThe basic method used to value items recorded in the financial statements is the historical cost method.\n\n## Covid-19 and going concern\n\nAs the holding company of a group made up of the three airlines Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia, the company is concerned by the worldwide spread of Covid-19 since the beginning of 2020 has had and continues to have a major impact on air tra/ffic around the world. After the drastic reduction in tra/ffic during the second quarter following very stringent constraints on worldwide travel, the recovery expected in the second semester was delayed with the resurgence of Covid-19 at the end of the summer. Further measures were implemented by the French and Dutch governments to slow the spread of the virus in the final quarter of 2020 (lockdowns, curfew). Since early January/uni00A02021, the restrictions on travel have been reinforced at global level following the emergence of new variants of the virus.\n\nThe Group, made up with its two main subsidiaries, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, has already taken a number of strong measures to mitigate the e/ffect of Covid-19 on its business and continues to closely monitor and evaluate further developments. These actions include, amongst others, a substantial reduction in network capacity, structural changes to the fleet, cash preservation and salary measures.\n\n## Liquidity position\n\nWithin the framework of the financial support packages from the French and Dutch States, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group signed the legal documentation relating to the four financing mechanisms, approved by the European Commission on May/uni00A04, 2020 for Air/uni00A0 France Group (see Note/uni00A012.3/uni00A0'Loans and Debts') and on July/uni00A013, 2020 for KLM Group, in the total amount of \u20ac10.4/uni00A0billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese financing packages thus enabled an improvement in the Group's liquidity position.\n\nIn addition, the Group decided to defer non-essential capital expenditures and internal projects, defer payment of the employee profit-sharing scheme and variable compensation, and defer payment of the wage tax, social contributions and aeronautical charges.\n\nLastly, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group o/ffered customers whose flights had been cancelled the option of exchanging their tickets for vouchers, with a 15% uplift in their value.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's liquidity position consisted of total cash of \u20ac9.82/uni00A0billion, of which \u20ac7.36/uni00A0billion in liquidity and \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion in undrawn credit lines.\n\nDespite these measures and a gradual resumption of activity, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's financial performance for the coming period will continue to be a/ffected by a significant fall in revenue, lost ticket sales and substantially negative cash flows in a proportion and for a duration that currently remain uncertain.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn determining the appropriate basis for preparing the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, the Board of Directors considered the Group as a going concern by evaluating the financial forecasts over a time horizon of at least one year and by analyzing, in particular, the trading position of the Group in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic and taking into account the following elements:\n\nAs indicated above, the Group had total cash of \u20ac9.82/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe 2021 budget, as modelled by the management and approved by the Board of Directors, assumes a gradual ramp-up in passenger demand with a stronger recovery in tra/ffic in the second part of year thanks to the vaccination roll-out.\n\nThis plan will ensure a level of liquidity considered to be adequate thanks to the following elements:\n\n- -  the adjustment of the flight schedule and capacity to the expected demand in order to operate only flights having a positive incremental impact in terms of operating cash-flow;\n- -  the continued specific mechanisms from the French and Dutch governments to partially cover sta/ff costs through the 'NOW' program in the Netherlands and the Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') in France;\n- -  a high level of variable costs linked to a reduction in capacity;\n- -  the reduction in the capital expenditure plans;\n- -  the systematic refinancing secured by assets of new aircraft delivered from manufacturers.\n\nBased on these financial forecasts, the banking covenants applicable in 2021, including the \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion Revolving Credit Facility at the level of KLM, are met.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the Group is working on financing projects, pursuant to the European Regulation, which would increase the stockholders' equity, provide further liquidity and secure access to additional financing secured by assets.\n\nLastly, and more generally, the French and Dutch States have shown their support to enable Air/uni00A0France and KLM to weather the current di/fficulties.\n\nAs the timing for the resumption of flights is uncertain, the Management has also modelled a more pessimistic, but plausible, scenario assuming a further 10% decline in activity during 2021 relative to the aforementioned budget, to assess the liquidity position over a period of at least 12/uni00A0months from the date of the year end closing.\n\nOn this scenario, thanks to the high level of variable costs and the subsidies supporting payroll costs, the Group would have enough cash to continue its activities over this 12-month period.\n\nWere this scenario to transpire, the Management has considered additional mitigating actions, including:\n\n- -  further optimization and reduction of the network and capacity;\n- -  asset  disposals;\n- -  further sta/ff restructuring;\n- -  other cost-saving measures; and\n- -  the deferral of capital expenditure and charges.\n\nWithin a context of significant uncertainty linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis, the Board of Directors nonetheless considers that there are pessimistic scenarios which could cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, in particular were the pandemic, including the uncontrolled spread of new variants and the maintenance or even reinforcement of the related health measures, to call into question the gradual recovery in demand, especially in the 2021 second semester.\n\nFurthermore, the non-realization of financing projects, the inadequacy of the aforementioned mitigation measures, the possibility that the banking covenants might, in certain situations, not be respected, the lack of alternative sources of finance like the sale and leaseback of aircraft, the impact of a possible forced reduction in slots and a potentially negative change in some behavior relating to air travel also constitute, to various degrees, factors of additional uncertainty in the short and medium term.\n\nIn the event that these factors of uncertainty were to materialize, the Group might not be able to realize its assets and repay its debts within the normal framework of its activity while the application of the IFRS accounting rules and principles in a normal context of a going concern, concerning notably the assessment of the assets and liabilities, could prove inappropriate. This situation creates a situation of significant uncertainty with regard to operating as a going concern.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Board of Directors does not consider those pessimistic scenarios to be likely or that they are likely to have an impact su/fficient to call into question the business as a going concern. It thus considers it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the going concern principle.\n\n## Value in use of its equity investments\n\nIn the current context, the company has paid particular attention to the value in use of its equity investments.\n\n## The main accounting methods used are the following:\n\n## Long-term investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are presented on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of impairment, if any. A provision for impairment is recorded as soon as the fair value, which corresponds to the value in use, falls below the acquisition value. The fair value of securities is determined by taking into account the share of shareholders' equity, the outlook for profitability and the stock market values that can be used as a reference.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal fees related to the acquisition of securities are expensed, according to the option o/ffered by the regulations.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to employees or to a capital decrease are booked in long-term investments. They are shown at the lower of their acquisition cost or fair value. The fair value is determined based on the average market price for the last month of the financial year.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are valued at their nominal value. They are valued on a case-by-case basis and a provision is set up as required based on the assessed risks.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are shown on the balance sheet at the lower of their acquisition cost and their market value. In the case of listed shares, this market value is determined based on the market price at the end of the financial year.\n\nTreasury shares invested as part of a liquidity agreement are valued at the lower of their acquisition price and fair value. The fair value is determined based on the last month average market price at the end of the financial year.\n\nNegotiable debt securities (certificates of deposits, and bills issued by financial companies) are booked at their acquisition cost. Interest is booked as financial income, on a-prorata temporis basis.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nOperating expense and income transactions in foreign currencies are recognized at the average exchange rate for each relevant month.",

To this end, the Dutch government had to sell its cumulative preferred shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to a Dutch foundation in the name of and on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, if the transfer had occurred during the first three years following the business combination.\n\nIn the latter case, the foundation would have issue, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, share certificates corresponding to the\n\ncumulative A preferred shares transferred to the foundation. These share certificates would have conferred to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM all of the economic rights attached to the said shares, the voting rights attached to the said shares being exercised by the foundation until Air/uni00A0France exchanges the share certificates against the said shares.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period, Air/uni00A0France-KM had the option to exchange the share certificates against the cumulative A preferred shares, which it could hold directly. As Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided in 2007 to maintain SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not carry out this exchange. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can decide to dissolute the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.",

As of January/uni00A016, 2020, the position was closed following the partial early repayment of this loan.\n\nThe $145/uni00A0million bond is fully hedged by a cross currency swap. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, the fair value of this derivative instrument is \u20ac(19) million (see Note/uni00A012.2).\n\n## Other\n\nSince January/uni00A02009, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has acted as a guarantor for Air/uni00A0France Company within the framework of its commitments to A\u00e9roport de Paris in respect of civil leases. This guarantee has been renewed in July/uni00A02014and more recently on 23/uni00A0September/uni00A02019 for a period of 5/uni00A0years. The guarantee is now expressly limited to \u20ac19/uni00A0million (and, cumulatively, at a maximum of 3/uni00A0months' rent per contract).\n\nAir France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM guarantees a debt that KLM holds on the Airline GOL for an amount of US$50 million.\n\nAir France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM guarantees the payment by Transavia Holland to a lessor, of outstanding operational leases until 2024 for an amount of US$52 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n## 17./emspace  Litigation\n\n## Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, as parent company of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, is involved, since February/uni00A02006, in investigations initiated by the antitrust authorities in several countries, with respect to allegations of anti-competitive agreements or concerted actions in the air freight industry with up to twenty-five other airlines.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2017, most of these investigations have been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair and the appropriate competition authorities providing for the payment of settlement amounts or fines, with the exception of the proceedings initiated by the European Commission, and by the Swiss antitrust authority, which are still pending.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Europe, the decision of the European Commission of 2010 against eleven air cargo carriers, including the companies of the Group, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on 16/uni00A0December/uni00A02015. On 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02017, the European Commission issued a new decision against eleven air cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount has been reduced by \u20ac15/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On 29 and 30/uni00A0May/uni00A02017, the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The Group has maintained a provision covering these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are challenging a decision imposing a \u20ac4/uni00A0million fine before the relevant court. The subsidiaries of the Group have provisioned the totality of this fine.\n\nThose provisions are booked by each airline and do not have any impact in the financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## 18./emspace Contingent  liabilities\n\nFollowing the initiation of various investigations by the competition authorities in 2006 and the European Commission decision in 2010, several collective and individual actions were brought by forwarders and airfreight shippers in the civil courts against Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, and other cargo operators, in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nUnder these civil lawsuits, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is involved as the parent company of the airlines. Shippers and freight forwarders are claiming for damages to compensate alleged higher prices due to alleged competition law infringement.\n\nAir/uni00A0France, KLM and/or Martinair remain defendants, either as main defendants (in particular in The Netherlands, Norway) or as third-party interveners brought in these cases by other main defendants under 'contribution proceedings'. Where Air/uni00A0France, KLM and/or Martinair are the main defendants, they have also initiated contribution proceedings against other airlines.\n\nAlthough significant amounts have been reported by the media, plainti/ffs are mostly claiming for unspecified and/or insu/fficiently substantiated damages against defendants taken as a whole (and not individually) and the EU decision to which the plainti/ffs refer to is still not definitive.\n\nThe Group companies and the other airlines involved in these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose all such civil claims.\n\nExcept for the matters specified under the paragraphs 17 and 18, the company is not aware of any governmental, judicial and arbitration dispute or proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, or that are pending or threatened against it) that could have a significant impact on the company's financial position, earnings, assets, liabilities or profitability, for a period covering at least the past twelve months.",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European Regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2020\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM S.A. for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nthe Company as at December/uni00A031, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de D\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5/thinspace (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern\n\nWe draw attention to Note/uni00A01/uni00A0to the financial statements which describes the material uncertainty resulting from events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's\n\nability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7/uni00A0of the\n\nFrench Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, and in addition to the matter described in the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

They are recorded at their acquisition cost net of any impairment, based on their fair value taking into account their share of shareholders' equity, profitability outlook and reference stock market values.\n\nThe fair value estimate of these long-term investments requires management to exercise judgment in its choice of items considered according to the nature of the investments concerned. Such items may correspond, to historical items (for certain entities shareholders' equity, and for others average stock market price over the last month), or forecast items (profitability outlook and the economic environment in the countries considered).\n\nWe considered the determination of the fair value of long-term investments to be a key audit matter because of i) uncertainties inherent to certain assumptions and particularly the achievement of forecasts, and ii) the potential importance of a reversal or recognition of impairment of long-term investments in the Company's accounts.\n\n## Our response\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of estimated fair value of long term investments, based on the information communicated to us, our procedures mainly consisted in verifying that the estimate of the values determined by management were based on an appropriate justification of the valuation method and figures used, and according to the investments concerned:\n\nFor valuations based on historical items:\n\n- -  verifying that the shareholders' equity used is consistent with the financial statements of the entities audited or subjected to analytical procedures and that any equity adjustments have been appropriately documented.\n\nFor valuations based on forecast items:\n\n- -  obtaining the profitability outlook for the entities concerned;\n- -  assessing the consistency of the assumptions adopted with the economic environment on the reporting dates;\n- -  comparing the forecasts adopted for prior periods with actual outcomes in order to assess the extent of achievement of past objectives;\n- -  verifying that the value resulting from cash flow forecasts was adjusted for the debt of the entity considered;\n- -  verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the computed fair values.\n\nIn addition to assessing the fair values of long-term investments, our work also consisted in assessing the collectibility of associated receivables based on our analysis of the long-term investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The outcome of these procedures and litigations depends on future events, and the Company's estimates are inherently based on the use of management assumptions and assessments.\n\nWe considered the measurement of the litigation provisions to be a key audit matter due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of current procedures, the high degree of management estimates and judgment and the potentially material nature of the impact of provision amounts on net income and equity should these estimates change.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D./uni00A0441-4/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce).\n\n## Information relating to corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the section related to the governance of the management report of the Board of Directors' contains the information required by Articles L./uni00A0225-37-4, L22-10-10 and L./uni00A022-10-9/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce).\n\n## Our response\n\nWe specifically assessed the estimates and assumptions adopted by the Company in determining the need to recognize a provision and where applicable its amount.\n\nBased on discussions with the Company, we familiarized ourselves with the latter's analysis of the risks and status of each significant litigation, whether reported or potential.\n\nWe assessed the items justifying the recognition or not of a provision. We examined the lawyers' replies to your enquiries, familiarized ourselves with the exchanges between the Company, its lawyers and other parties to the suits and considered any new developments up to the issue date of our report.\n\nBased on these items, we conducted a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted by management.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in notes/uni00A017 and 18/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L./uni00A022-10-9/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the Directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies included in the scope of the consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nConcerning the information relating to the items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange o/ffer, provided pursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-11/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), we have agreed this information to the underlying documents which have been communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- -  evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0/uni00A0537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L./uni00A0822-10/uni00A0to L./uni00A0822-14/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de D\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. It should be understood that the agreements and commitments reported on are only those provided for by the French Commercial Code and that the report does not apply to those related-party transactions described in IAS/uni00A024 or other equivalent accounting standards.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders held to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020\n\nTo the Shareholders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM S.A.,\n\nAs Statutory Auditors of your company, we hereby present our special report on related-party agreements.\n\nWe are required to inform you, on the basis of the information provided to us, of the terms and conditions, the purpose, and the benefits to the Company of the agreements of which we were informed or became aware of during our engagement. It is not our role to determine whether they are beneficial or appropriate or to ascertain whether any other agreements exist. It is your responsibility, in accordance with Article R./uni00A0225-31/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the relevance of these agreements with a view to approving them.\n\nIn addition, we are required to inform you, where appropriate, in accordance with Article R./uni00A0225-31/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code, of the agreements already approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nWe performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to this engagement. Our work entailed verifying that the information provided is consistent with the documents from which it was derived.\n\n## Agreements submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders\n\n## Agreements authorized and/or concluded during the year\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L./uni00A0225-40/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been informed of the following agreements which have been subject to prior authorization by your Board of Directors throughout the year.\n\n## State-backed loan and shareholder loan\n\n## Directors concerned:\n\n- -  French State, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Martin Vial, director representing the French State appointed by ministerial decree;\n- -  Ms. Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, directors appointed at the General Meeting of Shareholders upon the proposal of the French State.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions:\n\nYour Board of Directors, gathered on April/uni00A024, 2020 previously authorized the conclusion of the following two agreements, signed on May/uni00A06, 2020 involving, directly or indirectly, the French State, which is a shareholder currently holding 14.3% of the Company's share capital:\n\n- 1) a loan of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, granted by a consortium of banks and guaranteed up to 90% by the French State in accordance with\n\nthe regime introduced in Law No. 2020- 280/uni00A0of March/uni00A023, 2020. The State-backed loan, fully drawn, is granted for a one-year period, renewable once for an additional one-year or two-year period;\n\nThe cost of this guarantee takes the form of an annual commission equal to 0.5% of the total amount of the State-backed loan, payable at the end of the first year (the 'Initial Maturity Date') and may be increased by an additional annual commission of 1% of the amount outstanding in principal on the Initial Maturity Date, for each of the second year and the third year, being specified that this additional commission would be payable by the Company according to the terms provided to the contract if it were to exercise its right of extension of maturity.\n\n- 2) a shareholder loan of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, granted by the French State for a four-year period, extendable for an additional one-year period, renewable once and fully drawn as at December/uni00A031, 2020.",

As the pandemic has significantly impacted the Company's business activity, its current financial situation would not enable a sustainable return to business. Consequently, entering into the loan agreements appeared necessary for the sustainability of the Company. By covering the Company's general financial needs, the loan agreements will enable it to resume operations e/fficiently.\n\n## Conclusion of a Framework Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State\n\n## Directors concerned:\n\n- -  The Dutch State, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Dirk van den Berg, director appointed at the General Meeting of Shareholders upon proposal of the Dutch State.\n- -  Mr. Cees 't Hart and Mr. Benjamin Smith, joint directors of the Company and KLM.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions:\n\nYour Board of Directors gathered on June/uni00A025, 2020 previously authorized to enter, as part of the financial support plan granted by the Dutch state to the company Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij NV ('KLM'), a subsidiary of the Company, of a Framework Agreement signed on August/uni00A07, 2020 between the Company, KLM and the Dutch State, a shareholder of the Company holding 14% of its share capital.\n\nThe Framework Agreement includes a financial support package for KLM for a total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion backed by the Dutch State, including two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- -  a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, granted by 11/uni00A0banks to KLM with a 90% guarantee supported by the Dutch State; and\n- -  a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, subordinated to the revolving credit facility.\n\nThe loan granted by the Dutch State is subject to certain conditions. These conditions were addressed in a Framework Agreement between the Company, KLM and the Dutch State, which includes, in particular, commitments by KLM on sustainable development and restoring its performance and competitiveness, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and the contribution of its employees. KLM has undertaken to suspend the dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\n## Benefits for the Company:\n\nYour Board of Directors considered the conclusion of the Framework Agreement inherent part of the Dutch State's financial support plan for KLM totaling 3.4/uni00A0billion euros, aiming to help KLM, a subsidiary of the Company, meet its urgent liquidity requirements as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.",

('Delta') and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. ('Virgin') and, on the other hand, China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd. ('China Eastern') (together, the 'Partnership Agreements').\n\nThe other stipulations of the Partnership Contracts remain unchanged.\n\n## Benefits for the Company:\n\nYour Board of Directors considered that due to the constantly evolving health measures and regulations related to the Covid-19 crisis and a very uncertain environment, it was in the best interests of the Company and therefore decided to suspend the relative financial provisions of 'settlement' considered under the two Partnership Agreements, mentioned above during the period of health crisis, the parties wishing to avoid an uncontrolled financial exposure within the framework of these partnerships.\n\n- a) Adjustment of the Blue Skies transatlantic partnership concluded with Delta and Virgin\n\n## Persons concerned:\n\nDelta Air Lines/uni00A0Inc., shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10% and director of the Company, represented by Mr. George N.

Each party waives all rights with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. It may be extended in 2021 by mutual agreement of the parties based on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 epidemic on the joint-venture.\n\n## b) Adjustments of the partnership concluded with China Eastern\n\n## Persons concerned:\n\n- -  China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Jian Wang, director appointed by the general meeting on the proposal of China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions:\n\n- 1) On January/uni00A015, 2021, the execution of a waiver of the financial settlements (financial mechanism to share revenues generated by the joint-venture) as agreed upon in the joint-venture agreement entered into with China Eastern Airlines on November/uni00A026, 2018. Henceforth, the parties waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 epidemic on the joint-venture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This last decision, authorized by your Board of Directors meeting on October/uni00A030, 2020, resulted in the modification of the agreements relating to the Partnership which had been concluded on May/uni00A015, 2018 and authorized by your Board of Directors at its meetings on March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018, without impacting the Company's position in the commercial joint-venture between Delta, Virgin and the Company.\n\nThe ongoing Partnership agreements in 2020 are as follows:\n\n- 1) Joint Venture Agreement between Delta, Virgin, the Company, KLM and Air/uni00A0France, aimed at setting up a commercial joint-venture between these companies, concluded on January/uni00A030, 2020 with e/ffect from January/uni00A01, 2020.

If a unanimous decision cannot be reached by the three Board directors in the Board of Directors for each of the Dutch Foundations, no resolution may be passed by the Board of the relevant Foundation, which consequently cannot then vote on the relevant resolutions in the KLM Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAmongst the three Board directors for each of the foundations, one member is appointed by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, one by KLM and the third, acting in the capacity of Chair of the Foundation, is appointed by the first two directors, it being specified that the majority of the members of the Boards of Directors of each Foundation, including the Chair, must be Dutch residents.\n\nAir France - KLM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n6",

Nevertheless, this agreement provides that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM may, at any time\n\nas of May/uni00A06, 2007 and at its sole discretion, terminate this administered shareholding structure for KLM shares through SAK I and SAK II and proceed to regroup the economic and voting rights attached to the KLM shares, thereby holding 93.84% of KLM's voting rights.\n\n## 6.3.2/emspace Agreements with the Dutch State\n\nTo enable the completion of the business combination and safeguard KLM's tra/ffic rights, airline status and the scale of its network and operations at Schiphol, Air/uni00A0France and KLM entered into the following agreements with the Dutch State.\n\n## Agreement for the acquisition of cumulative preference A shares held by the Dutch State\n\nOn October/uni00A016, 2003, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the Dutch State signed an agreement pursuant to which the Dutch State agreed to decrease its interest in KLM proportionately to any reduction by the French State of its stake in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. To this end, the Dutch State will sell its cumulative preferential A shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as long as this foundation is maintained. In such case, SAK I will issue share certificates to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM corresponding to the cumulative preferential A shares transferred to SAK I. These share certificates confer to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the economic right attached to the transferred cumulative preferential A shares, i.e. a right to a dividend, the corresponding voting rights being exercised by SAK I until the share certificates have been exchanged by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM against the said shares.\n\nIn March/uni00A02005, pursuant to the agreement, 5,103,885/uni00A0cumulative preference A shares were transferred by the Dutch State to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which received, in return, SAK I share certificates.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period (2004 to 2007), Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had the option to exchange the share certificates against cumulative preferential A shares, and to directly hold the cumulative preferential A shares. Having decided, in 2007, to maintain the SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not proceed with this exchange but could still do so at any time, in whole or in part. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is free to decide to dissolve the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nFurthermore, the Dutch State benefits from the right to transfer, at any time, as many cumulative preferential A shares as it wishes to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThese agreements relating to the cumulative preferential A shares remain in force.\n\n## Option for the Dutch State to subscribe for preferential KLM B shares\n\nThis option granted to the Dutch State lapsed in May/uni00A02010.\n\n## Assurances given to the Dutch State\n\n## Nature and duration of the assurances - unilateral termination option\n\nWithin the framework of the 2004 business combination, Air/uni00A0 France and KLM granted the Dutch State, for an initial eight-year period starting from the completion of the business combination (i.e. expiring in 2012), various assurances as to KLM's airline status, its air services and the scale of its passenger and cargo operations at Schiphol airport with a view to maintaining the quality of KLM's network at Schiphol which, according to the Dutch State, is of public interest, while at the same time taking into account the interests of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its shareholders (the 'Assurances').\n\nIn return for these Assurances, the Dutch State undertook to take the importance of KLM's activities at Schiphol into consideration when defining its civil aviation policy. Furthermore, the Dutch State agreed to:\n\n- -  maintain the existing portfolio of tra/ffic rights granted to KLM, other than those that have not been used by KLM over a cumulative period of twelve months;\n- -  continue to review any future request submitted by KLM for the allocation of new tra/ffic rights on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\n\nPursuant to an agreement entered into on May/uni00A025, 2010, the Dutch State, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM agreed to extend the Assurances given to the Dutch State, with the exclusion, however, of an assurance foreseeing that the combined growth should not negatively impact KLM's operations in the passenger and cargo segment, beyond May/uni00A05, 2012 for an indefinite period, subject to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's right to terminate these Assurances, at its sole discretion, with prior notice of nine months. This agreement was confirmed by a meeting between, inter alia, the Minister for Transportation of the Netherlands, the Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the President of the Management Board of KLM which took place on March/uni00A012, 2015.\n\n## Mechanism to ensure compliance with the Assurances\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM set up a Dutch foundation, known as the KLM Assurances Foundation (Stichting Assurances KLM - duration extended in 2010) to facilitate the provision of binding advice (bindend advise) on the interpretation of the Assurances granted to the Dutch State (the 'Advice'). These advices are issued by a KLM Assurances Foundation Committee in the event that a decision taken by the KLM Supervisory Board, KLM Management Board or Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors is considered to be in conflict with the Assurances given to the Dutch State.",

A fourth treaty, the Rome Convention (1952), covers damage caused to third parties on the ground.\n\n## Freedoms of the air\n\nUnder a bilateral treaty, an air carrier has freedoms that allow it to operate in the air space and the territory of a State other than its State of origin. These eight freedoms are as follows:\n\n- -  1 st /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to overfly the air space of a foreign State;\n- -  2 nd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to make a technical layover without unloading or loading passengers in a foreign State. This freedom is the 'transit right';\n- -  3 rd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload passengers from its State of origin in a foreign State;\n- -  4 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in this foreign State and unload them in its State of origin;\n- -  5 th /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload and load passengers in two successive foreign States;\n- -  6 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State and unload them in its State of origin, then in another foreign State;\n- -  7 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State to unload them in another foreign State, without going through its State of origin;\n- -  8 th /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to load passengers in a foreign State, to unload them in another city in this same foreign State.\n\n## The Chicago Convention (1944)\n\nThe Convention relating to international civil aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, sets out the legal, regulatory and technical rules governing commercial aviation and its Member State signatories are required to implement a common legal\n\n<!-- image -->",

This convention entered into force on June/uni00A028, 2004. It is based on several fundamental provisions, notably the principle of the unlimited liability of air transport companies in the event of physical injury with the implementation of a two-tier system:\n\n- -  a first tier that sets an objective liability for the air transport company of up to 128,821/uni00A0Special Drawing Rights (SDR);\n- -  a second tier, based on a presumption of fault for the air transport company, for which the airline may be exempt if it proves that it or its agents or o/fficials have not been negligent in any way or that the damages result exclusively from the acts of a third party.\n\n## The Rome Convention (1952)\n\nThe Rome Convention, signed in 1952, covers damages caused to third parties on the ground by foreign aircraft. This convention has not been ratified by France, the Netherlands or the United States. The ICAO's legal commission is currently involved in a major initiative to redraft the wording which would facilitate its ratification by making a distinction between everyday risk and terrorist risk.\n\nThe Convention intended to replace the Rome Convention, relating to compensation for damage caused to third parties\n\n## 6.4.2/emspace European  legislation\n\n## Single European air space\n\nWithin the European Union, these eight freedoms have been supplemented, since April/uni00A01, 1997, by common legislation that creates a homogeneous regulatory situation for all European carriers. All European airlines may freely operate and, in particular, perform cabotage operations within a single European air space. Furthermore, any resident of an EU Member State may hold a stake in the shares of any EU-registered airline, without limit, provided that the shareholder is not acting as a front for a beneficial owner who is not a citizen of an EU Member State. The existence of this legislation eliminates the need for bilateral agreements between EU Member States and does not prevent them from participating in the ICAO, nor does it conflict with the principles and regulations of the Chicago Convention.\n\nfollowing acts of unlawful interference with aircraft, signed in Montreal on May 2, 2009 by thirteen States, for the most part African, is still not applicable. It has only been ratified by three of the 35 States required for its entry into force.\n\n## The Tokyo Convention (1963)\n\nThe Tokyo Convention, in force since December/uni00A04, 1969, sets out the principles and establishes the procedures for handling o/ffences against penal law (except those of a political nature and based on racial or religious discrimination) and acts endangering the safety of the aircraft or that of the persons and property on board.\n\nOne of the specific characteristics of this Tokyo Convention is that it recognizes certain powers and immunities of aircraft commanders, exonerating them, under certain conditions, from responsibility for any harm potentially caused to individuals committing such unlawful acts.\n\nThis Tokyo Convention (ratified by France in 1970) is currently the subject of a revision process within the ICAO.\n\nA Protocol to amend the Tokyo Convention was adopted in Montreal on April/uni00A04, 2014. It gathered the minimum of 22/uni00A0 ratifications required for its entry into force and is thus applicable in the States having ratified it. It was ratified by France at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThis Montreal Protocol expands the jurisdiction by recognizing, under certain conditions, the jurisdiction of the State of Landing and the State of the Operator over o/ffences and acts committed on board aircraft. The establishment of such jurisdiction over o/ffences is mandatory if the criteria stipulated in the Protocol are respected. Furthermore, the Protocol grants legal recognition and some protections to in-flight security o/fficers. It also contains provisions covering matters such as intra-State coordination, due process of law and fair treatment.\n\n## Open Skies agreements between Europe and third-party countries\n\nBased on mandates issued by the Council of Ministers, the European Union and its Member States have signed air transport agreements with the following third-party countries:\n\n- -United States : the agreement signed in April/uni00A02007 was amended by a protocol of June/uni00A02010 enabling, notably, European airlines to operate an unlimited number of flights, aircraft and routes to the United States from any European airport with the freedom to set prices, and to operate their services within the framework of cooperation agreements with partners of their choice. This agreement does not change the US rules on ownership and control and, similarly, cabotage remains forbidden;\n- -Canada : the agreement signed in December/uni00A02009 o/ffers EC carriers similar opportunities to those figuring in the agreement with the United States and also includes the same restrictions;",

        "page_content": "- -European Union neighboring countries : the agreement signed with Morocco in December/uni00A02006 was the first in a series of agreements signed with European Union neighboring countries: Georgia and Jordan in December/uni00A02010, Moldavia in June/uni00A02012 and Israel in June/uni00A02013. These agreements foresee the liberalization of bilateral air relations subject to the relevant countries adopting the EU aviation-related acquis;\n- -Balkan States (Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, UNMIK, Montenegro, Serbia): the agreement signed in June/uni00A02006 aims to create a common air space. At the end of transition periods that vary by country, the Balkan airlines will benefit in Europe from the same tra/ffic rights as EC airlines. At this stage, only the 3 rd /uni00A0and 4 th /uni00A0f reedom rights have been liberalized.\n\nIn April/uni00A02002, the European Union also signed an air transport agreement with Switzerland giving Swiss carriers, which are assimilated with EU carriers, access to all the intra-Community rights with the exception of cabotage.\n\nAccess to the market between France and States other than those mentioned above for which there are existing agreements at European Community level remains governed by bilateral aviation agreements signed between France and these third-party States.\n\n## Community air transport policy\n\nThe regulation applicable to air transportation within the European Union is primarily of European Community origin. The aims as outlined in the work programs of the European Commission are to reinforce the competitiveness of European Community airlines while insisting on the need to reduce the air transport industry's environmental impact and offer a high degree of passenger protection (1) . The principal positive measures consist of establishing a legal framework favoring fairer competition between EU and third-party carriers, the e/ffective implementation of the Single European Sky and a commitment to developing biofuels. The European Commission also proposed a series of measures known as the 'Better Airports' package, aimed at reducing the cost of infrastructure use within the European Union. The latter initiatives have only come to very partial fruition due to persistent disagreements within the European institutions. A new European Commission Aviation Strategy was published on December/uni00A07, 2015 but the concrete consequences of the proposed measures remain to be evaluated. This strategy should notably be reflected in the adoption of a new EC commercial defense instrument aimed at protecting European airlines against competition from subsidised air carriers from third-party countries.\n\n## 6.4.3/emspace Other legal aspects of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activities\n\nAccess to the main international airports is subject to the prior allocation of time slots. A European Regulation covers access to most so-called coordinated European airports (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc.). Elsewhere in the world, the allocation of slots is generally done on the basis of recommendations issued by IATA in a Worldwide Slot Guidelines reference document. Countries nonetheless retain sovereignty for defining the modalities of slot allocation and may apply rules that di/ffer slightly from the IATA recommendations (e.g. China, Japan, United States, Dubai, etc.).\n\nFor airports within the European Union, each Member State with coordinated airports under its responsibility, after consulting the airlines that regularly use the airports concerned, their representative organizations and the airport authorities, must designate a coordinator or an entity to be responsible for the allocation of slots and the monitoring of their use. Such individuals or entities must have specialized knowledge of coordinating aircraft routes for air transport companies.\n\nSlots are allotted twice a year by the designated airport coordinator, at the same time as the airline flight schedules for the relevant IATA season.\n\nThe allocation procedure is as follows:\n\n- -  airlines file their slot applications with the coordinator five months prior to the beginning of each season;\n- -  the coordinator first allocates slots to airlines that already had slots the previous season (known as grandfather rights) for past operations;\n- -  a pool is then created that regroups, for each coordination period, all the available slots, whether they are newly created, unused, abandoned by a carrier or have become available for any other reason;\n- -  finally, the coordinator allocates half of the pooled slots to newcomers and the other half to the other operators.\n\nSince slots are first allocated to existing long-standing operators, and given the expansion plans of all the airlines, requests for new slots are rarely satisfied at saturated airports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n6",

On October/uni00A014, 2020, in view of the continuing public health crisis and the weak demand for air transportation in the coming months, the European Commission decided to extend this exception from the requirement to the whole Winter scheduling season, i.e. until March/uni00A027, 2021. A further amendment to the Regulation enabling the easing of the conditions relating to the operation of slots and covering a period extending until the IATA Summer\n\n2022 season is expected be adopted by the end of February 2021 (see also paragraph 3.1.2.3 'Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots').\n\n## Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\nSee section/uni00A03.1.2.4.\n\n## Framework for State support within the context of the public health crisis\n\nIn March/uni00A02020, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State Aid rules to support the economy and companies facing the consequences of the public health crisis. Recapitalization measures for companies by Member States will be authorized within this framework until September/uni00A030, 2021. The implementation of measures to reinforce the Group's liquidity (guarantee by the State of a \u20ac4/uni00A0billion bank loan (PGE) and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State, together with the guarantee by the Dutch State of a \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion revolving credit faciliity and a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion loan from the Dutch State) was submitted for prior approval to the European Commission pursuant to the rules on State Aid, applying the aforementioned Temporary Framework.\n\n## 6.5/emspace INFORMATION AND CONTROL\n\n## 6.5.1/emspace Person responsible for the Universal Registration Document and for the Annual Financial Report\n\nBenjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## 6.5.2/emspace Certification by the person responsible for the 2020 Universal Registration Document\n\nApril/uni00A07, 2021,\n\nI hereby declare that, to the best of my knowledge, the information contained in this Universal Registration Document reflects reality and that nothing has been omitted that would be likely to change the significance thereof.\n\nI further declare that, to the best of my knowledge, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, financial position and results of the Company and\n\nall the companies within the consolidation scope, and that the information contained in the management report figuring on pages 6/uni00A0to 12, 13/uni00A0to 43, 47/uni00A0to 129, 131/uni00A0to 160, 161/uni00A0to 180, 182/uni00A0to 234 and 361/uni00A0of this Universal Registration Document provides a true and fair view of the changes in the business, results and financial position of the Company and all the companies within the consolidation scope, and that it outlines the main risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Benjamin Smith\n\nChief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM",

On January/uni00A020, 2016, at the European Aviation Summit, the five largest European airline groups - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, easyJet, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa Group and Ryanair - announced the creation of the new association.\n\nThe five groups, which carry more than 50% of passengers in Europe, chose to join forces with the aim of influencing European aviation policy.\n\nA4E aims to replace the AEA in lobbying the European Commission e/ffectively on at least three major measures:\n\n- -  reducing European airport charges;\n- -  ensuring a safe and e/fficient air space by reducing the cost of air tra/ffic control (ATC);\n- -  stimulating increased economic activity and employment by creating an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\n## AEA\n\nAssociation of European Airlines. Created in 1952, notably by Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the AEA represents the interests of its members within the European Union institutions, the European Civil Aviation Conference and other organizations and associations.\n\n## Available seat-kilometers (ASK)\n\nTotal number of seats available for the transportation of passengers multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Available ton-kilometers (ATK)\n\nTotal number of tons available for the transportation of cargo, multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Biometry\n\nTechnique enabling the identity of an individual to be verified, while crossing a national border for example, through the automatic recognition of certain pre-recorded physical characteristics.\n\n## Coordinated airport\n\nAirport where a coordinator has been appointed to allocate landing and take-o/ff slots according to rules established in advance. All large European Union airports are coordinated.\n\n## Cabotage\n\nAirline cabotage is the carriage of air tra/ffic that originates and terminates within the boundaries of a given country by an air carrier of another country.\n\n## Capacity\n\nCapacity is measured in available seat-kilometers.\n\n## Catering\n\nIn-flight catering involves the planning and preparation of meals and the assembly of meal trays destined to be served on board an aircraft.\n\n## Codeshare\n\nIn accordance with a codeshare agreement, two partner airlines o/ffer services on the same aircraft, each under their own brand, their own IATA code and their own flight number. Codesharing may take two forms. In the first case, the two airlines purchase and sell seats to and from each other at an agreed price. The airline which has purchased the seats then markets them under its brand and at its fares. In the second case, under the system known as free flow, the two airlines are allowed to sell all the seats on the flights involved. Each airline retains the revenues generated on the flight it operates and remunerates the other airline for the number of seats the latter has sold on its aircraft.\n\n## Combi\n\nAircraft whose main deck is equipped for the transportation of both passengers and cargo. The freight is stored at the back of the aircraft and is accessed by a specially-fitted cargo door.\n\n## Connecting tra/ffic\n\nTra/ffic between two destinations which are not linked by a direct flight.\n\n## DGAC\n\nDirection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile. Under the authority of the French Ministry of Transport, the DGAC is in charge of the security of air transport and of air space in France.\n\n## DGTL\n\nDirectoraat-Generaal Transport en Luchtvaart. Under the authority of the Dutch Ministry of Tra/ffic and Public Works, the DGTL is in charge of the security of air transport and of air space in the Netherlands.\n\n## E-services\n\nRange of ground services o/ffered by Air/uni00A0France and KLM to their passengers, based on the new information technologies. E-services notably enable passengers to check in using self-service kiosks or via the airlines' websites as well as the use of electronic tickets.\n\n## EASA\n\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency. EASA develops safety and environmental protection expertise in civil aviation in order to assist the European institutions to establish legislation and implement measures regarding aircraft security, organizations and associated sta/ff.",

An electronic or e-ticket replaces a traditional paper ticket.\n\n## FAA\n\nFederal Aviation Administration. Body responsible for civil aviation security in the United States.\n\n## Handling\n\nPreparation of the aircraft, involving loading and unloading, as well as the associated logistics such as management and storage of hotel products.\n\n## Hub\n\nTerm used for a transfer platform where departures and arrivals are scheduled to minimize transit times. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM disposes of two of the four major European hubs: Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol. The Air/uni00A0France and KLM hubs are organized into successive waves for arrivals and departures each day in order to increase the transfer opportunities for customers.\n\n## IATA\n\nInternational Air Transport Association. Created in 1945, IATA establishes regulations for the air transport industry and provides its members with a framework for the coordination and proper implementation of tari/ffs, together with various commercial and financial support services.\n\n## ICAO\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN Specialized Agency, promotes the safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation worldwide. It establishes the standards and regulations required to ensure the safety, security, e/fficiency and continuity of aviation operations as well as the protection of the environment.\n\n## Joint-venture\n\nJoint company with two partners, often held equally with 50% each. This type of shareholder structure notably allows the implementation of technological or industrial alliances in order to undertake specific projects common to both partner companies.\n\n## Load factor\n\nRevenue passenger-kilometers (RPK) divided by available seat-kilometers (ASK). In the cargo activity this is revenue ton-kilometers (RTK) divided by available ton-kilometers (ATK).\n\n## Multi-hub\n\nSystem linking several hubs, allowing customers to access the networks developed from each hub, thus multiplying the round-trip o/ffer to and from worldwide destinations.\n\nAir transport glossary\n\n## Premium\n\nFare classes corresponding to business or first class.\n\n## Over-reservation or over-booking\n\nOver-reservation or over-booking consists of accepting more bookings than seats available. Practiced by all airline companies and permitted by European legislation, over-booking enables management of the fact that some passengers cancel their trips but not their reservations. It thus allows many passengers to find a seat on board flights that could have departed with available seats. Airlines usually have a passenger compensation policy.\n\n## Point-to-point tra/ffic\n\nTra/ffic between two airports, excluding passengers prolonging their trip with a connecting flight.\n\n## Revenue management\n\nTechnique designed to optimize revenue on flights, by constantly seeking a better balance between the load factor and the fares o/ffered.\n\n## Revenue passenger-kilometer (RPK)\n\nTotal number of paying passengers carried multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Revenue ton-kilometer (RTK)\n\nTotal number of tons of paid cargo multiplied by the number of kilometers that this cargo is carried.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nAirline safety includes all the measures implemented by air transport professionals aimed at ensuring the reliable operation and maintenance of aircraft.\n\nAirline security involves all the measures taken by air transport professionals to prevent any illicit or malicious act. Air transport is particularly exposed to terrorist acts due to the considerable media impact o/ffered by such activity. Airline security notably includes baggage screening, and the screening and questioning of passengers.\n\n## Self-service check-in kiosk\n\nSelf-service check-in kiosks, available in airport departure halls, allow passengers to check in and print their own boarding cards, without having to go to a check-in counter.\n\n## Segment\n\nSection of a flight between two destinations. The number of passengers is calculated by segment carried.\n\n## Slot\n\nA slot represents clearance given for a carrier to land at or take o/ff from an airport at a specified time and date.",
