Production at both mines was impacted by Covid-19 operational restrictions. At Noche Buena it was also affected by a reduction in operating areas as the mine approaches its planned closure and by a minor event in one of the pit walls.\n- \u00b7 Continued progress on the Juanicipio processing plant, with commissioning now expected by 4Q 2021, a few months later than anticipated due to delayed infrastructure contracts, Covid-19 preventive measures and a brief stoppage in construction.\n- \u00b7 The Pyrites Plant (phase II) at the Fresnillo district was completed on time and on budget. Start-up was deferred due to a delay in final inspections by the authorities as a result of Covid-19 restrictions on travel and other regulatory delays.\n- \u00b7 The Fresnillo flotation plant optimisation to cope with higher content of lead and zinc was completed on time and on budget. The connection of this new circuit to the beneficiation plant was postponed until early 2021 to avoid unnecessary interruptions to normal operations.\n- \u00b7 Silver resources up 1.6% primarily due to exploration at Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega; gold resources remained stable.\n- \u00b7 Silver reserves decreased 5.5% to 457.4 moz mainly due to depletion and higher cut-off grades at Fresnillo, and an updated mine production plan at San Juli\u00e1n which incorporates new geotechnical criteria, mitigated by the increase at Saucito.\n- \u00b7 Gold reserves decreased 8.8% to 8,438 koz primarily due to more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations at Herradura and depletion at Noche Buena.\n- \u00b7 We regret to report one fatality during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information See pages 40-65\n\n## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted revenue 1 of US$2,608.1 million, up 14.9% over 2019 due to higher gold and silver prices, which were partially offset by the lower volumes of gold and silver sold.\n- \u00b7 Revenue of US$2,430.1 million, up 14.6% over 2019 primarily due to increased adjusted revenue.\n- \u00b7 Gross profit of US$879.4 million, up 90.5% due to the favourable effect of higher average realised gold and silver prices; EBITDA 2 of US$1,169.1 million, up 73.4%.\n- \u00b7 Profit from continuing operations before net finance costs and income tax of US$649.7 million, up 278.3%.\n- \u00b7 Capex of US$412.3 million, down 26.3%.\n- \u00b7 Dividends of US$104.7 million paid, down 26.4%, in line with our dividend policy which includes a consideration of profits generated in the year.\n- \u00b7 Strong balance sheet and low leverage ratio; cash and other liquid funds 3 of US$1,070.4 million, up 218.0% driven by our debt restructuring and operational performance and in spite of the pandemic, investing US$412.3 million in capex and spending US$107.3 million on exploration expenses to underpin our future growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information See pages 66-77\n\n## ESG HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- \u00b7 Participated in the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) for the first time.\n- \u00b7 Partnered with our communities and the authorities to respond to Covid-19.\n- \u00b7 Made encouraging progress through our 'Step-Up' Culture programme to embed ethics into our organisational culture.\n- \u00b7 Launched a programme to prevent and address labour and sexual harassment.\n- \u00b7 Participated for the first time in the PAR Ranking, the largest ranking in Latin America that measures gender equity performance.\n- \u00b7 Included in the FTSE4Good Index, Ethisphere's list of the world's most ethical companies and ranked second in the Corporate Integrity Ranking in Mexico.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information See pages 78-109\n\n- 1 Adjusted revenue is the revenue shown in the income statement adjusted to add back treatment and refining costs and gold, lead and zinc hedging. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and realised prices. The reconciliation of Adjusted revenue to Revenue as shown in the income statement is provided on page 68.\n- 2 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation.

Covid-19 has posed new and difficult questions around how we all think and work. It has seen us embrace new behavioural norms that would have been unthinkable almost a year ago and, sadly, it has destroyed lives and livelihoods across the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE LIVING UP TO OUR PURPOSE",

        "page_content": "CORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nCash and other liquid funds increased from US$336.6 million to US$1,070.4 million, reflecting the increased cash generated by the mines and the restructuring of the debt.\n\nYou will find further details on our financial performance on pages 66-77\n\nOur dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. Our aim is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\nWe declared an interim dividend of 2.3 US cents per share, with a final dividend of 23.5 US cents per share, bringing the total for the year to 25.8 US cents per share.\n\nOur future financial performance should benefit from two actions taken during the year to ensure the stability and financial health of Fresnillo. Firstly, while we do not usually hedge silver and gold prices, unique market conditions presented an opportunity to limit downside risk while retaining significant upside exposure to future silver price increases. We have therefore locked-in 7% of 2021 silver production with an average floor price of US$20 per ounce, and with an average price ceiling of approximately US$50 per ounce.\n\nThe second action involved buying back a portion of the outstanding debt that was due to mature in 2023. With economic conditions indicating that this was a good time to return to the market, we bought back just under US$450m of outstanding debt and then placed US$850m of new debt due to mature in 2050. This new debt is in the form of a 30-year bond with an annual interest rate of 4.25% - a lower rate of interest than the 5.50% of the original bond set to expire in 2023. Going forward, this will have the effect of reducing our annual financing costs and lowering the balloon payment due in three years' time while also injecting cash into the business and underpinning the Company's financial future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring these dark and challenging days, the Fresnillo Purpose has come to the fore as a beacon for our behaviour and a guide to how we could best navigate the pandemic. When we first articulated our Purpose in 2019, it was important to us that it was not just a set of words to shape our future, but something that sprang directly from how we have always operated as a business.\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold.\n\nBy living up to our Purpose and holding fast to our culture and values throughout the pandemic, we have been able to protect and support our people, maintain production close to the expected levels and continue to contribute to the wellbeing of our stakeholders - including shareholders, local communities, suppliers, government authorities and the environment. Although our production was affected by the closing of the mines at the beginning of the pandemic, we have maintained production close to the expected levels.\n\n## A positive performance in difficult circumstances\n\nDespite the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the measures we introduced to mitigate its effect, production of silver from our underground mines generally remained within expected ranges. Gold production was lower than anticipated, largely due to the six weeks' interruption of mining at our open pit operations, as initially mandated by the authorities.\n\nIn spite of these difficult circumstances, the Company achieved US$2,430.1 million in total revenue and US$2,608.1 million in adjusted revenue during the year. This represented an increase of 14.6% and 14.9% respectively, primarily due to better prices for precious metals. Gross profit rose year-on-year by 90.5% to US$879.4 million, driven by a combination of higher prices and lower costs.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Putting people and communities first\n\nWhile the pandemic posed challenges for our operations, it also provided an opportunity to demonstrate our firm commitment to support our workforce and their families, our communities, the authorities and the country in difficult times.\n\nWe always put the health of our people at the front and centre of every action - and the decisions we made at the onset of the pandemic were no different. It was very pleasing to see the rapid and united response to the threat of Covid-19 at all our facilities, as management and the workforce collaborated to introduce a wide range of preventive measures to protect our people throughout the working day. These included social distancing at work as well as during transportation to and from our sites, the strict use of PPE and the installation of sanitisation stations. Our corporate office teams were required to work from home.\n\nWe quickly identified vulnerable members of the workforce - including contractors - and asked them to stay at home on full pay. We believe that testing is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of the virus, and we imported 30,000 tests capable of providing faster results than those generally available in Mexico at the time. When people tested positive, we instructed them to self-isolate and traced their contacts, who we also tested.\n\nFresnillo is an integral part of many communities - and this year, perhaps more than any other, the partnership between us has been absolutely central to the health and wellbeing of local people. We shared our Covid-19 tests with communities in remote locations, and donated medical and preventive equipment, including ventilators, to local health authorities. We also donated food, masks and anti-bacterial gels to vulnerable people, and continued to make sure that our employment and procurement processes put the needs of local communities first - and that included maintaining our payment terms and providing help to enable contractors and suppliers to implement health protocols. In addition, in the city of Fresnillo, we made some of our land available for a facility that increased the capacity of the local hospital.\n\nCommunication and partnership played important roles in our efforts to manage the virus, not only at our sites and in local communities, but also with the authorities. We worked closely with the Mining Ministry of Mexico to develop national workplace guidance for our industry - and that collaboration was central to the Government's reclassification of mining as an essential industry, enabling us to reopen our open pit operations in May 2020.",

For example, we piloted a virus awareness programme aimed at encouraging children to understand the dangers and then use their 'pester power' to pass the message on to their parents and other relatives.\n\n## Preparing the ground for further success\n\nAs the Chief Executive explains in his statement, the Fresnillo Full Potential plan is starting to have an impact on production at the Fresnillo mine. The impact would have been greater still without the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, but progress to date gives us cause for cautious optimism regarding future performance.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 pandemic continues to pose risks and uncertainties, silver production in the months and years ahead will grow with the start-up of the Juanicipio mine, which is on track to be operational in 4Q 2021. Ore produced during the mine development phase is currently being processed in the flotation plant at Fresnillo. Future production will also be increased when the recently-completed Pyrites Flotation Plant at Fresnillo is operational. Although we have made preparations to start-up commercial production, the inspection that is required to be carried out by the authorities in order to grant the energy permit has been delayed due to Covid-19 restrictions on travel. We anticipate that this inspection will take place in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOur exploration teams continue to identify and develop potential projects for our pipeline, including at Rodeo, which we expect to become the next open pit gold mine. The aim is to present the Rodeo project for Board approval in mid-2022. Meanwhile, work continues to complete the feasibility study of Orisyvo, a significantly larger and more complex gold project than Rodeo.\n\n- With concern for the impacts of climate change continuing to increase, the Board took steps to review and, where possible, intensify sustainable practices in all of our operations, becoming a registered supporter of the TCFD during the year. In line with our commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the HSECR Committee evaluated whether our Energy Strategy was sufficiently flexible to enable us to adopt a decarbonisation pathway compatible with the well below 2 \u00b0C scenario of the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Board activities\n\nFollowing our approval of the Company's Purpose at the end of 2019, the Board's focus for the year was on ensuring that we lived up to the promises made in our Purpose - and I believe that the events of the last year have proved both its validity and value.\n\nIn my introduction to the Governance Report on pages 136-137, I describe the Board's activities in more detail, including how we worked with our Executive Committee and our colleagues elsewhere in the BAL Group to ensure that our workforce and their communities were as safe as possible. This necessitated regular engagement with employees as well as the Government, as we sought to introduce processes and purchase equipment that enabled our mines to operate safely.\n\nDuring the year, an independent legal firm provided external facilitation for our 2020 Board and Committee effectiveness reviews, which this year included an assessment of how the Board performed during the pandemic. While there is always room for improvement, I was pleased that the review's findings were once again positive. We provide details of the review on page 152.",

        "page_content": "## Changes to the Board\n\nIt was with profound sadness that in November we learnt of the death of Luis Robles, who served as an independent Non-Executive Director since May 2019. I was privileged to know Luis personally and to work alongside him - he brought a great wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to our meetings and to our Company, and will be sorely missed by all at Fresnillo.\n\nI was delighted that Guadalupe de la Vega was elected as an independent Non-executive Director of the Company at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Guadalupe is a Managing Director and CEO of Almacenes Distribuidores de la Frontera, which owns and operates a chain of convenience stores, gas stations and medium format supermarkets in the north of Mexico. We will benefit from her strong commitment to communities. She has been involved in promoting economic and community development as part of the task force for Juarez Social and Economic Recovery Plan, working with the Government to help realign major infrastructure assets along with education in order to improve the region's competitiveness.\n\nGuadalupe's presence at Board meetings further strengthens our belief that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience and gender to oversee the execution and development of long-term strategy. Her appointment ensures that Fresnillo complies with the Hampton-Alexander Review requirement that at least 33% of Board members should be women. With racial inequality and ethnic diversity coming into greater focus, it was pleasing to see the Parker Review report that Fresnillo plc met the ethnicity target for FTSE 100 companies in 2020.\n\nJaime Lomel\u00edn retired as a Director during the year, having served on the Board since the IPO, initially as our Chief Executive Officer and since 2012 as a Non-executive Director. I am grateful to him for his wise counsel over many years, and am delighted that he will continue to act as an adviser, ensuring that we will still benefit from his valuable experience and knowledge.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nIn addition, Georgina Kessel has been appointed as a member of the Audit Committee from 1 March 2021, with Guadalupe de la Vega becoming a member of the Remuneration Committee on the same date.\n\nWe said farewell to two members of our Executive Committee during the year. Our Chief Operating Officer Andr\u00e9 Sougarret returned to his native Chile while David Giles retired from his role as Vice President Exploration, and I thank them both for the expertise and experience they brought to our Company. On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome their successors to Fresnillo, Tom\u00e1s Iturriaga and Guillermo Gast\u00e9lum respectively.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs I write, a significant degree of uncertainty remains over how, when and if the virus will develop and present further challenges, as well as over the efficacy and availability of a vaccine. However, as this extraordinary event unfolds, one thing is certain - guided by our Purpose and underpinned by our culture, we will continue to work tirelessly to protect the wellbeing of our people and all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank management and particularly our operational teams at the mines who have worked so hard to deliver satisfactory production results in the face of extremely challenging conditions.\n\nThe Group is in a strong position, supported by a sound strategy, a positive culture and an expert executive team. Production has stabilised as expected, and the pipeline of new mines and projects - together with a series of improvement programmes - provides us with solid grounds for optimism.\n\n## Alberto Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our values are embedded in our culture and support our strategy.\n\n## Trust\n\nMakes strategic relations more resilient\n\n## Responsibility and Respect\n\nNurtures care and accountability\n\n## Integrity\n\nPrevents the negative consequences of unethical actions\n\n## Loyalty\n\nBuilds long-term and reciprocal relations\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "By engaging with our stakeholders - the mining authorities, suppliers and local communities as well as our people - we have been able to minimise the pandemic's impact on our operations. The result is that regardless of the many new ways of working that our teams have had to adopt, we have largely stabilised production, which was identified as a key priority at the end of last year. We remain committed towards achieving our operational objectives and delivering our projects in order to regain the confidence of our investors.\n\nI would like to welcome Tom\u00e1s Iturriaga to the Executive Committee following his appointment as Chief Operating Officer, while also placing on record my thanks to Andr\u00e9 Sougarret for his contribution to our recent operational improvements. I look forward to working closely with Tom\u00e1s in the years to come, as we bring forward new actions to further maximise the potential of our existing operations.\n\nI would also like to thank David Giles for his significant contribution to Fresnillo over many years and wish him well in his retirement, while at the same time congratulating Guillermo Gast\u00e9lum on his appointment. He brings with him proven technical skills, a deep understanding of our operations and considerable experience, all of which will contribute to the further strengthening of our pipeline of exploration projects and prospects.\n\n## Production highlights and price review\n\nProduction of silver remained broadly in line with our expectations, despite the difficulties generated by Covid-19, and although gold production fell due to a temporary suspension of mining activities, it ended the year more strongly.\n\nAs expected, total silver production remained stable and within our guidance at 53.1 million ounces. The lower production was due to a combination of fewer workers on site due to the Covid-19 preventive measures we implemented, and a lower ore grade processed at Saucito. These factors were mitigated by a higher grade at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body and the processing of development ore from our new Juanicipio mine for the first time.\n\nMining activities at our Herradura and Noche Buena open pit gold mines in the north of Mexico were suspended for around six weeks at the start of the pandemic. Concerns about the virus spreading from Arizona across the border and into the State of Sonora forced the State government to impose tougher restrictions at the onset of the pandemic, and these impacted our operations at Penmont. Although we continued to process ore during this period, the lack of new material being deposited on the leaching pads affected the recovery cycle and meant that once full activities restarted, production inevitably lagged behind expectations. Combined with reduced workforce levels for the remainder of the year, this resulted in gold production for the year decreasing by 12.1% to 769.6 thousand ounces, although still within our revised guidance.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nOur by-product lead and zinc production both increased year-on-year, driven by higher ore grades at Saucito.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease find more details on production at each of our mines on pages 52-65\n\nFollowing a positive performance in the previous year, precious metals prices again rose during 2020, with the average realised silver price reaching US$21.3 per ounce and that for gold hitting US$1,792.4 per ounce, an increase of 32.3% and 26.4% respectively. Average realised prices for zinc and lead decreased by 7.8% and 7.9% respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on precious metals prices and how they have been influenced by market dynamics See pages 18-19\n\n## Times change, but a sound strategy endures\n\nStability, consistency and a long-term perspective have always characterised Fresnillo, and our proven strategy once again anchored our performance during 2020. The strategy comprises four distinct pillars and I am pleased to report that we made good progress with each of them.\n\n## Maximising the potential of existing operations\n\nAs I outlined in last year's statement, this was our key focus for 2020. Although there remains more to do, we are now working smarter and with greater efficiency. In fact, our operational improvements would have been more pronounced still but for the preventive measures we introduced to counter the virus. For example, our new Covid-19 safety initiatives meant that only a limited number of people could work together in some of our mines, and this inevitably led to lower development rates.\n\nThe Fresnillo Full Potential (FFP) project aims to exploit the great potential that exists at our Fresnillo and Saucito mines, and in the surrounding area. Over the last 12 months, we have refined our mine planning operations, enhanced the certainty of our geological models and taken actions to stabilise production - focusing on controlling dilution and enhancing our blasting and drilling techniques to manage the deeper operations and narrower veins at both mines.\n\nOur US$22.7 million tunnel boring machine (TBM) began operations in the Fresnillo mine early in the year, as planned. Although the TBM had successfully bored over 1,300 metres by the end of December, we are working with the manufacturer and crew to improve performance - and we are confident that further improvements will be achieved in 2021. In particular, we aim to continue development in the western areas of the mine, which offer good potential.\n\nAs we go deeper into the earth, we have continued to work on a new, large capacity pumping station to replace a number of smaller ones and improve drainage, and also completed a new elevator that has reduced travel time for our underground teams.\n\nIn addition, we have advanced the deepening of the San Carlos Shaft. Started in June 2016, this project has extended the shaft from 550 metres down to 990 metres, and once it is fully operational in 2022, it is expected to provide access to 56% of the mine's reserves and reduce the haulage costs.\n\nOur investment in technology has begun to pay dividends. In addition to progress with the TBM, we continued to integrate semi-automatic drilling rigs into the Fresnillo mine. These rigs, which can be programmed to continue drilling during shift changes, completed 15 long hole stopes by the end of the year, as planned.\n\nAt Saucito, we are continuing to deepen the Jarillas shaft to 1,000 metres, helping to provide access to deeper levels of the mine where almost half of the reserves are located. Due to be completed in 2024, this will also allow us to transport ore to the surface more quickly than is possible using access ramps.\n\n## Delivering growth through development projects\n\nDespite the challenges presented by the pandemic, we concluded the first production stope at Juanicipio on schedule in mid-2020, with development ore being processed eight kilometres away at the Fresnillo plant during the third quarter. However, commissioning of the plant is now not expected until 4Q 2021, several months later than anticipated due to delayed infrastructure contracts, as well as Covid-19 preventive measures and the brief stoppage of work earlier in the year. Juanicipio will be a major factor in the Group's future silver production. A joint project with MAG Silver in which we hold a 56% share, the mine is forecast to produce 11.7 moz of silver and 43.5 koz of gold per year on average.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Once fully operational, and including production from the Saucito plant, we anticipate that it will produce an average of 3.5 moz of silver and 13 koz of gold per year.\n\nIn addition, further actions are enhancing productivity at Fresnillo, including the US$30 million plant optimisation project to improve the recovery of lead and zinc from lower levels of the mine. The new flotation circuit was completed in the second half of 2020 as anticipated, although we decided to postpone connection to the beneficiation plant until the first months of 2021 in order to minimise disruption by taking advantage of planned monthly maintenance stoppages. Once the Fresnillo mine has been sufficiently developed and is able to sustainably maintain a higher plant run rate, we will install the third and final stage of this project - the addition of vibrating screens to the plant - to increase the milling capacity to 9,000 tonnes per day. This is expected to take place in 2022.\n\n## Extending the growth pipeline\n\nThe identification and development of new mines such as Juanicipio are essential to the long-term strategy of the Group. While we have concentrated on improving the efficiency of our existing mines in recent months, exploration activities have continued to take place - not only in Mexico but also in South America - and we have increased the exploration budget for 2021, following the planned decrease for 2020 which was made more pronounced by uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.\n\nTwo new gold projects have moved closer to reality over the last year. The potential mine at Rodeo is on track to come before the Board for approval in mid-2022. We are currently consulting with local communities on the permitting process, while our exploration teams are working hard to move inferred resources into the indicated category. Although Rodeo will be a relatively small mine with an initial operational life of around seven to ten years, it offers a number of advantages. Capex is expected to be low, for example, because we intend to repurpose existing mining equipment from Noche Buena, as that mine nears its end of life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeveloping the potentially much larger mine at Orisyvo will require more capex and work, with the building of roads and infrastructure adding to the challenges posed by gaining access to land. However, this latter issue was partially resolved during the year as our team identified a new, viable location for infrastructure that is a better option for all stakeholders in the area. We are now increasingly confident that Orisyvo will join our portfolio of operational mines in the next few years.\n\nIn line with our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint, we have included the Rodeo, Orisyvo and Guanajuato exploration projects in our Energy Strategy.\n\nWe continued to undertake exploration activities in Peru and Chile during the year and see great potential in the areas where we have concessions.\n\nSilver resources stood at 2.3 boz, a 1.6% increase over 2019 mainly as a result of the exploration efforts at Saucito. Gold resources remained stable at 38.9 moz. Silver reserves decreased 5.5% to 457.4 moz mainly due to depletion and higher cut-off grades at Fresnillo and an updated mine production plan at San Juli\u00e1n which incorporates new geotechnical criteria, mitigated by an increase at Saucito. Gold reserves decreased by 8.8% to 8.4 moz primarily due to more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations at Herradura, which resulted in a smaller pit shell, and depletion at Noche Buena.\n\n## Advancing and enhancing the sustainability of our operations\n\nAlthough our safety record has improved significantly over the last decade, the need for constant vigilance and renewed effort was underlined during the year. Sadly, one of our colleagues was the victim of a fatal accident. This incident in August 2020 ended a period of 16 months without a fatality at any of our operations. Our 'I Care, We Care' programme has now been rolled out across the business and is a central aspect of all new development projects and operations, and we continue to target a steady improvement in all health and safety metrics.\n\nWe received the independent report on our 11 tailings storage facilities (TSFs) during the year, as I anticipated in last year's statement. The report has provided us with valuable information - and while our TSFs remain in good condition, we have nevertheless introduced new measures at specific facilities, notably in the Fresnillo district where some of the original infrastructure dates back to the 1940s.\n\nOur commitment to green energy is unchanged. The project to install dual fuel engines that run on both diesel and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) is on track, despite Covid-19 presenting the supplier with considerable challenges. However, the percentage of our energy consumption met by wind power decreased to 48%, due to a delay in the connection of the Las Mesas wind energy project. We provide more detail on these and other programmes on pages 93-99.\n\nWe remain committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, improving our energy efficiency and integrating clean energy sources into our electricity mix. We recognise the importance of complying with the TCFD and will continue making progress on assessing the carbon footprint of our Strategic Plan, measuring our performance and analysing scenarios to identify impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nAs we report on pages 132-134, one of the Company's Principal Decisions of 2020 was to evaluate the Energy Strategy with the aim of setting decarbonisation targets and assessing its resilience to the Transition Risks of Climate Change. This process involved forecasting our energy demand in the years to 2030 and took into account the impact of the LNG and wind power projects already under way. The evaluation concluded that it is technologically viable to support a decarbonisation pathway in the 2021-2030 period.\n\nAt Fresnillo, we have a long track record of being respected by our peers and the authorities for our social and environmental performance, and this continued during 2020. We ensure that our social programmes are based on the UN Global Compact - and we were again recognised as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, and also retained our membership of the FTSE4Good Index. In Mexico, our team was proud to win the Ethics and Values Award from the Mexican Council of Industrial Chambers, and to be commended for our standards of corporate integrity by Integridad Corporativa 500.",

        "page_content": "## Looking ahead\n\nLooking at silver volumes, our next wave of growth will be buoyed by steadily increasing production at Juanicipio, while the multiple ongoing operational programmes are forecast to increase production at Fresnillo. Lower ore grade at Ci\u00e9nega and reduced activity at Noche Buena in line with the mine closure plan, as well as slightly lower volumes at Herradura, are likely to lead to reduced gold production. However, the longer-term prospects for gold are good, supported by the potential new mines at Rodeo and Orisyvo.\n\nPrecious metals prices are likely to remain strong for 2021, supported by low interest rates and given the global macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. However, our aim is and always has been to perform well in times of low prices as well as high - and our cost reduction initiatives and operational improvements are targeted firmly at increasing margins regardless of the prices of precious metals.\n\nDue to the pandemic there is a relatively high degree of unpredictability about the year ahead, and I must strike a note of caution. Unless and until a vaccine is readily available, we recognise that any further outbreaks of the virus could impose further restrictions on our production, margins and profitability.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank the entire Fresnillo workforce, including our contractors, for their hard work, understanding and expertise during these difficult months. We have adapted to conditions that nobody could have anticipated or made plans for, and we have emerged as a stronger, more united business - together I believe we can look forward to the future with confidence.\n\n## Octavio Alv\u00eddrez\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## MARKETS REVIEW\n\nWe are impacted by global events and economic trends as well as by the business environment local to Mexico and the dynamics of the precious metals markets.\n\n## Gold is primarily an investment commodity and has been a highly sought-after precious metal for thousands of years.\n\nDeclared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the outbreak of Covid-19 has had and continues to have an adverse impact on the global economy. In Mexico and the vast majority of countries affected by the virus, governments have declared a state of emergency and have implemented severe lockdown measures which have contributed to a general economic slowdown. The pandemic has had numerous effects worldwide and negatively impacted communities, supply chains and general commercial activity. It has also caused significant volatility in the financial markets, undermining consumer and investor confidence in economic and business growth, and was, in part, responsible for the multi-year high precious metals prices we experienced during the year.\n\n## Market backdrop and precious metals prices performance\n\nOver the last ten years, the price of silver has fluctuated. From approximately 2004, it began to appreciate before reaching a high of US$48.44 per ounce on 28 March 2011. There then followed a steady decline until December 2015 when the price again started to recover. Over the course of 2020, the price of silver accelerated to reach multi-year highs, achieving around US$30 per ounce in early July - a level last seen in early 2013, representing an increase of 156% from its mid-March 2020 trough of US$12 per ounce.\n\nGold also recorded an impressive performance during 2020, reaching an all-time high of US$2,075 per ounce on 7 August, before retreating down to levels of around US$1,900 per ounce at year end.\n\nThe gains we saw during 2020 are the result of several factors. First and foremost, the global macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop has turned increasingly supportive for precious metals investment. As the Covid-19 crisis persists, caution about the solidity of the stock market rally, dollar weakness and the fall in bond yields have all raised the investment appeal of silver and gold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLooking ahead, the backdrop of negative real interest rates, persistent uncertainty and accommodative monetary policy mean that the fundamentals around gold remain strong. While the same holds true for silver, we could yet experience further upside to silver prices in the medium term due to increased industrial demand from the ongoing revolution in green technologies. This would be driven by the mainstream adoption and exponential growth of new energy vehicles and the continued investment in solar photovoltaic energy. Regarding the medium term prospects for gold, early-stage development of technologies including gold catalysts to help convert CO 2 into useful fuels and the use of gold to improve photovoltaics could facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Silver market and industry overview\n\nSilver is both an industrial and an investment commodity. For industry, it is an essential component in many products - with limited alternatives available - because of its unique combination of characteristics. These include strength, malleability, electrical and thermal conductivity, high reflectance of light, and ability to endure extreme temperatures. Like gold, silver also has significant appeal as an investment commodity because it is viewed as a safe haven and hedge against inflation during times of economic uncertainty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detailed information on the current silver industry and market information, please visit the Silver Institute's website at https://www.silverinstitute.org/\n\n## Demand\n\nDemand for silver is driven primarily by three markets: industrial applications; investment (coins and bars); and consumer (jewellery and silverware). In 2020, industrial, investment and consumer demand represented 50.1%, 20.8% and 25.4% of total global silver demand respectively, according to the Silver Institute's Interim review 1 . Silver demand fell to a ten-year low in 2020, down 6% against 2019 driven by lockdown restrictions hitting industrial\n\n- demand, with supply chains heavily disrupted, end-users adopting an increasingly cautious approach to inventory replenishment and factories facing labour supply problems. The reduction in demand from industry was mitigated to some extent by an increase in demand for silver as an investment, which hit a five-year high in 2020 off the back of increased price volatility and healthy price expectations.\n\n## Supply\n\nGlobal silver supply is predominantly from two sources: mine production; and recycled scrap. In 2020, mine production contributed 81.1% of total silver supply, with scrap providing 18.8% and the balance made up by net official sector sales. Silver mine production, which has shown a moderate but slow decline since 2015, fell by a further 6.3% in 2020 compared with 2019, to 780.1 moz. This is largely due to Covid-19 lockdowns implemented by countries during the first half of the year, which required several major silver producers to temporarily halt production at their mines. Primary silver producing mines continue to produce only 28.7% of mine production 2 , with the remaining 71.3% extracted as a by-product from lead, zinc, copper and gold mines.\n\n## Gold market and industry overview\n\nGold is primarily an investment commodity and has been a highly sought-after precious metal for thousands of years. Its continuing appeal as an investment commodity is due to its long history as a store of value. Gold also has industrial applications, primarily in dentistry and electronics. It is widely considered to be one of the most useful metals because of the diversity of its properties, which include malleability, conductivity and resistance to corrosion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detailed information on the current gold industry and market information, please visit the World Gold Council website at https://www.gold.org/\n\n## Demand\n\nDemand for gold is driven by four markets: jewellery; retail investment; industrial fabrication; and net official sector. In 2020, these markets accounted for 37.5%, 47.2%, 8.0% and 7.3% of total global demand respectively, according to the World Gold Council 3 . In 2020, total gold demand decreased by 14% compared with 2019, the lowest level of demand since 2009 driven by a combination of the global pandemic with its resultant market lockdowns and a record gold price at a time of economic slowdown. According to Metal Focus, the overall macroeconomic backdrop is set to remain supportive for gold, with numerous political and economic uncertainties likely to lead to stock market volatility and greater risk aversion.",

        "page_content": "## Supply\n\nGold supply primarily originates from two sources: mine production; and recycled scrap. In 2020, mine production and recycled scrap accounted for 73.4% and 28.0% of total gold supply respectively. Gold mine production decreased to 4,633.1 tonnes in 2020, a fiveyear low, down 4.0% year-on-year. This was the second consecutive annual decline in production. It remains challenging for gold producers to discover and develop high-quality gold mines (high grade and low cost) in low-risk geographic regions.\n\n## Our operating environment\n\nWe are a leading precious metals company with operations in Mexico, which is Latin America's second largest economy and a country characterised by a mature tax and legal framework. We have significant experience and expertise in all aspects of mining, including the exploration, development, extraction and processing of ore with gold, silver, zinc and lead metal contents. While the country has a 500-year tradition of mining, its geological potential remains as strong as ever, with just over 240 companies undertaking mining projects in the country 4 , representing 8.3% 5 of Mexico's industrial GDP while also supporting over 379,000 direct jobs and almost two million indirect jobs.\n\nWith all our current operations located in Mexico, and with gold and silver both making significant contributions to revenue, Fresnillo is in a unique position: we are exposed to the market dynamics of the global precious metals industry, as well as those specific to companies operating in Mexico.\n\nIn the context of our peers, we are the world's largest silver producer according to the Silver Institute and Mexico's largest gold producer, in each case based on 2020 production volumes. To the right, we outline what we consider to be our peer groups.\n\n## Key industry trends\n\nThe global mining industry is subject to a number of underlying trends that impact its competitiveness and viability. The key trends below are those that also affect Fresnillo, and are discussed in greater detail in 'Managing our risks and opportunities' on pages 110-129.\n\n## Increased environmental and social focus\n\nPublic concerns regarding the potential social and environmental hazards of mining operations and developments have increased, both in Mexico and worldwide. The greater negative sentiment towards mine\n\ndevelopment and operation is evidenced by increased regulatory restrictions and social activism. Our response has been, and will continue to be, active engagement with all stakeholders and through sustainable business practices, positively contributing to society at large, as articulated by our Purpose.\n\n1\n\n- Refinitiv Interim Silver Market Review, 17 November 2020 - Online webinar.\n- 2 World Silver Survey 2020, April 2020.\n- 3 World Gold Council, Gold Demand Trends Full year and 4Q 2020, 28 January 2021.\n- 4 https://www.sgm.gob.mx/Web/SINEM/mining/mining\\_companies.html\n- 5 https://www.trade.gov/knowledge-product/mexico-m-mining-and-minerals\n- 6 Including Silverstream.\n\n## Strategic workforce challenges\n\nDriven by the negative sentiment around the industry, it is becoming more challenging to attract, develop and maintain a young, dedicated and skilled workforce in the Mexican mining industry.

Given that mining is an energy-intensive business and Fresnillo is a major player in the extractive industry, we recognise that we have a clear responsibility to play our part in mitigating our impact on the climate. At the same time, it is important to note that carbon emissions from gold production are significantly lower than those from most other major mined products including steel, aluminium and coal. Our goal is to improve our energy efficiency and progressively introduce cleaner technologies, including renewables, into our energy mix, in order to mitigate the physical, regulatory and reputational risks of climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe provide more detail on this challenge in the 'Energy and Climate' section See pages 93-99",

Please see pages 50-51 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Cost reduction initiatives started to be implemented but at a slower pace than anticipated, due to Covid-19 constraints.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure projects advanced across all operations including the deepening of both the San Carlos and Jarillas shafts in the Fresnillo District, and the tailings dams at Herradura, San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega.\n- \u00b7 Construction of the Pyrites Plant was concluded, although start-up was deferred pending final inspections by the authorities as a result of Covid-19 restrictions on travel.\n\n## ATTRIBUTABLE SILVER PRODUCTION /parenleft.caseMILLIONS OF OUNCES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 2.8 53.1 50.3 2.8   |\n|--------|---------------------|\n|   2019 | 54.6 51.8 2.8       |\n|   2018 | 61.8 58.1 3.7       |\n|   2017 | 58.7 54.2 4.4       |\n|   2016 | 4 50.3 45.7 4.6     |\n\n## 53.1\n\nAttributable silver production of 53.1 moz (including Silverstream), down 2.9% vs. 2019 due to the expected lower ore grade at Saucito, mitigated by a higher ore grade at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body (DOB) and development ore from Juanicipio being processed for the first time.\n\n## ATTRIBUTABLE SILVER RESERVES 1 /parenleft.caseMILLIONS OF OUNCES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   457.4 |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2019 |   484.1 |\n|   2018 |   476   |\n|   2017 |   501.7 |\n|   2016 |   530.3 |\n\n## 457.4\n\nSilver reserves decreased 5.5% to 457.4 moz mainly due to depletion and higher cut-off grades at Fresnillo and an updated mine production plan at San Juli\u00e1n which incorporates new geotechnical criteria, mitigated by the increase at Saucito.\n\n- 1 2020 resources are presented as of 31 May 2020.\n\n|   2020 |   8.4 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2019 |   9.3 |\n|   2018 |  11   |\n|   2017 |  11.7 |\n|   2016 |   9.5 |\n\n- \u00b7 Produce between 53.5-59.5 moz silver and 675-725 koz gold.\n- \u00b7 Prevent fatal or serious accidents.\n- \u00b7 Continue to monitor progress against our action plan in the Fresnillo District.\n- \u00b7 Monitor infrastructure projects to make sure they are developed in accordance with the mine plans.\n- \u00b7 Capture efficiencies and reduce costs.\n- \u00b7 Ramp up the tailings flotation plant at the Fresnillo mine, once it is commissioned.\n- \u00b7 Ramp up the Juanicipio plant once it has been commissioned.\n\n## ATTRIBUTABLE GOLD PRODUCTION /parenleft.caseTHOUSANDS OF OUNCES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   769.6 |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2019 |   875.9 |\n|   2018 |   922.5 |\n|   2017 |   911.1 |\n|   2016 |   935.5 |\n\n## 769.6\n\nAttributable gold production of 769.6 koz decreased 12.1% vs. 2019 driven primarily by a lower volume of ore processed at Herradura and Noche Buena. Production at both mines was impacted by Covid-19 operational restrictions. At Noche Buena it was also affected by a reduction in operating areas as the mine approaches its planned closure and by a minor event in one of the pit walls.\n\n## ATTRIBUTABLE GOLD RESERVES 1 /parenleft.caseMILLIONS OF OUNCES/parenright.case\n\n8.4\n\nGold reserves decreased 8.8% to 8,438 koz primarily due to more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations applied at Herradura, which resulted in an updated smaller pit shell, and depletion at Noche Buena.\n\n## PROGRESS AGAINST OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED",

Two different challenges have driven this reduction: a fall in the quantity of reserves, due to mineral mined not being adequately replaced, in addition to higher cut off grades (a term used in our industry to determine what part of a mineral deposit to include in a resource and reserve estimate); and to a lesser extent, a change in the quality of reserves, because our programme of infill drilling has intersected lower grades than expected in localised areas of the mines.\n\nWe are addressing this issue head-on, in three different ways:\n\n## Costs\n\nOur operational improvement plans aim to increase production levels while maintaining or lowering costs on a per unit basis, resulting in lower cut off grades, a principal factor underlying year-on-year changes. This will have the effect of increasing the reserves and resources available to us across our mine portfolio.\n\n## Infill drilling\n\nIn the past, we have maintained greater distances between drills, with the expected ore grade between those sites being inferred. We are addressing this by reducing the interval between drills. While some of the results of the extra drilling have revealed ore grades lower than expected, some have shown increased grades. In both cases, the programme is increasing certainty and therefore minimising the likelihood of unexpected grades in the future.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Exploration\n\nWe appointed Guillermo Gast\u00e9lum as Vice President of Exploration at the end of 2020, following David Giles' retirement after leading our exploration team for over a decade. Guillermo was previously the Deputy Director of Northern Mexico and Chile Exploration and has extensive knowledge of our assets and experience in the Mexican mining sector. Guillermo has joined one of the industry's most respected exploration teams.

By continuing to invest in exploration across all precious metals price cycles and regardless of the peaks and troughs of economies, we aim to keep our pipeline well-stocked with a steady flow of opportunities and, specifically, to replace reserves mined each year.\n\nOur exploration teams have a proud and highly respected reputation in the Mexican mining industry. They have been responsible for our most significant breakthroughs, such as those at San Juli\u00e1n and Saucito, and are ideally qualified to identify and develop new opportunities. One of the most important roles of our teams is to engage with local communities and seek their participation at an early stage of a project. Not only does this help safeguard our licence to operate, it also gives us the opportunity to meet and consult with local people, thereby ensuring that we are able to tailor any subsequent community support programmes to meet their specific needs.\n\nOur focus remains on Latin America, and in particular on maximising the geological potential in and around our current operations. At the same time, we are continuing to look to locate and consolidate new districts in Mexico, Chile and Peru where we have identified favourable gold-silver potential.\n\nAll our exploration projects are measured against a set of strict criteria to ensure they meet our operational and revenue objectives. For example, we will only proceed with a standalone project if it offers a minimum potential of 150 moz of silver or 2 moz of gold. We also consider a range of additional factors before commencing activities, such as ore grades, metallurgical recoveries, extraction costs, environmental impact, and sustainability and community investment, as well as the available infrastructure. Only those projects that score well against these requirements receive the green light.\n\nFurthermore, and in line with our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint, we have started to include our most advanced exploration projects into our Energy Strategy. In 2020, we mapped and considered the potential environmental impact of the Rodeo, Orisyvo and Guanajuato projects, however, carbon pricing for these and other projects will be evaluated once their exploration programmes are more advanced.",

        "page_content": "## 2020 Performance\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nOur reserves and resources have been audited by SRK since the IPO, with the 2019 and 2020 reserves at Juanicipio being audited by AMC. The 2020 audit scope was more detailed and in-depth than in prior years, when estimates of reserves and resources were affected by increasing costs, and this has resulted in a higher cut-off grade. To estimate resources and reserves, we apply the 2012 edition of the JORC code. For estimates at our operations and projects, we have used a gold price of US$1,400/oz. except at Herradura where we used US$1,600/oz, and a silver price of US$17.50/oz. Reserves and resources for the operating mines were estimated from data generated in the period 31 May 2019 to 31 May 2020 to allow for a timely completion of the audit. Costs used for cut-off and economic models were based on information as at the end of 2019. The mineral resource estimate for Orisyvo is unchanged from 2019 as no additional exploration was conducted, with the year's focus being on ongoing pre-feasibility studies. Silver resources increased by 1.6% to 2,292.5 moz primarily due to the positive exploration results at Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega; gold resources remained stable at 38.9 moz. Silver reserves decreased 5.5% to 457.4 moz mainly due to depletion and higher cut-off grades at Fresnillo and an updated mine production plan at San Juli\u00e1n which incorporates new geotechnical criteria, mitigated by an increase in reserves at Saucito. Gold reserves decreased 8.8% to 8,438 koz primarily due to more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations applied at Herradura, resulting in an updated smaller pit shell, and depletion at Noche Buena.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS /endash.case EXPLORATION\n\n## CONTINUED\n\nOur priority during 2020 was to explore in and around our existing operations. In fact, 94% of the 682,113 metres drilled during the year was carried out at, or close to, our existing operations. The following section provides details about our exploration pipeline, highlighting progress made in 2020 as well as outlining our plan for the year ahead.\n\nWe continued standardising and improving our processes during the year, expanding our dedicated cross-functional ore reserve team from six to 23 members. This team is focusing its efforts on applying new first principles cost models, improving geotechnical modelling and initiating the engineering studies required to increase levels of confidence in the reserves and resources at our operating assets, including geotechnical evaluations as well as hydrology and hydrogeology studies. These processes and improvements will continue through 2021, and we expect to begin incorporating the outputs into our reserves and resources estimation process, as required by the auditor.\n\n## Exploration at our existing mines\n\nExcellent exploration potential exists around our operating mines, where numerous drill targets have been outlined using geological, geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing data, analysed and interpreted by our expert team. Exploring these targets represents a good opportunity to add value to our current operations by increasing our resource and reserve base. Following this approach, a significant portion of the 2020 budget was devoted to brownfield exploration, with 505,463 metres of core drilling completed.\n\nThe objectives of the drilling campaigns at our mines are threefold: (i) replenish and augment our mineral reserves, converting inferred resources into the indicated category with infill drilling; (ii) increase the total and inferred resources drilling both at extensions of known mineralisation and testing new targets; and (iii) ensure the quality of the reserves blocks scheduled to be mined in the short term with selected additional drilling wherever deemed necessary due to grade variations. We work hard to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and to drive growth by replenishing depleted reserves and maintaining a robust growth pipeline.\n\nGreat potential exists in brownfield sites around our existing mines - and this is where the majority of our exploration budget was invested during 2020, supporting 136,016 metres of drilling in the areas of influence around the mines. In addition, we drilled 48,252 metres in greenfield targets where we are consolidating districts.\n\nWithin the mines, our focus was on infill drilling campaigns to define reserves and convert inferred resources into indicated resources, as well as to identify new resources within the mine area. In 2020, drilling in the mines totalled 505,463 metres.\n\n## Fresnillo District\n\nWhile Fresnillo is one of the most important silver districts in the world, our exploration activities show that it remains under-explored. We are addressing this opportunity through an integrated approach based on detailed mapping, geophysics and geochemistry. We are following up three high-priority exploration targets located within the area of influence of the processing facilities, with positive results.\n\nAcross the district, the mines and exploration teams drilled 284,095 metres during the year.\n\n## Herradura District\n\nWe carried out a total of 99,176 metres of drilling in the Herradura District in 2020. Activities were focused within the final Centauro pit to identify additional mineralised sections and to better define reserve blocks. Beyond the pit limits, drilling was intensified in the high-grade gold veins, where mineable thickness and good grade continuity was successfully proven.\n\n## Ci\u00e9nega District\n\n56,065 metres of core drilling were completed at Ci\u00e9nega during 2020, with a continued focus on the new veins discovered in the northeastern part of the District. The discovery in 2020 of the Santa Alicia vein further adds to the exploration potential of the sector, along with the extensions of the Rosario Transversal and AFT veins located in the same area. In addition, extensions of the most promising veins in the central and western sections of the mine are being drill tested along with targets in the San Ram\u00f3n and Taspana satellite operations. A thorough review of the stratigraphy and mineralised areas around the main mineral zone at Ci\u00e9nega revealed several underexplored exploration targets in the central and southern part of the district; additional mapping and sampling is underway to deliver an optimised drill programme for these targets.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n District\n\nAn intense drill programme amounting to 202,143 metres was implemented by the mine and district exploration teams. Results were positive both in finding extensions to the veins under exploitation and in delineating new good-grade veins easily accessible from the current mine development works. A significant amount of new and indicated resources were added to the near- and medium-term mine plans.\n\nWe also initiated a drill programme to test exploration targets for new disseminated deposits. Targets were identified by the integration of a robust geological, geochemical, and geophysical database accumulated in the previous years. Interesting silver and base-metal values were discovered in favourable lithologies showing the diagnostic hydrothermal alteration of this deposit type. Information obtained was used to refine the vectoring tools and exploration models, resulting in the design of an updated drill programme that will be implemented in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Great potential exists in brownfield sites around our existing mines.\n\nWe deployed a team of geologists in San Juli\u00e1n to continue district-wide geological mapping and geochemical sampling. This effort has delivered an improved understanding of the stratigraphy and structural setting, as well as a number of promising exploration targets that will be followed-up with detailed work and drilling.\n\n## Development projects, preliminary economic assessments and feasibility studies\n\nProjects in this category have shown good potential for supporting our growth ambitions and have therefore been brought forward for further work. We carry out a wide range of exploration activities for these projects. For example, for projects in the relatively early stages we may conduct preliminary economic assessments (PEAs), which comprise an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources. For more advanced projects such as Juanicipio, we undertake extensive de-risking activities to refine models, explore the extents of mineralisation and provide comprehensive support to a project as it moves into and through the development stage - a key moment in the journey towards becoming an operational mine.\n\n## Juanicipio - development project (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% MAG Silver)\n\n27,899 metres of core drilling were completed during 2020 over the main NW-trending Valdeca\u00f1as and subsidiary veins. While most of the results were positive, only marginal changes to the existing mineral inventory were attained, because a reappraisal of the mining cost resulted in increased cut-off grades that offset the higher metal prices used in the resources and reserves estimation. Exploration potential remains open at depth in some sections of these veins, and both along strike and at depth in the NE-trending Venadas vein. This potential will be drill-tested in 2021, along with additional NE-trending targets in the western part of the tenement.\n\n## Advanced exploration projects Orisyvo\n\nFollowing a positive PEA, we completed a multi-purpose underground drill programme consisting of 7,600 metres distributed across 34 holes. These drill holes provided additional material needed to conduct detailed metallurgical investigation on the sulphide ores; studies will also include the determination of engineering parameters for the processing facility design. Geotechnical information was also collected to produce a new rock quality model for the mineralised and barren rocks making up this world-class deposit.\n\nGeochemical and geological information resulting from this programme was used to refine the mineralisation models and will be included in an updated resource estimation. The metallurgical, geotechnical and resource estimation studies will be completed in 2021 and will support a feasibility study.\n\n## Guanajuato\n\nGuanajuato is a historic, world-class gold and silver mineral system, which displays numerous attractive exploration targets that have the potential to increase its already large preciousmetals endowment. 21,374 metres of core drilling were completed in 2020 over priority vein zones, designed to increase both the total and the indicated resources, and to test at depth several pristine new veins discovered. Follow-up work on mineralogical anomalies determined using air-borne hyperspectral technology detected strong trace-element epithermal signatures, along with minor gold and silver showings. These pieces of information are evidence of upper level hydrothermal environments below which ore-bearing horizons have been preserved. Several of these locations are currently being drill-tested with promising results.\n\n## Rodeo\n\nThe Rodeo District contains a sizeable gold resource and a number of exploration targets in the neighbouring areas. The mineralised zone is amenable to open-pit mining and gold recovery using heap-leach technologies. We have strengthened a region-wide community relations programme and advanced negotiations with local land owners. Further exploration and development works have been delayed until an agreement is reached with the local Ejidos.\n\n## Tajitos\n\nExploration at Tajitos in 2020 consisted of detailed mapping and sampling of new exploration targets around the existing gold resources. Land access is currently being negotiated, and once obtained, application for environmental permits will be submitted. Drilling is expected to resume in 2H 2021.\n\n## Prospects\n\n## Mexico\n\n2020 was a year marked by the multiple restrictions imposed to counter the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mining was declared an essential activity for Mexico in April 2020 and mine operations were allowed to continue under strict health protocols. However, only limited exploration activities were completed outside of the main production centres. Assessment work required to maintain our mining claims in good standing was completed in Sonora, Zacatecas, Durango and Chihuahua states.\n\n## Peru\n\nNo drilling was completed at Pilarica in 2020. Two promising target areas with the potential to increase the resources of the project will be evaluated in 2021, with detailed geological mapping and sampling taking place. The Peru exploration budget was adjusted to allow for the initiation of drilling at Supaypacha, where drilling results validate the gold exploration potential, and to strengthen the community relations programme at Santo Domingo where significant progress has been made.\n\n## Chile\n\nThe Capricornio project, located in the Antofagasta region, displays a significant quartz vein system with interesting precious-metal values at the surface. Drilling in 2020 was limited to 800 metres in six holes, due to pandemicrelated travel and logistics limitations. All the drill holes successfully identified vein continuity. The drill programme will resume in 2021.\n\nAt the Condoriaco project near La Serena, 2020 drilling amounted to 10,211 metres distributed in 34 holes testing nine of the veins occurring in the 5 x 8 kilometre vein field. Mixed results were obtained from 1 - 3 metre-thick veins at shallow depths. Drilling will continue in 2021 in the remaining unexplored veins and we will also test the existence of district-wide deeper ore-shoots.\n\n## Early stage exploration\n\nThe 2020 Company-wide exploration plan focused on brownfield sites, coupled with travel restrictions related to the pandemic, resulted in a decreased activity in greenfield areas. In Mexico, reconnaissance work was done in Sonora (Herradura Corridor), Chihuahua (Santa Brigida, Candame\u00f1a), Durango (Ci\u00e9nega region) and Zacatecas states, while several prospect areas remained on stand-by. In Peru and Chile, regional prospecting works were performed in the Puno and the Talca/Taltal regions, respectively. GIS-related tasks were performed by our six exploration offices - and their analysis of updated databases led to the definition of regional exploration targets which will be followed-up in 2021.",

This project was divided into two phases, with the first phase consisting of the iron flotation circuit and pyrites leaching plant at the Saucito mine. This was commissioned mid-2018.\n\nThe second phase comprised a 14,000 tpd tailings flotation plant at the Fresnillo mine that will process the ongoing and historical tailings from the mine to produce a pyrites concentrate. This will be sent to a filtration plant and then on to the leaching plant at Saucito for the final part of the process to produce the precipitates.\n\nThe Pyrites Plant at Saucito (phase I) produced 920 koz of silver and 3,452 ounces of gold in 2020. However, production is expected to total an average of 3.5 moz silver and 13 koz gold per year once both phases are operating at full capacity.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nThe construction of the flotation plant at Fresnillo was commissioned on time in 2H 2020 and in line with the budget of US$49 million. However, the start of operations has been deferred to 3Q 2021 due to a delay in final inspections by the authorities as a result of Covid-19 restrictions on travel and other regulatory delays. These inspections are required in order to provide the energy permits needed to operate the plant. Once the final inspection by the authority is carried out and electrical permits have been approved, we expect the plant to ramp up to full capacity within one quarter. Given the current Covid-19 situation in Mexico, we do not foresee inspections taking place in the first half of the year, thus pushing back the start up of the plant to 3Q 2021.",

A three-stage project, the first phase was completed in 2017 and comprised the installation of an additional zinc thickener. This year, construction of the second phase consisted of the installation of additional flotation cells to increase the plant's capacity to process ore with higher lead and zinc grades, while maintaining the time the solution remains in the cells. The third and final stage, increasing the plant capacity to 9,000 tpd from its current\n\n## Timeline:\n\n- \u00b7 Phase I was completed in 2017 and phase II was commissioned in 4Q 2020. Phase III will only be undertaken once the mine has been sufficiently developed and prepared in order to sustain the increase in the beneficiation plant capacity to 9,000 tonnes per day.\n\ncapacity of 8,000 tpd through the use of vibrating screens, will only be undertaken once the mine is able to sustain a consistent level of development, sufficient to maintain this higher level of processing capacity.\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nThe installation of the flotation cells, the second stage of optimisation of the Fresnillo beneficiation plant, was commissioned on time and on budget. The connection of this new circuit was postponed to early 2021 to avoid unnecessary interruption to the normal operation of the plant.\n\n## 2021 Priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Integrate the new flotation cells into the beneficiation plant's circuit in early 2021, minimising operational impact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a standalone project, located 14 kilometres from the Fresnillo mine, which is being constructed, developed and operated by Fresnillo plc.\n\nThe Juanicipio deposit consists of two main vein systems, the Valdeca\u00f1as vein system and the Juanicipio vein, which are significant silver-gold epithermal structures. The Valdeca\u00f1as vein system displays the vertical grade transition typical of the principal veins in the Fresnillo District, observed as a change from silver- and gold-rich zones at the top to increased lead and zinc in the deeper reaches.\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nMine development continued to advance, despite progress being slowed due to Covid-19 restrictions, reaching 33.6 kilometres by the end of the year.\n\nFurthermore, we concluded the preparation of the project's first stope on time during 3Q 2020.\n\nAs planned, development ore began to be processed at the Fresnillo beneficiation plant in mid-2020, with 71,859 tonnes processed during the year. Attributable production was 349.2 koz of silver, 589.6 gold ounces, 107.6 tonnes of lead and 148.1 tonnes of zinc (total: 623.6 koz silver, 1,052.9 ounces of gold, 192.1 tonnes of lead and 264.4 tonnes of zinc).\n\n- 1 Feasibility study 2018.\n- 2 Represents 100% of investment (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% MAG Silver).\n- 3 Mineral resources quoted reflect Fresnillo plc's attributable 56% ownership.\n\nCommissioning of the plant is now expected by 4Q 2021, a few months later than anticipated as a result of delayed infrastructure contracts, as well as Covid-19 preventive measures and the brief stoppage of work earlier in the year. The plant is expected to reach 40-50% nameplate capacity in 4Q 2021 and 90-95% in 2022.\n\nBy bringing forward the start-up of the underground mine to 2H 2020, we have improved cash flow as income from production is accelerated and capex spend is spread across a longer period. Furthermore, the early start-up has further de-risked the metallurgical process by increasing our knowledge of the ore and enabling us to maximise recovery rates, which are expected to contribute to a quicker and more certain ramp-up to 4,000 tonnes per day once the Juanicipio beneficiation plant is commissioned.\n\nSilver resources 3 at Juanicipio increased 4.5% to 161 moz, while gold resources decreased by 1.2% to 817 koz. Silver reserves at the project also increased, up 2.3% at 88 moz while gold reserves decreased by 4.3% to 419 koz.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

We've established safety concepts and metrics similar to those used by the best in our industry - and that's given us a solid knowledge base that we're using to introduce a new concept of 'high potential incidents', identifying and addressing specific events so that we can reduce the likelihood of fatal accidents.\n\nIn relation to stabilising our operations, we've addressed technical issues such as geotechnical stability at the San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body. We've also improved our control of key operational variables such as dilution, mine development capacity and maintenance.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, we've paid particular attention to tailings dam management, including assessing the dams, evaluating changes to dam design and facilitating external reviews by an independent expert panel according to international standards and best industry practice.\n\n## TI\n\nIt's clear that you've worked hard to put even more resource behind an already very skilled specialist team in order to further improve the long-term planning process. I know that efforts to standardise and improve the estimation process for resources and reserves have continued. We'll be supporting the progress achieved in 2020 by carrying out additional work in 2021 to generate a more accurate picture of the life of each mine and, therefore, a more focused strategic long-term plan for the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tom\u00e1s Iturriaga (TI)\n\nAndr\u00e9, before we go on to explore the task ahead, I'd like to thank you for a smooth and effective handover. It's been a privilege to work alongside you over these last few months.\n\n## Andr\u00e9 Sougarret (AS)\n\nIt's been a great process. While adhering to Covid guidelines, we visited sites, reviewed work in progress and talked through the challenges and opportunities that each of the operating units faces. Our time together has also enabled us to discuss key aspects of the long-term plans and optimisation initiatives at our mines, including how they are organised, the relationships with unions and the business environment in general.\n\nYou have extensive experience in our industry - and this experience is going to prove invaluable as you tackle the challenges ahead.\n\n## TI\n\nYes, during my role at Goldcorp, I had the opportunity to develop a number of projects. For example, I worked on the construction of a new mine, and gained experience as a mine manager, and as Chief Operating Officer Mexico and Regional Vice President and General Manager Mexico. I also helped to close El Sauzal mine and to start-up the Los Filos and Pe\u00f1asquito mines - the latter being one of the biggest mines in Mexico at the time. In addition, I've been fortunate to manage mining operations in both Canada and the United States, so I believe my experience is well-suited to the COO role at Fresnillo.\n\n## AS\n\nAs a former Director of Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations at Pe\u00f1oles, you were of course already familiar with some of the opportunities and challenges at Fresnillo. But I hope our regular meetings have really helped to put flesh on the operational bones for you. I think you now have a rounded and comprehensive view of what's been achieved so far - as well as how to address challenges down the road.\n\n## AS\n\nLooking ahead, in general we both agree that your main challenges are around Fresnillo's drive to improve safety while maximising the potential of existing operations.\n\n## TI\n\nAbsolutely. As well as being efficient, mining can and should be carried out in a sustainable way, which means that our operations should be performing to the highest standards of safety, environmental care and social responsibility, and contributing to the wellbeing of people in line with our Purpose.\n\nMy priorities include focusing on preventing fatal and serious accidents, by implementing the High Potential Incidents programme that you initiated, which is a step up for Fresnillo following the successful Me Cuido Nos Cuidamos ('I Care, We Care') programme. The Company has a target of zero fatal accidents and I'm going to do my best to help achieve that.\n\nI'm also going to spend a significant portion of my time monitoring infrastructure projects to make sure they're developed in accordance with the mine plans, and on maturing programmes to capture efficiencies and reduce costs. For example, we need to continue to concentrate on controlling dilution, improving maintenance indicators and managing our inventories of spare parts.\n\nThe FFP programme has already had an impact on operational performance - and we need to maintain attention on this, taking it further in search of even better performance. Other specific challenges for the coming year include assessing the deepening of the Herradura pit, and continuing to improve the Company's geological models as well as the reserves and resources estimates. The ongoing delivery of the Juanicipio project and the start-up of the Pyrites Plant at Fresnillo are also areas where my team will be bringing valuable expertise.\n\nFurthermore, I'm conscious of my responsibility to continue improving our energy efficiency by setting and monitoring targets that will help us reduce our carbon footprint. I will ensure that the team continues to implement initiatives that will help us achieve these important goals, including the installation of dual fuel systems in our haulage trucks at Herradura and the integration of more clean energy sources into our operations.\n\n## AS\n\nI know that the Company could not wish for a more experienced or appropriate person to take on the COO role. I wish you all the very best for the future.\n\n## TI\n\nThank you for laying down such solid foundations for me. As a mining professional, I'm excited by the challenge of managing the operations of the world's largest silver producer.",

However, as the years have progressed, the challenges of successfully operating the Fresnillo and Saucito mines which dominate this large district have become more acute. While the operations remain world-class and rich in potential, narrower veins, higher grade variability and greater depth have combined to stretch our teams.\n\nNow, a year on from implementing our action plan, progress has been achieved and operations have been stabilised, albeit not to the full extent that we had hoped at the beginning of the year.\n\nOne of the key challenges we identified was our ability to control dilution. We implemented a number of affirmative actions during the year, ranging from workforce training to assigning dedicated supervisors, in addition to aligning workforce incentive schemes to reflect our teams' actual performance in areas such as dilution.\n\nAs part of our continual drive to improve our processes, we have introduced the use of additional topographic scanners and have redefined a number of key variables around dilution control. However, this has led to a higher baseline than that we originally determined and used to set our targets for 2020. The new baseline and the thinner veins we have encountered meant that we did not meet our original target for the year, although we did succeed in reducing dilution rates by 2 percentage points at Fresnillo and 10 percentage points at Saucito. We take confidence from the fact that the new baseline provides increased visibility of the task ahead while the processed ore grades have improved, a trend that we expect to continue into 2021.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, we experienced a marked drop in personnel availability, driven by illness and self-isolation as well as by our insistence that older, more vulnerable members of our workforce should be protected from risk and work from home where possible. At one point, absenteeism at the Fresnillo mine reached over 21%, compared to an average of around 5% for the previous year. This lack of personnel was compounded by the fact that many of those staying at home were our more senior colleagues, leaving us short of valuable expertise and experience at the mines.\n\nInevitably, a reduced workforce on site brought challenges in several areas of our operations and impacted a number of the year's targets, including drilling, development, maintenance and downtime.",

        "page_content": "Nevertheless, our introduction of a reliabilityfocused maintenance system enabled us to reduce the average time between mechanical failures as well as the time between planned maintenance, both helping to ensure production continuity. Furthermore, from an operational perspective the systems we introduced to better monitor in-mine production and identify areas of opportunity started to bear fruit. For example, although Covid-19 meant that the anticipated increase in productivity from new working arrangements at Fresnillo did not transpire, we do expect the number of tonnes processed on Sundays to begin to increase in 2021, while our continued introduction of semi-automatic drilling into the operation is starting to have an impact.\n\nAlongside our drive to improve the efficiency of our operations, we continued our infill drilling programmes and these have significantly increased our knowledge of the veins. We drilled 91,239 metres (infill drilling 35,608 metres and new resources 55,632 metres) and 126,455 metres (36,692 metres infill drilling and new resources 89,753 metres) at Fresnillo and Saucito, respectively. We continue working to increase the confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our geological model through our infill drilling programme, by standardising our processes and by carrying out additional engineering studies. These initiatives, together with our efforts to control dilution, are expected to further stabilise ore grades at these mines.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nDevelopment rates continue to be very important for our operations. Increased rates lead to greater operational flexibility of the mines, and this is a key factor in enabling mines to function consistently. While we saw an increase of 3.1% year-on-year at Fresnillo, Saucito's development rate was marginally lower. These were achieved in spite of the adverse impact of Covid-19.\n\nDevelopment rates at the Fresnillo mine were further improved by the ramp-up of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), one of many important infrastructure projects that have been introduced. Although we failed to achieve our initial target of developing at least 300 metres per month, the TBM nevertheless advanced over 1,300 metres during the year and has opened up a key haulage level within the mine, improving our access to 1,190,000 tonnes of the mine's reserves. At the same time, the deepening of the San Carlos shaft advanced well and once fully operational in 2022, will transport material from this new area, amongst others, directly to the surface - reducing haulage costs and supporting our drive to reduce our environmental footprint by further moving our energy mix away from diesel. In addition, the Alimak hoist, the largest of its kind in Mexico, is now operational and reducing transport time for our teams.\n\nWhile we have been unable to make the degree of progress we had hoped for in all areas, the last 12 months have demonstrated great resilience and determination across the business. Despite the adverse impacts that Covid-19 had on our operations during the year, we have nevertheless managed to stabilise our operations, while positioning ourselves to maximise the potential of these assets in the future.\n\n- The table below shows our action plan and some of its specific objectives, which are closely monitored.\n\nThe additional knowledge gained through the implementation of the FFP programme at the Fresnillo District has played an important role in shaping our plans at the nearby Juanicipio development project. The mineralisation at Juanicipio is similar to that found at Fresnillo and Saucito, featuring wider veins with high silver ore grade in the upper levels, with width decreasing and base metal content increasing as the veins go deeper. Our new level of knowledge will underpin our preparations and enable us to adapt to the challenges and opportunities that we will encounter in different areas at Juanicipio.\n\nWe will continue to implement our High Potential Incidents programme at the Fresnillo mine and also roll it out across the rest of our operations in 2021. This initiative aims to prevent fatalities and serious injuries through the systematic and methodological identification of high potential risks and the development of specific control protocols for each of those risks. The programme incorporates dedicated reporting tools and incident investigation methodologies. Over the next 18 months, we will focus on addressing the top five risks at each of our mines.\n\n| Action                            | Fresnillo Objective                           | Fresnillo Progress                                                                                        | Saucito Objective                          | Saucito Progress                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Improve dilution control:         | Reduce to 34% by 2020  and 31% in 2021.       | 41% in 2019 to 39% in 2020.                                                                               | Reduce to 37% by 2020   and 34% in 2021.   | 53% in 2019 to 43% in 2020.                                                                            |\n| Continue drilling   programme:    | 85-90 thousand metres   in 2020.              | 91,239m, 39% focused   on infill.                                                                         | 110-120 thousand metres   in 2020.         | 126,455m, 29% focused   on infill.                                                                     |\n| Increase accuracy   of samples:   | 85% of samples below   20% of variability.    | Systematic sampling carried  out as part of the process;  determined variability was   not of concern.    | 85% of samples below   20% of variability. | Systematic sampling carried  out as part of the process;  determined variability was   not of concern. |\n| Reduce downtime:                  | Increase effective work   time by 30 minutes. | Covid measures and  protocols limited our   ability to reduce downtime.                                   | N/A                                        | Covid measures and  protocols limited our ability   to reduce downtime.                                |\n| Improve maintenance  reliability: | Mean time before failure:   12 hours.         | Average of whole fleet:   15 hours.

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production remained at similar levels to 2019. This was driven by the expected higher ore grade resulting from incremental improvements following the implementation of our performance improvement initiatives, offset by lower volume of ore milled as a result of a reduced number of personnel on site following Covid-19 preventive measures. The higher absenteeism also impacted maintenance and the development rate, further limiting the short-term operational flexibility of the mine. The average ore throughput in 2020 was 6,976 tpd (2019: 7,349 tpd).\n\nThe average development rate increased to 3,130 metres per month (2019: 3,037 metres per month), an increase of 3.1%. Despite the positive impact of the full integration of the new contractor hired at the end of 2019 and the addition of the tunnel boring machine during the year, the adverse impact of personnel issues due to our Covid-19 measures prevented us reaching our target for the year. Our plan to rationalise our contractor base in the future is continuing. Our goal is to work with four contractor companies, each developing 1,000 metres per month.\n\nProductivity, calculated as tonnes of ore milled per person, decreased compared to 2019.\n\n- This was driven by Covid-19-related issues which led to a marked reduction in the number of personnel available, which in turn impacted our ability to process higher volumes of ore. This adverse impact was further compounded by our insistence that older, more vulnerable, and often more experienced members of our workforce should be protected from risk and remain at or work from home where possible.\n\nWhile our improvement initiatives made progress, further work is required to help control dilution, particularly on the narrower veins. During the year, we redefined a number of key variables around dilution control, and this has led to a higher baseline than originally determined. Despite this, we take confidence in the fact that the new baseline provides increased visibility of the task ahead. Our drilling programme, focused on increasing resources and improving the certainty of the geological model, met its objectives for the year and this will continue into 2021, further improving our knowledge and understanding of the geology and thereby the certainty of our mine planning.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves and resources both decreased.

Additionally, cost deflation for this mine was 4.5% mainly due to the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar on contractors and labour.\n\nMargin defined as average realised price less cash cost per ounce.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce increased to US$5.9 (2019: US$2.3) principally due to higher cost per tonne, higher treatment and refining charges, increased special mining rights and lower by-product credits, partially mitigated by the higher silver ore grade. Margin per ounce increased 11.6% to US$15.4. Expressed as a percentage of silver price, it decreased to 72.3% (2019: 85.7%).\n\nAll-in sustaining cost decreased 4.4% over 2019 to US$12.9, explained by lower capitalised development per ounce and a lower sustaining capex per ounce.\n\n- mine that are richer in base metals, leading to the exclusion of lower grade areas from the calculations.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nTotal capex spend in 2020 was US$92.6 million, which included sustaining capex, mine development, the construction of the second phase of the Pyrites Plant (see page 45), the optimisation of the beneficiation plant, the deepening of the San Carlos shaft and investments in technologies and equipment that look to enhance the mine's efficiency and productivity.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nFor 2021, the silver ore grade is expected to be in the range of 190-210 g/t, with the gold ore grade around 0.55-0.70 g/t.\n\nThe majority of our investment in the year ahead will focus on sustaining capex and mine development. Furthermore, in 2021 and the following two years, we will continue to invest in our IT projects, including wireless telecommunication systems in new production areas, remote controlled drilling equipment, Track Plus, Ventilation Plus, Mine Ops and software required for the stochastic modelling of the mines resources.\n\n## FRESNILLO\n\n/parenleft.caseUS$/TONNE MILLED/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   69.9 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |   62.7 |\n|   2018 |   49.4 |\n|   2017 |   47.5 |\n|   2016 |   43.9 |\n\n69.9\n\n## FRESNILLO ORE MILLED PER PERSON /parenleft.caseTONNES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 655   |     |\n|--------|-------|-----|\n|   2019 | 712   | 712 |\n|   2018 | 745   |     |\n|   2017 |       | 896 |\n|   2016 |       | 884 |\n\n655\n\n## FRESNILLO CASH COST\n\n/parenleft.caseSILVER US$/OUNCE/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |      | 5.90 69.4%   |\n|--------|------|--------------|\n|   2019 | 2.25 | 16.10 86.0%  |\n|   2018 | 0.46 | 15.54 97.0%  |\n|   2017 | 0.71 | 16.97 95.8%  |\n|   2016 | 2.09 | 17.23 87.8%  |\n\n5.90\n\nSilver price             Cash cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n%  Figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.\n\n53 /hyphen.case FRESNILLO PLC",

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nAs expected and in accordance with the mine plan, annual silver production was lower year-on-year, mainly due to the decrease in ore grade as a result of the gradual depletion of higher grade areas and increased dilution as the Jarillas vein narrows. Ore throughput remained broadly stable year-on-year at 8,208 tpd, above nominal capacity of 7,800 tpd, as a result of ongoing initiatives to optimise our processes. While progress has been achieved on our improvement initiatives, further work is required to help control dilution, particularly on the narrower veins. During the year, we redefined a number of key variables around dilution control, and this has led to a higher baseline than originally determined.\n\nDuring the year, our drilling campaign further bolstered the certainty of the mine's geological model and helped to increase silver reserves and resources. Inevitably, a workforce reduced in numbers due to the safety initiatives implemented as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, together with heightened security measures to counteract the increased insecurity in the area (See Risk section on page 116) limited the daily average workforce on site. This brought challenges in several areas of the operation and impacted a number of the year's targets including our development rate. Year-on-year, development decreased 1.6%, below our target due to our focus on production.\n\nAnnual gold production increased 6.7% due to the higher ore grade and improved recovery rate.\n\nProductivity increased compared to 2019 mainly because we were able to maintain the volume of ore processed with a smaller workforce. This was in spite of our insistence that older, more vulnerable, and often experienced members of our workforce should be protected from risk and remain at or work from home where possible. These measures had less impact on productivity at Saucito than at Fresnillo, due to the relatively young average age of our personnel at this mine, which meant that fewer employees and contractors were required to stay at home.\n\nThe Pyrites Plant at Saucito produced just under 1 moz of silver and 3.5 koz gold during the year. We expect production from this plant, excluding the expected production from the Fresnillo Pyrites Plant, to remain unchanged year-on-year.\n\nThe project to deepen the Jarillas shaft from 630 metres to 1,000 metres continued, reaching 930 metres by the end of 2020. We continue to expect this project, which will provide access to the deeper reserves of the Jarillas vein, to be completed by the end of 2023.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nThe infill drilling programme continued during the year and further drills will be carried out in 2021 to improve the model's certainty. Silver reserves increased 16.6%, helped by the decrease in the cut-off grade and silver resources also increased, up 14.1% year-on-year as a result of exploration in the area of influence.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2020 |   2019 | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  593.6 |  493.4 | 20.3       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  199.2 |  197.9 | 0.7        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  325.1 |  238.1 | 36.5       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |   73.4 |  126.4 | (41.9)     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |   13.9 |   33.4 | (58.4)     |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                    |   72   |   67.8 | 6.2        |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver)               |    0.8 |    2.3 | (65.2)     |\n| Margin (US$/oz)                         |   20.5 |   13.8 | 48.6       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   96.2 |   85.7 |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)            |    6.9 |   11   | (37.3)     |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Saucito increased 20.3%, mainly as a result of higher precious metal prices, partially offset by the lower volumes of silver sold. The mine's contribution to total adjusted silver revenue decreased to 33.2% in 2020 (2019: 36.0%). Despite this, Saucito remained the main contributor to total adjusted silver revenues. Gold contributed 23.9% to Saucito's adjusted revenue (2019: 22.0%), representing 10.7% of the Group's total adjusted gold revenue.\n\nCost per tonne increased 6.2% to US$72.0, mainly due to an increase in development cost, mitigated by the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the decrease in consumption of operating materials at the Pyrites Plant; cost deflation for this mine was 4.3% primarily due to contractors, maintenance, operating materials and labour.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce decreased to US$0.8 per ounce (2019: US$2.3 per silver ounce) mainly as a result of higher gold, lead and zinc by-product credits per silver ounce. This was partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges per silver ounce, an increase in special mining rights, a lower silver ore grade and an increase in cost per tonne. Margin per ounce increased to US$20.5 in 2020 (2019: US$13.8). Expressed as a percentage of silver price, it increased from 85.7% to 96.2%.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost decreased to US$6.9 per ounce mainly as a result of lower sustaining capex per ounce and lower cash cost.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2020 totalled US$73.4 million, mainly allocated to in-mine development, sustaining capex and the project to deepen the Jarillas shaft.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nFollowing the operational setbacks driven by the adverse impact of Covid-19, we are again looking to develop between 3,200-3,500 metres a month by the end of 2021, as we rationalise our roster of contractor companies and review their incentive schemes and mine preparation services.\n\nThe gradual decline in the ore grade seen over the past few years is expected to reverse going into 2021, with the grade expected to average towards the higher end of the 200-220 g/t range. The grade improvement is in part due to the lower dilution and improved blasting and drilling patterns, part of the action plan implemented at the end of 2019. The gold ore grade is expected to be around 1.1 g/t.\n\nCapex will primarily be allocated to increasing development rates, sustaining capex and the deepening of the Jarillas shaft, together with other minor investments in technology such as consolidating Track plus following the mine's growth, real time tracking of equipment for production and maintenance purposes, big data analysis (SmartOps) to focus on productivity initiatives and predictive maintenance as well as software required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources.\n\n## SAUCITO\n\n/parenleft.caseUS$/TONNE MILLED/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   72.0 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |   67.8 |\n|   2018 |   60.1 |\n|   2017 |   47.6 |\n|   2016 |   36.7 |\n\n72.0\n\n## SAUCITO ORE MILLED PER PERSON /parenleft.caseTONNES/parenright.case\n\n## 858\n\n|   2020 | 858   | 858   |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n|   2019 | 749   | 749   |\n|   2018 | 849   | 849   |\n|   2017 |       | 1,065 |\n|   2016 |       | 1,249 |\n\n## SAUCITO CASH COST\n\n/parenleft.caseSILVER US$/OUNCE/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2020       | 0.76   | 19.4 96.1%   |\n|------------|--------|--------------|\n| 2019       |        | 16.1 85.7%   |\n| 2018       | 0.97   | 15.5 93.8%   |\n| 2017       | 1.54   | 17.0 90.9%   |\n| -0.39 2016 |        | 17.2 102.3%  |\n\n0.76\n\n%  Figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n55 /hyphen.case FRESNILLO PLC",

The lower silver production was driven by the expected lower ore grade due to the depletion of higher ore grade areas at the San Juli\u00e1n and Shalom areas. The infill drilling programme initiated in 2019 continued into 2020, increasing the certainty and accuracy of the geological model.\n\nThe programme to control dilution at the veins made good progress, averaging 23% for the year, a rate that we consider to be acceptable for the conditions of the mine.\n\nSilver production increased by 6.7% at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body (DOB) against 2019, due to a higher ore grade as we regained access to higher ore grade areas following the resequencing of the mine in 2019 to maintain the geotechnical stability of some high grade stopes. We maintained the operational continuity of the operation, with no geotechnical issues during the year.\n\nGiven San Juli\u00e1n's remote geographical location, Covid-19 preventive measures have been effective to date in limiting the pandemic's impact on operations. This has been achieved in part by ensuring limited social interaction with people outside the workforce and local community, in conjunction with quick tests and other preventative measures.\n\nOre throughput remained stable year-on-year at both plants in accordance with the mine plan, while remaining above their nominal capacities. At the end of December, the lead circuit housing at the DOB suffered some minor structural damage that only affected the conditioning tank, resulting in a short production outage. Though production was ramped back up within 20 days following rapid remedial work, the plant is now expected to operate at circa 6,000 tonnes per day (down from the previous 6,600 per day) while permanent repair work is completed.\n\nProductivity at San Juli\u00e1n decreased due to the greater number of personnel required to operate and maintain equipment across more dispersed production stopes, as well as increased hauling distances.\n\nThe construction of the third stage for the expansion of the tailings dam continued into 2021 as a result of a strategic decision to build the dam in sequential phases, while planning for the fourth stage is expected to continue in 2021. Once constructed, these projects will ensure capacity for a further five years and the mine's operational continuity.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves at San Juli\u00e1n veins slightly increased year-on-year as a result of a successful exploration programme in the southern areas of the district, albeit with an increase in the cut-off grade.

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nAnnual gold production marginally decreased year-on-year, in line with our expectations and reflecting the natural depletion of the high grade areas at Las Casas and East Taspana. Silver production remained at similar levels against 2019.\n\nSimilar to San Juli\u00e1n, Ci\u00e9nega's remote geographical location has been effective at limiting social interactions outside the workforce and communities, thereby mitigating the risk of contagion. This in conjunction with quick tests and other preventive measures has enabled the operational performance to remain stable year-on-year.\n\nProductivity increased as there were fewer contractors to manage operations following the significantly reduced activity at the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine as it approached closure. This resulted in a more concentrated operation with shorter haulage distances.\n\nConstruction of stage one of the third tailings dam was concluded during the year as expected. Construction of stage two is expected to conclude early in 2021.\n\nFurther progress was made on other smaller district-related projects including the completion of the high compaction thickener to further improve our water consumption metrics at the mine. We also made good progress on a high-tension electricity cable to the district's satellite operations, due for completion in the first half of 2021.\n\nOur exploration programme continued throughout 2020, identifying additional mineralisation at the main Ci\u00e9nega mine though exploration results from the Rosario Transversal fault fell short of expectations. We are concentrating on converting resources into reserves to the west and east of Ci\u00e9nega as we look to further de-risk the potential 2,000 tonnes per day expansion of the beneficiation plant at Ci\u00e9nega, thereby improving the economic viability of the project.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver and gold reserves decreased 12.7% and 6.8% year-on-year respectively due to the depletion of some veins of the Ci\u00e9nega mine and the closure of the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine. Silver and gold resources both increased, up 17.8% and 19.0% respectively following positive exploration results which will improve the Ci\u00e9nega silver and gold grade profile over the next few years.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2020    | 2019    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 248.3   | 204.7   | 21.3       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 101.2   | 104.0   | (2.7)      |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 129.5   | 84.9    | 52.5       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 35.1    | 58.2    | (39.7)     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 6.5     | 17.1    | (62.0)     |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 76.7    | 78.3    | (2.0)      |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz gold)               | (276.2) | (0.23)  | N/A        |\n| Margin (US$/oz)                       | 2,068.6 | 1,418.2 | 45.9       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 115.4   | 100.0   |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)          | 618.3   | 1,212.1 | (49.0)     |\n\nAdjusted revenue increased 21.3% over 2019, mainly due to higher gold and silver prices. Ci\u00e9nega is the Group's most polymetallic mine, a fact demonstrated by the significant contribution from silver, lead and zinc of 56.3% in 2020 (2019: 57.2%).\n\nCost per tonne at Ci\u00e9nega decreased 2.0% to US$76.7 mainly due to the positive effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar partly offset by increased consumption of electricity and spare parts for maintenance.\n\nThe decrease in cash cost was primarily due to an increase in silver by-product credits and lower cost per tonne, partly offset by increased\n\nspecial mining rights, higher treatment and refining charges and lower gold ore grade. Margin per ounce increased to US$2,068.6 in 2020 (2019: US$1,418.2). Expressed as a percentage of gold prices, the margin increased to 115.4% (2019: 100.0%).\n\nThe US$593.8 per ounce decrease in all-in sustaining cost was primarily driven by the lower capitalised development, decreased sustaining capital expenditure per ounce and lower cash cost.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex in 2020 totalled US$35.1 million and was allocated primarily to mine development and sustaining capex.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nIn 2021, the average gold ore grade is expected to be between 1.30-1.40 g/t, with the silver ore grade expected to average 150-160 g/t.\n\n2020 was the final year of production from San Ram\u00f3n. This satellite mine will be in care and maintenance until a number of drills are completed and definitive closure is determined, at which point remedial work on the tailings dam as well as the dismantling of surface facilities will commence. For 2021, we expect the resulting spare capacity to be taken up by additional mineralisation from Ci\u00e9nega stopes. This is expected to lower haulage costs due to the shorter haulage distances involved.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2021 will continue to be primarily focused on mining works and sustaining capex. Other smaller capital investments in the year will support various IT initiatives as they near completion, the MineOps Optimiser and software required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources.\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA\n\n/parenleft.caseUS$/TONNE MILLED/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   76.7 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |   78.3 |\n|   2018 |   70.8 |\n|   2017 |   66.5 |\n|   2016 |   55.5 |\n\n76.7\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA ORE MILLED PER PERSON /parenleft.caseTONNES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 900   | 900   |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n|   2019 | 791   | 791   |\n|   2018 |       | 1,252 |\n|   2017 |       | 1,322 |\n|   2016 |       | 1,577 |\n\n900\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA CASH COST\n\n/parenleft.caseGOLD US$/OUNCE/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2020         | -276.20   | 1,714.00 116.1%   |\n|--------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| 2019         | -0.23     | 1,418.00 100.0%   |\n| 2018         | 25.88     | 1,269.28 98.0%    |\n| -152.87 2017 |           | 1,267.44 112.9%   |\n| -217.19 2016 |           | 1,246.47 117.4%   |\n\n-276.20\n\nGold price             Cash cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n%  Figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\n61 /hyphen.case FRESNILLO PLC",

These adverse effects were mitigated by our ability to continue processing inventories from the leaching pads and stockpile at the dynamic leaching plants during the operational restrictions.",

        "page_content": "In addition, we benefitted from the improved overall speed of recovery at the lower ore depositing levels on the 13th leaching pad, following its commissioning in mid-2019.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2019 due to the strict safety protocols which limited the number of personnel on site at any one time as well as during transportation to and from the mine. As a consequence, the number of shifts per day was changed from three to four. The reduction in personnel at the mine also impacted haulage fleet productivity.\n\nFollowing the analysis conducted during 2018 as a result of the construction of an access road through a number of old leaching pads, the mine has continued carrying out assays to refine the grade and recovery of the ore in inventories. As a result of the information obtained, the mine updated its estimate of the recoverable remaining gold content in the inventories at the old leaching pads, resulting in an increase of 119.3 thousand ounces of gold as at 1 January 2020.\n\nDuring the year, we commenced construction of the Carbon in Column project to increase gold recovery from the old leaching pads. However, progress was slowed due to Covid restrictions and then halted, following a high potential incident.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nIn 2019, we began rolling out the dual fuel systems into our haulage fleet. This programme involves the installation of engines which are able to automatically switch between powering the trucks by diesel and by liquefied natural gas (LNG), depending on the terrain. By the end of 2020, all of the 785 haulage fleet had been converted in addition to 40% of the larger 793 haulage fleet. Going forward, we expect to convert the remaining trucks, lowering our operating costs while at the same time reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nVibrating screens were installed at the dynamic leaching plant (phase I) in 4Q 2020, increasing milling capacity from 8,700 tpd to 9,200 tpd.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nGold reserves and resources decreased mostly due to the application of more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations, resulting in an updated pit design which excluded some benches that were previously included in the estimates. Some of the ounces lost from the pit were incorporated into the resources of the underground Centauro project. In addition to good exploration results obtained from drill holes targeting high-grade gold veins below the pit limits, these additional ounces led to a 17.5% increase in gold resources at Centauro Deep.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2020    |   2019 | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 778.9   |  693.9 | 12.2       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 361.4   |  415   | (12.9)     |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 400.5   |  218.7 | 83.1       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 30.2    |   37.5 | (19.5)     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 17.6    |   28.1 | (37.4)     |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 18.3    |   18.1 | 1.0        |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 3.3     |    3.3 | 0.0        |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz gold)               | 727.9   |  818.6 | (11.1)     |\n| Margin (US$/oz)                       | 1,064.5 |  599.4 | 77.6       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 59.4    |   42.3 |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)          | 881.9   |  963   | (8.4)      |\n\nAdjusted revenue increased 12.2% due to the higher gold and silver metal prices, offset by the lower volumes of gold sold.\n\nCost per tonne of ore deposited remained stable at US$18.3, primarily due to an increase in the stripping ration and inefficiencies caused by lower economies of scale as a result of the decrease in volume of ore processed and waste material hauled related to the Covid-19 disruptions, offset by the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar, fixed costs that were incurred and reclassified as unproductive costs and the lower unit price of diesel.\n\nCash cost per gold ounce decreased to US$727.9, as a result of the favourable effect of the reassessment of recoverable gold inventories at the leaching pads, resulting in a lower cost per ounce. This was partially offset by increased special mining rights, lower ore grades and higher profit sharing. Margin per ounce and margin expressed as a percentage of gold prices increased to US$1,064.5 and 59.4%, respectively.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost decreased by US$81.1 per ounce mainly due to the lower cash cost and a lower capitalised stripping.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2020 totalled US$30.2 million, which was focused primarily on sustaining capex, mine preparation, the construction of the 13th and 14th leaching pads and construction of the activated carbon project. Other investments included implementation of ProxAlarm and the Fatigue Monitoring system, to reduce operator error and fatigue, as well as the implementation of the MineOps Optimiser system.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nGold ore grades in 2021 are expected to be in the range of 0.70-0.75 g/t.\n\nCapex for 2021 will continue to focus primarily on sustaining capex, mining works, the construction of the 14th leaching pad and the implementation of the activated carbon process to increase gold recovery. Minor investments scheduled for 2021 also include big data analysis (SmartOps) to focus on productivity initiatives and predictive maintenance, autonomous equipment, slope monitoring equipment for pit walls and the tailings dam.\n\n## HERRADURA\n\n/parenleft.caseUS$/TONNE DEPOSITED/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |     | 18.3   |\n|--------|-----|--------|\n|   2019 |     | 18.1   |\n|   2018 |     |        |\n|   2016 | 7.7 |        |\n\n18.3\n\n## HERRADURA ORE/WASTE MOVED PER PERSON\n\n/parenleft.caseTONNES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 39,531   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2019 | 49,974   |\n|   2018 | 61,510   |\n|   2017 | 72,518   |\n|   2016 | 73,250   |\n\n39,531\n\n## HERRADURA CASH COST\n\n/parenleft.caseGOLD US$/OUNCE/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 727.94 1,714.0 57.5%   |\n|--------|------------------------|\n|   2019 | 818.63 1,418.0 42.3%   |\n|   2018 | 504.00 1,269.3 60.3%   |\n|   2017 | 493.36 1,267.4 61.1%   |\n|   2016 | 1,246.5 62.2%          |\n\n727.94\n\nGold price             Cash cost\n\n%  Figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\n63 /hyphen.case FRESNILLO PLC",

Furthermore, the safety initiatives implemented as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of personnel on site, thus affecting the preparation of the mine. In conjunction with this, increased waste material was hauled during the year following a minor land slip in one of the pit walls which impacted the mining sequence. The change in the mine plan is therefore expected to extend the mine life for an additional four to six months in 2022. These factors were mitigated by the higher speed of recovery due to increased irrigation on the pads and the installation of the carbon columns in 2019.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nThe focus remained on improving gold recovery and reducing costs by processing ore through the Carbon in Column process, which started operations in the first quarter of 2020 and replaced the Merrill Crowe plant. As we approach the end of mine life, we will began implementing our mine closure plan.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2019 due to the strict safety protocols which limited the number of personnel on site at any one time as well as during transportation to and from the mine, limiting the volume of material hauled.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nGold reserves continued to decrease as a result of the depletion of the ore body while gold resources increased by 12.4% due to a higher gold price used in the estimation.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2020    |   2019 | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 152.6   |  176.7 | (13.6)     |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 72.0    |  119.2 | (39.6)     |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 53.7    |   58.3 | (7.9)      |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 19.7    |    5.7 | 245.6      |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 1.6     |    1.1 | 45.4       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 10.8    |    9.8 | 10.2       |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 3.3     |    2.5 | 32.0       |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz gold)               | 1,158.5 |  847.8 | 36.6       |\n| Margin (US$/oz)                       | 633.9   |  570.2 | 11.2       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 35.4    |   40.2 |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)          | 1,502.9 |  922.9 | 62.8       |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Noche Buena decreased 13.6% to US$152.6 million as a result of the lower volumes of gold sold, mitigated by the higher gold prices.\n\nCost per tonne at this mine increased 10.2% to US$10.8 in 2020, primarily as a result of the lower economies of scale achieved from the decrease in volume of ore processed and waste material hauled as a result of Covid-19 disruptions and the expected lower production as the mine approaches closure, mitigated by the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar, fixed costs that were incurred and reclassified as unproductive costs and the lower unit price of diesel.\n\nCash cost per gold ounce increased by 36.6% to US$1,158.5, mainly due to a lower gold ore grade, a higher cost per tonne and increased special mining rights. Margin per ounce increased to US$633.9, while margin expressed as a percentage of the gold price declined from 40.2% in 2019 to 35.4% in 2020.\n\nThe US$580.0 per ounce increase in all-in sustaining cost was the result of the capitalised stripping and higher cash cost.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2020 totalled US$19.7 million, focused on sustaining capex, including the final construction of leaching pads and the implementation of the activated carbon process.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nIn 2021, the average ore grade is expected to be in the range of 0.40-0.50 g/t.\n\nExpenditure in 2021 will again primarily be for sustaining capex.\n\n## NOCHE BUENA\n\n/parenleft.caseUS$/TONNE DEPOSITED/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   10.8 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |    9.8 |\n|   2018 |    6.8 |\n|   2017 |    7.5 |\n|   2016 |    7.5 |\n\n10.8\n\n## NOCHE BUENA ORE/WASTE MOVED PER PERSON\n\n/parenleft.caseTONNES/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 | 43,444   |        |\n|--------|----------|--------|\n|   2019 | 53,867   | 53,867 |\n|   2018 | 75,333   | 75,333 |\n|   2017 | 90,241   | 90,241 |\n|   2016 | 95,361   | 95,361 |\n\n43,444\n\n## NOCHE BUENA CASH COST /parenleft.caseGOLD US$/OUNCE/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   1,158.50 | 1,714.0 32.4%   |\n|--------|------------|-----------------|\n|   2019 |     847.75 | 1,418.0 40.2%   |\n|   2018 |     753.41 | 1,269.3 42.1%   |\n|   2017 |     794.2  | 1,267.4 37.3%   |\n|   2016 |     765.9  | 1,246.5 38.6%   |\n\n1,158.50\n\nGold price             Cash cost\n\n%  Figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Group's financial statements. All comparisons refer to 2020 figures compared to 2019, unless otherwise noted. The financial information and year-onyear variations are presented in US dollars, except where indicated. The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 198-242.\n\nBy following strict controls on cash, costs and expenses we have improved our already healthy cash and other liquid funds 1 position, while maintaining a low leverage ratio. This has been enhanced through the closing of our US$850 million Senior Notes offering, part of which we used to prepay a portion of our US$800 million Senior Notes due in 2023 and has enabled us to continue investing in the business and delivering returns to shareholders.\n\nThe following report presents how we have managed our financial resources.\n\n## Commentary on financial performance\n\nSupported by high precious metals prices and a respectable operational performance despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group achieved strong financial results in 2020. Adjusted revenue increased 14.9% over 2019 due to higher gold and silver prices, which were partially offset by the lower volumes of gold and silver sold. Revenue increased 14.6% year-on-year. Adjusted production costs 2 decreased mainly as a result of lower volumes processed at Herradura and Noche Buena due to Covid-19 operational restrictions and the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar. This decrease was amplified by the positive effect from changes in inventory in 2020 compared to that in 2019 resulting from the gold content in the leaching pads at Herradura being reassessed, and by lower exploration costs. As a result, gross profit and EBITDA increased to US$879.4 million and US$1,169.1 million, a 90.5% and 73.4% increase over 2019 respectively.\n\nIn the second half of 2020, Fresnillo plc bought back US$482.1 million of the US$800 million Senior Notes at 5.5% due in 2023. Despite the payment of a US$60.8 million premium for the early repayment of these notes, the Company considered it a good opportunity to restructure its debt, taking advantage of the favourable conditions prevailing in the market at that point in time. The aggregate amount paid by the Company to holders whose Tender Securities were accepted for purchase, including an early repayment premium, was approximately US$543.0 million. In addition, Fresnillo plc issued new US$850 million Senior Notes at 4.25% due in 2050. This provided the funds to pay existing bond holders who chose to sell their 2023 bonds, while at the same time ensuring the stability and financial health of the Company both in the short and long term.\n\nWe improved our already strong financial position, with US$1,070.4 million in cash and other liquid funds 1 as of 31 December 2020 notwithstanding paying dividends of US$104.7 million in accordance with our policy and despite the pandemic, investing US$412.3 million in capex and spending US$107.3 million on exploration expenses to underpin our future growth.\n\n## Income statement\n\n|                                                                                             | 2020   US$ million   | 2019   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue  3                                                                         | 2,608.1              | 2,270.2              | 337.9                  | 14.9       |\n| Total revenue                                                                               | 2,430.1              | 2,119.6              | 310.5                  | 14.6       |\n| Cost of sales                                                                               | (1,550.7)            | (1,657.9)            | 107.2                  | (6.5)      |\n| Gross profit                                                                                | 879.4                | 461.7                | 417.7                  | 90.5       |\n| Exploration expenses                                                                        | 107.3                | 157.9                | (50.6)                 | (32.0)     |\n| Operating profit                                                                            | 649.7                | 171.7                | 478.0                  | 278.3      |\n| EBITDA  4                                                                                   | 1,169.1              | 674.0                | 495.1                  | 73.4       |\n| Income tax expense including special mining rights                                          | 175.6                | (27.1)               | 202.7                  | N/A        |\n| Profit for the year                                                                         | 375.6                | 205.8                | 169.8                  | 82.5       |\n| Profit for the year, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects                                | 325.9                | 172.0                | 153.9                  | 89.5       |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$/share)  5                                         | 0.508                | 0.277                | 0.231                  | 83.4       |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding post-tax   Silverstream effects (US$/share) | 0.440                | 0.231                | 0.209                  | 90.5       |\n\n- 1 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in Note 30(c) to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 2 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs.

        "page_content": "The Group's financial results are largely determined by the performance of our operations. However, there are other factors such as a number of macroeconomic variables, that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results. These include:\n\n## Precious metals prices\n\nDuring the year, the average realised silver price increased by 32.3%, from US$16.1 per ounce in 2019 to US$21.3 per ounce in 2020, while the average realised gold price rose 26.4% from US$1,418.0 per ounce in 2019 to US$1,792.4 per ounce in 2020. (For more detailed information, see the Markets review on pages 18-19). In contrast, the average realised lead and zinc by-product prices decreased 7.9% and 7.8% year-on-year, to US$0.82 and US$1.06 per pound, respectively.\n\nHowever, the Group benefitted from a favourable but relatively minor effect as a result of a series of financial derivatives entered into in 2019 to hedge a portion of lead production, as described in the Hedging section on page 70.\n\n## MX$/US$ exchange rate\n\nThe Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2020 was US$19.95 per US dollar, compared to US$18.85 per US dollar at the beginning of the year. The 5.9% spot devaluation had an adverse effect on: i) the net monetary peso asset position, which contributed to the US$40.3 million foreign exchange loss; and ii) taxes and mining rights as the devaluation resulted in an increase in related deferred tax liabilities.\n\nThe average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate increased 11.6% to US$21.5 per US dollar (2019: US$19.3 per US dollar). As a result, there was a favourable effect of US$66.6 million on the Group's costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) when converted to US dollars.\n\n## Cost deflation\n\nIn 2020, cost deflation was 5.5%. The main components of our cost inflation basket are listed below:\n\n## Labour\n\nUnionised employees received on average a 6.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, while administrative employees did not receive an increase as a measure to preserve cash during the onset of Covid-19; when converted to US dollars, this resulted in a weighted average labour deflation of 6.0%.\n\n## Energy\n\n## Electricity\n\nThe Group's weighted average cost of electricity increased by 4.7% from 7.4 US cents per kW in 2019 to 7.8 US cents per kW in 2020. This increase was mainly due to the higher average generating cost of the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility.\n\n## Diesel\n\nThe weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars decreased 18.0% to 72.2 US cents per litre in 2020, compared to 87.9 US cents per litre in 2019. This resulted mainly from the decrease in the demand for oil as economic activity slowed sharply across the globe during the pandemic.\n\n## Operating materials\n\n|                                             | Year over year  change in unit price  %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Other reagents                              | (9.3)                                     |\n| Steel balls for milling                     | (4.2)                                     |\n| Steel for drilling                          | (4.0)                                     |\n| Sodium cyanide                              | (3.5)                                     |\n| Lubricants                                  | (2.6)                                     |\n| Explosives                                  | (2.5)                                     |\n| Tyres                                       | 0.2                                       |\n| Weighted average of all operating materials | (2.4)                                     |\n\nUnit prices of most operating materials decreased in US dollar terms, which resulted in a year-on-year deflation of 2.4%. This reflected the lower demand for some of these products as global mining activity was impacted by Covid-19 and several mines and projects worldwide reduced or halted operations. The majority of these items are dollar-denominated.\n\n## Contractors\n\nAgreements are signed individually with each contractor company and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2020, increases per unit (i.e. per metre developed/per tonne hauled) granted to contractors, whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulted in a weighted average decrease of 6.0% in US dollars, after considering the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nUnit prices of spare parts for maintenance decreased by 5.3% on average in US dollar terms.",

        "page_content": "## Other costs\n\nOther cost components include freight which decreased by an estimated 7.5% in US dollars, while insurance costs increased by 16.2% in US dollars due to higher market premiums for some of the risks covered, such as the risk to tailings dams and the start-up of new operations. The remaining cost inflation components experienced average deflation of 5.1% in US dollars over 2019.\n\nThe effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group's internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Consolidated revenue 1\n\n|                                | 2020   US$ million   | 2019   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | % change   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue  1            | 2,608.1              | 2,270.2              | 337.9                  | 14.9       |\n| Gold, lead and zinc hedging    | 2.4                  | (6.0)                | 8.4                    | N/A        |\n| Treatment and refining charges | (180.4)              | (144.6)              | (35.8)                 | 24.8       |\n| Total revenue                  | 2,430.1              | 2,119.6              | 310.5                  | 14.6       |\n\nAdjusted revenue increased by US$337.9 million mainly as a result of the increase in gold and silver prices. This positive effect was partially offset by the higher treatment and refining charges. As a result, total revenue rose to US$2,430.1 million, a 14.6% increase against 2019.\n\n## Adjusted revenue 1 by metal\n\n|                        | 2020        | 2020   | 2019        | 2019   |                                |                               |                                 |      |\n|------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|------|\n|                        | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | Volume  Variance   US$ million | Price  Variance   US$ million | Total net  change   US$ million | %    |\n| Silver                 | 970.5       | 37.2   | 766.9       | 33.8   | (34.0)                         | 237.6                         | 203.6                           | 26.5 |\n| Gold                   | 1,327.9     | 50.9   | 1,202.8     | 53.0   | (172.3)                        | 297.4                         | 125.1                           | 10.4 |\n| Lead                   | 104.9       | 4.0    | 102.1       | 4.5    | 11.3                           | (8.5)                         | 2.9                             | 2.7  |\n| Zinc                   | 204.7       | 7.9    | 198.4       | 8.7    | 22.8                           | (16.5)                        | 6.3                             | 3.2  |\n| Total adjusted revenue | 2,608.1     | 100.0  | 2,270.2     | 100.0  | (172.2)                        | 510.1                         | 337.9                           | 14.9 |\n\nThe increase in gold and silver prices, partially offset by the lower lead and zinc prices, resulted in a positive effect on adjusted revenue of US$510.1 million. This was partially offset by the US$172.2 million adverse effect of the lower volumes of silver and gold sold, mitigated by the higher lead and zinc sales volumes. Gold volumes sold were impacted by the lower production at our open pit operations due to the temporary suspension and subsequent mitigating actions implemented in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, while the volumes of silver sold were primarily affected by the expected lower silver grade from the Saucito mine (See Review of Operations on pages 52-65).\n\n## Adjusted revenue by mine\n\nHerradura continued to be the greatest contributor to adjusted revenue, representing 30.0% primarily due to the higher gold price, mitigated by the lower volume of gold sold. Saucito's contribution increased to 22.8% in 2020 (2019: 21.7%) mainly as a result of the increased gold, lead and zinc volumes sold. Fresnillo remained the third most important contributor to adjusted revenue, increasing its share to 16.3% (2019: 15.9%). The contribution to the Group's adjusted revenue from the San Juli\u00e1n mine remained broadly stable at 15.6% in 2020 (2019: 15.0%). Similarly, Ci\u00e9nega's contribution to the Group's adjusted revenue remained broadly unchanged at 9.5% (2019: 9.0%) as a result of the higher gold and silver prices, which partly offset the lower gold and silver volumes sold. As expected, Noche Buena's contribution continued to decrease from 7.8% in 2019 to 5.8% in 2020, primarily reflecting the gradual depletion of the mine as it approaches the end of its life and the minor land slip.\n\nThe contribution by metal and by mine to adjusted revenues is expected to change further in the future, as new projects are incorporated into the Group's operations and as precious metals prices fluctuate.\n\n- 1 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and gold, lead and zinc hedging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## CONTINUED",

        "page_content": "## Hedging\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we hedged a portion of our silver production for 2021, capitalising on the unique market conditions, where volatility and skewness presented an opportunity to limit downside risk while retaining a significant upside exposure to future silver price increase. The transaction was structured as a collar with an average floor price of US$20 per ounce, and with an average price ceiling of US$49.56 per ounce. The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 4,248,000 ounces of silver with monthly settlements throughout 2021.\n\nOur precious metals hedging policy has changed slightly to give the Company the ability to hedge up to 20% of the expected annual silver and gold production over the next 12 months, as determined at the time of entering the hedge.\n\nAdditionally, in the last quarter of 2019 we hedged a portion of our by-product lead production for 2020. The table below illustrates the expired hedging volume and the results for 2020.\n\n| Concept                          | As of   31 December 2020 Lead   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Weighted floor (US$/tonne)       | 1,759                           |\n| Weighted cap (US$/tonne)         | 2,026                           |\n| Expired volume (tonne)           | 8,760                           |\n| Gain (US$ million)               | 1.3                             |\n| Total outstanding volume (tonne) | 0                               |\n\n## Treatment and refining charges\n\nTreatment and refining charges 1 are reviewed annually using international benchmarks. Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate increased in dollar terms by 51.0% and 18.4% respectively as benchmarks were set far more weighted towards the market conditions in December 2019 and January 2020, before markets turned as a result of the onset of Covid-19. Furthermore, silver refining charges increased by 9.0% over the year. The increase in treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc and silver refining charges, combined with the higher volumes of lead and zinc concentrates shipped from our mines to Met-Mex, resulted in a 24.8% increase in treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement in absolute terms when compared to 2019.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n| Concept                                                  | 2020   US$ million   | 2019   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | % change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted production costs  2                             | 1,079.1              | 1,173.0              | (93.9)                 | (8.0)      |\n| Depreciation                                             | 505.4                | 489.5                | 15.9                   | 3.2        |\n| Profit sharing                                           | 18.7                 | 9.1                  | 9.6                    | 105.5      |\n| Hedging                                                  | (4.1)                | 0.0                  | (4.1)                  | N/A        |\n| Change in inventories                                    | (66.4)               | (11.1)               | (55.2)                 | >100       |\n| Unproductive costs including unabsorbed production costs | 18.0                 | (2.6)                | 20.6                   | N/A        |\n| Cost of sales                                            | 1,550.7              | 1,657.9              | (107.2)                | (6.5)      |\n\n- 1 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.\n- 2 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies as the case may be and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n\nCost of sales decreased 6.5% to US$1,550.7 million in 2020. The US$107.2 million decrease is explained by the following combination of factors:\n\n- \u00b7 A decrease in adjusted production costs (-US$93.9 million). This was primarily due to: i) a lower volume of ore processed at Herradura and Noche Buena due to Covid-19 operational restrictions (-US$79.4 million) which can further be broken down into two factors: a) variable costs that were not incurred (-US$71.1 million), and b) fixed costs that were incurred and reclassified as unproductive costs 3 (-US$8.3 million); and ii) the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar (-US$66.6 million). These positive effects were partly offset by increased development works and maintenance, mainly at Fresnillo, Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n (Veins and DOB) (+US$49.4 million).\n- \u00b7 The variation in the change in work in progress had a positive effect of US$55.2 million year-on-year. This resulted mainly from the reassessment of the gold content on the leaching pads at Herradura (see notes 2(c) and 5 to the financial statements). This was partially offset by the net effect of the reduction of inventories at Noche Buena resulting from processing gold inventories during the operational restrictions at the onset of the pandemic, without being able to deposit on the leaching pads.\n- \u00b7 Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (-US$4.1 million). As part of our programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos, during the first quarter of the year we entered into a combination of put and call options structured at zero cost (collars). These derivatives were used to hedge US$150.1 million of costs denominated in Mexican pesos with average floor and cap exchange rates of US$22.33 and US$32.82 per US dollar respectively, which have generated a positive result of US$4.1 million. The total outstanding position using collar structures as of 31 December 2020 was US$37.53 million with monthly maturities until March 2021, with average floor and cap exchange rates of US$22.33 and US$32.82 per US dollar respectively. These instruments guarantee a minimum exchange rate should the market fall below the floor exchange rate.\n- 3 Unproductive costs primarily include unabsorbed production costs such as fixed costs incurred in Minera Penmont during the temporary suspension of mining activities at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and other costs related to the subsequent ramp-up of operations and the underutilisation of production capacity once mining activity was resumed. Unproductive costs are recognised within cost of sales but excluded from adjusted production costs.\n\n## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## CONTINUED",

        "page_content": "These positive effects were partly offset by year-on-year increases in:\n\n- \u00b7 US$18.0 million in unproductive costs, which is mainly related to costs incurred during the partial stoppages at Herradura and Noche Buena due to the Covid-19 measures imposed by the state government.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation (+US$15.8 million). This is mainly due to increased amortisation of capitalised mining works and increased depletion factors at the underground mines, partly mitigated by the lower depreciation at Herradura and Noche Buena as some equipment was not in use as a result of the preventive measures related to Covid-19. The reduced amount in depreciation was reclassified as unproductive costs.\n- \u00b7 Profit sharing (+US$9.6 million).\n\n## Cost per tonne, cash cost per ounce and all-in sustaining cost (AISC)\n\nCost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of changes in production costs and cost control performance at each mine. This indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights, less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed. We have included cost per tonne hauled/moved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.\n\n| Cost per tonne     |                     |   2020 |   2019 | % change   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Fresnillo          | US$/tonne milled    |   69.9 |   62.7 | 11.5       |\n| Saucito            | US$/tonne milled    |   72   |   67.8 | 6.2        |\n| Ci\u00e9nega            | US$/tonne milled    |   76.7 |   78.3 | (2.0)      |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) | US$/tonne milled    |   71.8 |   72   | (0.3)      |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)   | US$/tonne milled    |   39   |   39.1 | (0.3)      |\n| Herradura          | US$/tonne deposited |   18.3 |   18.1 | 1.0        |\n| Herradura          | US$/tonne hauled    |    3.3 |    3.3 | 0.0        |\n| Noche Buena        | US$/tonne deposited |   10.8 |    9.8 | 10.0       |\n| Noche Buena        | US$/tonne hauled    |    3.3 |    2.5 | 32.0       |\n\nExplanations regarding changes in cost per tonne by mine are covered in the Review of Operations section, on pages 52-65.\n\nCash cost per ounce, calculated as total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges, less depreciation) less revenue from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold, when compared to the corresponding metal price, is an indicator of the ability of the mine to generate competitive profit margins.\n\n| Cash cost per ounce   |                      | 2020    | 2019   | % change   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------|--------|------------|\n| Fresnillo             | US$ per silver ounce | 5.9     | 2.3    | 156.5      |\n| Saucito               | US$ per silver ounce | 0.8     | 2.3    | (65.2)     |\n| Ci\u00e9nega               | US$ per gold ounce   | (276.2) | (0.2)  | N/A        |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (Veins)    | US$ per silver ounce | (6.0)   | 0.8    | N/A        |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)      | US$ per silver ounce | 7.0     | 7.0    | 0.0        |\n| Herradura             | US$ per gold ounce   | 727.9   | 818.6  | (11.1)     |\n| Noche Buena           | US$ per gold ounce   | 1,158.5 | 847.8  | 36.6       |\n\nExplanations regarding changes in cash cost per ounce by mine are covered in the Review of Operations section, on pages 52-65.\n\nIn addition to the traditional cash cost, the Group is reporting All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC) in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.\n\nThis cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.\n\nWe consider AISC to be a reasonable indicator of a mine's ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price. We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.",

These positive factors were partly offset by: i) the increase in cost related to maintenance and development works at Fresnillo, Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n (veins and DOB) (-US$49.4 million); ii) lower ore grades at Herradura DLP, San Juli\u00e1n (veins) and Ci\u00e9nega (-US$47.2 million); iii) lower volumes of ore processed at Herradura and Noche Buena following Covid-19 operational restrictions (-US$45.7 million); iv) the variation of change in inventories excluding the effect of the 2020 reassessment of gold contents in the leaching pads at Herradura (-US$36.0 million); v) higher treatment and refining charges (-US$35.8 million); vi) increase in unproductive costs as a result of the Covid-19 measures (-US$20.6 million); vii) higher depreciation (-US$15.9 million); viii) higher profit sharing (-US$9.7 million); and others (-US$2.5 million).\n\nWith the exception of Noche Buena, gross profit increased year-on-year at all mines. Herradura remained the largest contributor to the Group's consolidated gross profit, recording an increase in its percentage share from 38.9% in 2019 to 43.4% in 2020. Gross profit at Saucito and Fresnillo experienced double digit increases; however, their percentage shares decreased to 23.4% and 12.7% in 2020 respectively as a result of their relative weighting. The higher grades at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB) together with the higher precious metals prices resulted in a US$71.9 million gross profit, which represented 8.4% of the Group's total gross profit. Ci\u00e9nega's share of the Group's total gross profit remained steady at 7.5%, while Noche Buena's contribution continued to decrease, falling to 4.6%.\n\n## Contribution by mine to consolidated gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses\n\n|                                      | 2020        | 2020   | 2019        | 2019   | Change      | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|\n|                                      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %        |\n| Herradura                            | 372.3       | 43.4   | 183.2       | 38.9   | 189.1       | 102.9    |\n| Saucito                              | 200.2       | 23.4   | 131.2       | 27.9   | 69.0        | 52.6     |\n| Fresnillo                            | 109.1       | 12.7   | 88.7        | 18.9   | 20.4        | 40.2     |\n| San Juli\u00e1n                           | 71.9        | 8.4    | (7.3)       | (1.5)  | 79.2        | N/A      |\n| Ci\u00e9nega                              | 64.4        | 7.5    | 34.5        | 7.3    | 29.5        | 86.7     |\n| Noche Buena                          | 39.0        | 4.6    | 40.2        | 8.5    | (1.2)       | (3.0)    |\n| Total for operating mines            | 856.9       | 100    | 470.5       | 100    | 386.4       | 82.1     |\n| Metal hedging and other subsidiaries | 22.5        |        | (8.8)       |        | 31.3        | N/A      |\n| Total Fresnillo plc                  | 879.4       |        | 461.7       |        | 417.7       | 90.5     |\n\n## Administrative and corporate expenses\n\nAdministrative and corporate expenses decreased 3.1% from US$96.4 million in 2019 to US$93.4 million in 2020, due to the decrease in non-recurring corporate services provided by Servicios Industriales Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. and the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar.",

The decrease of US$50.6 million seen year-on-year was in part a response in order to improve the financial stability of the Group during heightened financial uncertainty early in the year resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, we suspended exploration activities for a period of time to mitigate any adverse impact from the pandemic. An additional US$8.5 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project and Centauro Deep. As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$115.8 million in 2020, while in 2019 US$12.2 million was capitalised, totalling US$170.1 million in risk capital invested in exploration, a 31.9% decrease over 2019. In 2021, total invested in exploration is expected to be within the range of US$175-US$180 million, of which approximately US$15 million is expected to be capitalised.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n|                                                     | 2020   US$ million   | 2019   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Profit from continuing operations before income tax | 551.3                | 178.7                | 372.6                  | 108.5      |\n| - Finance income                                    | (12.2)               | (24.2)               | 12.0                   | 49.6       |\n| + Finance costs                                     | 141.3                | 70.7                 | 70.6                   | 99.9       |\n| - Revaluation effects of Silverstream contract      | (71.0)               | (48.4)               | 22.6                   | 46.7       |\n| - Foreign exchange gain/(loss), net                 | 40.3                 | (5.1)                | 45.4                   | N/A        |\n| - Other operating income                            | (10.0)               | (9.8)                | (0.2)                  | 2.0        |\n| + Other operating expense                           | 14.8                 | 22.6                 | (7.8)                  | (34.5)     |\n| + Depreciation                                      | 505.4                | 489.5                | 15.9                   | 3.2        |\n| + Depreciation in unproductive costs                | 9.2                  | 0                    | 9.2                    | 100        |\n| EBITDA                                              | 1,169.1              | 674.0                | 495.1                  | 73.4       |\n| EBITDA margin                                       | 48.1                 | 31.8                 |                        |            |\n\nEBITDA is a gauge of the Group's financial performance and a key indicator to measure debt capacity. It is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation. In 2020, EBITDA increased 73.4% to US$1,169.1 million primarily driven by the higher gross profit and, to a lesser extent, lower exploration expenses. As a result, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue increased, from 31.8% in 2019 to 48.1% in 2020.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nIn 2020, a net loss of US$4.8 million was recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of costs incurred in the maintenance of closed mines. This compared favourably to the US$12.8 million net loss recognised in 2019, mainly as a result of the disposal of assets, environmental activities and donations.",

        "page_content": "## Silverstream effects\n\nThe Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The total revaluation effect recorded in the 2020 income statement was a gain of US$71.0 million. This includes: i) a positive non-cash revaluation effect of US$23.9 million mainly as a result of the market update of certain variables such as the forward price of silver and the decrease in the LIBOR rate, partially offset by the variation of the country risk premium, these last two variables are used to determine the discount rate; and ii) a US$47.1 million gain mainly generated by the unwinding of the discounted values (a portion of this amount is cash). The total revaluation effect recorded in 2019 was a US$48.3 million gain.\n\nSince the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$687.3 million vs. US$350 million initially paid. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 77 and in notes 13 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Finance costs\n\nNet finance costs of US$129.1 million compared unfavourably to the US$46.5 million recorded in 2019. The US$82.6 million increase was primarily driven by the one-off restructuring of the Company's debt in October 2020. The 2020 net finance costs mainly reflected: i) the US$60.8 million premium paid on early redemption of 60.2% of the existing US$800 million principal Senior Notes due 2023; ii) the interest on the US$800 million principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes, net of interest received and capitalised, together with the accrued interest payable as a result of the issuance of US$850 million principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050, all of which totalled US$43.7 million; iii) US$24.9 million in interest and surcharges, which resulted from the 2020 tax amendment agreed with the Mexican Tax Administration Service (Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria 'SAT') covering the period from 2013 to 2019. Detailed information is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. A portion of the interest from the Senior Notes is capitalised, hence not included in finance costs. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group capitalised US$8.8 million of borrowing costs (2019: US$6.1 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nA foreign exchange loss of US$40.3 million was recorded as a result of the 5.9% devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar over the year on: i) the realised transactions during the period related to accounts receivable paid in Mexican pesos (mainly recoverable VAT); and ii) the value of peso-denominated net monetary assets. This compares negatively to the US$5.1 million foreign exchange gain recognised in 2019.\n\nThe Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro (EUR) and Swedish krona (SEK) which have generated a marginal result in the year of -US$0.15 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense for the period was US$140.6 million, which compared unfavourably vs. (US$8.0) million (tax credit) in 2019. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 25.5%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate. This was mainly due to: i) the border zone tax benefit which benefitted the Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$35.8 million); ii) the inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$23.0 million); iii) taxable/deductable foreign exchange effects for Mexican tax purposes (-US$16.9 million); and iv) special mining right taxable for corporate income tax (-US$10.5 million). These factors were partially offset by: i) the devaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities (US$55.1 million); and ii) deferred tax assets not recognised (US$4.9 million).\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2019 was -4.5%. The reason for the negative tax rate in 2019 was the significant permanent differences between the tax and accounting treatment, together with the low level of profit before income tax. The permanent differences were mainly related to: i) the revaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities that are denominated in Mexican pesos (US$37.1 million); ii) the inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (US$17.1 million); iii) the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel (US$10.0 million); iv) a new border zone tax benefit which benefitted the Herradura and Noche Buena operations (US$6.4 million); and v) the effect recorded in the year in respect of the voluntary tax amendment relating to the tax treatment for mining works at underground mines for the years 2014 to 2018 (US$5.1 million).\n\nMining rights for the year were US$35.0 million compared to a credit of US$19.1 million charged in 2019. The main reason for the negative mining rights in 2019 was the effect of the 2019 voluntary tax amendment relating to the tax treatment for mining works for the years 2014 to 2018 on the deferred mining rights. (See Note 10 to the financial statements).\n\n## Profit for the year\n\nProfit for the year increased from US$205.8 million in 2019 to US$375.6 million in 2020, a 82.5% increase year-on-year as a result of the factors described above.\n\nExcluding the effects of the Silverstream contract, profit for the year increased from US$172.0 million to US$325.9 million, a 89.5% increase.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Working capital increased US$129.8 million, mainly due to: i) a US$79.5 million increase in ore inventories primarily generated by the reassessment of gold content at the Herradura leaching pads; and ii) a US$61.6 million increase in trade and other receivables resulting mainly from the increase in precious metals prices.\n\nTaxes and employee profit sharing paid decreased 37.1% over 2019 to US$121.3 million mainly due to: i) a decrease in provisional tax payments resulting from the lower profit factor determined to calculate the estimated taxable income; ii) lower income tax paid in 2020 (corresponding to the 2019 tax fiscal year); iii) lower income tax and mining rights resulting from tax amendments; and iv) the recovery of excess higher income tax paid.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities increased 110.5% from US$435.9 million in 2019 to US$917.7 million in 2020.\n\nIn addition to cash generated from operations, the Group received other sources of cash, of which the most significant were: i) proceeds from the new bond due in 2050 net of early redemption of 2023 bonds (US$350.0 million); ii) note payable by minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$63.8 million; and iii) the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$33.7 million.",

Taking into account the cash and other liquid funds of US$1,070.4 million and the US$1,167.8 million amortised cost of the Senior Notes, Fresnillo plc's net debt was US$97.4 million as at 31 December 2020. This compares to the net debt position of US$463.4 million as at 31 December 2019. Considering these variations, the balance sheet as at 31 December 2020 remains strong, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.08x 2 .\n\nInventories increased 21.8% to US$443.2 million, mainly as a result of the reassessment of gold content in inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura.\n\nTrade and other receivables remained broadly unchanged at US$512.9 million.\n\nThe change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$541.3 million at the beginning of the year to US$576.1 million as of 31 December 2020 reflects proceeds of US$36.1 million corresponding to 2020 (US$33.7 million in cash and US$2.4 million from the increase in accounts receivables) and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$71.0 million.\n\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,708.2 million at year end, representing a 3.7% decrease over 2019. The US$105.2 million decrease was mainly due to increased depreciation.\n\nThe Group's total equity was US$3,614.6 million as of 31 December 2020, a 10.2% increase over 2019. This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2020 profit.\n\n## Dividends\n\nBased on the Group's 2020 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 23.5 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 1 June 2021 to shareholders on the register on 23 April 2021. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of 2.3 US cents per share amounting to US$16.9 million. This final dividend is higher than the previous year due to the higher profit in 2020, and remains in line with the Group's dividend policy (see page 05).\n\nThe corporate income tax reform introduced in Mexico in 2014 created a withholding tax obligation of 10% relating to the payment of dividends, including to foreign nationals.\n\nHistorically, the Company has been making dividend payments out of retained earnings generated before the tax reform came into force and no withholding tax has therefore been applicable. We expect that dividend payments relating to 2020 and future years will attract the withholding obligation. However, foreign shareholders may be able to recover such tax depending on their tax residence and the existence of double taxation agreements.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Since the onset of the pandemic, we have ensured that our workforce and neighbouring communities remain our number one priority. The Committee monitored the effectiveness of the Company's engagement and collaboration with our workforce, neighbouring communities and authorities. While we recognised and prioritised the relevance of Covid-19, we also ensured that the Company made sound progress on safety and tailings storage facility management, while increasing our involvement in the governance of the Climate Change strategy. As Chairman of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe HSECR Committee, I am pleased to present the activities that the Committee undertook during the year.\n\nMaintaining a safe and healthy workplace is our top priority. We therefore monitored the performance of the preventive protocols introduced to mitigate the risks of Covid-19 in the workplace. Meaningful engagement with the authorities was key in order to ensure that mining was recognised as an essential activity, and also guided our implementation of preventive protocols based on international health recommendations and best practice. The measures we implemented to protect the vulnerable members of our workforce including social distancing guidelines, hygiene, sanitising facilities and particularly the use of testing to self-quarantine and trace contacts were effective in minimising cases of Covid-19.\n\nWe adapted our community support programmes in numerous ways to combat the pandemic. For example, we donated ventilators and protective equipment to local hospitals, adapted educational and entrepreneurial programmes for online formats, donated and raised awareness of masks and provided food supplies to the most vulnerable members of our neighbouring communities.\n\nDespite the sustained improvement in Total and Lost Time injury frequency rates, the regrettable loss of one of our colleagues in 2020 serves as a sobering reminder that we have not succeeded in completely eliminating fatal injuries. We are firmly committed to achieving zero fatalities and to this end, the Committee has continued to monitor the 'I Care, We Care' programme, focusing on evaluating safety performance and the progress of the High Potential Incidents and Critical Risk Control programmes.\n\nThe Company is also committed to the responsible management of its Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) by its operating subsidiaries. The design, operation and governance of TSFs is supported by qualified engineering firms. The key elements of our TSF governance processes are TSF Committees, which include the CEO and COO, together with an Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP), in line with international best practice. In recognition of the importance of this strategic issue, TSFs were elevated to a principal risk in 2020 and TSF Management was on the agenda of all our HSECR meetings in 2020.\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Recognising its relevance, the Committee evaluated the",

We took energy mix, technological opportunities and regulatory risks into consideration to assess and better understand the transitional risks and opportunities we face. Wherever practical, renewable energy sources are implemented by our operating subsidiaries, with a view to increasing their role in our overall energy portfolio. However, current governmental energy policies in Mexico present challenges to the development of clean energies. In 2021, the Committee will monitor the Company's progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and duties of the HSECR Committee are set out in its terms of reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website at www.fresnilloplc.com.\n\n## HSECR Committee membership\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez (Chairman), Dame Judith Macgregor, Mr Fernando Ruiz and Mrs Georgina Kessel.\n- \u00b7 Key contributors: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, Sustainability and Community Relations Officer, Head of Legal, Compliance Officer, Human Resources and Procurement teams.\n\n## HSECR Committee activity\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met in accordance with its terms of reference.\n\nWe remain strongly committed to promoting a long-term focus and rigorous analysis of the Company's sustainability strategy.\n\nI am very pleased to report that our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) performance was recognised by the inclusion of Fresnillo plc in the FTSE4Good Index.

This underlines the importance of deeply integrating responsible business practices into our business model, and considering factors that affect stakeholders at every critical decision-making level. The effectiveness of our response to Covid-19 has demonstrated that stakeholder trust is our most valuable intangible asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe year saw many examples of our commitment to contribute to 'the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold'. For example, throughout our response to Covid-19 we made sure that our people and communities were always our number one priority. In addition, our initiative to achieve excellence in the safety and governance of our TSFs is enhancing our resilience and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders.\n\n- Our initiatives regarding renewable energy, intelligent mine ventilation and innovative dual fuel trucks also give us the flexibility to transition to a low-carbon economy, while reducing operating costs. Furthermore, our closed-circuit processes, reuse of municipal wastewater, and collaboration with authorities and communities strengthen our water stewardship strategy. Last but not least, we have adapted our community engagement and social investment portfolio to support our communities during the Covid-19 emergency.",

Our aspiration was 'A well-established ethics culture demonstrated by our behaviours and actions'. Our ethics culture initiative was deployed in two phases:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preventing workplace harassment\n\nAt Fresnillo plc we believe that a healthy work environment improves the wellbeing of our workforce and has a direct impact on productivity. Encouraged by this deep-seated belief, and convinced that a communication campaign alone would not be enough, our Honour Commission requested a comprehensive programme to prevent and address harassment in the workplace. In June 2019, we carried out a diagnosis to identify the root causes that triggered these behaviours at an operation. This diagnosis was composed of direct observations of work dynamics and social interactions, face-to-face interviews, psychological workshops for all the workforce and perception surveys. The model was tested in San Juli\u00e1n and Fresnillo mines and modified to create a protocol to prevent and address labour and sexual harassment in a reliable, accessible, efficient and fair way for all our employees and non-unionised employees.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- \u00b7 Phase 1: Raising Awareness (2013-2015): The objective of this first phase was to reduce behavioural risk, which is the gap between the intended behaviours (Purpose, values, Code of Conduct, etc.), the expressed behaviours (training, advice, tone at the top, etc.), and the actual behaviours demonstrated by employees and leaders.\n- \u00b7 Phase 2: 'Step-Up' Culture (2016-present): We retained our focus on raising awareness and developing the ethical decision-making competencies of our people. Furthermore, in this phase we wanted to go beyond individual decision-making, engaging our people to become stewards of our ethical culture.\n\nWe monitored the progress of our 'Step-Up' Culture with Ethisphere's 'Ethics Quotient', with encouraging signs of the progress made in this journey.\n\n86.6 2016 FRESNILLO CULTURE QUOTIENT\n\n84.5\n\nThe protocol has three focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Prevention: address the internal and external conditions of workers and raise awareness.\n- \u00b7 Care: address instances of harassment with trained personnel.\n- \u00b7 Restoration: train staff involved in harassment situations, improve our processes and introduce initiatives to prevent these situations developing.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, the protocol was implemented digitally. This comprised:\n\n- \u00b7 Training counsellors and commissioners on how to address harassment cases.\n- \u00b7 Creating Labour Behaviour Commissions in all mines.\n- \u00b7 Raising awareness through a permanent communication campaign.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We also engaged with our contractors. 79% of the main contractor companies were invited to attend online workshops to align them with the protocol's principles of action and to help them create their own protocol to address harassment.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue raising awareness and building trust in the protocols in order to eliminate harassment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE",

We have made the health of our people our number one priority, implementing a comprehensive strategy to protect our people from the impacts of Covid-19.\n\nWe seek to attract, develop and retain the best people, and engage them over the long term. We continue to work hard to develop an organisational culture based on ethics and caring for our people. We respect labour rights and engage union representatives constructively. We conduct employee engagement surveys to better understand and respond to the expectations of our people. Our workforce comprises unionised employees, non-unionised employees and contractors.\n\n## Talent management\n\nWe seek to recruit, retain, and develop the most talented employees in order to ensure we have an appropriate pipeline to meet the future needs of the business. We attract and develop talent with a long-term mindset and emphasise the value of training and mentorship. We believe that the best retention strategy is to provide opportunities for people to learn and grow.\n\nA cohort (batch) system is used to recruit short- and long-term interns and Engineers in Training. During 2020 short-term internships were completely online, with training on mining, geology, safety and communication being delivered to 433 students (167 women and 266 men). In order to increase diversity, we collaborate with leading educational institutions in Mexico to attract young and diverse talent in geology, metallurgy and mining engineering. We recruit graduates from our pool of interns through the Engineers in Training programme. These graduates are assigned a coach from our operations team who supervises their development and provides performance appraisals - and those with good appraisals receive permanent job offers, securing the talent pipeline for our growth strategy. Through this programme, we engage students from the earliest stages of their college education and encourage more women to participate in mining.\n\n## DIVERSITY IN TALENT ATTRACTION /parenleft.caseJUNIOR NON/hyphen.caseUNIONISED POSITIONS/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2016\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2020, we assessed 50% of our nonunionised employees to identify high potential employees. Our performance assessment mechanism aligns training for every employee. Best performers with high potential enter the Institutional Development programme; 14% of these employees were women (50 out of 347 non-unionised employees). We also introduced succession plans focused on key positions and intend to identify at least 60 high potential employees to cover these positions over the long term. We develop our high potential middle managers via the Leaders with Vision programme. This involves senior executives delivering seminars throughout the year as a mechanism to engage and mobilise our people. The executives participate in two training programmes organised by the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM), a leading business school.\n\n## Union relations\n\nUnions are our strategic partners and key players in our drive to foster productivity and develop a safety culture. We believe that fair and respectful relations with unions build trust and mutual accountability. We respect the rights of employees to freedom of expression, association and collective bargaining. We engage unions to build trust through continuous dialogue, leadership development programmes, wellbeing activities (sports, culture, etc.) and continuous improvement projects.\n\nThe CEO and the Head of Human Resources engage with union senior leadership while our business units regularly engage with local union committees and their delegates. These close relationships enable collaboration on capacity building of newly elected union committees. Win-win relations are the foundation for fair collective bargaining. During 2020, we did not experience any work stoppages or industrial action because of labour disputes.\n\nThe unions and the Company collaborate in an annual symposium on Safety. The forum presents best practices, with meaningful dialogue helping to identify the challenges and opportunities. Safety regulators also contribute to the symposium. In addition, the Company and unions jointly implement the 'LEAL' (Loyal) survey on work behaviours and wellbeing. These insights are used to improve our workforce engagement strategy.\n\n|                                           | Men    | Women   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Senior managers                           | 165    | 9       | 174     |\n| Employees  (unionised and  non-unionised) | 4,943  | 641     | 5,584   |\n| Contractors                               | 12,377 | 1,229   | 13,606  |\n| Total workforce                           |        |         | 19,364  |\n\n## WORKFORCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2020 13,606   |       | 4,327   | 1,431   |\n|---------------|-------|---------|---------|\n| 2019 13,407   |       | 4,165   | 1,317   |\n| 2018  13,425  |       | 3,925   | 1,214   |\n| 2017 11,188   |       | 3,736   | 1,081   |\n| 2016 7,815    | 3,324 | 969     |         |\n\n- 2015 817 2,684 3,589 Contractors Unionised employees\n- Non-unionised employees\n\n## PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2020      | 5.17%   |        |\n|-----------|---------|--------|\n|           |         | 11.29% |\n| 2016 2019 | 4.58%   |        |\n|           |         | 10.07% |\n|           |         | 9.59%  |\n| 2018      | 4.67%   |        |\n|           |         | 9.32%  |\n|           |         | 8.59%  |\n| 2017      | 5.08%   |        |\n|           |         | 8.89%  |\n\n- Manager and senior executive positions\n- Employees (unionised and non-unionised) Contractors\n\nNote: This is the first year we are including statistics on women contractors.

Equity and inclusion can lead to improvements in attraction, retention and development of talent, as well as innovation and creativity.\n\nOur approach is inspired by the principle of equality and recognises the importance of treating people appropriately and providing equal access to opportunities. Our aim is to foster an inclusive workplace where openness, belonging, and respect allow people to have an impact on the workplace in a meaningful way.\n\nIncreasing the participation and inclusion of women is the first step in the journey to make diversity a competitive edge. We have two strategic objectives:\n\n- 1. Enhance the contribution of women to the success of the Company.\n- 2. Have a positive impact on female employees.\n\n## What we did in 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Participated at the Women in Mining (WIM) chapters in the Mexican states of Zacatecas and Sonora.\n- \u00b7 Participated in PAR Ranking.\n- \u00b7 Increased the percentage of women recruited through our Engineers in Training programme from 35% to 38%.\n- \u00b7 Monitored diversity as part of the ethics culture perception survey.\n- \u00b7 Trained executives and senior level employees in diversity, equity and inclusion (see case study).\n- \u00b7 Saw the representation of women on our Board rise to 33%.\n- \u00b7 Set a diversity target.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nBased on salary scales, we have policies in place to mitigate the gender pay gap. In 2020, the gender pay gap for non-unionised, nonexecutive employees was 2.64% compared to 2.98% in 2019. The gap is calculated using the weighted average salary per hierarchical level.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nOur goal is to increase the overall representation of women from 10% to 12% by 2025 and to challenge the glass ceiling at the operating manager and superintendent level, raising the percentage of women in these roles from 2% to 8% by 2025.\n\n## In 2020 our programme focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Training the Executive Committee, senior executives, managers, superintendents and high potential talent to raise awareness of the strategic importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, and develop the necessary skills to manage a diverse workforce (see case study).\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking our practices in the PAR Ranking and the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI).\n- \u00b7 Engaging our neighbouring communities in STEM careers.\n\nWe participated for the first time in the PAR Ranking, the largest ranking system in Latin America to measure gender equality performance. In 2019, we adhered to the Women's Empowerment Principles established by the UN Global Compact and UN Women.\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Change how we communicate to showcase more diverse role models.\n- \u00b7 Develop coaching and mentoring programmes.\n- \u00b7 Review our human resources practices (such as recruitment, development, performance appraisal and promotion) to reduce the risk of implicit and explicit bias.\n- \u00b7 Introduce a broader set of KPIs to understand patterns, plan interventions and monitor their effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 Train non-unionised employees on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n- \u00b7 Adopt the 'Four For Women' framework from Wharton Business School for our Annual Report 2021.\n\nThe head count per hierarchical level and business unit is used to determine the weights in the overall average gap calculation.\n\n## OVERALL GENDER PAY GAP\n\n-2.64%\n\n2020\n\n-2.98%\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n0\n\n-3.95%\n\n2016\n\n|                                | Open pit  Operations   | Underground  Operations   | Projects   | Explorations             | Support and  administrative staff   | Average gap per  hierarchical level   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| First level 'Senior Engineer'  | (0.22)%                | (5.85)%                   | (14.78)%   | (1.45)%                  | (9.92)%                             | (5.73)%                               |\n| Second level 'Junior Engineer' | (0.34)%                | (2.43)%                   | (2.32)%    | 12.66%                   | 1.29%                               | 0.13%                                 |\n| Third level 'Assistant'        | 14.25%                 | (14.68)%                  | (28.29)%   | (6.59)%                  | 14.31%                              | (4.93)%                               |\n|                                |                        |                           |            | Overall average gap 2020 | Overall average gap 2020            | (2.64)%                               |\n|                                |                        |                           |            | Overall average gap 2019 | Overall average gap 2019            | (2.98)%                               |\n|                                |                        |                           |            | Overall average gap 2018 | Overall average gap 2018            | (3.95)%                               |\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Promoting greater diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nIn partnership with the University of Arizona, we developed a five-hour online training module on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for our executives, managers and high potential talent.\n\nAround 300 leaders participated in this training, which covered the following topics: defining and addressing Fresnillo's strategy for diversity, equity and inclusion; understanding unconscious bias and different types of diversity; identifying the types of microaggressions; recognising toxic masculinity; and reviewing stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination.

Therefore, we are committed to work relentlessly to improve our performance, instilling a preventive culture, raising awareness of the risks associated with our activities and implementing controls and mechanisms to eliminate fatalities.\n\n## Relevance and risk in the lifecycle of mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to implement the 'I Care, We Care' programme with its five strategic pillars.\n- \u00b7 Strengthen safety objectives by monitoring preventive KPIs in order to improve our ability to anticipate incidents.\n- \u00b7 Reinforce our approach of holding our people accountable for safety performance.\n- \u00b7 Launch the 'Eye on Risk' programme to foster risk management competencies, teamwork and coaching with the involvement of mine managers and superintendents.\n- \u00b7 Increase focus on reporting, investigating and learning from high potential incidents related to critical risks.\n- \u00b7 Mature our approach to 'Critical Risk Controls.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Me Cuido, Nos Cuidamos ('I Care, We Care') programme\n\nThis programme enables the organisation to embrace ongoing innovation and continuous improvement regarding safety practices, risk assessments and controls, and emergency preparedness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leadership: Values-driven leadership\n\n- \u00b7 Senior leadership education courses.\n- \u00b7 Supervisor education courses.\n- \u00b7 Coaching our people.\n\n## Accountability: Integration of safety and operational management systems\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting recognition of safety as the responsibility of line management.\n- \u00b7 Senior management involvement in monitoring processes, systems, operations and reporting policies.\n\n## Risk Competencies - Behaviour: A mature and resilient safety culture\n\n- \u00b7 Stepback (a method used to raise awareness and identify safety risks in work areas).\n- \u00b7 Positive recognition.\n\n## Reducing vehicle incidents\n\nInstalled in our haulage fleet at our Penmont mine, a high-tech system reduces accidents by identifying driver fatigue and distractions. The Driver Safety System from CATERPILLAR monitors cab activity and sends alerts to a control centre. Once the issue is classified and confirmed, the appropriate intervention is applied.\n\nOur mining fleet also benefits from SAFEmine CAS, a GPS-based anti-collision system that monitors the proximity of other vehicles and uses loud alarms to warn operators of any potential collision. The system gathers data including the position, speed and direction of the vehicle and transmits it to other vehicles within 800 meters.\n\nAn essential aspect of the programme is that all our people should work together to create an environment of trust and respect. The programme highlights the importance of safe work, recognises positive actions in work areas and creates a learning environment. In addition, it encourages awareness of individual and group commitment. This includes understanding the responsibilities of each job or function, the role of passion in the workplace, leadership and companionship - in order to create a true culture of caring.\n\n## Risk Competencies - Systems: Establish a risk-based management system\n\n- \u00b7 Internal documents aligned with ISO standards.\n- \u00b7 Critical Risk Control protocols and organisational deployment.\n\n## Learning environment: Reduce risks through engineering, systems, behaviours and lessons learnt\n\n- \u00b7 Communicate and implement improvements and corrective actions.\n- \u00b7 Investigation - Eye On Risk.",

The centre currently delivers seven modules with a further two related to vehicle control in development\n\n- 1. De-energisation and lockout, using electricity boards.\n- 2. Ground control, where trainees can practice different techniques to avoid rockfalls such as manual scaling with aluminium bars or reading geomechanical lights.\n- 3. Explosive management, which delivers learnings on how to transport, store and handle explosives.\n- 4. Working at heights, where trainees can improve their understanding of equipment used for working at heights.\n- 5. Material lifting, which focuses on different types of hoists and provides training on the correct way to lift materials.\n- 6. Safety guards, where trainees learn to use guards in transportation bands or other transmission elements.\n- 7. Hazardous materials, enabling trainees to identify and handle harmful substances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Certifications\n\n|                                                                                                   | Fresnillo   | Saucito   | Ci\u00e9nega              | Penmont   | San Juli\u00e1n            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| OHSAS 18001/ISO 45,000                                                                            | Certified   | Certified | In process Certified |           | In process In process |\n| Sets out criteria for international  best practice in occupational  health and safety management. | Certified   | Certified | In process Certified |           | In process In process |\n\n## Performance\n\nAlthough we have made progress in reducing injury frequency rates, we regret that we have to report one fatality in 2020.

Leadership and critical conduct management: Defining roles, responsibilities and accountability. The main critical conduct is to stop working if the critical controls are not being followed.\n- 2. Critical control management: Defining the critical controls per business unit, identifying preventive and mitigating controls, developing verification tools for critical controls and performance standards, and training the workforce.\n- 3. Management of high potential incidents (HPIs): Classifying HPIs, defining KPIs, investigating high potential accidents and verifying corrective actions.\n\nIn 2020, all our mines identified and reported their HPIs. During the last quarter of the year, the HPIM strategy was implemented in the San Juli\u00e1n mine and the Juanicipio project, with the collaboration of managers, supervisors, operators and contractors.",

The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to Fresnillo. However, we continued to ensure that the health of our people remained our number one priority - implementing a comprehensive strategy to protect employees and contractors in our mining operations from the pandemic's impacts.\n\n## Relevance and risk in the lifecycle of mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Covid-19\n\nAt the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak, we engaged with the Mexican authorities and our industry peers to develop a preventive protocol based on international best practice. Throughout the pandemic, we have learned from others while sharing our own best practices. Our efforts have been recognised by our regulator, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), which honoured us with the Covid-19 Health Safety Award.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Embedding Covid-19 prevention into our culture\n\nDuring the year, we regularly engaged with our people to combat misinformation and drive greater awareness of preventive protocols in the workplace as well as how they could protect themselves and their families. For example, we worked hard to raise awareness of the importance of identifying the early symptoms of Covid-19 and asking for help promptly, in some cases using creative approaches such as plays and mimes. In addition, we organised webinars on the importance of protecting mental health and wellbeing while we all spend more time at home, using instant messaging apps to share testimonials and interviews.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we will win\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- 1. Crisis committees: We created a corporate crisis committee, led by the CEO, to coordinate crisis committees across all our operations, development projects and explorations. Covid-19 coordinators were designated to monitor compliance with the preventive protocol.\n- 2. Protecting the vulnerable workforce: We identified vulnerable members of our workforce based on their age, whether they had existing chronic diseases (such as diabetes or high blood pressure) and whether they were pregnant or breastfeeding. To better protect their health, we offered all these employees the option to stay at home on full pay.\n- 3. Raising awareness and education: We launched a creative communication campaign to educate our people about preventive measures, raise awareness and combat misinformation. Our CEO participated actively in communication campaigns, setting the tone from the top.\n- 4. Social distancing in the workplace: We adopted social distancing measures and appropriate protective equipment at all our facilities, including accommodation and personnel transportation. In common areas such as entrances, dining rooms, dressing rooms, shaft, boardrooms and meeting rooms, we used floor markings to facilitate compliance. To support effective social distancing, we have reduced the number of passengers travelling together, the size of teams working together and the number of people in a training room.\n\n## NEW CASES OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- 5. Hygiene and sanitation: We mandated the use of masks and hygiene measures, notably handwashing and the use of anti-bacterial gel. In addition, we implemented a daily sanitisation programme for work areas, accommodation and transportation.\n- 6. Access control: We established checkpoints to monitor body temperature and enquire about symptoms or contacts with people suspected to have the disease. For those working in remote locations, monitoring takes place both before transportation and on arrival at the mine site.\n- 7. Testing, monitoring and contagion traceability: We were early adopters of Covid-19 tests and contagion traceability. We monitor the progress of our workforce in self-quarantine on a daily basis, and also offer psychological care and emotional support.\n\n## Occupational health\n\nOur approach aims to pre-emptively identify and manage the health risks to which our workforce is exposed. Preventive care and the promotion of healthier lifestyles can limit certain chronic diseases and enhance overall wellness and fitness for work. While our focus is on prevention, emergency response is a core competence of all our health teams. To mitigate Covid-19 risks, we have temporarily reduced the number of regular check-ups, postponed non-essential spirometry tests and stopped testing for alcohol abuse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Fresnillo   | Saucito   | Ci\u00e9nega   | Penmont   | San Juli\u00e1n   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Healthy Company   Certification by Mexican health authorities  of the implementation of best practice in  occupational health and preventive care,   including the promotion of healthier  lifestyles. | Certified   | Certified | Certified | Certified | Under  Way   |\n| Smoke-Free Company  A prerequisite for Healthy   Company certification.                                                                                                                                | Certified   | Certified | Certified | Certified | Certified    |\n\n## Working safely and protecting our colleagues\n\nAll our people undertook mandatory online training provided by the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) on how to work safely and protect their families at home. Our mine managers and senior medical staff were trained to lead on Covid-19 prevention in the workplace (Monitores para el retorno saludable) by IMSS and the Labour Ministry. Following an audit of the preventive measures, we were awarded a government certificate. Our contractors also undertook this training, ensuring full compliance with regulations.\n\nOur doctors, nurses, paramedics and staff at the access control points were trained on measures to protect themselves and to support our people in self-quarantine, in particular how to identify when a person should go to the hospital. We have increased the size of our health teams and introduced enhanced collaboration with contractors. Our senior medical staff supervised the implementation of the same protective measures among the health teams of our contractors, notably the use of rapid testing and contact tracing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impact on the environment is already observable, with average temperatures on both land and in the oceans increasing. Sea levels have risen while ice sheets have shrunk, and glaciers have retreated. Extreme events such as high temperatures and exceptional rainfall have intensified, while the acidification of the oceans is irrefutably the result of human activity creating more carbon dioxide.\n\n## Relevance and risk in the lifecycle of mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese changes to the planet's climate have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, economies and on society at large. As the average global temperature has increased, so too has society's investment in initiatives to mitigate further impacts. Preventing the worst results of climate change requires global cooperation. Together, we need to work to hold the increase in temperature to well below 2 \u00b0C. At the same time, we should pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 \u00b0C, which could limit the costs associated with adapting to climate change, compared to the 2 \u00b0C scenario. The fight against climate change also brings opportunities, due to an increase in the demand for silver for manufacturing solar photovoltaic cells.\n\nOur stakeholders expect us to take action and report transparently. We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions (SDG 13), improving our energy efficiency and integrating clean energy (SDG 7) sources into our electricity mix. We recognise the importance of integrating the physical and transitional risks into our planning and decision-making processes, to ensure that our business continues to thrive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have prepared this section in light of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

A key development in 2020 was the decision to 'Evaluate the Energy Strategy with the aim of setting decarbonisation targets and assessing its resilience to the Transition Risks of Climate Change' (see the Principal Decisions section on pages 132-133). The progress of this evaluation was discussed by the full Board in the 2Q 2020 meeting, confirming the importance that Fresnillo places on this topic.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the Board's HSECR Committee evaluates climate-related performance, risks and opportunities. In 2020, climate change was part of the agenda at all HSECR Committee meetings. For example, the Committee analysed the regulatory risks and technological opportunities of the Energy Strategy. The Committee was briefed on the progress of TCFD in the February 2021 meeting.\n\n## HSECR Committee knowledge and training\n\nThe Directors of the HSECR Committee have relevant experience and knowledge in relation to climate change. The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, has extensive expertise in Mexican public policy and a solid academic background in macroeconomics. Ms Georgina Kessel has significant experience on matters relating to energy and climate change, serving served as Minister of Energy from 2006 to 2011. Dame Judith Macgregor has wide-ranging diplomatic experience and contributes valuable international perspectives on climate change. Mr Fernando Ruiz brings his considerable experience on Mexican taxation to the Committee, as well as a valuable perspective on the landscape of carbon pricing legislation.\n\nDuring 2020, the HSECR Committee undertook training on the basic principles of science-based targets. This training has been useful in discussing target-setting and evaluating the decarbonisation pathway. In 2021, additional training on the physical risks of climate change will be delivered.\n\n## Management oversight on climate change\n\nOur CEO, COO and Head of Sustainability report quarterly to the HSECR Committee. The energy and climate change performance are reviewed against our environmental goals.\n\nThe strategic vision of our CEO is key to making the connection between business strategy and climate-related risks and opportunities. The CEO's words and actions have an enormous impact, and his personal leadership is essential for setting and communicating goals and holding the organisation to account. Our COO has responsibilities related to the energy\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AT THE CORE OF OUR PURPOSE\n\nCONTINUED\n\n## Environment\n\nefficiency of current operations and our objectives regarding future performance. Our COO plays a key role in setting annual energy efficiency targets and holding mine managers accountable. Our CFO and COO collaborate to identify energy efficiency opportunities. The Head of Sustainability supports the Executive Committee in assessing the carbon footprint of the Strategic Plan, measuring the quarterly performance and analysing scenarios to identify impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nOur mine managers engage with our people to find opportunities to improve energy efficiency. In a key development of 2020, mine managers and superintendents worked together to support the Executive Committee in forecasting energy demand for the Strategic Plan and assessing the impact of the energy efficiency initiatives on the operations for which they are responsible.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## Identifying risks and opportunities\n\nConsiderations regarding climate change are integrated within our Enterprise Risk Management system. In the current risk reassessment cycle, climate change was elevated from emerging to principal risk status following feedback from our internal stakeholders. Climate change in turn has multiple implications, necessitating further refinement in the identification of the risks and opportunities. The Sustainability team reviews industry association guides, government and international scientific reports, global energy scenarios and the climate change reports of our peers to identify transition and physical risks of climate change. In addition, the Sustainability team engages internal stakeholders from our operations on energy matters, and also engages with government representatives, environmental and legal teams, industry bodies and our peers to gain a better understanding of emerging regulations and developments in technology. The risks and opportunities are reviewed annually by the Head of Sustainability.\n\nWe evaluate the materiality of risks and opportunities using qualitative and quantitative judgements regarding the science, economics, politics and policy. We consider as material those risks that could give rise to a financial impact or disrupt the operations of the Company in the short, medium and long term.\n\n## Impacts on and by the business\n\nDue to climate change, we expect our operations and projects to face acute physical risks from extreme events such as high temperatures, droughts and extreme rainfall from more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Pacific. These natural disasters may affect the health and safety of our people, damage access roads and mine infrastructure, disrupt operations and impact our neighbouring communities.\n\nIn addition, the rise in temperatures may increase our water demand while the decrease in annual rainfall exacerbates water stress in the regions where we operate. These chronic risks may intensify the competition to access water resources, increasing risks to our social licence to operate. Society's responses to the need to transition to a low-carbon economy include more stringent regulations to reduce emissions, a transformation of the global energy system, changes in behaviour and consumption choices and emerging technologies. Adaptation measures are necessary to build sufficient flexibility to respond to physical and transitional changes.\n\nWe recognise the importance of maturing the way in which we integrate physical climate change risks and adaptation into our financial planning and decision-making processes. We are committed to enhancing our understanding of the site level impacts and vulnerabilities in order to refine our adaptation measures. In 2020, we have integrated transition risks and adaptation into our assessment of the Energy Strategy and Strategic Plan.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nScientists agree that global climate change has already led to observable effects. The climate patterns that shaped our day-to-day mining operations are changing, and we need a better understanding of climate risk to design resilient operations that can adapt to changes in climate. In the short term, the adaptation to extreme climate and weather events, such as excessive rainfall and drought, relies on an understanding of present and expected changes in their probability and magnitude. However, the attribution of a single extreme weather event to anthropogenic climate change remains challenging due to the underlying natural variability of climate and limited site specific historical records (i.e. 30 years of data). In the long term, the effects of climate change remain uncertain as they depend on the complex interrelation between rising emissions, environmental and social impacts and the global response to mitigate climate change.\n\nTo identify the physical impacts of climate change, we use guides produced by industry associations such as ICMM, international scientific reports, for example the IPCC, reports from industry peers and reports by the Mexican Government. To improve our general understanding of the issues, we rely on the outcomes of scenarios built by the Mexican reports based on the Global Circulation Models (GCMs) using different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In addition, we use Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), to better understand water stress under different climate change scenarios in the 2020-2030 period.",

The reduction in annual precipitation is expected to increase water stress in the river basins, while higher temperatures may increase our water demand, for example to compensate for losses through evaporation. Among the acute physical risks, the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, such as rainfall, droughts and heat waves are expected to increase in the regions where we operate.\n\nWhile they are useful to aid understanding of global and regional trends, global models must be translated into localised impacts in order to better understand site-level risks. We are committed to working closely with the scientific community to conduct additional regional and site-level climate and hydrologic modelling. This will help identify actionable information that will help us plan adaptation measures in our operations and projects.\n\n(See the Physical risks table on the next page).\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities\n\nMitigating the impacts of climate change, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, requires a major transformation of the global energy system. To identify the risks and opportunities, we explore the implications of two specific scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA): the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS); and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). In a well below 2 \u00b0C scenario, the energy system relies less on fuel combustion and increases the participation of renewable energy in the energy mix, notably solar energy. The energy\n\n## ENERGY DEMAND FORECAST\n\n## DECARBONISATION PATHWAYS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n95 /hyphen.case FRESNILLO PLC\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nsystem takes advantage of the huge potential for energy efficiency, electrification, energy storage and hydrogen technology.\n\nIn addition to these global scenarios, we explore the market and technological trends in the mining industry as well as the regulatory landscape for energy and climate change in Mexico.\n\n(See the Transition risks and opportunities table on pages 97-98).\n\n## Business resilience to climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nOur identification of physical climate-related risks is based on the outcomes of global models for Mexico. A better understanding at the regional and site level is necessary to assess vulnerabilities, set priorities and evaluate adaptation measures.\n\nTo evaluate our resilience to transitional risks, we have assessed the flexibility of our Energy Strategy to provide decarbonisation opportunities in the 2021-2030 period. Assuming that emerging policies and stakeholder expectations will transition to a low-carbon economy, we have used for comparison purposes the Absolute Contraction (straight line) Method of the Science-Based Targets Initiative, considering a well below 2 \u00b0C scenario. We have considered the energy requirements of our Strategic Plan which includes our mining operations and the Juanicipio project. The operating energy demand of our high potential advanced exploration activities were taken into consideration in order to provide a more conservative estimation of the energy demand.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- This evaluation assessment has allowed us to identify the requirements of renewable energy over time. Renewable energy, such as fuel replacement in the fleet at Herradura (dual diesel-LNG trucks) are the most important levers to decarbonise in the 2021-2030 period.\n\nWe have further evaluated the risks of sourcing more renewable energy under the current government efforts to secure a market share for the conventional power plants of the national electricity company. New technologies, such as hydrogen and electrification, were explored qualitatively to reflect on the pathway to carbon neutrality beyond 2030. The outcomes of this assessment have been presented as a Principal Decision this year (pages 132-134).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate change was identified as an emerging risk in 2019 and elevated to a principal risk in 2020. The pervasive and complex nature of climate change means that it can act as an amplifier of other risks such as environmental incidents, access to water, health and safety of our people, government regulations, and social licence to operate. The Head of Sustainability supports the process to refine the identification and risk assessment of physical and transitional risks.\n\nThe risk assessment of transition risks has been conducted considering a well below 2 \u00b0C scenario decarbonisation pathway. The Head of Sustainability is responsible for monitoring risks and opportunities, mitigation and performance monitoring of transition risks. We are committed to maturing how we evaluate physical risks and mitigation measures.

Please check the climate change scenarios at: https://www.wri.org/aqueduct\n\n## Engagement with stakeholders\n\nThrough the Silver Institute, we participate in an industry-wide initiative on silver and the low-carbon economy. The objective is to produce more carbon footprint information for industry stakeholders, showcase carbon abatement best practices and further study the role of silver as a climate-smart metal. We also participate in the 'Energy & Mines' community, a leading group that shares best practices on renewables, energy efficiency and promising technologies for off-grid mines and hydrogen. In addition, we collaborate with our peers in the Colorado Mining Cleantech Challenge to promote innovative solutions for energy efficiency and other environmental challenges.\n\nOur engagement initiatives extend to groups in other industries. For example, we take part in the World Environment Center (WEC), which enables us to learn best practices on climate change strategy from leading international companies. In Mexico, we are part of CESPEDES (Mexican Chapter of the WBCSD) which shares best practices and engages with governments and society at large. In 2020, Fresnillo plc became a registered\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsupporter of the TCFD. We disclose our performance in the CDP and GEI Mexico, a voluntary disclosure programme with the Mexican regulators. We discuss our climate change strategy in interviews with shareholders.\n\n## Integration with current risk process\n\nIn the past, climate change was considered to be solely a sustainability issue. The allencompassing business implications of climate change led to its inclusion as one of the emerging risks, as part of provision 28 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Climate change is now considered an integral part of the overall risk management process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AT THE CORE OF OUR PURPOSE\n\nCONTINUED\n\n## Environment\n\nAn improving or declining reputation, depending on our climate change accountability to our stakeholders.",

We continued to support innovation and provide access to digital education by partnering with different NGOs.\n\n## Partnering with our communities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nOur response to the challenges presented by Covid-19 focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Communicating preventive measures.\n- \u00b7 Donating and raising awareness of the use of masks.\n- \u00b7 Collaborating with the state, municipal and health authorities through strategic donations.\n- \u00b7 Supporting the most vulnerable with food supplies during the lockdowns.\n- \u00b7 Sharing our Covid-19 tests with communities in remote locations.\n- \u00b7 Adapting our educational and entrepreneurial programmes to support distance learning and capacity building.\n\n## Engaging communities effectively in the lifecycle of mining\n\nWe earn and maintain the trust of communities through effective engagement and by being accountable for our impacts - and we recognise that this is the only way to obtain and preserve our social licence to operate. Our community strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, aims to build mutual understanding between our operations and local communities, ensuring that we engage, develop and grow together.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration: Our exploration teams are the first to establish contact with a local community. We identify the relevant stakeholders and focus our engagement efforts on obtaining temporary land access to explore and assess social risks.\n\nFramework for community engagement in the lifecycle of mining\n\nExploration\n\nClosure\n\nProject development\n\nOperation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholder identification, evaluation and mapping\n\nSocial studies: baseline, impact assessment and reputation\n\nSocial management plans\n\nInformal and formal meetings\n\nRegister of commitments\n\nCommunity committees\n\nIndigenous people consultation\n\nGrievance mechanism\n\nSocial incident investigations\n\nLand acquisitions and resettlements\n\nStrategic social investment\n\nCommunity requests of contribution\n\nCommunity small and medium enterprises\n\nSocial closure plans\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Development: Our stakeholder relationships deepen in this phase of the cycle, as we build trust through activities including local hiring, contracts and social investment.

We recognise that consultation is a fundamental right of indigenous communities and a mechanism to build trust. Good faith, transparency and accountability are the key values that guide our consultation approach.\n\nConsultation allows us to understand their perspectives on our projects and address their concerns. Before the consultation phase, we assess the potential impacts and benefits of our projects and develop the capacities of the communities to fully exercise their right to consultation. During consultation, we consider their preferred method of engagement, present information in a culturally appropriate manner and reach agreements on shared benefits. In 2018, our commitment to constructive dialogue and inclusive participation was fundamental to obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the Raramuri Indigenous People to build and operate a water reservoir for our San Juli\u00e1n mine. There were no indigenous consultations in 2020.\n\n## How we will win\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify indigenous communities, proactively conducting due diligence of our exploration concessions.\n- \u00b7 Engage respectfully in a culturally appropriate manner that recognises their culture, values and aspirations.\n- \u00b7 Implement best practices regarding the Free, Prior and Informed Consent of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AT THE CORE OF OUR PURPOSE\n\nCONTINUED\n\n## Communities\n\n## Land acquisitions and resettlements\n\nOur goal is to manage resettlement responsibly, respecting local laws and following international best practices.\n\nRelevance and risk in the lifecycle of mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeveloping a mining project involves land acquisition and, in some cases, the resettlement of households. We recognise that these are complex and life-changing issues for communities. When poorly planned and managed, land acquisition and resettlement can adversely impact the livelihoods and social structure of communities, damage our relationships or even cause conflict. We recognise that the right to an adequate standard of living after land acquisition and resettlement projects is a basic human right.\n\n## How we will win Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Avoid resettlements whenever possible, by exploring alternative options.\n- \u00b7 If resettlements are unavoidable, work together with affected households, communities and governments to minimise adverse impacts, restoring or improving livelihoods and living conditions.\n- \u00b7 Further develop our competencies and internal processes to manage resettlements, including social baseline and asset surveys, an entitlement and compensation framework, negotiation, livelihood restoration programmes and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\n\n## Performance\n\nNo community resettlements occurred at our operations or development projects during 2020.\n\n## Helping communities combat the pandemic\n\nWe trained 300 parents and teachers from communities near our operations - raising awareness of how they could protect themselves, their families and their communities from Covid-19.\n\nOur educational module was designed by the Smithsonian Science Education Center and adapted to Mexico by INNOVEC.\n\n'We shared with new generations the importance of adopting preventive measures to face the pandemic and of understanding how their daily habits impact the prevention of contagion' said Juan Carlos, INNOVEC teacher.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nArtwork created by parents to promote measures to combat Covid-19.\n\nChildren's homework to reinforce lessons learned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe project partners have now made the module contents available on video, with the help of one of Mexico's leading science content producers for children.

In total, 16 women used their skills to create more than 90,000 fabric masks, which were delivered to our workforce, health institutions, governments and communities.\n\n'We thank San Juli\u00e1n Mine for the sewing workshop. It was a great opportunity to support women, with nine of us manufacturing the masks. This creation of jobs helped us manage the economic impact of the pandemic' said Neria Ayala, the leader of the sewing workshop in San Juli\u00e1n.\n\n'We started the workshop eager to learn a new skill.

This fund was intended to support communities close to mining operations. However, the Congress has reallocated the Mining Fund to national public spending. We partner with the communities where we operate to engage the authorities and aim to encourage them to fund infrastructure projects that benefit mining communities.\n\nThe Fresnillo plc contribution to the Fund for Sustainable Development of Mining States and Municipalities was US$33.64 million in 2020.\n\n|   2020 US$ million |   2019 US$ million |\n|--------------------|--------------------|\n|              33.64 |              10.97 |\n\n*  Current mining fund taxes are used in our sustainability review as a social performance measure.\n\n## Local employment and procurement\n\nLocal employment is a key driver of social acceptability and community development. We promote local employment from the early days of the exploration phase onwards. In the development and operational phases, for example, we offer employment opportunities directly or through our mining contractors. Our local and regional labour as a percentage of the total workforce is 72.29%. Our Centre for Technical Studies (CETEF) trains mining technicians to meet our specific needs. CETEF candidates are chosen from the communities surrounding our operations, thus securing talent and strengthening our social licence to operate. We participate in the mining clusters of Zacatecas, Sonora and Chihuahua. These clusters contribute to the development of regional suppliers, strengthening their participation in the value chain of mining companies.\n\n## LOCAL EMPLOYMENT\n\n|   2020 | 72.29%   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2019 | 68.41%   |\n|   2018 | 68.27%   |\n\n2017\n\nEconomic Value Distributed is considered to be a social performance measure.\n\n|                                     | 2020 US$ million   | 2019 US$ million   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Wages and benefits to workers       | 93.15              | 100.7              |\n| Payments to suppliers (contractors) | 1,333.88           | 1,518.0            |\n| Payments to local governments       | 3.84               | 9.3                |\n| Payments to Federal Government      | 289.84             | 123.7              |\n| Total economic impact               | 1,720.71           | 1,751.7            |",

Our risk management process aims to strike a balance between mitigating and monitoring our risks and maximising the potential reward. We have a structured internal risk management process that identifies risks while simultaneously taking into account the views and interests of our stakeholders.\n\nEffective risk management is an essential part of our culture and strategy. Accurate and timely identification, assessment and management of key risks give us a clear understanding of the actions required throughout the organisation in order to achieve our objectives. Risk can manifest as opportunities or threats that can affect our business performance.\n\nOur risk management framework reflects the importance of risk awareness across the Company. The framework enables us to identify, assess, prioritise and manage risks in order to deliver the value creation objectives defined in our business model.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for all. We implemented risk techniques and processes to identify new risks and analysed the impact of the pandemic on all risks in the Company. Changes enacted to respond to Covid-19 have created opportunities to accelerate digital transformation and enhance safety and productivity.\n\n## Risk governance basis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE BOARD\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews and approves risk management and internal control systems.\n- \u00b7 Determines the nature and extent of principal risks and emerging risks.\n- \u00b7 Monitors exposures to ensure their nature and extent are aligned with overall goals and strategic objectives.\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies strategic risks.\n- \u00b7 Assesses level of risk related to achieving strategic objectives.\n- \u00b7 Oversees execution and implementation of controls into strategic and operating plans.\n\n## OPERATIONAL LEVEL*\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment across mining operations, projects and exploration sites.\n- \u00b7 Risk mitigation and internal controls monitoring across functional areas and business units.\n- The global Covid-19 pandemic posed new challenges for the Risk Department and the Executive Committee in 2020. Due to the uncertainty around the pandemic, all strategic decisions of the Company were analysed using risk scenarios modelling their potential impacts. In addition, from the beginning of the pandemic, five new processes were implemented: (i) a weekly procedure for evaluating and mitigating principal risks; (ii) a process to identify and analyse the impact of the pandemic in all the Company's risks including projects, with a main focus on the health and safety of employees and identification of new risks; (iii) dashboards were constructed for each business unit to monitor mitigation actions and risk level; (iv) impact and probability scenarios were conducted for risks related to the supply chain of critical inputs for operations and projects; and (v) collaboration with governments, the sector, health experts and communities to ensure leading practices were followed.\n- \u00b7 Sets tone on risk management culture.\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT\n\n- \u00b7 Supports the Audit Committee in evaluating the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, and internal controls implemented by management.\n- \u00b7 Risk awareness, and safety culture in day-to-day operations.\n\nAll risk governance, including principal, individual and emerging risks.\n\n* Including personnel at mine sites, development projects, exploration sites and support areas.\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7 Supports the Board in monitoring risk exposures against risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Reviews the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Risk management system\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice.\n\nIn addition to our established risk management activities, our executives - including operations and projects managers, the controllership group, HSECR and exploration managers regularly engage in strengthening the effectiveness of our current controls. These actions support the executives and the Board in each of their responsibilities.\n\nThe Company's risk profile has been developed based on the most significant risks in our business profiles. All of our principal risks were reviewed at least twice during the year, including through Key Risk Indicators, which were developed last year to help embed the risk appetite framework in the business and enhance the monitoring and mitigation of risks.",

        "page_content": "## Emerging risks\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code covers emerging risks and requires the Board to carry out a robust assessment of the Company's emerging risks, disclose procedures to identify them and also explain how these are being managed.\n\nThis requirement has been adopted and embedded within the Company's risk management reporting process and, in parallel with the day-to-day management of risk, within each business unit and project. The risk control and assessment processes in mines, exploration offices and projects were adapted to pay particular attention to emerging risks. At each location, SSMARC's risk-responsible staff monitor local information and analyses related to Fresnillo plc's emerging risks. This monitoring process involves building scenarios for three, five and ten years for each emerging risk and quarterly performance indicators that assess probability and impact.\n\nFresnillo plc defines an emerging risk as a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, a risk that is known to some degree but is not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the Company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications for the achievement of the organisation's Strategic Plan. Furthermore, Fresnillo plc considers emerging risks in the context of longer-term impact and shorter-term risk velocity. The Company has therefore defined emerging risks as those risks captured on a risk register that: (i) are likely to be of significant scale beyond a three-year timeframe; or (ii) have the velocity to significantly increase in severity within the three-year period.\n\nTo strengthen our emerging risks management framework, during 2020 we carried out activities to: (i) identify new emerging risks in light of Covid-19; (ii) reassess emerging risks identified in 2019; (iii) deploy effective monitoring mechanisms; (iv) carry out horizon scanning to consider disruptive scenarios; and (v) implement\n\nmitigating control actions and enhance our risk awareness culture. This process involved workshops, surveys and meetings with the Executive Committee, business unit leaders, support and corporate areas, as well as suppliers, contractors and customers. We also consulted third-party information from global risk reports, academic publications, risk consulting experts and industry benchmarks.\n\nOur risk management standards promote communication of up-to-date information on the Company and industry risks, trends and emerging risks. The events early in 2020 relating to the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a reassessment of our emerging risks and their impact on our operations. This year's emerging risk assessment determined the two most exposed emerging risks to be: 'Water crisis' and 'Technological disruption' and identified a new emerging risk: 'Extreme heatwaves'. Most importantly, the assessment indicated that 'Climate change' had moved from an emerging risk to a principal risk. Relevant emerging risks are discussed below:\n\n| Emerging risk                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Controls                                                                                                                                                                                       | Time scale   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| 1                                                           | Water crisis Lack of sufficient water resources   to meet water consumption  demands in a region.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Water is critical to mining processes.

Executive management then reviewed and challenged each perceived risk level and compared it to Fresnillo plc's risk universe (109) as a whole. The results of this exercise were used as an additional input to define the Company's principal risks. We conducted the same risk analysis on advanced projects, detailing the specific risks faced by each project according to their unique characteristics and conditions.\n\n## WORKSHOPS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBUSINESS WORKSHOPS /parenleft.caseDIRECTOR & MANAGER LEVEL/parenright.case\n\n16\n\n25\n\nINTERVIEWS WITH THE RISK OWNERS\n\n/parenleft.caseMANAGERS & LEADER UNITS/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWORKSHOPS /parenleft.caseSSMARC TEAM/parenright.case\n\n6\n\nAs a result of the 2020 annual risk assessment, the most exposed risks were determined to be:\n\n- \u00b7 The risk of 'Potential actions by the Government' is assessed as the main risk for the Company, exacerbated by recent decisions of the current government such as: (a) the dissolution of the Undersecretariat of Mines of the Secretariat of the Economy; (b) the implementation of policies that support the emission of coal into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies; (c) the restriction on the granting of new mining concessions; (d) the elimination of outsourcing of labour law; and (e) the beginning of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or TMEC) with new labour dispositions.\n- \u00b7 While the price of gold and silver has remained strong despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic crisis in the world, and especially in Mexico, is a high risk that\n\n## MANAGING OUR RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## CONTINUED\n\n- The Risk Department narrowed down our 109 risks into major risks which are monitored by executive management and the Audit Committee.

It also created the National Guard, mostly comprising military personnel, with the aim of combating organised crime and drug cartels. Unfortunately, state or local police in most states are unprepared and ill-equipped to combat organised crime, have low wages and are sometimes infiltrated by crime.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 Increased presence of organised crime in the vicinity of the mining units.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the number of high impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping, extortion) in the regions of the mining units.\n- \u00b7 Consumption and sale of drugs at the mining units.\n- \u00b7 Roadblocks or blockages on the roads and/or highways near the mining units.\n- \u00b7 The Mexican State of Sonora is notorious for being under constant attack from organised crime gangs. Several attacks have taken place recently jeopardising the continuity of mining operations and the physical integrity of workers employed by Minera Penmont.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe closely monitor the security situation, maintaining clear internal communications and coordinating work in areas of greater insecurity. We have adopted the following practices to manage our security risks and prevent and address potential incidents:\n\n- \u00b7 We maintain close relations with authorities at the federal, state and local levels, including army camps located near most of our operations. We also communicate with the newly created National Guard.\n- \u00b7 We continue to implement greater technological and physical security at our operations, such as the use of a remote monitoring process in Herradura, Noche Buena and San Juli\u00e1n. In the Saucito and Fresnillo mines, in addition to the remote monitoring service, we have also built new local operating and command centres for each business unit. At the Juanicipio development project, we have the necessary infrastructure to provide security services during the mine construction process.

        "page_content": "## RISK DESCRIPTION\n\nFresnillo plc's most valuable asset is its workforce.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has several health risks for employees. The way that mining works (especially underground), where there are several workers in one place, further increases the possibility of contagion. Due to the complex nature of mining operations and the remote locations in which they are often located, it is difficult to implement health measures and carry medical prevention equipment.\n\nClose working conditions at mine sites are placing workers on the frontline in terms of health and safety risks, prompting us to quarantine workers when national lockdown regulations did not force us to do so.\n\nFaced with the risk of contagion from the Covid-19 pandemic threat, we implemented several strategies to protect and preserve the health of employees and contractors in all business units. The close cooperation between our human resources function and our medical team has been fundamental to the application of timely tests and the care of infected personnel.\n\nHowever, the risk of contagion continues and increased in the months of September to December, mainly in the Fresnillo District, where the highest number of cases of contagion across the Company has been detected. This situation is likely to be exacerbated when the new strains of the virus reach Mexico.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 A resurgence of cases in the months of September to December in Mexico maintained the level of risk as very high.\n- \u00b7 Unfortunately, the population does not follow the measures to prevent Covid-19 and that increases the risk of contagion.\n- -Workers in the mining sector have been particularly affected by the pandemic, given the employment architecture of the industry, which can feature remote fly in-fly out or drive in-drive out operations, congested underground working conditions, and workers residing in mine-site compounds or neighbouring communities. These conditions make some Covid-19 preventive measures difficult to implement, which makes mineworkers vulnerable to both acquiring and spreading the virus.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nOur Employee Performance Management System is designed to attract and retain key employees by creating suitable reward and remuneration structures and providing personal development opportunities. We have a talent management system to identify and develop internal candidates for key management positions, as well as identify suitable external candidates where appropriate.\n\nRecruitment: We have evaluated our recruitment requirements for key positions by 2021, and our goal is to meet them through internal training and promotion, and recruitment through:\n\n- \u00b7 Our close relationships with universities that offer earth science programmes. We have programmes dedicated to identifying potential performance-based candidates who can be hired as trainees and/or employees at graduation. We welcomed seven professionals and 18 engineers to our coaching programme during the year.\n- \u00b7 CETEF (Fresnillo Center for Technical Studies), which teaches specific mining operational skills. The five graduates hired in 2020 joined as full-time employees.\n- \u00b7 CETLAR (Centre for Technical Studies of Pe\u00f1oles), which trains mechanical and electrical technicians. The 12 graduates hired in 2020 joined as full-time employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4 - Human resources\n\nUntil such a time that the vaccine is broadly available, and the population becomes immune to Covid-19, this will remain a very high risk to the Fresnillo plc workforce and in general to all humanity.\n\nOur people are critical to meeting our goals. We face multiple risks in the processes of selection, recruitment, training and retention of talented people with technical skills and experience.\n\nObtaining qualified labour in the mining sector has become a major risk. More and more people trained and experienced in mining processes are required. Unfortunately, there are not enough candidates with the required profiles.\n\nDigital and technological innovation has the potential to generate substantial improvements in the productivity, safety and environmental management of the Company. However, to achieve this, in addition to demanding significant investment, different skillsets will be required in the workforce. There is a risk that our workforce will either be unable to transform as needed or will be resistant to change and unwilling to accept the impact of automation or to acquire new technological skills.\n\nThe lack of reliable contractors with sufficient infrastructure, machinery, performance history and trained people is also a risk that could affect our ability to develop and build mining works.\n\n- \u00b7 At some mines we have a lack of specialised personnel to cover working hours.\n- \u00b7 In certain regions where we operate there are not enough candidates with the necessary skills to operate the mining equipment.\n- \u00b7 The Secretary of Labour is suggesting changes to the law aimed at eliminating the outsourcing of personnel. Should this legislation be passed it would complicate our relationship with the contractors who support our mining operations and projects.\n\nOur focus is continuous improvement, powered by opportunities for training, development and personal growth; in brief, we focus on fair recruitment, fair remuneration and benefits, and gender equality. In the trusted staff structure, 15.29% of the population are women, of the new income staff 17% were women, and 17% of the female population were promoted.\n\nIn partnership with the University of Arizona, we developed a fivehour online training module on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for our executives, managers and high potential talent. Around 300 leaders participated in this training, which covered the following topics: defining and addressing Fresnillo's strategy for diversity, equity and inclusion; understanding unconscious bias and different types of diversity; identifying the types of microaggressions; recognising toxic masculinity; and reviewing stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination. The online training included a variety of exercises, case studies and discussions.\n\nIn order to keep our staff up to date and trained, 86% of employees and 98% of unionised staff have been trained this year. Staff with participation in institutional development programmes increased from 37.3% to 46.8%. 80.4% of the organisation's leaders have participated in leadershipfocused institutional development programmes.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

This has led to a complex, rarefied work environment at the Fresnillo mine, with violent clashes between the union and a group of workers seeking to register a new independent union.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIncreased communication with trade union leaders in mining units to monitor the working climate.\n\nMeetings have been held with groups of workers who want to introduce new unions to the Company.\n\nA specialist group in the area of labour relations was formed to meet the demands of dissident workers.\n\nOur strategy is to integrate unionised personnel into each team in the business unit. We achieve this by clearly assigning responsibilities and through programmes aimed at maintaining close relations with trade unions in mines and at the national level.\n\nWe maintain close communication with trade union leaders at various levels of the organisation in order to: raise awareness of the economic situation facing the industry; share our production results; and encourage union participation in our security initiatives and other operational improvements.\n\nThese initiatives include the Security Guardians programmes, certification partnerships, integration of high productivity equipment and family activities.\n\n## COVID/hyphen.case19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough the pandemic did not severely affect this risk, it did slightly complicate the negotiations and delayed some agreements, but with no significant impact.

This sentiment can manifest in the form of opposition of communities to mining operations and increased regulatory obligations for mining companies. Media coverage negative to mining, or specifically to Fresnillo, could impact the granting and maintenance of our social licence in the regions where we have a presence.\n\nWe monitor the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Loss of/threats to our social licence to operate.\n- \u00b7 Failure to identify and manage local concerns and expectations could negatively impact Fresnillo plc.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 Activism by anti-mining advocacy groups and other grassroots organisations increase the risk of social conflicts, fuelling the public perception against mining.\n- \u00b7 Insecurity and access to water are the issues of greatest concern to the populations and community leaders of the regions where we have a presence.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\n- \u00b7 Covid-19 response: We have implemented measures to mitigate the health risks to our workforce, engage authorities constructively and support our communities. Our communication campaigns in the media have emphasised our corporate citizenship activities.\n- \u00b7 Community engagement: We earn and maintain the trust of communities through effective engagement and by being accountable for our impacts. Our community strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, aims to build mutual understanding between our operations and local communities, ensuring that we engage, develop and grow together. Key monitoring and engagement activities include:\n- -Monitoring public opinion within local and international media.\n- -Holding continuous dialogue with our key local stakeholders through formal and informal meetings.\n- -Carrying out social baseline, human rights and perception studies to better understand our positive and negative impacts.\n- -Operating a grievance mechanism to address stakeholder concerns.\n- -Collaborating with peers in the international and Mexican mining community to promote the benefits of the mining industry and responsible mining practices.\n- -Communicating our best practices regarding social and environmental responsibility.\n- \u00b7 Environmental performance: Optimising our use of resources, curbing any negative impact of our activities and being transparent and accountable regarding our environmental footprint are crucial elements of sustainable mining and help us to be positively perceived by communities and regulators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Relations with local communities and stakeholders affect our reputation and our social licence to operate and grow.\n- \u00b7 Neighbouring communities may not provide their support or hinder operations, affecting our social licence.

        "page_content": "## 2020 VIABILITY STATEMENT\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 section 4 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, and taking into account the Group's current position and its principal risks for a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern statement, management prepared a viability analysis which was assessed by the Board for approval.\n\nThe Directors reviewed the viability period and confirmed the suitability of a five-year period to December 2025. This period aligns with the mining industry's typical planning cycle and with the Company's five-year forecast period normally used to evaluate liquidity and contingency plans. It allows us to model capital expenditure and development programmes planned during the timeframe and reflects cash flows generated by the projects currently under development. Due to the long business cycles in our industry, the Directors considered that a shorter time period would be insufficient.\n\nReporting on the Company's viability requires the Directors to consider those principal and emerging risks that could impair the solvency and liquidity of the Company. In order to determine those risks, the Directors robustly assessed the Group-wide principal risks and operation-specific risks by undertaking consultations with executive management, mine managers and other personnel across our operations. These consultations also enabled the Directors to identify low probability, high loss scenarios - 'singular events' - with the potential magnitude to severely impact the solvency and/or liquidity of Fresnillo.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors identified that of our principal and emerging risks, the following have the greatest potential impact:\n\n- i. 'Potential actions by the Government', which could include a delay in obtaining permits and/or new restrictive regulations.\n- ii. 'Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments', specifically volatility in the prices of gold and silver.\n- iii. 'Human resources', specifically the total stoppage of operations for three months for the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- iv. 'Access to land'.\n- v. 'Tailings and environmental incidents'.\n\nFurthermore, the potential effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Company were also considered. This led to a change to last year's scenario five. Instead of modelling the stoppage of operations at one mine following the theft of explosives, we decided to model the stoppage of all our operations resulting from a national lockdown introduced to combat the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis year, we also considered the effects of climate change on the viability scenarios, especially the impact of heavy rains, a water crisis or extreme heat. Our conclusion was that scenarios are not at this stage materially impacted.\n\nHaving determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation compromise the Group's viability, the Directors went on to group together principal risks into the following severe but plausible scenarios, in each case determining the risk proximity (how soon the risk could occur) and velocity (the speed with which the impact of a risk could be felt):\n\nScenario 1: Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments. Our model assumes that prices for gold and silver in 2021 fall to US$1,492 per ounce and US$16.9 per ounce respectively. We further assume that precious metals prices remain at a low level for the following four years of the viability period, varying between US$1,942 - US$1,676 per gold ounce. and US$23.4 - US$21.9 per silver ounce.\n\nTo create an impartial projection for a future low metals prices environment, the Directors used an average of the three lowest forecasts for each year of the assessment, based on consensus estimates published by institutional financial analysts. This environment was deemed to be the most significant risk, and pervasive across the Company. (Principal risk)\n\nScenario 2: Bench collapse at an open pit mine. A landslide occurs covering the lower pit of one of our mines. Due to the unexpected nature of the event, fatalities occur. Production is gradually ramped back up and re-established to full capacity. (Singular event)\n\nScenario 3: Tailings deposit breach at a mine. A tailings deposit collapses and tailings are released into the surrounding area, causing environmental damage. A fund is created by the Company to be used to remediate and compensate for any damage caused. The investigation into the causes of the event is drawn out and further time is required before all environmental permits are reinstated. As a result, the mine remains closed throughout the viability assessment period. (Principal risk)\n\n## Scenario 4: Flooding at a mine. An\n\nunforeseen fault containing water is cut into, leading to water entering the mine in excess of pumping capacity, thereby halting production at one of the mine's main areas. The ramp-up to pre-event production levels commences once management determines that it is safe to do so. (Singular event)\n\nScenario 5: Covid-19 pandemic. Due to the rapid increase in cases of Covid-19 infection, the Federal Health Authority orders an urgent mandatory quarantine throughout the country. All economic activities, including mining, are suspended for three months. Fresnillo immediately ceases all of its operations, maintaining only the necessary levels of preventative maintenance. The union and contractors remove their staff from the Company's mines and projects. Payment of fixed costs such as labour, insurance and critical maintenance inputs continues. (Principal risk)\n\n## Scenario 6: Access to land at a mine.\n\nConflicts with local communities arise and result in the Company having to cease operations until negotiations can be finalised and the land can be reoccupied. (Principal risk)\n\nScenario 7: The removal of concessions by the Government at a mine. Congress approves a new law enabling the Ministry of Economics to withdraw a concession. It is determined that a negative social impact took place following the rupturing of a cyanide tank, leading to the poisoning of the surrounding community. The Government withdraws all permits and mining concessions relating to the mine, with no intention of reinstating them in the future. This leads to the permanent closure of the mine for the duration of the viability period, while mitigating actions are undertaken. (Principal risk)\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios above are extremely severe in order to create outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. However, multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences. Should any of these scenarios take place, various options are available to the Company in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue in operation, including the deferral of capital and/ or exploration expenditure. When quantifying the expected financial impact and remediation time required for each of these risks, management performed benchmarking against the Group's own experience and against publicly available information on relevant, comparable incidents in the mining industry.",

It's important to note that all the scenarios assume that the outstanding portion of the 2023 Notes (US$317.8 million) are paid when they fall due.\n\nAll scenarios were first evaluated using metals prices based on average analyst consensus. No mitigations were necessary and it was decided that there was no threat to the viability of the Company. To create a more stringent test and further challenge the resilience of the Group, all scenarios were then overlaid with scenario one, (low metals prices) and then re-evaluated.\n\nWhen these scenarios were re-modelled, none led to an extremely low or negative cash balance because the strong cash and other liquid funds balance at the end of 2020\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic Review on pages 01-135. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review in pages 66-77. In addition, Note 30 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2022 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as at 31 December 2020 (US$1,070.4 million) and the restructuring of debt during the period, as described in the Financial Review. In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US$18.70 and US$1,725 respectively throughout this period, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure and only considering projects approved by the Executive Committee. This resulted in our current cash and cash equivalents balances reducing over time but maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period.\n\nAs a reverse stress test to assess the Group's resilience to commodity price\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n(US$1,070.4 million) positions Fresnillo plc in a healthy financial situation. In addition, metals prices contribute to the preservation of a positive cash balance position through the scenarios assessed.\n\nThe lowest cash balance level was identified in scenario number three, in combination with the low metals prices scenario. However, even in this scenario a positive cash balance would be maintained throughout the viability period, with a minimum level of US$628 million during the fourth year (2024), meaning that mitigating actions would not be required.\n\nRisk management and internal control systems are in place throughout the Group. The internal control systems enable the Directors to monitor key variables that have the ability to impact the liquidity and solvency of the Group. We are confident that management is able to sufficiently mitigate any situations as they might occur.\n\n## Going Concern\n\ndecreases. The Directors have further calculated prices (US$14.30 and US$1,141 for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2022 would result in cash and cash equivalents balances decreasing to minimal levels required to enable operations to continue without a strain on creditor payments during the going concern assessment period, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metals prices remain below these prices for an extended period, management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. Management could also amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nAdditionally, in the current period the Directors reviewed scenarios that incorporated an estimated potential impact of severe but plausible Covid-19 restrictions consistent with scenario five of our viability assessment (Covid Overlay).\n\nBased on what we know today, we consider the risk of a government-imposed full stoppage across all our operations to be low. To date, only the Penmont mines were subject to temporary, state-imposed restrictions in April and May. Mining was subsequently declared an essential activity by the Federal Government, all restrictions were lifted and there have been no further stoppages at any of our mines. Furthermore, we have implemented additional health and safety measures at each of our\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our risk mitigation and control measures include a Crisis Committee, while the Board would also be briefed and convened as necessary, in order to respond to events as they develop. At each level of our organisation, we have appointed dedicated personnel responsible for media management and engaging with authorities and other stakeholders, depending on the magnitude of the crisis.\n\nBased on the results of this robust analysis and having considered the established controls for the risks and the available mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period of their detailed assessment. This longer-term assessment process supports the Directors' statements on both viability, as set out above, and going concern.\n\nmines coupled with extensive targeted and random testing. This has allowed us to keep infection rates significantly below the Mexican average. We are therefore confident that we are well prepared to manage any localised outbreaks at our mines and maintain operations at planned or near-to-planned levels.\n\nNonetheless, taking into account risk implications of Covid-19 set out in the principal risks section, we assessed the impact on our operations should the Government impose temporary restrictions like those we saw in April and May at Penmont in response to a deteriorating health situation.\n\nThe key judgement applied is the likely time period of restrictions on operations and the time it would take for the subsequent recovery once those restrictions are lifted. The base Covid Overlay scenario assumes that mining operations throughout the Group are suspended for three months, maintaining only the necessary levels of preventative maintenance. Payment of fixed costs such as labour, insurance and critical maintenance inputs continues.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.",

The Board recognises that the medium and long-term sustainability of the Company, including its social licence to operate, is largely linked with value-creation for, and effective engagement with, our stakeholders. Our 'Building Trust' section (pages 22-31 of the Strategic Report) sets out the stakeholder engagement mechanisms that are currently in place; including:\n\n- \u00b7 who the key stakeholders are;\n- \u00b7 why they are important to the Company;\n- \u00b7 how engagement is being conducted;\n- \u00b7 the principal issues that matter to each stakeholder group;\n- \u00b7 the Company's governance activities; and\n- Further information about the Board's approach to engagement with stakeholders is also set out in the 'Board Leadership and Purpose' section of the Governance Report on pages 148-149.\n\nThe Board's Principal Decisions in 2020 were:\n\n- i. Maintain operations as close to normal as possible, implementing preventive measures to prevent Covid-19;\n- ii. Review the Strategic Plan and Annual Budget;\n- iii. Implement a strategy to increase the participation and inclusion of women; and\n- iv. Evaluate the Energy Strategy with the aim of setting decarbonisation targets and assessing its resilience to the Transition Risks of Climate Change.\n- \u00b7 the actions and outcomes which flow from these engagement mechanisms.\n- The Board considers 'Principal Decisions' to be those decisions which entail significant long-term implications and consequences for the Company and/or its stakeholders to distinguish these from the normal, ordinary course decision-making processes that the Board engages in. These Principal Decisions are discussed in this report. When preparing Board meetings a proforma template identifying the relevant stakeholder considerations has been developed for inclusion in the Board papers which accompany any discussions, which due to their strategic nature, should include specific documented consideration of Section 172 stakeholder interests when they are discussed.\n\nApproved by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2021.\n\n## Examples of Principal Decisions\n\n| Decision:                   | Maintain operations as close to normal as possible, implementing preventive measures to prevent  Covid-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Maintain operations as close to normal as possible, implementing preventive measures to prevent  Covid-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Context                     | Covid-19 started as a public health challenge but rapidly turned into an unprecedented social and economic crisis.

Preserving jobs was essential to mitigate the social hardship of the economic crisis in the regions where  the Company operates. Moreover, preserving the workforce ensures the capacity to execute the business  strategy. Therefore, work arrangements required an effective response to the different levels of exposure  (contact with people) and vulnerability (age and pre-existing conditions) of the workforce. Union  leadership and contractors were identified as key partners to effectively adopt preventive measures   to protect the workplace. Working in remote locations may increase the risks of spreading Covid-19 in  communities that are often underserved by public health authorities. Raising awareness and training   our workforce on the preventive protocol was essential to minimise the risks in remote communities. |\n|                             | Community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Company recognised that the Covid-19 crisis would raise the social expectations on corporate  citizenship and community engagement. In addition, the Company was aware of its significant role   in the regional economies, most notably in remote communities. Workforce and community factors   are interrelated as three-quarters of the workforce come from the regions where the Company  operates. Furthermore, communities participate in the value chain through service and procurement  opportunities. It was critical to preserve the ability to co-create value with our communities. Remote  communities could perceive the Company's workforce as a source of risk of Covid-19. Engagement   on the preventive measures implemented by the Company and cooperation with communities were  essential to develop effective partnerships in communities.                                                                               |\n|                             | Government   and regulators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Constructive engagement with the Mexican Government was crucial to recognise mining and its   value chain as essential activities. Collaboration was necessary to agree with regulators an effective  preventive protocol to prevent Covid-19 in the workplace. There was low public access to Covid-19  testing in Mexico and scarce contact tracing, which meant the Company would need to implement   its own testing and contact tracing system. Cooperation and support to the public health sector was  strategic to improve service in the communities where the Company operates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The physical risks are  related to the rise of temperature, rainfall patterns and extreme events (hurricanes, floods, droughts, etc.). Transitional risks  are expected to occur when moving towards a low-carbon economy. In 2020, the HSECR Committee decided to evaluate  the Company's resilience to transitional risks, hence dedicating resources to assess the robustness of the Energy Strategy  with the aim being to set targets. Physical risks will be further explored by the HSECR Committee in 2021.                                                                                    |\n| Stakeholder  considerations                 | the expected production of the operations and projects under the Strategic Plan. The carbon footprint was evaluated  considering the decarbonisation opportunities underway; namely, wind electricity and dual (diesel-LNG) trucks in the   open pit mine of Herradura.  Society Public concern about climate change has increased significantly and is expected to continue growing  over time. Recent natural disasters around the world have raised awareness of the physical impacts   of climate change and the urgency to act.

        "page_content": "STRATEGIC REPORT\n\n## Dear shareholder,\n\nFor many people in Mexico and the UK, 2020 has been an unprecedented year where resilience and resolve have been put to the test. In my introductory letter to the 2020 Annual Report on pages 04 to 07, I comment on Fresnillo's overall business performance during the past 12 months. In this letter, I would like to comment briefly on the work of the Board and its Committees.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Board approved our statement of Purpose: Our Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold . The validity of our Purpose statement was tested by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 and I firmly believe that our actions throughout the pandemic have demonstrated the truth of that statement in practice. In this Governance Report, we describe how our governance approach moved to a more tactical and operational focus during the first weeks and months of the pandemic, led by our Executive Committee alongside myself, our Deputy Chairman and my colleagues within the BAL Group, as we sought to ensure that our workforce could continue to work healthily and safely and the communities in which we operate were protected and supported. My colleagues and I made sure that we communicated regularly with our workforce and we were active in discussions with government over the importance of keeping Mexican mining safely operational as an essential industry. Our independent Non-executive Directors were hugely supportive of these efforts even to the extent of joining in with the Chairman's proposal to reduce his fees in solidarity during the early stages of the pandemic. All of these efforts, combined with favourable metals prices, have enabled us to record a relatively strong financial performance in 2020 whilst remaining true to the culture and values which support our Purpose.\n\nOn a personal level, I was deeply shocked and saddened by the passing of Luis Robles, one of our independent Non-executive Directors, in November 2020. Luis had been a member of the Board and our Audit and Remuneration Committees since the 2019 AGM and we had benefitted from his wisdom and counsel greatly during that period. That he should have been taken from us so suddenly is a tragic loss. His family continue to remain in our thoughts.\n\nIn February 2020, Jaime Lomel\u00edn retired as a Director, having served on the Board since the IPO, initially as our Chief Executive Officer and, since 2012, as a Non-executive Director. Jaime's deep knowledge of Mexican mining has been a valuable asset in our Boardroom and I am delighted that he will continue to be available to advise me and the Board.\n\nOn a more positive note, I was delighted to welcome Guadalupe de la Vega to the Board as an independent Non-executive Director following our 2020 AGM. In line with our policy, Guadalupe's appointment was firmly decided on the basis of merit. Guadalupe brings a huge amount of Mexican business and commercial experience to the Board as well as a significant commitment to community activities that will further add to the Board's ability to focus on our Purpose. Guadalupe's appointment brings the number of female members on the Board to four, thus representing more than 33% of the Board membership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWhilst the gender diversity of the Board is important, we remain conscious of the importance of promoting gender diversity throughout the Fresnillo business. We devoted time at our April meeting to this topic and we have now approved a significant programme of activity (which is described in more detail on pages 86 to 87) to enhance the contribution of women to the success of Fresnillo while having a positive impact on the women we employ. To give more focus on this initiative, I am delighted that Georgina Kessel, one of our independent Non-executive Directors, has joined our HSECR Committee as a diversity champion.\n\nWith the Board's support, we were able to approve some sound financial decisions during the year as a result of which, we are entering 2021 in a strong cash position having improved our long-term debt position through the successful US$850 million Senior Notes Offering in October 2020 whilst maintaining our dividend policy during the year. We believe that such proactivity has contributed to the long-term sustainability of our finances.\n\nTowards the end of 2020, Lintstock LLP provided external facilitation for our 2020 Board and Committee effectiveness reviews. Questionnaires were completed by all of the Directors and these were followed up with one-to-one interviews conducted by the Lintstock team. As part of this exercise, we considered how we as a Board have performed during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as reviewing our performance in the usual areas of Board and Committee governance. I am pleased that the overall findings from the review were firmly positive although, as ever, we are keen to learn and improve as a Board. Further details of this exercise are set out on page 152 of this report.\n\nWe were disappointed that UK restrictions on gatherings of more than two people resulted in the 2020 AGM being held as a closed meeting. We hope that we will be able to resume our usual format for the 2021 AGM although the situation currently remains unclear. Irrespective of whether or not that will be possible, my colleagues and I continue to welcome engagement with shareholders on our corporate governance arrangements and colleagues in our London office continue to be available to facilitate such dialogue (contact details are set out on page 270).\n\nYours faithfully\n\nMr Alberto Baill\u00e8res Chairman of the Board\n\n1 March 2021",

        "page_content": "## The Board's leadership role\n\nWhilst Fresnillo's approach to governance reflects many of the usual characteristics of a FTSE 100 company, it is also particularly influenced by four key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Ownership: It benefits from the common umbrella and shared resources with other companies within the BAL Group of companies.\n- \u00b7 Geography: It primarily operates within Mexico.\n- \u00b7 Board: Its fully non-executive Board of Directors supported by the executive team.\n- \u00b7 Investors: Its listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAs a result of these contextual factors, the leadership provided to Fresnillo plc by the Board is essentially strategic and supervisory in nature.\n\n## The leadership role of Fresnillo plc Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe leadership and management of the Company's day-to-day operations is the responsibility of the Executive Committee (comprising the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer). The non-independent non-executive members of the Board (Pe\u00f1oles-appointed Directors) maintain regular contact with the Executive Committee to challenge and/or support as appropriate.\n\nThis creates two levels of oversight for the senior management team, initially from the non-independent Non-executive Directors, and then from the Board as a whole, including the independent Non-executive Directors.\n\nThe Board sets the corporate values underpinning the culture by which the Group will continue to operate. The Board also supervises the management of the Group's activities, including the implementation of both the Group's long-term plans and commercial strategy. It also provides the governance framework within which the Executive Committee operates. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes major expenditure, investments and key policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe key elements of the Board's programme of activity are therefore:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring the alignment of the Company's activity with its Purpose, culture and values.\n- \u00b7 Setting the direction of strategy.\n- \u00b7 Approval of business plans, budgets and major capex decisions.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of stakeholder relationships.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring operational and financial performance.\n- \u00b7 The governance of risk.\n\nThe Audit, Nominations, HSECR and Remuneration Committees, each chaired by a Board member, support the Board by providing more detailed reviews of elements of the programme where additional time and attention is appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE",

Such initiatives and decisions were tactical in nature and did not need the formal approval of the Board; however, it was important for the Board to demonstrate its leadership of the Company during this period.

Guadalupe de la Vega was appointed a member of the Remuneration Committee on 1 March 2021.\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code states that the Remuneration Committee should be made up of independent Non-executive Directors. The membership of the Committee is made up of Non-executive Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 An understanding of shareholder expectations;\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations of investors on the London Stock Exchange; and\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Charles Jacobs has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since his appointment to the Board in 2014. Although Mr Baill\u00e8res was non-independent at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore his membership of the Remuneration Committee does not comply with provision 32 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code), the Board has determined that Mr Baill\u00e8res' experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations justifies his membership of that Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about the work of the Remuneration Committee during 2020 See pages 168 to 182 in the Remuneration Committee Report\n\n## HSECR Committee\n\n| Members as at 31 December 2020           | Attendance   | Meetings in 2020   | Other contributors      |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez  (Chair)                | 4/4          | February           | Chief Executive Officer |\n| Judith Macgregor                         | 4/4          | April              | Head of Sustainability  |\n| Jaime Lomel\u00edn  (to 26 February 2020)     | 1/1          | July               | Line Managers           |\n| Georgina Kessel  (from 26 February 2020) | 3/3          | October            | Head of Legal           |\n| Fernando Ruiz                            | 4/4          |                    |                         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about the work of the HSECR Committee during 2020 See pages 78 to 79 in the HSECR Committee Report\n\n## Terms of reference\n\nThe terms of reference of all of the Board Committees were reviewed during the year.

        "page_content": "STRATEGIC REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT\n\nAs a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, Fresnillo is required under the FCA Listing Rules to comply with the Code Provisions of the 2018 UK Governance Code (the 'Code') (a copy of which can be found on the website of the Financial Reporting Council www.frc.org.uk) or otherwise explain its reasons for non-compliance. The following statement is therefore made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nFollowing the passing of Luis Robles, an independent Non-executive Director on 19 November 2020, the Company was technically not compliant with Code Provisions 24 and 32 , which require that the Audit and Remuneration Committees consist of three or more independent Non-executive Directors. As a result of Mr Robles' passing, both Committees were reduced to two members. On 1 March 2021, Ms Georgina Kessel, an independent Non-executive Director, was appointed a member of the Audit Committee and Ms Guadalupe de la Vega, another independent Non-executive Director, was appointed a member of the Remuneration Committee, thus restoring the membership of both these Committees to three members.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2020 other than as set out below, the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code, save in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Code Provisions 9 and 19, which provide: (i) that 'the chair should be independent on appointment'; and (ii) that 'the chair should not remain in post beyond nine years from the date of their first appointment to the board'. Mr Baill\u00e8res was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 149); thus at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. Having been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Group over many years, the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Non-executive Chairman is very important to the continued success of the Company. The Board also considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance rather than detracts from it (as explained further on pages 138 to 139). As a consequence, the Board continues to value and endorse Mr Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company. Given Mr Baill\u00e8res' experience and understanding of Mexican business and its regulatory context, this assessment gains further validity in the continuing political and social environment in Mexico. The size, composition and balance of skills on the Board, including the independence and diversity of the Board and the existence of a senior independent director; and the adequacy of the succession plans were assessed as part of the Board effectiveness review during the year and were considered to be highly satisfactory.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 32, which provides that the Board should establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three independent Nonexecutive Directors. The Chairman of the Company, Alberto Baill\u00e8res, who was not independent at the time of his appointment, is a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board has consistently believed that Mr Baill\u00e8res' experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Baill\u00e8res is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 36, which provides that remuneration schemes should promote long-term holdings by executive directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder interests. The Company's approach to executive remuneration is explained in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 168 to 182. The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because historically it has not been a common form of remuneration in Mexico. The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of our business.\n\nInformation about compliance with the Code's Provisions may be found in the following sections of this report:\n\n1.\n\nBoard Leadership and Purpose:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information See pages 148 to 149\n\n- 2.

In February 2020, the Board reviewed and updated the five-year plan for the period 2020 to 2024. The Executive Committee members report on the implementation of strategy at each Board meeting, with particular reference to performance against the published strategic targets.\n\n## Purpose\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. The Purpose statement was approved by the Board in October 2019. As 2020 has progressed, the Board and the executive team have developed their understanding of what the Purpose means in practice as described on pages 08 to 09.\n\n## The Board and culture\n\nThe Corporate Code of Conduct was updated and the new version was approved by the Board in February 2020. The Code of Conduct sets down its cultural expectations for the activities of all Directors, executives, employees and related third parties (including contractors, suppliers and the community) in the conduct of the Company's business. It also helps to ensure a foundation of values and sets standards for behaviour that encourage an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders.\n\nDuring the year, the Board has monitored workforce culture and behaviour in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Feedback on the alignment of the decisions taken during the pandemic with the corporate values was obtained through the 2020 Cultural Assessment undertaken by Ethisphere. The Board considers that progress has been encouraging with the Company's culture quotient improving since 2016 and outperforming the relevant benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 Regular reviews of whistleblowing reports and actions taken by management in response to issues raised via that medium (see page 84 for a further summary of whistleblower hotline claims during the year). During the year, the Board (and Audit Committee) received reports on the roll-out of the anti-harassment protocol.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring progress with the diversity and inclusion programme and the approval of initiatives in relation to gender diversity in April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Updates on the 'I Care, We Care' safety strategy (including elements designed to change behaviours and create a more mature and resilient safety culture). The Board receives and considers updates on health and safety performance at every Board meeting, in particular, information analysing serious injuries and fatalities, Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and new cases of occupational disease. These metrics have been used to monitor the progress made in improving the health and safety culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about culture and workforce engagement See pages 10 to 13\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Whistleblower hotline\n\nThe whistleblower hotline can be used by anyone who wishes to raise concerns, in confidence, about the Company's operations. The hotline is used by employees, contractors and, occasionally, other stakeholders such as suppliers and local communities. The use of the Company's whistleblower arrangements is monitored quarterly by the Audit Committee (see the Audit Committee Report on page 162). The Audit Committee reviews updates on management responses to calls made to the whistleblower line and reports to the Board twice a year on the operation of the whistleblower hotline. The Board received such reports at its meetings in April 2020 (in relation to 2H, 2019) and July 2020 (in relation to 1H, 2020). In 2020, the Audit Committee and Board have monitored the reporting of incidences of harassment following the commencement of the anti-harassment protocol.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all stakeholder relationships and its members report to the Board on the key metrics and initiatives. The Board, either directly or through its Committees, engages or oversees engagement with the Company's stakeholders through a number of governance activities (which are described in more detail, along with further information about the Company's engagement with key stakeholders in the stakeholder table on pages 28 to 31).\n\nDuring 2020, one impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was to bring some of the non-executive members of the Board more closely into the engagement with key stakeholders, as described in the Our Approach to Governance section on page 138. In particular, there was more frequent communication with employees from the Chairman via weekly newsletters and feedback provided to management and the Board through employee surveys which focused on attitudes towards the health, safety and wellbeing initiatives taken by the Company to facilitate safe working during the pandemic. On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee monitored the outcomes (efficiency) of the Company's prevention strategy: cases, rapid testing, contact tracing and isolation, etc., and challenged management concerning key elements of their response such as the protection of the most vulnerable groups and employee communications. The Chairman and Chairman of the HSECR Committee led the Company's successful engagement with the Federal Government over the importance of keeping Mexican mining safely operational as an essential industry.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe Group's workforce consists of employees (unionised and nonunionised) and contractors. Further information on our workforce may be found in the 'Our people' section on pages 86 to 87.",

        "page_content": "Engagement with the workforce takes place through direct communication and surveys within which the management team take the primary role. During the year, the Board has focused on workforce engagement in the context of its responses to the pandemic (see pages 12 to 13). This has delayed the development of the normal communication and feedback mechanisms within the workforce engagement model. Nevertheless, several new steps were taken in 2020 including a new diversity, equity and inclusion initiative, a programme covering the entire workforce to prevent and address harassment and also an engagement initiative with the workforce in relation to the pandemic. The 'I Care, We Care' programme was implemented at all of the Group's operations, covering the entire workforce (unionised and contractors).\n\nMr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Director responsible for workforce engagement. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez intends to undertake two engagement meetings with members of the workforce each year. In 2020, it was not possible to hold such sessions due to the pandemic; however, it is anticipated that these meetings will commence as soon as the prevailing rules and conditions allow.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nThe Company invests in its employees through training and development programmes and healthcare and wellbeing programmes. Following the onset of the pandemic, the Company invested in state-of-the-art equipment to monitor employees' and contractors' health, including infrared thermometers, thermographic cameras and Covid-19 rapid tests. All personnel continued to receive full salaries and benefits. Mine managers were all provided with Covid-19 training from the Mexican Federal Social Security Institute and free health and wellbeing programmes were provided for miners and their families. Further details are provided on page 90.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nThe Board monitors the views of the Company's minority shareholders through reports on investor and analyst communications prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, which are included in the papers for each Board meeting. Such reports identify issues raised by investors during meetings with management during the previous quarter.\n\nOrdinarily, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with analysts, hold conference calls after quarterly production reports and engage with shareholders by participating in the major roadshows in London and other key financial centres, after preliminary and half-yearly results are announced. In 2020, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, such face-to-face meetings have not been possible and were replaced with video-conferencing calls. Similarly, it was not possible to hold an open meeting for the 2020 Annual General Meeting due to Covid-19-related restrictions. Shareholders were provided with an opportunity to submit questions to the Board via a dedicated email address ahead of the AGM. No questions were submitted. Following the Company's announcement that it had hedged 7% of the Company's 2021 silver production to limit downside risk while retaining significant upside exposure to future silver price increases, the Chief Financial Officer held a series of meetings with investors concerning their appetite for additional limited hedging if it continued to be opportunistic and selective allowing investors to benefit as much as possible from potential increases in the price of silver. Taking account of this feedback, the Board agreed to a change to the current Company hedging policy to allow opportunistic/selective hedging for up to a maximum of 20% of production (gold and silver), with a duration of not more than a year and subject to spreads where the ceiling is high enough that investors would still be able to participate in a substantial increase in the price.\n\nThe Head of Investor Relations in London is responsible for maintaining existing relations with analysts and major shareholders on a day-to-day basis, which is done by way of telephone calls and, outside of Covid-19 restrictions, meetings in London. Contact with investors in Mexico is maintained through the Investor Relations Office in Mexico City. The Senior Independent Director, who is based in London, is available to speak with shareholders concerning specific corporate governance questions as and when they arise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Board and sustainability\n\nIn 2020, the Board focused on two particular areas of environmental risk both through direct reports at its July meeting and through regular updates provided by the Chairman of the HSECR Committee. In relation to tailings storage facilities (TSFs), the Board reviewed the programme of work that has been supervised by the Independent Tailings Review Panel set up to ensure that Fresnillo's TSFs are managed in accordance with international standards of operational and governance practice.\n\nIn relation to climate risk, the Board received and reviewed a presentation on Fresnillo's science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change. This included the proposed strategy for setting a decarbonisation path in line with the 2\u00b0C scenario of the Paris Agreement within the 2020-2030 timeframe. The HSECR Committee discussed an updated presentation in October 2020.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Group requires that Directors complete a 'Director's List' which sets out details of situations where each Director's interest may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director has resubmitted their list as at 31 December 2020 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the resubmitted lists. At the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board. Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 166.\n\n## Relationship agreement\n\nPe\u00f1oles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the 'Relationship Agreement') to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group are conducted at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. Messrs Alberto Baill\u00e8res, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, Juan Bordes and Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez have been appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. The independent Non-executive Directors annually review the good standing of the Relationship Agreement (with the most recent review being undertaken in February 2021) and they are satisfied that the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2020. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2020 by Pe\u00f1oles and/or any of its associates.\n\nPe\u00f1oles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a 'related party transaction' (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Pe\u00f1oles Group.\n\n## Director concerns\n\nDirectors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings, and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. The Board has also established a procedure which enables Directors, in relevant circumstances, to obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "## Roles\n\nThe composition of the Board is structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making processes of the Board. The Board is led by the Chairman with support from the Deputy Chairman. The Board as a whole currently consists of five nonindependent Non-executive Directors and six independent Nonexecutive Directors. It is anticipated that a seventh independent Non-executive Director will be appointed during 2021. One of the independent Non-executive Directors is designated as the Senior Independent Director. The Executive Committee provides operational leadership to the Group and is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The respective responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director are set down in a written statement which was updated in October 2019.\n\n## Chairman's independence\n\nThe Chairman, Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res, is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company's controlling shareholder. Mr Baill\u00e8res is also the Chairman of Pe\u00f1oles and other companies within the BAL Group. Mr Baill\u00e8res has been the Chairman of the Company since 2008. Mr Baill\u00e8res was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 149), thus at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. Having been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Group over many years, the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Non-executive Chairman is very important to the continued success of the Company. The Board also considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance rather than detracts from it (as explained further on pages 138 to 139). As a consequence of this, the Board continues to value and endorse Mr Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company. Given Mr Baill\u00e8res' experience and understanding of Mexican business and its regulatory context, this assessment gains further validity in the continuing political and social environment in Mexico. Notwithstanding the expectations of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'), the Board does not expect to change this assessment for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement continues to provide a foundation for a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Baill\u00e8res' leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of any companies with which he is connected. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arm's length and on competitive commercial terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information regarding the Relationship Agreement See page 149\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board considers the following Directors to be independent: Charles Jacobs, B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera, Georgina Kessel, Dame Judith Macgregor, Alberto Tiburcio and Guadalupe de la Vega. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, has assessed each of these Directors by reference to the criteria set out in provision 10 of the Code and the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent in character and judgement. In making this assessment for Mr Alberto Tiburcio, the Board notes that he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S.C., the Mexican firm of EY, the Company's auditors, until June 2013 and that he was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to that date. Mr Tiburcio is an independent non-executive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Grupo Palacio de Hierro, S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. He is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo. The Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio's position as an independent Nonexecutive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. The Board also considers that Mr Tiburcio's experience in Mexican and international business and his experience and knowledge of Mexican and international accounting and audit practice and corporate governance are particularly valuable to the Board and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nCharles Jacobs is the Senior Independent Director. In February 2020, Mr Jacobs convened a meeting of the independent Non-executive Directors to evaluate the performance of the Chairman and to assess the good standing of the Relationship Agreement. The independent Non-executive Directors were satisfied that there were no issues or concerns in respect of either matter. Mr Jacobs provided feedback to the Chairman on those discussions.\n\n## Time commitment and overboarding\n\nAll Directors pre-clear any proposed appointments to listed company boards with the Chairman, prior to committing to them, and such appointments are ratified by the Board at the next possible meeting. None of the Directors took on any significant new additional external appointments in the year.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The Nominations Committee is satisfied that all of the Directors, but particularly the non-independent Non-executive Directors, spend considerably more than this amount of time on Board and Committee activity. During 2020, as indicated on page 139, the non-independent Directors devoted additional time to support the Executive Committee in coordinating the Company's response to the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "STRATEGIC REPORT\n\nThe Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments to ensure that all Board members continue to be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the Company's business. Its philosophy in doing so, is to consider the total workload of each Non-executive Director and the particular value that each Director brings to the Board. In making this assessment, the Nominations Committee takes into account the following factors:\n\n- 1. As a single-product company with operations primarily in just one country, and because of the relative commonality of the Company's activities, the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings a year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively low fees that the Company pays its Non-executive Directors.\n- 2. This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company. This comes by virtue of it also being a member of the BAL Group. The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with the other meetings of companies, including listed companies, within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards.\n\nThe other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc Directors is set out on pages 142 to 145 of this report. The Board and Committee attendance record of each of the Directors during 2020 is set out on page 140 of this report.\n\nIn addition, during 2020 the Nominations Committee specifically considered the issue of overboarding and time commitment in relation to the external listed appointments of Fernando Ruiz and noted that for the whole of his time on the Fresnillo Board, Mr Ruiz has held many other listed company directorships. These directorships are mainly on the boards of listed Mexican companies which are considered less time consuming because of the size of their boards and the frequency of their meetings. Mr Ruiz's attendance record at Fresnillo Board and Committee meetings has always been solid and has never been a matter of concern to the Nominations Committee or the Board. Of greater importance to the Nominations Committee is the value to the Board of Mr Ruiz's advice and expertise, particularly in the area of tax and government fiscal policy. The Board are keen that Mr Ruiz continues to remain a member of the Board, albeit given his length of service on the Board, he is no longer considered to be an independent Director.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- Prior to her appointment to the Board, the other interests of Guadalupe de la Vega were considered and it was noted by the Nominations Committee that she does not hold any other listed company directorships.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal are matters reserved for the Board) are also available to the Directors. During 2020, the Board considered a succession plan for the position of Company Secretary in anticipation of the phased retirement from company secretarial duties of Chris Stamp of Prism Cosec Ltd. In February 2020, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board approved the appointment of Gerardo Carreto as Assistant Secretary to assist the transition process. He has bachelor's and master's degrees in law and more than 20 years of professional experience in the fields of law, compliance and corporate governance. On 28 October 2020, Gerardo Carreto was appointed Company Secretary. The Company regularly receives advice on UK corporate governance and legal developments from its UK legal and corporate governance advisors.",

The cycle of the Board's evaluations is summarised as follows:\n\n## YEAR 1\n\nExternally facilitated Board evaluation using questionnaires and/or interviews\n\n## YEAR 2\n\nFollow-up on action plan prepared in response to Year 1 evaluation using internally-facilitated questionnaires\n\n## YEAR 3\n\nFocus on outstanding and emerging issues arising from the action plan using internally-facilitated questionnaires\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, Lintstock LLP were invited to undertake effectiveness reviews of the Board and the principle Committees of the Board. The reviews consisted of a combination of survey questionnaires and one-to-one interviews.\n\n## BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW PROCESS IN 2020\n\nREPORT CIRCULATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe overall conclusion from the Board effectiveness reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board of Directors is rated very highly and therefore the recommendations were characterised as points of potential further improvement rather than material changes of approach. Particular areas of Board governance which were commended in the report included: Board composition; stakeholder oversight; Board dynamics; Board support and Committees; the management and focus of meetings; the Board's performance during Covid-19; oversight of strategy; risk management; succession planning; and HR management.\n\nThere were four priorities for change that the Board was encouraged to focus on over the coming year:\n\n- \u00b7 Transitioning back towards a face-to-face business-as-usual working environment (post-pandemic);\n- \u00b7 Improvements to the information flows;\n- \u00b7 Focus on strategic implementation; and\n- \u00b7 Keeping up the positive momentum that has been generated by the HSECR Committee over the past 18 months, continuing to bring a clear focus to all areas within its remit.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe reports on each of the Board Committees prepared as part of the externally-facilitated Board effectiveness review were circulated to the members of each of the Committees in October 2020 and discussed by the Audit, HSECR and Remuneration Committees at their meetings in October 2020 and the Nominations Committee at its meeting in February 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Individual performance reviews\n\nThe output from the externally-facilitated Board effectiveness review included individual reports on the performance of each Director which were subsequently circulated to and discussed with each Director, as necessary, by the Chairman. The independent Non-executive Directors meet annually in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman. These meetings were held in February 2020 and February 2021.\n\nNon-executive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present; the performance of the Executive Committee is discussed during such meetings.\n\n## Board development and induction\n\nSenior management present on the Group's strategic initiatives to provide the Non-executive Directors with more information about the broader context to the Company's activities. In addition, there is a regular distribution of industry briefings on technical, market and sector issues.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to visit the Company's mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group's operations, to meet staff and visit community projects supported by the Group. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible for the Non-executive Directors to make such visits in person.\n\nBriefings by the Company's legal advisers are arranged for all new Directors. In June 2020, such a briefing was given to Guadalupe de la Vega to familiarise her with the duties and responsibilities of a director of a UK listed company and the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Chairman discusses training or development needs with Board members from time to time.\n\nIn November 2020, EY, the Company's auditor, ran a half-day briefing session for Audit Committee members, to which other Board Directors were invited and some of whom attended. The session covered recent developments in corporate governance, regulatory compliance, narrative and financial reporting and internals controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION",

At the 2020 Annual General Meeting, the election of our fourth female Director, Guadalupe de la Vega, was approved by shareholders, bringing the percentage of female members on our Board up to 33% for the first time. Of equal importance was the time that the Board devoted to reviewing the Company's diversity strategy during the year.\n\n## Board changes\n\nGuadalupe de la Vega's appointment to the Board, enables us to benefit from her extensive executive experience in a wide variety of Mexican companies. Her commitment to community activities will bring valuable and useful perspectives to the Board and we have already benefitted from her insightful input at our meetings since she became a Director.\n\nJaime Lomel\u00edn retired from the Board in February 2020 but continues to be available in an advisory capacity allowing us to benefit from his considerable professional experience and knowledge of mining and resources.\n\nIt was with great sadness that we announced the death of Luis Robles, an independent Non-executive Director and member of the Audit and Remuneration Committees in November 2020. In his short time with Fresnillo, Luis made a huge contribution to the Board where he was an outstanding colleague. We will miss his wise counsel, his vast experience, but above all his kindness and friendship. On behalf of the Board, and everyone at Fresnillo, I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy progress\n\nWe continue to recognise and embrace the benefits of having a diverse Board, particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decision-making. We hold fast to the importance of making Board appointments on the basis of merit, but we also take seriously considerations such as background and experience; age; gender; and shareholder perspectives in our reviews of the composition of the Board. We believe that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not an effective approach and therefore we have no specific quotas or targets. Nevertheless, our direction of travel, as far as diversity is concerned, has been a progressive one. Since 2012, half of our Board appointments (five out of ten) have been female and, following the appointment of Guadalupe de la Vega to the Board at the 2020 AGM, our Board composition now meets the target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review.\n\nWith Guadalupe de la Vega's appointment coinciding with the retirement of Jaime Lomelin from the Board in February 2020, we now have established a precedent for having seven independent Non-executive Directors which is the largest number of independent Directors we have ever had on the Board. This adds further diversity of thought and input into our Board discussions.\n\nWith racial inequality and ethnic diversity coming into greater focus in 2020, it is pleasing to note also that in 2020 the Parker Review reported that Fresnillo plc has met its set ethnicity target for FTSE 100 companies. Since our IPO in 2008, the Board has consisted of a mix of Mexican and British Directors which enables the Board to benefit from a sound understanding of both the UK and Mexican cultural contexts of the Company in its decision-making. I believe that the Board's response to the pandemic has demonstrated the benefits of these two different cultural perspectives during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Company-wide gender diversity\n\nIn previous years, we have commented on the challenges of improving the level of female representation below Board-level. At the Nominations Committee meeting in February 2020, we considered a suggestion made by one of our Directors, Ms Georgina Kessel, that the Company adopt the CLIMB framework developed by McKinsey which provides the platform for a comprehensive transformation plan to maximise the potential of women in the Group. The CLIMB framework has given us a better understanding of the systemic barriers to diversity which we need to address. The programme includes a series of initiatives designed to improve the leadership opportunities for women; develop a better human resources infrastructure; adopt and use metrics to improve management; and monitor and promote the right culture and behaviours. The Board subsequently approved this programme at its April 2020 meeting. The programme is strategically important as well as being fair because it is expected to enhance innovation, and improve stakeholder engagement and risk management. To give additional oversight to this initiative, the Nominations Committee recommended and the Board agreed that Ms Kessel should join the HSECR Committee with a view to being a diversity champion on that Committee. Further information on the implementation of this programme is set out on pages 86 to 87 in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn 2020, the Board engaged Lintstock LLP to undertake an externally facilitated review of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and the contributions of individual Directors. A summary of the overall approach adopted and findings arising from this review is set out on page 152 of the Corporate Governance Report. As part of the review, Directors were asked to appraise the effectiveness of contributions of each member of the Board; the size, composition, diversity and balance of skills on the Board; and the adequacy of the succession plans. We were pleased that Lintstock reported favourably on the performance of the Board and, indeed, the Nominations Committee. Their challenges to the Nominations Committee arising from their review were to continue (a) to be proactive in developing the membership of the Board and (b) to devote more attention to succession planning. We will respond to those challenges over the next year.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Nominations Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n## CONTINUED\n\n## Role\n\nThe Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making appointments of new Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Nominations Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates for approval by the Board. Prior to making such recommendations, the Nominations Committee considers the other time commitments and significant external interests of such candidates to ensure that they are able to contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments and Diversity Policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Board's approach to Board appointments. The Board has also approved a Group Diversity Policy. (Full versions of these Policies can be found on the Company's website - www.fresnilloplc.com).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA further explanation of the steps that the Company is taking to promote diversity across its businesses is set out in the Sustainability Report on pages 86 to 87\n\n## Board Appointments Policy\n\nThe Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new appointments to the Board while ensuing that appointments are based on merit. The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with this commitment in mind.\n\nThe criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles.\n- \u00b7 The Company's leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The Company's inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.\n- \u00b7 The specific functions on Board Committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.\n- \u00b7 The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee and the Board Diversity Policy.\n\nThe Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is not considered necessary considering the Company's contacts within Mexico and further afield.",

Companies and their stakeholders have needed to be creative in responding to the pressing challenges caused by it. This has required the careful but quick adjustment of existing processes, prioritising the health and wellbeing of employees and stakeholders, whilst making every effort to maintain financial strength.\n\nFresnillo was no exception. With rigorous safety measures, our mines were able to continue operating for most of the year, although the majority of the office-based employees had to work from home. From an operational perspective, many new or amended controls needed to be put in place from the outset of the pandemic to address the new risk factors. With the assistance of the Risk Manager and Internal Audit, we monitored the impact of this new environment on our financial statements process, including the management of data security. For the same reasons, we also discussed and agreed with the external auditors the appropriate changes in their audit approach.\n\nGiven the challenging circumstances, the Audit Committee placed additional emphasis on the adequacy of the processes and conclusions of key areas of judgement and estimation. These are discussed further in this report, in particular those related to the impairment of long-term assets and the going concern and viability assessments.\n\nDuring the year, we continued to monitor the ongoing implications of the new aspects of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code on our activities and in this report we comment particularly on those aspects that fall within the scope of the Committee. We have also begun to consider the analysis of the significant changes that may be introduced in future years as a result of Kingman and Brydon reviews. To help us in this task, in November 2020 the Audit Committee held a half-day update session which was facilitated by EY and included a review of a wide range of recent developments which are under consideration in the UK. The topics covered included: the impact of the Stewardship Code 2020 on investor priorities and how can corporate boards prepare for change; the UK corporate governance landscape and upcoming regulatory changes; the likely introduction of UK regulation in respect of internal controls on financial reporting; and reporting trends in the context of Fresnillo's Annual Report. This session was attended by Audit Committee members and some other members of the Board, executives from the Finance, Internal Audit, Internal Control, Compliance and Legal areas as well as other executives that work closely with the Committee.\n\nMatters of particular focus for the Audit Committee during the year that merit reference in this year's report, include:\n\n- \u00b7 Tax contingencies: Over the past few years, the Audit Committee has closely monitored the tax contingencies, in particular, the differences generated in prior years regarding the tax treatment of certain investments in mining assets and in the intra-group sales of mining concessions. These items were not explicitly determined by the Mexican tax law and consequently were subject to interpretation. The Audit Committee has received regular reports from management on their discussions with the Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT) the Mexican tax authority concerning these matters.

        "page_content": "STRATEGIC REPORT\n\nchange in government at the end of 2018, this issue was re-examined by the SAT. In the second half of the year, the Company reached an agreement with the SAT by which the Company agreed to settle approximately US$62 million (part of which was compensated with balances owed by the Government), with a profit and loss impact of US$22 million. The Audit Committee reviewed the evidence provided by management and discussed the approach taken to this negotiation prior to recommending to the Board that it was a reasonable outcome for the Company.\n\n- \u00b7 Inventory: The re-estimation of the inventory quantities held in the leaching pads at Herradura was evaluated at the end of 2019 and no adjustment to the estimated recovery rate was required at that stage. During 2020, the Audit Committee continued to review the assessment of the executive team once additional studies and evidence could be completed. In July, the Audit Committee probed the management assessment of the evidence obtained in the first half that suggested that further ore could be recovered from the deposits built up in prior years that were part of the inventory at the end of 2019. Following this discussion, the Audit Committee agreed with the adjustment resulting from that reassessment which was accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate, in accordance with IFRS. The reduction of the per-ounce cost of gold in leaching pads benefitted the 2020 income statement by approximately US$90 million.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and Resources: The Audit Committee reviewed the observations raised by SRK Consulting UK Ltd (SRK) (the Company's independent reserves and resources auditor), in relation the preparation of our 2019 Reserves and Resources statement. SRK were invited to meet with the Audit Committee to discuss the timeliness of the preparation of the statement and the discussion focused on some weaknesses in the supporting documentation provided by the Company to SRK and the delays in their procedures arising from these weaknesses. SRK also explained that these weaknesses had resulted in the downgrading of reserves from proven to probable and, until these are remediated, reserves would remain in this category. The Audit Committee reviewed the remedial action plan prepared by management and the steps already taken in response to SRK's observations. There is more work to do and this will be monitored by the Audit Committee during 2021 but progress to-date has been reasonable and the 2020 report by SRK was delivered in time.\n- \u00b7 Cyber security: IT security and data protection were also subjects that the Committee discussed regularly during the year to ensure that the programmes of activity identified in previous years continue to be implemented on schedule. The Company continues to make progress in this important area and this will be monitored further by the Committee during 2021.\n\nToward the end of the year, an externally-facilitated Audit Committee effectiveness review was conducted by Lintstock. I am pleased to report that the findings were very positive, with the only suggestion being that we should be more efficient in dealing with relatively minor issues of the agenda. In order to keep the Board informed of the Committee's activities on a timely basis, we have continued with the practice adopted at the end of 2018, of circulating our minutes to all Board members as soon as they are available.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- In closing, I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the effort and valuable contributions received from the members of the Committee and from the Company executives who work closely with it, and certainly, for the invaluable support and trust that we have always received from the Board. With profound sadness, I have to mention the passing of Luis Robles in November 2020. He was an outstanding Audit Committee member. His valuable contributions will be missed. I am delighted that Georgina Kessel has been appointed to the Audit Committee. Georgina brings a wide range of skills and experience to the Committee and I am certain that her contributions to the Committee will be hugely valuable over the coming years. Being also a member of the HSECR Committee, it will be extremely helpful to have Georgina's input as the Audit Committee considers climate-related risks in the coming months.\n\nI would also like to thank Chris Stamp, who retired as Secretary of the Audit Committee in October, for his many valuable contributions and support to the Committee for more than ten years, since the Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. We wish him all the best. We welcome Gerardo Carreto who has already taken over as Company Secretary. We wish him every success in his new responsibilities.\n\nThere is no doubt that 2021 will also be a difficult year. It will very much depend on how and when the pandemic is brought under control and the economies of different countries recover from the setbacks experienced in 2020. Despite these difficulties, I am certain that the Audit Committee, backed up by the information and support that it receives from the executive team, is well equipped to continue doing its work effectively.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

To aid the Committee members' understanding of the reported financial results during the year, the Chief Financial Officer updated the Committee on the Group's quarterly financial performance at each of its meetings in February, April, July and October.\n\nThe principal steps taken by the Audit Committee during the past 12 months in relation to its review of the published financial statements were:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the 2020 interim financial statements and 2020 Interim Announcement and consideration of EY's comments on the drafts of these documents;\n- \u00b7 Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2020;\n- \u00b7 Review of the significant judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements (see below); and\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2020 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and recommended for approval, drafts of parent company interim accounts prepared for the periods ended 30 November 2011, 30 June 2012, 30 June 2013, 30 June 2018 and 30 April 2019 in response to a technical breach of Section 838, Companies Act 2006 whereby the Company, having had sufficient distributable reserves and cash available to pay them, had in the past paid certain distributions where relevant accounts had not been filed at Companies House.\n\nDuring 2020, EY provided assurance work in relation to the repurchase of the Fresnillo plc November 2023 5.5% bond and issue of a new 30-year bond ('the Bond Refinancing'). The Audit Committee discussed with EY, their work on the accounting for the Bond Refinancing and associated taxation effects.\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the implications of new accounting standards and other regulatory developments for the Company's financial reporting. In November, at the request of the Audit Committee, EY further supported this work by providing a half-day thematic update for the Audit Committee members (and executives that work closely with the Committee) on the following topics: (i) the impact of the Stewardship Code 2020 on investor priorities and how can corporate boards prepare for change; (ii) the UK corporate governance landscape and upcoming regulatory changes; (iii) the likely introduction of UK regulation in respect of internal controls on financial reporting; and (iv) narrative reporting trends in the context of the Company's 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## Significant judgement areas\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the principal areas of financial statement risk and judgements made in relation to both the interim and full year financial statements, prior to recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval. In many cases, these significant judgement areas were the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these areas of judgement or estimation evolve and new ones may need to be considered while others may become less important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ASSURANCE\n\n## External audit:\n\nOverseeing the work of and the Company's relationship with the External Auditor.\n\n## Internal audit:\n\nOverseeing the work and findings of the Internal Audit.\n\n## RISK AND CONTROLS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED",

In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements are appropriate.\n\n## Related party transactions including revenue recognition (see Note 26 to the financial statements)\n\nAssessment of risk\n\nVariables considered\n\n## Sources of assurance\n\nFresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to Pe\u00f1oles and the broader BAL Group. There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings, otherwise distort the Company's financial position and/or transfer value to Pe\u00f1oles or another BAL company inappropriately. Furthermore, related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the nature and extent of the Company's transactions with related parties and there is a risk that disclosures in the financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nEvery year, the Audit Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders (see the section of this report headed 'Transactions with Related Parties' on pages 232 to 234).\n\nThe Audit Committee considered management reports on the transactions with related parties during the year. In particular, it received confirmation from the Chief Executive Officer on the trading relationship with Met-Mex and the basis on which pricing is determined following an amendment to the process which was adopted in 2019. The 2020 charges were proposed using this same methodology and agreed by the Audit Committee (see the Related Party transactions section on page 166).\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed EY's procedures to ensure that related party transactions are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report, as well as their related conclusions.\n\nInternal Audit routinely review agreements between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee as part of its annual Internal Audit Programme updates. In addition, PwC conducts annual reviews of the price reasonableness of the intercompany transactions each year. In previous years, these reviews have not resulted in any adverse comments thus providing a basis of assurance for the usual approach; however, the PwC 2020 transfer pricing review will not be completed until a later date.\n\n## Re-estimation of quantities in inventory (see Note 14 to the financial statements)\n\nAssessment of the risk\n\nVariables considered\n\nSources of assurance\n\nInventory on leaching pads changes over time as new inventory is added or depleted and new techniques for extracting metal from inventories are developed. Consequently, the estimated future recovery of gold from that inventory may change from year-to-year. The re-estimation of the inventory quantities held in the leaching pads at Herradura was evaluated at the end of 2019 and no adjustment to the estimated recovery rate was required at that stage. The recovery of gold from leaching pad inventories at Herradura was reassessed in 2020 and new evidence obtained from the continuing operation of the old leaching pads (I-XII) indicated that further gold ounces could be recovered from the deposits on those pads.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered a presentation on the reassessment of inventory at Herradura at its July 2020 meeting and monitored the financial impact of this reassessment during the year. It noted management's response to enquiries from EY concerning information supporting the recovery rates from the pads. The data was reviewed again in February 2021 and it was agreed that no further adjustments to the estimated future recovery of gold in the pads were necessary.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed the answers given to EY by the operational management team in response to enquiries concerning this matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREVIEW OF SOURCES OF ASSURANCE\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDISCUSSIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND EY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nCOMMITTEE'S CONCLUSION ON ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE",

If  the financial statements are not adjusted accordingly there is a risk of significant financial misstatement.                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Variables considered                                                                                    | The reserves and resources, prices, costs, discount rates and related mine plans for each business unit  along with management's assessment of impairment indicators were considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Sources of assurance                                                                                    | The Audit Committee noted that the specialist third-party reports on management's estimates of  reserves and resources and management's estimates of recoverable value had been prepared and   then assessed by EY, using specialists where necessary. The Audit Committee also noted the reports  from SRK on reserves and resources and scrutinised the process by which they were prepared to   ensure that improvements made during the year had been properly implemented. Internal Audit   also undertook a review of the process and assurance provided by it during the year. The Audit  Committee further evaluated EY's assessment of the management position on the mines most   at risk and sensitivities performed by EY for alternative metals price and discount rate scenarios. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some aspects of Mexican tax legislation are open to interpretation. Governmental changes in Mexico  also result in personnel and policy changes at the SAT, the government tax authority.  Certain tax assets and liabilities are denominated in Mexican pesos and are revalued in US dollars                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variables considered     | The Audit Committee reviewed the status and potential outcomes of tax audits commenced during  the year and ongoing dialogue concerning a previous agreement reached with the SAT. Further  information is set out in the Stakeholder reporting (Government/Tax Authorities) section below.   The Audit Committee also reviewed reconciling items applied to accounting profit in determining  profit subject to taxation and PTU as set out in papers prepared by management.                                                                                                               |\n| Sources of assurance     | Throughout the year the Audit Committee received updates on the status of tax inspections.   Reviews of tax related matters were also undertaken by Internal Audit. The Audit Committee reviewed  management's supporting memoranda on the consolidation of tax and PTU and sought EY's views on  the same. It ascertained the degree to which judgements and adjustments are supported by internal  and/or external subject matter experts and ensured that they corresponded with information  presented during the year prior to approving the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report. |\n\n## Ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Audit Committee supports the Board in ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. The approach taken by the Board in relation to the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 is described on page 167 of the Corporate Governance Report. Following changes introduced to the Company's procedures in 2019 and early 2020, different sections of the Annual Report were circulated to Board members during early February 2021 to provide time for comments to be passed back to management. In addition, Internal Audit undertook a review of the non-financial reporting (which is extracted from the Company's operational records). In support of this process, prior to deciding whether to recommend them to the Board for approval, the Audit Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and comments discussed with management; and\n- \u00b7 discussed with Internal Audit points arising from their review of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report.\n\n## Stakeholder reporting\n\nThe Audit Committee plays a role in overseeing, on behalf of the Board, some key aspects of the Company's reporting concerning its relationships with key stakeholder groups.\n\nEmployees: The Audit Committee reviewed the work of the Honour Commission in relation to matters raised via the whistleblower line (see following section).\n\nGovernment/Tax Authorities: In particular, the Audit Committee closely monitors the Company's relationship with the SAT, with the status of any outstanding tax audits reviewed at most meetings. During 2020, the Company reached an agreement with the SAT concerning the treatment of certain investments during the period 2013 to 2019 for Income Tax and in Special Mining Right purposes. Two principal tax issues were discussed and agreed with the SAT: (i) the tax treatment of costs associated with mine developments and (ii) the tax treatment of the intra-company purchase and sale of mine concessions. The Company's position on both these issues was well-supported by its tax advisers but was interpreted differently by the SAT leading to further negotiations. These resulted in an agreement that approximately 50% of the investments made during the period 2013 to 2019 should be capitalised for tax purposes with the balance amortised for tax purposes and the balance written off in the year incurred. The Audit Committee also reviewed the reconciliation of tax and PTU and monitored the ongoing dialogue with the Mexican tax authorities on tax matters.\n\nDuring 2020, the Audit Committee reviewed the Company's Payments to Governments data, published in June; and the Company's UK Tax Strategy Statement, published in November.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe 'Fresnillo Plays Fair' whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) violations of the Group's Code of Conduct. The hotline is available for all stakeholders, including employees and third parties, so that any concerns about misconduct or impropriety may be raised and dealt with appropriately. All matters raised via the hotline are processed by an independent third party for review by the Honour Commission (which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer, the Director of Internal Audit, the Vice President of Exploration and the Head of Legal). A summary of the whistleblowing cases, which also includes the decisions of the Honour Commission in relation to each case, is reviewed by the Audit Committee each quarter and the Chairman of the Audit Committee gives a report to the Board every six months on the key trends and steps taken as a result of these reviews.\n\nIn 2020, there were a total of 110 reports (compared to 66 in 2019). The Audit Committee particularly noted the impact of increased training in relation to the Harassment Protocol on whistleblower line calls. In 2020, 97 (88%) of the reports were concluded in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still under investigation. Further details about the whistleblowing reports in 2020 is set out in the Sustainability Report on page 84. During the year, the Audit Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or continue to be properly investigated with appropriate action taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExternal audit\n\n## Relationship with EY\n\nEY was reappointed as the Company's auditor at the 2020 AGM. EY was originally appointed in 2008 and their appointment was re-confirmed in 2016 following a rigorous external audit tender process in 2015/2016. The next tender process is expected to be held no later than 2025. Following completion of the 2019 audit, Steve Dobson took over from Daniel Trotman as the lead Audit Partner. During 2020, the members of the Audit Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none.\n\n## External audit process\n\nThe key steps in the Audit Committee's interactions with EY during the past 12 months were:\n\n- \u00b7 The review of a report from EY providing their observations and opportunities arising from the 2019 audit process and management responses to those observations in April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Discussion with EY of the findings from their review of the interim results for the period ended 30 June 2020.\n- \u00b7 The review of the 2020 half-year representation letter given to EY.\n- \u00b7 The review and approval of the external audit plan, fees and terms of audit engagement.\n- \u00b7 The review of the results of the 'hard close audit' for the ten months to 31 October 2020.\n- \u00b7 The review of the representation letter given to EY for the 2020 full-year audit.\n- \u00b7 The review EY's report following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nCovid-19: In 2020, EY's review of the half-year financial statements and the external audit of the full-year financial statements and 2020 Annual Report were restricted by the Covid-19 pandemic which prevented travel from the UK to Mexico and significantly reduced physical access to the Company's facilities. EY revised their approach to the audit to take account of these physical restrictions. The scope of the audit was also adjusted to place enhanced focus on the going concern disclosures and viability assessment.\n\nQuality, objectiveness and independence of the external auditor: The Audit Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Audit Committee specifically reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. The Audit Committee discussed the quality, objectiveness and independence of the EY team with the management team and was satisfied that there were no concerns in this regard.\n\nNon-audit services policy: The Audit Committee initiated a review of its policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor (the 'Policy') in late 2019 to take account of changes to the FRC's Ethical Standard. This review was completed in early 2020 and amendments to the Policy were approved. The Audit Committee has maintained an ongoing dialogue with EY during the year concerning the services that it provides to the Company and the wider Pe\u00f1oles Group to ensure that where such services are provided, they are in line with the Policy.\n\nThe current policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide a narrow range of permitted services which are closely related to the audit and/or required by law or regulation. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Audit Committee. During 2020, EY provided assurance work in relation to the Bond Refinancing. The cost of such services was US$309,000. EY also provided audit-related assurance services in connection with the review of the interim financial statements (US$821,000). The ratio of fees paid for non-audit work in relation to audit work during the year was 0.49:1.00 (2019: 0.28:1.00). Details of the fees paid to EY during the year are shown in Note 27 to the financial statements.\n\n## Evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit and the auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of EY as its external auditor from two perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of the work of EY's UK practice, as a firm, undertaken by the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Review Team; and\n- \u00b7 Its own assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and the role played by both EY's UK and Mexican teams in the performance of the annual audit.\n\nAudit Quality Review: The Audit Committee reviewed the report of the FRC on its Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm and discussed with the EY Audit Partner whether any of the FRC's findings were relevant to the firm's audit of the Fresnillo financial statements. EY also shared the findings from their own internal quality review with the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The conclusion from these reviews was that there were no major matters of concern to consider.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED",

As part of this process, the Chief Financial Officer and finance team were invited to provide their insights into their interaction with the EY teams during that process. The Committee concluded that EY was generally performing well with an overall consensus being that the working relationship was good.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly monitors the steps taken by EY to ensure that the balance of work between the UK and Mexico is efficient and effective. The implementation of commitments made by EY for improving audit efficiency at the time of their successful tender in 2016 continued to be monitored by the Audit Committee during 2020.\n\n## Reappointment of the external auditor\n\nIn February 2021, taking account of the reviews of the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of the external auditor, EY at the Company's 2021 Annual General Meeting. The reappointment of the auditor will be subject to a review of proposed fees for the 2021 audit in October 2021.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe 2020 Internal Audit Annual Plan was approved by the Audit Committee in October 2019, incorporating audits across all of Fresnillo's business units with a focus on key operational risks. In March 2020, the Internal Audit plan was revised to accommodate the operational restrictions arising from the health and safety measures undertaken at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented the Internal Audit team from visiting the operating units. However, the Internal Audit programme proceeded forward with work being conducted remotely through increased use of technology, data analytics and process documentation. Throughout the remainder of 2020, Internal Audit completed a number of risk reviews along with process and controls assessments focusing on efficiency, productivity, cost management and regulatory compliance. Prior to the pandemic, Internal Audit was able to complete on-site audits of the Saucito and Penmont mines. However, scheduled visits to Fresnillo, San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega had to be suspended. Internal Audit verified the validity, accuracy and completeness of the non-financial information included in the 2019 Annual Report, and reported the results to the Audit Committee.\n\nDue to the ongoing importance of cyber security, and the enormous increase of critical work being performed remotely due to the pandemic, Internal Audit conducted a security assessment of applications and services available through the Internet and Virtual Private Network (VPN). Some risk areas were detected, which were promptly remediated by the Cyber security Office. The Audit Committee continues to review progress made in raising the level of cyber security maturity.\n\nThe Audit Committee is satisfied that monitoring of significant risks was not adversely impacted by this change of approach in the Internal Audit programme as Internal Audit was able to leverage technology, apply data analytical tools and maintain virtual contact with operational personnel.\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nTowards the end of each year, Internal Audit presents the proposed Internal Audit Annual Plan and resourcing requirements for the following year. The 2021 Internal Audit Plan was presented to the Audit Committee and approved in October 2020. The plan was developed according to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and included the following steps: shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_439569301\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Internal Audit plan for 2021 includes planned audits of higher risk areas such as permitting, ongoing capital projects, compliance with community relations plans, compliance with environmental law, reserves and resources, tailings dam management, compliance with safety regulations, taxes, multi-risk compliance processes at mines, regulatory compliance, compliance with health legislation (including Covid-19 procedures), digital effectiveness, cyber security and IT processes.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit and Deputy Director of Internal Audit attended all Audit Committee meetings throughout the year. Members of the Audit Committee meet with the Head of Internal Audit and the Deputy Director, Internal Audit two times a year without management present.\n\nAt each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee also monitored the progress made by management in addressing 'red flag' items (i.e. most serious control weaknesses) identified through Internal Audit work. The Audit Committee's focus is to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate and that timely progress is made in reducing the number of red flags over time.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing Internal Audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to address the points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during the year to review the outstanding Internal Audit points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.\n\nIn December 2020, the Audit Committee also considered the appointment of at Ms Nancy Acosta as Head of Internal Audit with effect from 1 January 2021 following the resignation of Mr Rodolfo G\u00f3mez. This change was made in accordance with the Internal Audit succession plan and the Audit Committee considered Ms Acosta's credentials, knowledge, skills and experience, prior to approving her appointment.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors how the Company's risk management framework is operating. Operational responsibility for risk lies with line management (details of the risk management system are set out on pages 110 to 113). The Audit Committee discusses potential changes to the Group's risk profile through its regular reviews of the Risk Matrix and its consideration of any associated recommendations from management proposing changes to the Risk Matrix to take account of changing and emerging risk.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the review of the Company's risk assessment process, which commenced in 2019, was concluded. As a result, the Audit Committee approved the following definition of emerging risk:\n\nFresnillo plc defines emerging risks as a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, risks that are known to some degree but are not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications to achieve the organisation's Strategic Plan.\n\nThe Emerging Risks were re-evaluated and reprioritised by management and reviewed by the Audit Committee in February 2021. The Principal Risks and Uncertainties are reviewed every six months prior to the publication of both the interim and full-year reports.\n\nDuring the pandemic, a weekly procedure for evaluating and mitigating risks was introduced. In July 2020, the Audit Committee reviewed the Risk Matrix as at 30 June 2020. It was agreed that the Covid-19 pandemic should not be considered as a separate risk category but, rather, its impact should be incorporated into the assessment of changes in other risks. In February 2021, the results of the annual risk assessment process were presented to the Audit Committee and discussed with the Group Risk Manager prior to recommendation to the Board. The review considered the most exposed risks which were determined to be increased risk resulting from potential actions by the government; the continuing risk of global macroeconomic developments and their impact on metals prices and the security risk as a result of increased high-impact crimes in the regions where the Group operates. In addition, it was agreed that climate change should become a Principal Risk (previously an emerging risk); the public perception against mining and relations with the communities close to the mines, explorations and projects risks were amalgamated into a single Principal Risk; and the environmental incidents risk was renamed so as to specifically reflect the importance of tailings dam management.\n\n## Ethical risk\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors ethical risk through regular reviews of progress with the Group's anti-bribery and corruption programme (including regular updates on the completion rates for the online training programmes). This demonstrates that the Group's corporate values and elements of the control culture in relation to ethics remain embedded throughout the organisation. To this end, during the year, the Audit Committee received reports on the roll-out of training in relation to the disclosure of conflicts of interest; the annual assessment of the Code of Conduct; 'Step-Up' Culture; and Harassment.\n\nIn response to the Brydon review in the UK and, in particular, the focus on fraud in its recommendations, the Company widened the evaluation of its fraud risk assessment process, separating it from the annual risk assessment to evaluate the findings, observations and potential areas of opportunity. This evaluation will continue in 2021.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Company's objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company's exposures to market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks; credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in Note 30 to the financial statements. During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the Company's Treasury Policy and concluded that no further changes were required.\n\n## Non-financial risk areas\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly reviews and receives management updates on current issues and developments that could have potential to give rise to specific risks. In this, the Audit Committee is guided by regular updates it received from management on specific issues that it considers should be kept under review. Thus, during 2020, regular reports were received on legal matters (including land titles and litigation) and a review of the Group's compliance with mining licence conditions at each of its business units. Where new potential areas of risk are considered by management as part of their regular reviews of the Risk Matrix, the Audit Committee may request further bespoke updates from management to supplement its general review of risk and internal controls. No new areas of non-financial risk were identified during 2020.\n\n## Information technology\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's IT strategy, its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo management teams in developing the cyber security framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on page 123 of the Strategic Report.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. The Audit Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2021, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group's budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to December 2022, taking into account the Company's anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure, the additional cash inflow resulting from the Bond Refinancing, and the sensitivity of the cash flow forecasts to movements in metal prices, including stress testing those forecasts to identify the levels to which metals prices must fall to put pressure on working capital levels. Recognising the prevailing uncertainties as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of the going concern assessment, an additional scenario test was included to determine the impact of production being stopped for three months as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThe Audit Committee also considered EY's report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements. The Audit Committee also challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation. Following this assessment, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern. The Going Concern Statement is set out in the Strategic Report on page 131.\n\n## Risk and internal control\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n## CONTINUED",

        "page_content": "## Viability assessment\n\nThe executive team has developed a comprehensive approach to the viability assessment which is then reported in the Viability Statement. The key steps of this approach are explained within the Viability Statement, which is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 130 to 131. In December 2020, the Audit Committee received an update on the methodology that the executive team adopted in preparing the Viability Statement. In February 2021, it reviewed the output from that process, including consideration of observations reported by EY, and the proposed Viability Statement itself.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's internal control environment. This monitoring includes oversight of all material controls including financial, operational, regulatory and compliance. To accomplish this, there is a governance and organisational structure in place where internal control is secured by three lines of defence: process owners (1 st line); committees, controllers, risk management and other oversight bodies (2 nd line); and, Internal Audit (3 rd line). During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed each of the quarterly internal control reports which were then circulated to the full Board for its review. At the end of the financial year, the Audit Committee oversaw the annual process for monitoring the Group's system of internal controls. The Audit Committee is directly supported by the work of the Internal Audit team.\n\nThe pandemic impacted the way in which the internal control reviews were carried out, making it impossible to conduct physical reviews of the operating processes at all the mines and main projects due to travel restrictions. However, it was possible to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control by using technology, evaluating electronic information and analysing data from the operations. Accordingly as a result of these reviews, it was concluded that there were no material control weaknesses as a consequence of the pandemic.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, numerous controls were implemented to address new risk factors. Where certain controls had to be suspended temporarily due to health and safety requirements, for example fingerprint entry controls, mitigating controls were implemented as appropriate.\n\nDespite these operational restrictions and complexities caused by the pandemic, Fresnillo plc continued with the implementation of vitally important organisational programmes such as health, safety and initiatives for the monitoring and management of tailings dams.\n\n## Quarterly internal control reports\n\nDuring 2020, the Audit Committee continued to review each of the quarterly internal control reports which were prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically reports on developments in the Key Risk Indicators and the key internal control issues arising from the quarterly Internal Audit reports. From time to time, the Audit Committee has proposed changes to those reports based on its own discussion of Internal Audit's findings.\n\n## Annual review of the system of internal controls\n\nThe Audit Committee's review of the Group's system of internal controls aims to improve the understanding of how the various sources of assurance (mainly the three lines of defence) interact in the review and execution of material controls by identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework. Consequently, once a year, the Audit Committee oversees the review of the Group's system of internal controls through an assessment, conducted by Internal Audit, setting down the various sources of assurance (such as operational management, financial management, executive management and Internal Audit) assess the execution of material controls so as to identify and address any gaps in the control framework. To this end, the Group Risk Manager sends a survey to managers at the business unit to seek their views on elements of entity-level controls. Their findings are compared to the findings from a similar evaluation undertaken by the Internal Audit team. Any discrepancies are analysed and used to identify potential areas for further discussion. This combined approach underpins assessment of the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls. The Audit Committee reviewed the output from this process in February 2021.\n\nNotable control exceptions identified throughout the year were those related to: (i) ensuring that the implementation of the corporate safety ('I Care, We Care') and some environmental (water concessions and tailings dam management) programmes are executed according to EHS best practices; (ii) enhancing procedures for mine closure plans in accordance with international leading practices; (iii) optimising mine planning and contractor performance; (iv) improving procedures for the acquisition of new technologies (specifically those intended to strengthen the safety process); (v) improving the commissioning process to ensure that all systems and components of a new plant or mine are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to mine operational requirements; and vi) improving the process for the reporting of the reserves and resources as discussed later in this section.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and other senior managers were invited to meet with the Audit Committee to discuss their action plans for remediating any issues identified. In 2020, such discussions included a progress review on initiatives to address recommendations made by SRK to improve the governance of the reserves and resources estimation process, with significant progress made during the year.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2021 meeting), reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls. Following this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented, particularly those specifically highlighted in this report, complement Fresnillo's risk management framework and are appropriate to the Group's circumstances. The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

Being part of the same Group provides an opportunity to achieve synergistic operational, financial and administrative benefits by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo. Although these arrangements are beneficial to Fresnillo, the Audit Committee performs a role in overseeing these arrangements to ensure that they continue to operate impartially.\n\nThe principal arrangements entered into between the Company and related parties and reviewed by the Audit Committee during the year were:\n\n| The Met-Mex agreement   | As it does every year, the Audit Committee considered the reasonableness of proposed treatment and  refining charges in respect of the Met-Mex arrangements for 2020. Management circulated a paper  setting out the methodology to determine the charges, which takes industry benchmark charges and  adjusts to reflect ore composition and transport costs. The methodology used in 2020 was consistent   with 2019. The Audit Committee reviewed this paper and recommended approval of the proposed charges  by the independent Directors at the Board meeting in October 2020. As part of its review of the Met-Mex arrangements, the Audit Committee also confirmed with management   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other agreements        | There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage)  which, although not requiring approval by independent Directors, will from time to time be reviewed by the  Audit Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm's length basis. During the year,  the Audit Committee reviewed the annual insurance renewal for which GNP, a related party, acted as broker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\nThe Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles under which 24 categories of services are provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 1 January 2018. Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately one third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by Internal Audit over a three-year cycle. Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on its review of the Shared Services Agreement.\n\nThe following diagram summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related party transactions under the Relationship Agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Process                               | How this is managed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Responsibility                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Monitoring of Directors interests     | If a Director has an interest in a company that could potentially enter into  transactions with a Fresnillo plc Group company, the Board will normally  consider that interest under its arrangements for authorising conflicts of  interest under s175, Companies Act 2006. | Directors                                      |\n| Process                               | How this is managed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Responsibility                                 |\n| Contract negotiation and verification | The best possible commercial terms are negotiated by management  and, where possible, they will seek to verify them against international  benchmarking reports and/or independent valuation or assessment.                                                                  | Fresnillo Executive  Committee and  management |\n| Financial scrutiny                    | Review of the key financial terms of any major transaction which are  verified where possible as to price and quality by external consultants   or independent benchmarking.                                                                                                 | Audit Committee                                |\n| Independent Director approval         | Under the Relationship Agreement and the Listing Rules, the  independent Non-executive Directors must approve any transaction  with the Pe\u00f1oles Group or its associates without the non-independent  Directors voting.                                                       | Independent   Non-executive Directors          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

An explanation of the process adopted in preparing the Annual Report and analysis of the basis upon which each requirement for it to be 'Fair', 'Balanced' and 'Understandable' had been met was summarised in a paper which the Board discussed at its meeting on 24 February 2021. The key features of this process were:\n\n- \u00b7 The narrative sections of the Annual Report were drafted by the members of the team with specific responsibility for the areas referred to in the sections that they prepare. The individuals involved included the Head of Investor Relations, the Head of Risk, the Head of Sustainability, the Compliance Officer, the Head of Legal, the Company Secretary and mine managers.\n- \u00b7 As narrative sections of the Annual Report were prepared, copies were circulated to Board members for review and comment. Such comments were incorporated into updated versions of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 About a month prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors reviewed a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Company's business and the nature and content of discussions at the Board meetings during the year. Comments were received from the Directors on most areas of the Annual Report and these were incorporated into subsequent drafts of the Annual Report. The sections of the Annual Report which were particularly commented on included: the Operations reporting, the Sustainability Report and climate disclosures in particular, the presentation of information on diversity and inclusion and the presentation of health and safety information.\n- \u00b7 Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management were taken into account by management in preparing the final version of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Internal Audit undertook a review exercise of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the Company's operational records and their findings were appropriately reflected.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and decided to recommend them to the Board for approval.\n\nAs a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report which is set out on pages 136 to 167 has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board\n\n## Charles Jacobs\n\nSenior Independent Director 1 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

However, with the unprecedented scenario of the Covid-19 pandemic making this a less straightforward process than we might have anticipated, we have adapted our approach to executive remuneration accordingly. We were, of course, by no means alone in having to react to these new circumstances. In the event, however, the impact of the pandemic on the Company was much more moderate than it could have been. Our operations were, with the exception of a brief disruption to production in the Herradura District, largely uninterrupted and our financial performance was buoyed by reasonably favourable commodity prices. Fresnillo has, therefore, been able to continue operating without the need for short-term financial assistance and we continued to pay dividends in line with our usual policy. As a consequence, our discussions and decisions on remuneration were relatively easy ones to take. Nevertheless, we have been mindful of the need to be fair in our decisions and, above all, we have sought to ensure that the approach to executive remuneration was fairly aligned to the approach to remuneration of our employees.\n\n## Salaries\n\nAt our meeting in April, the first after the onset of the pandemic, we noted that our CEO had agreed to take a temporary pay reduction of 20% and other members of the Executive Committee had agreed to take a pay reduction of 10%. We therefore proposed and it was agreed that all of the Directors should also consider a temporary reduction in their fees of 30%. Once it was clear that the financial performance of the Company for the year would be more robust than we initially feared, the Directors fees and Executive Committee salaries were restored to their pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, we agreed that there should not be any salary increases for the Executive Committee members in 2020 in line with the policy agreed for all non-unionised employees. We believe that this was an equitable approach to take.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Bonus\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviewed the financial and operational outcomes for 2020 and noted that these resulted in a bonus outcome for the Chief Executive Officer equivalent to two and a half months' salary. In view of the performance of the business during 2020, we considered that this was a reasonable outcome and therefore were happy to agree the bonus award without any discretionary adjustment.\n\n## Shareholder approval\n\nWith our approach to executive remuneration being relatively unusual when compared to our peers in the FTSE 100 Index, I am always keen to ensure that we retain strong shareholder support for the Remuneration Committee's work and the Company's approach. It was therefore encouraging that our 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration was approved by almost 98% of the shares voted by our independent shareholders at our 2020 AGM.\n\n## Use of discretion by the Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee did not consider it necessary to use the discretion that it is authorised to exercise, under the Directors Remuneration Policy, in adjusting outcomes under the Annual Bonus Plan. It should be noted, however, that some non-financial targets and outcomes within the KPIs for the Annual Bonus Plan are considered by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of recommendations made by the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Board.\n\n## Committee discussions during 2020\n\nDuring the year, the Remuneration Committee met three times and its discussions and decisions included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs set for 2019 and approval of annual bonus awards for 2019 based on achievement of KPI targets.\n- \u00b7 Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee for 2020.\n- \u00b7 Review of the Non-executive Directors' fees.\n- \u00b7 Review of the external effectiveness review of the Committee undertaken by Lintstock.\n- \u00b7 Review and revision of the terms of reference of the Committee in response to UK regulatory developments.\n\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Luis Robles to the work of the Remuneration Committee during the period from his appointment in 2019 until his passing away in November 2020. We were greatly saddened by his loss and will miss his wisdom and input into the work of the Remuneration Committee. My condolences go to all of Luis' family and friends.\n\nAs ever, I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on our approach to executive remuneration.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Charles Jacobs\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

In particular, the current Policy seeks to take account of the interests of our key stakeholders in the following ways:\n\n## Shareholders\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Baill\u00e8res, who represents almost 75% of the share ownership of the Company sits on the Remuneration Committee, bringing a shareholder perspective to the Committee's discussions.\n- \u00b7 Feedback from major shareholders and proxy voting agencies provided prior to the AGM is considered by the Remuneration Committee in the course of its discussions during the following year.\n\n## Workforce\n\n- \u00b7 Salary reviews for the members of the Executive Committee are decided after taking account of the average salary increases discussed and agreed with the unions.\n- \u00b7 Metrics that promote good employment practices, e.g. appropriate management of health and safety and the relations with unionised employees and contractors, are included in the targets for the Annual Bonus Plan.\n\n## Communities and environment\n\n- \u00b7 Metrics that promote good community relations and sound environmental stewardship are included in the targets for the Annual Bonus Plan.\n\n## Salary\n\nFactors considered in setting salary and workforce engagement on remuneration\n\n## Policy on the consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

These reports benchmarked salaries by reference to peer groups in mining, large companies in Mexico and internationally.\n\nThe Company negotiates salary increases with the unions annually, to take effect from 1 April each year. The agreed rates may also used as the point of reference in setting the annual salary review for the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Executive Committee and non-unionised employees. In view of the financial uncertainties resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, it was agreed that there would not be a salary increase for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee, in line with the wider decision not to award non-unionised employees a salary increase in 2020. Consequently, the salary payable under Mr Alv\u00eddrez's service agreement remains MX$1,020,611 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, Company-paid savings contributions and other cash benefits.\n\n## Policy on the alignment of executive remuneration and the market\n\nA formal review of the Executive Director and Executive Committee members' remuneration is conducted by Willis Towers Watson and will be undertaken at least once every three years. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this Policy.\n\nThe Peer Group will be reviewed at least every three years, and updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive's salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer Group for base salary. In April 2019, Willis Towers Watson reviewed the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration by reference to the Peer Group and confirmed that it remained within these parameters. A further review will be conducted ahead of the next renewal of the Policy in 2022. The Peer Group consists of the following companies.\n\n## Policy benchmarking Peer Group\n\n| Region     | Peer Group companies      |\n|------------|---------------------------|\n| Mexico     | Grupo Mexico              |\n|            | Leagold Mining            |\n| USA/Canada | Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd    |\n|            | Centerra Gold             |\n|            | Hecla Mining Co.          |\n|            | IAM Gold                  |\n|            | Newmont Goldcorp          |\n|            | Pan American Silver Corp. |\n|            | Yamana Gold Inc.          |\n| Europe     | Hochschild Mining         |\n|            | Antofagasta               |\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\n## Policy on annual bonus plan and variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\n## Factors considered in setting bonus\n\nThe Annual Bonus Plan includes metrics and targets which are aligned to at least one of the four main themes of the Group's strategy (see Remuneration at a Glance section on pages 168 to 169).\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has set a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

management according to the Strategic Plan. Where a change of emphasis is considered to be necessary, the weighting will be amended in future years. Since 2019, the targets, weighting and measures have been set recognising that the Company is moving into a phase of consolidation rather than growth.\n- 2 EBITDA is adjusted to exclude currency fluctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and any revaluation of the Silverstream contract. The points awarded are increased by 1.0 points per 1.00% increase in EBITDA up to a maximum of 5.0 points. In the event of a decline in EBITDA, there is a decrease of 1 point in the case of a 1% decline in EBITDA; a decrease of 2 points in the case of a 2% decline in EBITDA; a decrease of 4 points in the case of a 3% decline in EBITDA; a decrease of 8 points in the case of a 4% decline in EBITDA; a decrease of 16 points in the case of a 5% decrease in EBITDA; and a decrease of 20 points (total score) in the case of a 6% or more reduction in EBITDA.\n- 3 Proportional increase in points per increase in Resources above target. A proportional decrease in points will be applied in case of a decrease in Resources below target. Resources will be weighted to take account of quality.\n- 4 Increase of 2 points per each 1% of Resources increased above Target. A decrease of 2 points will be applied for each 1% below Target. Resources will be weighted to take account of quality.\n- 5 Exploration Projects for 2020 were: (i) The new JM Ore Deposit at San Juli\u00e1n (3.0 points); (ii) Fresnillo District - Jarillas West (2.0 points); (iii) Condoriaco Project (2 points); and (iv) Guanjuato Project (1 point).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

For the purposes of calculating fatalities; all fatalities are included, irrespective of whether they are employees or contractors.\n- 8 Progress with the Sustainability Development Area in the Safety Plan will be set by the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.\n- 9 In the event of a fatality, zero points will be awarded for safety. The number of points awarded will be further reduced by 1% if there are two fatalities. From the remaining total score, an additional 2% will be deducted if there are three fatalities. In the case of four fatal accidents, an additional 3% will be deducted from the remaining total score and so on for further fatalities. This includes employees and contractors.\n- 10 In the event of an environmental incident, the total bonus score will be reduced by 2%. An additional deduction of 3% will be made from the total score in the case of two incidents. In the case of these incidents, a further 4% for each incident will be deducted and so on.\n- 11 Under the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to make adjustments to bonus payments in certain circumstances.\n- 12 The maximum points awarded for categories where no maximum is set (Financial, Production and Exploration) cannot be more than 35% above the weighting.\n\n## Reconciliation of adjusted net profit targets and outcomes to the financial statements\n\n| US$ millions                                                                                   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit for year as shown in financial statements                                               | 375.6   | 205.8   |\n| Interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation                                                   | 864.5   | 516.6   |\n| Adjustments:                                                                                   |         |         |\n| Changes due to currency fluctuations                                                           | (66.6)  | 35.3    |\n| Changes due to year-on-year movements in metal prices (including the effects of metal hedging) | (367.3) | (192.8) |\n| Changes due to the movement in the valuation of the Silverstream contract                      | (71.0)  | (48.4)  |\n| Adjusted EBITDA total for bonus purposes                                                       | 735.2   | 516.6   |\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is prohibited from participating in the PTU scheme and therefore may only receive a maximum bonus equal to six months' pay. All Mexican employees are eligible for PTU payments annually which can be as high as 200% of salary in exceptional years.\n\n## 2021 Bonus targets\n\nThe Remuneration Committee agreed that 2021 indicators, weightings and measures should be the same as for 2020 with the exception that the Pyrites Plant (Phase II - Fresnillo Tailings) project will be replaced by the Rodeo project in the Projects section. The 2021 targets, performance against those targets and the basis of calculation of bonus points awarded will be disclosed in next year's report.\n\n## Pension entitlement\n\n## Policy on pensions\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5 to 8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary. Executive Directors may participate the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nMr Alv\u00eddrez is a member of the defined benefit scheme in relation to services with the Company prior to 1 July 2007. He is also a member of the defined contribution scheme. He is expected to retire at his normal retirement age of 60 years.\n\n## Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\n## Policy on Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director.\n\nThe fees payable to Non-executive Directors are calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee of \u00a335,000 per annum is paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole.\n- \u00b7 There are no set fees for membership of any Board Committees or for the chairmanship of the Board, other than as follows.\n- -/.notdef The UK-based Non-executive Directors receive a higher fee, currently \u00a390,000 per annum, to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and for responsibilities as Committee members and, where appropriate, as Senior Independent Director and/or Chairman of any Committee.\n- -/.notdef When the Chairman of the Audit Committee is resident in Mexico, he/she will receive an additional fee of \u00a315,000 per annum.\n- -/.notdef Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a35,000 per annum.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The current term expires on 18 May 2021, being the date of the next Annual General Meeting but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM.\n- 2 Copies of the Directors' letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\n## Shareholders and remuneration\n\n## Policy on engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.\n\n## AGM voting on the Remuneration Report\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's approach to executive remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at every Annual General Meeting since the Company's listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. More than 95% of independent share votes cast on the advisory vote at each AGM have been in favour of the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nAll shares voted\n\nIndependent shares voted\n\n|                           |         |         |        |         | No of votes   |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------------|\n| Year                      | For     | Against | For    | Against | withheld      |\n| 2011                      | 99.98%  | 0.02%   | 99.88% | 0.12%   | 5,125         |\n| 2012                      | 99.91%  | 0.09%   | 99.54% | 0.46%   | 1,814,818     |\n| 2013                      | 99.97%  | 0.03%   | 99.82% | 0.18%   | 115,987       |\n| 2014: Remuneration Policy | 99.72%  | 0.28%   | 98.69% | 1.31%   | 532,589       |\n| 2014: Remuneration Report | 100.00% | 0.00%   | 99.99% | 0.01%   | 531,072       |\n| 2015: Remuneration Report | 99.91%  | 0.09%   | 99.55% | 0.45%   | 814,989       |\n| 2016: Remuneration Report | 99.89%  | 0.11%   | 99.48% | 0.52%   | 44,391        |\n| 2017: Remuneration Policy | 99.87%  | 0.13%   | 99.42% | 0.58%   | 43,901        |\n| 2017: Remuneration Report | 99.86%  | 0.14%   | 99.34% | 0.66%   | 43,901        |\n| 2018 Remuneration Policy  | 99.45%  | 0.55%   | 97.32% | 2.68%   | 9,907         |\n| 2018: Remuneration Report | 99.79%  | 0.21%   | 98.99% | 1.01%   | 12,203        |\n| 2019: Remuneration Policy | 99.45%  | 0.55%   | 95.72% | 4.28%   | 269,961       |\n| 2019: Remuneration Report | 99.41%  | 0.59%   | 96.99% | 3.01%   | 15,761        |\n| 2020: Remuneration Report | 99.56%  | 0.44%   | 97.75% | 2.25%   | 11,231        |\n\nNote: Prior to 2014, there was only one vote on the Directors Remuneration Report at each Annual General Meeting.",

Such information is taken into account when considering Executive Committee remuneration. Willis Towers Watson advises the Remuneration Committee on executive remuneration matters from time to time. During 2020, the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$nil (2019: US$9,558). All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company and each of the Directors. No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself.\n\nThe Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and arranges regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK. The Group Human Resources Department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group.\n\n## Additional information on remuneration\n\n## Share price performance\n\nAs required by the Regulations, the following graph sets out the performance of the Company's share price since its listing compared to the FTSE 100 Index. As the Company was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index for most of the year, this is deemed to be the most appropriate index for comparative purposes for the year-ended 31 December 2020.\n\n- Fresnillo Total Return Index\n- FTSE 100 Total Return Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's service agreement\n\nDuring the year, Mr Alv\u00eddrez served as Chief Executive Officer but was not a member of the Board.

Mr Alv\u00eddrez's contract commenced on 15 August 2012 and is governed by Mexican Federal Labour Law. Mr Alv\u00eddrez's service agreement does not have a fixed term and may be terminated in writing by either party. There is no provision in Mr Alv\u00eddrez's service agreement entitling him to additional compensation for termination other than those required by Mexican labour laws for termination without cause. No benefits are payable on termination.\n\nUnder his service agreement, Mr Alv\u00eddrez is entitled to 26 working days' paid holiday per year. He is not entitled to profit-sharing (PTU). Mr Alv\u00eddrez is also entitled to life insurance, the use of a chauffeur and company car, the payment of medical insurance premiums covering limited expenses and check-ups, meals and subsistence payments and club subscriptions.\n\n## Total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for the past eight years, in US dollars, has been as follows:\n\n| Year ending 31 December                         | 2013    | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018    | 2019   | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Total remuneration (US$'000)                    |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |\n| Octavio Alv\u00eddrez                                | 1,116   | 1,217  | 1,166  | 1,111  | 1,072  | 886     | 1,164  | 939     |\n| Percentage change on previous year              | (41.5%) | 9.1%   | (4.2%) | (4.7%) | (3.5%) | (10.7%) | 31.4%  | (19.3%) |\n| Proportion of maximum bonus paid to CEO in year |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |\n| Octavio Alv\u00eddrez                                | 33.33%  | 33.33% | 33.33% | 66.66% | 33.33% | Nil%    | Nil%   | 20.83%  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

PTU is excluded in order to make a like-for-like comparison with the Chief Executive Officer who does not receive PTU.\n- 2 The Chief Executive Officer's salary, bonus and benefit amounts are excluded from the calculation of Average Employee Remuneration. No bonus was paid to the Chief Executive Officer in 2019 but a bonus of 2.5 months was paid in respect of 2020, therefore it is not possible to present a percentage increase figure.\n- 3 Calculated using the data from the single figure table in the Annual Report on Remuneration (page 172) in US dollars. The Non-executive Directors are paid fees in UK sterling and therefore will be subject to year-on-year changes in exchange rates.\n- 4 The Non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or benefits from the Company.\n- 5 Following approval of the current Directors Remuneration Policy at the 2019 AGM, Charles Jacobs received additional fees for being a member of the Audit Committee for eight months in 2019. These fees were paid for the full year in 2020, albeit reduced by 30% along with his other fees in line with the voluntary reduction in all Directors fees from 1 May to 31 October 2020.\n\n## Relative importance of the spend on pay\n\n|                                         | 2020    | 2019    | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Staff costs (US$'000)  1                | 122,345 | 126,723 | (3.5)      |\n| Distributions to shareholders (US$'000) | 104,639 | 142,221 | (26.4)     |\n\n- 1 Staff costs are taken without PTU in order to make a like-for-like comparison with the Chief Executive Officer who does not receive PTU.\n\n## Payments to new or departing Directors\n\nDuring the year, the Company has not recruited any executive directors; nor has it made any payments to past directors or made any payments to Directors for loss of office.\n\nThis Report has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board.\n\n## Charles Jacobs\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee 1 March 2021\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy of the Company has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 ('the Regulations') and was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 21 May 2019. The Remuneration Committee has assessed the criteria recommended by provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and believes that the Policy has always been inherently clear, simple, designed to avoid of excessive rewards, predictable and proportionate. The effective date of the Policy is date 21 May 2019. The full text of the current Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 143 to 147 of the Fresnillo plc 2018 Annual Report and Accounts, which can be found on the Company's website (www.fresnilloplc.com).\n\nAs required by UK law, the Remuneration Policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the Remuneration Policy. However, the Company treats the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the Remuneration Policy and for reporting on his remuneration.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Group's Remuneration Policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this Policy.\n\nSetting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company's Peer Group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.\n\nThe table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors' pay set out in the Remuneration Policy (the 'Policy Table'):\n\n## Base salary\n\n## Provides the core reward for the role\n\n| Operation          | Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year and the review is influenced by: \u00b7  Role, experience and performance. \u00b7  Average workforce salary adjustments. \u00b7  Mexican economic factors. \u00b7  Comparison with the Company's Peer Group in Mexico and internationally. Salaries are benchmarked triennially by reference to companies of similar size and complexity and will be positioned  within a mid-range of the Company's comparator Peer Group in Mexico and internationally. The next review will take                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maximum value      | The Executive Director's salary will be reviewed taking account of the benchmarking information received by the  Remuneration Committee and the maximum value of the Executive Director's base salary will be positioned within the  mid-range for companies in the Peer Group of Mexican and international resources companies. An Executive Director's  salary will be increased in line with increases applied across the whole workforce. In exceptional circumstances, the  Executive Director's salary may be increased by up to but never more than 10% above the average pay increase for the  whole workforce of the Company in any year. The rationale for such increases will be fully explained in the Annual Report  on Remuneration. |\n| Performance metric | The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year by reference to   the factors noted under the 'Operation' heading in this table. Details of the current remuneration of the Executive  Director are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Discretion         | The Remuneration Committee will establish the Company's comparator Peer Group in Mexico and internationally   as part of the triennial review which it will consider in April 2019. The Peer Group was reviewed in April 2019. Further  information about the Peer Group agreed at that time can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 174.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## APPENDIX: SUMMARY OF THE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY",

Executive Directors are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme.\n\nMaximum value\n\nThe maximum Company contribution for any employee may not exceed 13% of salary.\n\nPerformance metric\n\nNone.\n\nDiscretion\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Policy on shareholding guidelines\n\nFresnillo has not introduced share ownership guidelines. The Company does not operate share-based incentive arrangements given that the culture for incentives in the Mexican market does not favour share-based incentives. Consequently, there would be neither opportunity nor appetite for executives to build a shareholding in the Company and therefore the Remuneration Committee has not adopted any shareholding guidelines.\n\n## Policy on the consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nSubject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a common approach to both. Below Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (PTU) is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any of the Non-executive Directors participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. The other members of senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., which pays annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following is a summary of the structure, rights and restrictions of the Company's share capital:\n\nThe Company has two classes of share capital: 736,893,589 ordinary shares of US$0.50 ('Ordinary Shares') and 50,000 deferred shares of \u00a31.00 each ('Sterling Deferred Shares'). The Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Mexican Stock Exchange. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares are governed by UK law and the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nOrdinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. On a show of hands every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or being a corporation represented by a duly authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. The Notice of Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares other than:\n\n- \u00b7 the standard restrictions for a UK-quoted company set out in article 32 of the Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 where, from time to time, certain restrictions may become imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and\n- \u00b7 pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain Directors, officers and employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Ordinary Shares.\n\nA Director may be elected either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director, but so that the total number of Directors shall not thereby exceed the maximum in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. Any person so appointed by the Directors shall retire at the next Annual General Meeting and shall then be eligible for election.\n\nNo shareholder holds securities carrying special rights as to the control of the Company. There are no limitations on the holding of securities. There are no restrictions on voting rights or any arrangements by which, with the Company's cooperation, financial rights carried by securities are held by a person other than the holder of the securities. There are no agreements between holders of securities that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the transfer of voting rights.\n\nThe Sterling Deferred Shares only entitle the shareholder to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary Shareholders on winding up or on a return of capital. The Sterling Deferred Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Shares at a price of \u00a31.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Shares. Except at the option of the Company, the Sterling Deferred Shares are not transferable.",

The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in conformity with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, Group financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- \u00b7 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- \u00b7 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Company and of the Group's financial position and financial performance;\n- \u00b7 in respect of the Group financial statements, state whether IFRSs in conformity with the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs adopted pursuant to Regulation(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 in respect of the parent company financial statements, state whether IFRSs in conformity with the Companies Act 2006, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 state that the Company and the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Company and the Group to continue as a going concern unless it is appropriate to presume that the Company and/or the Group will not continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's and Group's transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Acts 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and regulations. In addition the Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\n## Directors' Responsibility Statement under the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nIn accordance with provision 27 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information to enable shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nEach of the Directors whose names are listed on pages 142 to 145 confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- a)  the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards in conformity with the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs adopted pursuant to Regulation(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- b)  the management report (encompassed within the 'Overview', 'Strategic Report', 'Performance' and 'Governance' sections) includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board\n\nCharles Jacobs Senior Independent Director 1 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We confirmed our understanding of management's going concern assessment process and confirmed that the Group is not subject to financial covenants on its borrowings;\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's forecasting accuracy as reliable by comparing forecasts from prior periods to subsequent actuals and assessing the reasons for differences, including the effect of market-driven factors;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness of the factors included in the going concern assessment by reference to our understanding of the business;\n- \u00b7 We obtained management's going concern assessment, including the cash forecast for the going concern period which extends to December 2022. The group has developed a number of scenarios in order to model plausible, adverse changes and to apply reverse stress testing to the forecast liquidity of the Group;\n- \u00b7 We have tested the factors and assumptions included in the base case and most severe adverse scenario for the cash forecast, in particular comparing forecast metals prices to analyst forecasts and comparing production forecasts to 2020 production, plant capacity and our understanding of the business and its future plans;\n- \u00b7 We have tested the impact of Covid-19 overlays applied to each forecast scenario. We considered the appropriateness of the methods used to calculate the cash forecasts and determined through inspection and testing of the methodology and calculations that the methods utilised were appropriate to be able to make an assessment for the entity;\n- \u00b7 We considered the mitigating actions available to management, although these were not modelled due to the level of headroom in the plausible, adverse cases;\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed management's reverse stress testing in order to identify what reduction in metal prices, as the key variable input, would lead to the Group utilising all liquidity during the going concern period noting that these are well below the minimum analyst price forecast for the going concern period; and\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period which extends to December 2022.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FRESNILLO PLC",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group, changes in the business environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 16 reporting components of the Group, we selected 11 components covering entities within Mexico and Chile, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 11 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining four components ('specified procedures components'), we performed specified audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2019: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2019: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 99% (2019: 100%) of the Group's profit before tax excluding revenue and Silverstream revaluation effects and 99% (2019: 99%) of the Group's total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 100% (2019: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2019: nil) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 95% (2019: 95%) of the Group's profit before tax excluding revenue and Silverstream revaluation effects and 84% (2019: 82%) of the Group's total assets. The specified procedures scope components contributed nil (2019: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 4% (2019: 5%) of the Group's profit before tax excluding revenue and Silverstream revaluation effects and 15% (2019: 17%) of the Group's total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nOf the remaining five components that together represent 1% (2019: 0.5%) of the Group's profit before tax excluding revenue and Silverstream revaluation effects and 1% (2019: 1%) of the Group's total assets, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group's profit before tax excluding revenue and Silverstream revaluation effects. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements. to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The component team performs certain supporting procedures regarding cash receipts, and the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles provides support in respect of procedures on the estimation of reserve and resource quantities and the related mine plan at the Sabinas mine.\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the seven full scope components, audit procedures were performed on two of these directly by the primary audit team. Of the four specific scope components, the primary team performed audit procedures directly on one and for the other three specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nSenior members of the component team attended our virtual global planning meetings during the planning phase of the audit, and we discussed the results of interim procedures and interacted regularly with the local team in Mexico. The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers in order to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.\n\nIn previous years, the primary engagement team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited Mexico at least four times during the audit, during both the planning and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over several visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of any accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings.\n\n## Effect of Covid-19\n\nIn the current year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, travel to Mexico was not possible. As a result, our interactions with our component team, meetings with management and closing meetings were held virtually through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities, with no time spent physically in Mexico. To compensate, we implemented weekly status calls with the component team throughout the duration of the execution phase of the audit. These resulted in the provision of timely feedback and observations and allowed for effective oversight. The review of relevant audit work papers was facilitated by the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or the provision of copies of work papers direct to the Group audit team. Given the nature of our engagement, some of these measures had been implemented, albeit to a lesser extent, in previous years, providing an appropriate base from which to expand our interactions.",

For certain procedures, in particular areas involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers and discussed these with the component team.\n\nBased upon the above approach we are satisfied that we have been able to perform sufficient and appropriate oversight of our component teams. This, together with the additional procedures performed at group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the tables below, each key audit matter is attributed an icon which is used to map these to our components in scope in the subsequent section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key audit matter: Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition /.notdef\n\n- \u00b7 All of the Group's current year revenue from the sale of goods, being concentrates, dor\u00e9, activated carbon, slag and precipitates, excluding hedging, (US$2,427.7 million; 2019: US$2,126.0 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$152.2 million; 2019: US$155.0 million), arise from transactions with related parties. The Silverstream contract is also with a related party. These related parties are principally subsidiaries of the Group's direct parent, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles (Pe\u00f1oles).\n- \u00b7 /.notdef Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream contract.\n- \u00b7 /.notdef There is a risk that, if not at arm's length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group's parent.\n- \u00b7 /.notdef There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement of product sold.\n- \u00b7 /.notdef There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by recently concluded and on-going tax inspections. There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.\n- Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in seven components, which covered 100% of the aggregate risk amount relating to revenue, 100% of the risk related to the Silverstream contract and 63% relating to related party expenses. In addition, we performed specified procedures in 2 components which covered 30% of related party expenses.\n\n/.notdef Identification of related parties and related party transactions\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the appropriateness of management's process for identifying, recording and reporting related party transactions and tested relevant controls.\n\n/.notdef Revenue recognition\n\n/.notdef Silverstream contract\n\n- \u00b7 We tested a sample of cash receipts in respect of silver that is payable under the contract in the year.\n\n/.notdef Other transactions with related parties\n\n- \u00b7 The valuation of the Silverstream contract is discussed separately as a key audit matter below.\n- \u00b7 On a sample basis we tested related party expenses against underlying contractual terms.\n- \u00b7 We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that there was no evidence of manipulation.\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the role of the Audit Committee in identifying and monitoring related party transactions.\n- \u00b7 We considered the completeness of related party transactions through virtual meetings with management at various levels, inspection of board minutes, and confirmation letters.\n- \u00b7 We read new and amended contracts and agreements with related parties, including Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, to understand the nature of the transactions.\n- \u00b7 Throughout the performance of our audit procedures, we remained alert for any related party transactions not already identified by management or that are outside the normal course of business.\n- \u00b7 We obtained confirmations of 100% of the revenue, including quantities delivered, and the period-end receivable balance.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the risk of material misstatement due to assay adjustments by performing a retrospective review of their quantum during the year and determining the maximum plausible adverse effect on period-end provisional sales.\n- \u00b7 We performed revenue cut-off testing, by reference to shipment dates.\n- \u00b7 On a sample basis, we performed testing to verify physical deliveries of product in the year.\n- \u00b7 Since this is a significant risk, our testing threshold is lower and our sample sizes are larger than they would otherwise have been.\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the basis of the treatment and refining charges (TR&Cs) negotiated between the Group and Pe\u00f1oles for the current year, these being deducted from revenue. We confirmed principal inputs to external benchmarks or other external evidence. We recalculated TR&Cs based on actual production and contractual terms.\n- \u00b7 We performed overall analytical procedures which consisted of comparing actual revenues on a disaggregated basis to detailed expectations developed based on production in the year and market prices for relevant metals and obtained explanations for any material variances.\n\nRelated party transactions are disclosed in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues in Note 4 and relevant accounting policies in Note 2.",

Where relevant, we corroborated those explanations through EY's data analysis  tools and external sources of information. We utilised data analysis tools to interrogate entire data sets for potential related party transactions. We also  compared related parties and related party transactions identified through our audit with the schedule provided |\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 Our procedures did not identify issues with the identification, recording or reporting of related party transactions.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that revenue recognition in the year is appropriate, including the treatment of related provisional pricing terms.\n- \u00b7 In respect of transfer pricing in transactions with related parties, we confirmed that the methodology for determining transfer pricing in respect of the transactions with other Pe\u00f1oles companies has not changed during the year and remains appropriate.\n\n## Key audit matter: Valuation of the Silverstream contract /.notdef\n\n- \u00b7 The valuation of the Silverstream contract (asset value: US$576.1 million at 31 December 2020; 2019: US$541.3 million; revaluation effect: US$71.0 million pre-tax gain in 2020; 2019: US$48.4 million pre-tax gain), a derivative financial instrument, is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model.\n- \u00b7 Key assumptions are the estimation of the reserves and resources and the related production profile of the Sabinas mine (owned and operated by Pe\u00f1oles), future silver prices and the discount rate applied. These assumptions require management judgment and estimation.\n- \u00b7 The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in future silver prices and the discount rate applied which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements.\n- Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2020 and related income statement revaluation effects. In 2019, the procedures were classified as specified procedures, although there have not been any significant changes to our procedures. These procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nThe nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation considerations are disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in Note 2.",

We therefore  issued instructions to the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles to perform procedures and report to us in respect of the reserves and  resources estimate and the mine plan of the Sabinas mine. These procedures detailed in the instructions included: - conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Pe\u00f1oles management's processes to estimate  quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan; |\n| /.notdef Key economic assumptions   in the valuation                           | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7 | With assistance from our valuation specialists we corroborated key economic assumptions in the valuation,  including future silver prices and the discount rate applied.  This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and discount rate  assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of the consistency of assumptions   to other accounting estimates, such as recoverable amounts of mining assets. We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and discount rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 We noted that the valuation model is consistent in its methodology with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long-term derivative contract.\n- \u00b7 Our procedures confirmed that the mine plan underpinning the valuation was estimated in an appropriate way.\n- \u00b7 We highlighted the sensitivity of the valuation to economic input assumptions, most significantly silver price and discount rate. We performed sensitivity analysis to quantify the financial impact of reducing to the high end of our range of acceptable values.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the overall valuation of the contract is appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key audit matter: Recoverable amount of mining assets /.notdef\n\n/.notdef\n\nThe identification of indicators of impairment is judgmental.\n\n- \u00b7 When an impairment test is performed, the key assumptions underpinning management's assessment of the recoverable amount of mining assets are reserves and resources and related mine plans and production profiles, estimated future operating and capital expenditure, future commodity prices, exchange rates and the discount rates applied.\n- \u00b7 The estimation of mineral reserves and resources quantities of the Group's mines requires significant judgment and estimation.\n- \u00b7 The group's reserves and resources are audited by SRK, a specialist engaged by management.\n- \u00b7 Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in impairment of property plant and equipment (net book value being US$2,708.2 million, 2019: US$$2,813.4 million). There is no impairment taken in prior years that may be reversed.\n\n/.notdef\n\n- Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area, on balance, remains consistent with the prior year. Whilst there is some additional risk related to the potential for Covid-19 related effects and an increased focus on the potential effects of climate change on financial information, price expectations are higher than in the prior year.\n\nIn the current year, we have considered also considered the possible effect of climate change on cost estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement's assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, with results of management's assessment for impairment in Note 12.

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be 5% of the five-year average profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects, adjusted for any material one-off transactions ('adjusted normalised profit'). At planning, we use forecast profit figures. We believe this measure of profit represents one of the main considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature and one-off transactions are not reflective of the on-going operations of the business.\n\nAlthough there can be no certainty over future levels of profitability, we have concluded that, solely for the purposes of determining materiality, there are sufficient indicators to normalise the basis for determining materiality using the average of that for the last five years. An illustration of our approach to normalising basis profit is set out below, with profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects as the starting point.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted profit used in materiality calculation\n\nExcluded one-off expense\n\nExcluded one-off income\n\nFive-year average\n\n## US$ million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: One-off items during the measurement period include the gain on sale of concession (2017), the partial reimbursement for an insurance claim relating to flooding at Saucito (2018) and an interest expense arising on the voluntary tax amendment (2019 and 2020).\n\nAt planning, we determined materiality for the Group to be US$18.5 million. During the course of our audit, we updated its calculation for the actual financial results of the year, which resulted in materiality of US$22.0 million (2019: US$19.7 million).\n\nWe determined materiality for the parent company to be US$53.6 million (2019: US$54.0 million), which is 1% (2019: 1%) of equity. The materiality of the parent company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the parent company's primary role being that of a holding company.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2019: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$16.5 million (2019: US$14.8 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the level of past history of misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.\n\nAllocated performance materiality increased in respect of all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group.\n\n/.notdef/.notdef/.notdef/.notdef\n\nKey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * The icons correspond to the key audit matters set out above.

The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;\n- \u00b7 /.notdef the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and\n- \u00b7 /.notdef information about the Company's corporate governance statement and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA Rules.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in:\n\n- \u00b7 the strategic report or the Directors' report; or\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 /.notdef adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the Directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and;\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of Directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined below, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit sharing requirements in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 We understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries to management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programs and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error. In the current year, forensic specialists reviewed our fraud risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved enquiries of group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, internal audit, and the risk and compliance departments; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and those indicating large or unusual journals based on our understanding of the business and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant accounting estimates.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the audit committee, we were appointed by the Company on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 13 years, covering the years ending 2008 to 2020.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Steven Dobson\n\n(Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London\n\n2 March 2021\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->",

(the 'Company') is a public limited company registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in Note 5 of the parent company accounts ('the Group').\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The registered address of Pe\u00f1oles is Calzada Legaria 549, Mexico City 11250. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances and transactions with Pe\u00f1oles' group companies is disclosed in Note 26.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 1 March 2021.\n\nThe Group's principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance\n\n## Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for trade receivables, derivative financial instruments, equity securities, investment in funds and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.\n\nEntities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nA number of new or amended standards (the 'Standards') became applicable for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group except for the corresponding to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment which prohibits the deduction of any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment. An entity instead recognises the proceeds from selling such items and related cost of production in profit or loss. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The amendments will apply retrospectively only to items of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) that are brought to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which the Group first applies the amendments. The items of PP&E within the transition scope, and therefore the impact of adopting this amendment, are not yet known.\n\nThe Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nAreas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 are:\n\nRecognition and classification of assets at Soledad-Dipolos mine:\n\nIn 2009, five members of the El Baj\u00edo agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont ('Penmont'), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, with which Penmont complied by vacating 1,824 hectares of land, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. Whilst the claim and the definitive court order did not affect the Group's legal title over the mining concession or the ore currently held in leaching pads near the mine site, land access at the mine site is required to further exploit the concession at Soledad-Dipolos.\n\nPenmont is the legal and registered owner of the land where the leaching pads are located but has not yet been able to gain physical access to these pads due to opposition by certain local individuals. The Group has a reasonable expectation that Penmont will eventually regain access to the Soledad-Dipolos assets and process the ore content in the Soledad-Dipolos leaching pads. Therefore, the Group continues to recognise property, plant & equipment and inventory related to Soledad-Dipolos, as disclosed in Note 12 and Note 14, respectively. Due to the fact that it is not yet certain when access may be granted so that the inventory can be processed, this inventory is classified as a non-current asset.\n\nAs previously reported by the Group, claimants from the El Baj\u00edo community also presented claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels other than the surface land where Soledad-Dipolos is located. Penmont has had no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. The Agrarian Court has issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont's occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to final conclusion. However, given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or had specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingencies relating to such land parcels are not considered material by the Group. There are no material assets recognised in respect of these land parcels as at 31 December 2020 or 31 December 2019.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nSignificant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, Note 2(e):\n- \u00b7 Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group's mining properties; mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such changes may impact the Group's reported balance sheet and income statement including:\n\n- \u00b7 the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in the recoverable amount, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources;\n- \u00b7 depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unit-of-production method based on ore reserves;\n- \u00b7 stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios;\n- \u00b7 provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur; and\n- \u00b7 the recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.\n- \u00b7 Estimate of recoverable ore on leaching pads:\n\nIn the Group's open pit mines, certain mined ore is placed on leaching pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold and enable extraction. The determination of the amount of recoverable gold requires estimation with consideration of the quantities of ore placed on the pads, the grade of the ore (based on assay data) and the estimated recovery percentage (based on metallurgical studies and current technology).\n\nThe grades of ore placed on pads are regularly compared to the quantities of metal recovered through the leaching process to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimated recovery (metallurgical balancing). The Group monitors the results of the metallurgical balancing process and recovery estimates are refined based on actual results over time and when new information becomes available.\n\nIn 2017, the Group decided that it would construct a new leaching pad in a separate area of the Herradura mine with all ore since July 2019 being deposited on the new pad area. To reduce the hauling distance from the pit to the new pad, the Group constructed an access route through certain existing leaching pads, removing and redepositing the ore in the process. These works allowed the Group to perform assays and verify certain characteristics of the ore, including the humidity of the ore deposited and the grade of gold in solution.\n\nThe Group continues reviewing the metallurgical balancing of the pads to assess the grade and recovery of the ore in inventories. The analysis of the operational performance of the pads yielded new information about the estimated recovery percentage. Based on the new information the Group updated its estimate of the remaining gold content in leaching increasing this by 119.3 thousand ounces of gold as at 1 January 2020.\n\nThis change in estimation was incorporated prospectively in inventory from 1 January 2020. The increase in the number of ounces reduced the weighted average cost of inventory. Had the estimation not changed, production cost during the year ended 31 December 2020 would have been US$86.1 million higher, with an offsetting impact against the work in progress inventory balance as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## \u00b7 Silverstream, Note 13:\n\nThe valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The term of the derivative is based on the Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine on the same basis a market participant would consider, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see Note 30. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions and the discount rate is included in Note 30. Management considers that an appropriate sensitivity for volumes produced and sold is on the total recoverable reserve and resource quantities over the contract term rather than annual production volumes over the mine life. A reasonably possible change in total recoverable resources and reserves quantities would not result in a significant change in the value of the contract.\n\n- \u00b7 Income tax, notes 2(q) and 10:\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak developed rapidly in 2020, with a significant number of infections around the world. The development and fluidity of the situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of Covid-19; however, the Group seeks to obtain the best possible information to enable the assessment of the risks involved and implement appropriate measures to respond.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has taken a number of measures to safeguard the health of its employees and their local communities while continuing to operate safely and responsibly. The Group acted in compliance with government-ordered restrictions, resulting in operations being temporarily suspended in Minera Penmont, all other mines have operated at normal production capacity. The Group incurred on US$19.4 million on temporary suspension, standby and other production costs. These costs are associated with placing Penmont mines in care and the subsequent ramp-up of operations, and the underutilisation of production capacity to the pre-Covid-19 operating activity. These production costs are presented as unabsorbed production cost in cost of sales. In addition, the Group incurred other production costs of US$4.5 million resulting from Covid-19 which include community support, the acquisition of additional personal protective equipment and other safety measures and are presented in cost of sales.\n\nDuring 2020, attempts at containment of Covid-19 have resulted in decreased economic activity, which has adversely affected the broader global economy. In the current environment, assumptions about future commodity prices, exchange rates, and interest rates are subject to greater variability than normal, which could in the future affect the valuation of the Group's assets and liabilities, both financial and non-financial. As at 31 December 2020, there were no material changes to the valuation of the Group's asset and liabilities due to Covid-19.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent company's functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.\n\nFor entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (e) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.\n\nThe cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item's estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process (except mobile equipment) or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset that are not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe average expected useful lives are as follows:\n\n|                                           |   Years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Buildings                                 |       8 |\n| Plant and equipment                       |      10 |\n| Mining properties and development costs 1 |       8 |\n| Other assets                              |       4 |\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.\n\n## Disposal of assets\n\nGains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.\n\n## Mining properties and development costs\n\nPayments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.\n\nPurchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.\n\nMining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession.\n\nMine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained, pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where such processing is necessary to bring mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, in testing the plants at the mining unit in development), revenues from metals recovered from such activities are credited to mining properties and development costs. When the processing does not contribute to bringing the mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, when the processing of the ore extracted is supported by assets outside of the development project), the revenue is considered as incidental and it is recognised in profit or loss. In the latter case, cost of sales is measured based on expected operating cost once commercial production has been initiated.\n\nUpon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.\n\nMining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.\n\n## Construction in progress\n\nAssets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated.\n\n## Subsequent expenditures\n\nAll subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is derecognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\n## Stripping costs\n\nIn a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as either depreciation or depletion to cost of sales in the income statement based on the mine's units of production once commercial operations begin.\n\nRemoval of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.\n\nProduction stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group;\n- \u00b7 the Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nIf not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nStripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as 'component stripping ratio', which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the unit-of-production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated as new information of reserves and resources is available. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement.\n\nThe capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.\n\n## (f) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## The recoverable amount of an asset\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount of mining assets are based on the mine plan for each mine. The mine plan is determined on the basis of the estimated and economically proven and probable reserves, as well as certain other resources that are assessed as highly likely to be converted into reserves. Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group's cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.",

Significant accounting policies\n\n## continued\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (g) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI); and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in one of the following categories.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at fair value through profit and loss).\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. As at 31 December 2020 and 2019 there were no such instruments.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables and derivative financial instruments, including the Silverstream contract, are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at FVPL), the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities as amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nFinished goods, work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.\n\nFor this purpose, the costs of production include:\n\n- \u00b7 personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;\n- \u00b7 the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and\n- \u00b7 related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).\n\nWork in progress inventory comprises ore in leaching pads as processing is required to extract benefit from the ore. The recovery of gold is achieved through the heap leaching process. The leaching process may take months to obtain the expected metal recovery and mainly depends on the continuity of the leaching process. When the ore in leaching pads is in active leaching, it is classified as current. When the leaching process has stopped and not expected to restart within 12 months, ore in the leaching pads affected is classified as non-current.\n\nOperating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.\n\n## (i) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

Significant accounting policies\n\ncontinued\n\n## (j) Provisions\n\n## Mine closure cost\n\nA provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## (k) Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates the following plans for its employees based in Mexico:\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan\n\nThis funded plan is based on each employee's earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).\n\nThe present value of defined benefit obligations under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\nPast service costs are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nNet interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plan\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee's salary.\n\nThis plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.\n\n## Seniority premium for voluntary separation\n\nThis unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days' salary per year for unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days' for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.\n\n## Other\n\nBenefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.\n\nTermination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.\n\n## (l) Employee profit sharing\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing ('PTU') equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year.\n\nPTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is deductible for income tax purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## (m) Leases\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. From 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 restoration costs.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment.\n\n## (n) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of goods or services transfers to the customer based on the performance obligations settle in the contracts with customers.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue associated with the sale of concentrates, precipitates, dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon (the products) is recognised when control of the asset sold is transferred to the customer. Indicators of control transferring include an unconditional obligation to pay, legal title, physical possession, transfer of risk and rewards and customer acceptance. This generally occurs when the goods are delivered to the customer's smelter or refinery agreed with the buyer; at which point the buyer controls the goods.\n\nThe revenue is measured at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled, being the estimate of the price expected to be received in the expected month of settlement and the Group's estimate of metal quantities based on assay data, and a corresponding trade receivable is recognised. Any future changes that occur before settlement are embedded within the provisionally priced trade receivables and are, therefore, within the scope of IFRS 9 and not within the scope of IFRS 15.\n\nGiven the exposure to the commodity price, these provisionally priced trade receivables will fail the cash flow characteristics test within IFRS 9 and will be required to be measured at FVPL up from initial recognition and until the date of settlement. These subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in revenue but separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nRefining and treatment charges under the sales contracts are deducted from revenue from sales of concentrates as these are not related to a distinct good or service.\n\n## (o) Exploration expenses\n\nExploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.\n\nExploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life; and\n- \u00b7 Exploration expenses:\n- - costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves; and\n- - costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project from which time further expenses are capitalised as exploration costs on balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (p) Selling expenses\n\nThe Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.\n\nThe Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Juli\u00e1n mine. The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.\n\n## (q) Taxation\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in OCI is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n## Mining Rights\n\nThe Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities (see Note 10(e)). The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see Note 10).\n\n## Sales tax\n\nExpenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except:\n\n- \u00b7 when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and\n- \u00b7 when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## (r) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.\n\nSuch derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement as finance income or finance cost respectively.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.\n\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 there is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n- \u00b7 the effect of credit risk does not 'dominate the value changes' that result from that economic relationship; and\n- \u00b7 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nHedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in OCI and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in OCI from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in OCI until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is then recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nWhen hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI as a cost of hedging. Where the hedged item is transaction related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\nWhen hedging with forward contracts, the forward element is included in the designation of the financial instrument. Therefore, there is no cost of hedging in relation to forward contracts.\n\n## (s) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\nWhere funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (t) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 29 and 30.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 in the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in Note 29.\n\n## (u) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company's shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## 3. Segment reporting\n\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group has six reportable operating segments as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Ci\u00e9nega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine (closed at the end of 2020);\n- \u00b7 The Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and\n- \u00b7 The San Juli\u00e1n mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine.\n\nThe operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group's chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of sales and Gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross profit as per the consolidated income statement.

None of these were explicitly dealt with in Mexican tax law previously.\n\nThese amendments were applied from 2013 to 2019 for all its underground operations and resulted in an increase in the current corporate income tax charge of US$29.2 million and current special mining right charge of US$8.4 million; this effect was offset by a decrease in deferred corporate income tax of US$29.2 million. The amendment also resulted in US$25.0 million of interest and surcharges, presented in finance costs and US$1.2 million of penalties presented in other expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If not utilised, US$12.7 million (2019: US$21.2 million) will expire within five years and US$235.7 million (2019: US$155.5 million) will expire between six and ten years. At entity level deferred tax asset amounting to US$31.2 million is cover by a deferred tax liability position, the remaining US$43.3 million corresponds to Fresnillo plc which maintained a deferred net asset position. The Group has conducted a feasible tax planning that will allow applied the tax losses before its expiration.\n\nThe Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$64.6 million (2019: US$59.7 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. Based on the applicable tax legislation the tax losses are not subject to expire.\n\n## (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,797 million (2019: US$1,619 million).\n\n## (e) Corporate Income Tax ('Impuesto Sobre la Renta' or 'ISR') and Special Mining Right ('SMR')\n\nThe Group's principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.\n\nOn 30 December 2018, the Decree of tax incentives for the northern border region of Mexico was published in the Official Gazette, which provided a reduction of income tax by a third and also a reduction of 50% of the value added tax rate, for taxpayers that produce income from business activities carried out within the northern border region. The tax incentives were applicable since 1 January 2019 and remain in force until 31 December 2020. On 30 December 2020, an extension of the Decree was published in the Official Gazette which remain in force until 31 December 2024. Some of the Group companies which produce income from business activities carried out within Caborca, Sonora, which is considered for purposes of the Decree as northern border region, applied for this Decree tax incentives before the Mexican tax authorities, and were granted authorisation for income tax and value added tax purposes.\n\nUntil 2019, the Mexican Internal Revenue Law granted to taxpayers a credit in respect of an excise tax (Special Tax on Production and Services, or 'IEPS' for its acronym in Spanish) paid when purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain mining vehicles. The credit could be applied against the annual corporate income tax. The credit was calculated on an entity-by-entity basis. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group applied a credit of US$9.9 million in respect of the year. As the IEPS deduction was itself taxable, the benefit was recognised at 70% of the IEPS calculated during the year. The net amount applied by the Group is presented in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate in Note 10(b).",

The SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable within the same legal entity. The 7.5% tax applies to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended 31 December 2020, the Group credited US$21.3 million (2019: US$14.7 million) of mining concession rights against the SMR. Total mining concessions rights paid during the year were US$21.3 million (2019: US$21.1 million) and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. Mining concessions rights paid in excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess. Without regards to credits permitted under the SMR regime, the current special mining right credit would have been US$46.1 million (2019: US$18.6 million).\n\n## 11.

Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.02% (2019: 5.78%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the higher of value in use and fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) computation of their recoverable amount. Value in use and FVLCD was determined based on the net present value of the future estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the cash generating units (CGUs). For both valuation approaches management used long-term price assumptions of US$1,580 per ounce and US$20.2 per ounce (2019: US$1,370 per ounce and US$18.7 per ounce) for gold and silver, respectively. Management considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts are most sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs where a reasonably possible change in prices could lead to impairment. Management has considered a low sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 10% and 25% respectively (2019: gold and silver 5%) and a high sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 20% and 45% respectively (2019: gold and silver 10% and 15% respectively). As at 31 December 2020, the analysis resulted in an impairment on Herradura of US$43.2 million (2019:US$356.4 million) under high sensitivity; US$nil (2019: US$127.4 million) under low sensitivity; San Juli\u00e1n US$401.0 million (2019: US$121.6 million) under high sensitivity; US$199.8 million (2019: US$109.7 million) under low sensitivity; Ci\u00e9nega US$129.1 million (2019: US$nil) under high sensitivity; US$nil (2019: US$nil) under low sensitivity; Fresnillo US$77.6 million (2019: US$nil) under high sensitivity; US$nil (2019: US$nil) under low sensitivity; and Noche Buena US$23.7 million (2019: US$nil) under high sensitivity; US$8.6 million (2019: US$nil) under low sensitivity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Silverstream contract\n\nOn 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Pe\u00f1oles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Pe\u00f1oles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas mine ('Sabinas'), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Pe\u00f1oles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013) is payable to Pe\u00f1oles. The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2020 was US$5.37 per ounce (2019: US$5.31 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Pe\u00f1oles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Pe\u00f1oles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. At 31 December 2020 the weighted average rate applied for the purposes of the valuation model was 7.43% (2019: 6.57%).\n\nThe Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at FVPL and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine which is currently 34 years. Changes in the contract's fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2020, total proceeds received in cash were US$33.7 million (2019: US$24.3 million) of which, US$5.2 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2019 (2018: US$3.3 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$28.4 million (2019: US$20.9 million) corresponds to 2.3 million ounces of payable silver (2019: 2.3 million ounces). As at 31 December 2020, a further US$7.6 million (2019: US$5.2 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 362,295 ounces of silver is due (2019: 414,963 ounces).\n\nThe US$71.0 million unrealised gain recorded in the income statement (31 December 2019: US$48.4 million gain) resulted mainly from the decrease in the LIBOR reference rate, the unwinding of the discount and the increase in the forward silver price curve which were partially offset by the updating of the Sabinas Reserves and Resources, inflation and exchange rate forecasts.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance is shown below:\n\n|                                                   | 2020  US$ thousands   | 2019  US$ thousands   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                              | 541,254               | 519,093               |\n| Cash received in respect of the year              | (28,427)              | (20,932)              |\n| Cash receivable                                   | (7,648)               | (5,283)               |\n| Remeasurement gains recognised in profit and loss | 70,961                | 48,376                |\n| Balance at 31 December                            | 576,140               | 541,254               |\n| Less - current portion                            | 41,443                | 22,558                |\n| Non-current portion                               | 534,697               | 518,696               |\n\nSee Note 29 for further information on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see Note 30 for further information relating to market and credit risks associated with the Silverstream asset.\n\n## 14.

The amount past due and considered as credit-impaired as of 31 December 2020 is US$0.5 million (2019: US$0.8 million). Trade receivables from related parties and other receivables for related parties are classified as financial assets at FVPL and therefore not considered in the expected credit loss analysis. In determining the recoverability of receivables, the Group performs a risk analysis considering the type and age of the outstanding receivable and the credit worthiness of the counterparty, see Note 30(b).\n\n## 16. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Group considers cash and cash equivalents when planning its operations and in order to achieve its treasury objectives.\n\n|                           | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                           | 2020  US$ thousands | 2019  US$ thousands |\n| Cash at bank and on hand  | 1,955               | 3,347               |\n| Short-term deposits       | 1,068,460           | 333,229             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 1,070,415           | 336,576             |\n\nCash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposits. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. Short-term deposits can be withdrawn at short notice without any penalty or loss in value.\n\n## 17. Equity\n\n## Share capital and share premium\n\nAuthorised share capital of the Company is as follows:\n\n|                                                 | 2020          | 2020         | 2019          | 2019         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Class of share                                  | Number        | Amount       | Number        | Amount       |\n| Ordinary Shares each of US$0.50                 | 1,000,000,000 | $500,000,000 | 1,000,000,000 | $500,000,000 |\n| Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares each of \u00a31.00 | 50,000        | \u00a350,000      | 50,000        | \u00a350,000      |\n\nAs at 31 December\n\nIssued share capital of the Company is as follows:\n\n|                     | Ordinary Shares   | Ordinary Shares   | Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares   | Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                     | Number            | US$               | Number                              | \u00a3                                   |\n| At 1 January 2019   | 736,893,589       | 368,545,586       | 50,000                              | 50,000                              |\n| At 31 December 2019 | 736,893,589       | 368, 545,586      | 50,000                              | 50,000                              |\n| At 31 December 2020 | 736,893,589       | 368, 545,586      | 50,000                              | 50,000                              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The rights and obligations attached to these shares are governed by law and the Company's Articles of Association. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary shares.\n\nThe Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares only entitle the shareholder on winding up or on a return of capital to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary Shareholders. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares at a price of \u00a31.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares. Except at the option of the Company, the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares are not transferable.\n\n## Reserves\n\n## Share premium\n\nThis reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.\n\n## Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve arose as a consequence of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation as a result of using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge, net of tax. When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or the loss is transferred out of equity to the income statement or the value of other assets.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe changes in the time value of option contracts are accumulated in the costs of hedging reserve. These deferred costs of hedging are either reclassified to profit or loss or recognised as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedge item that realises over time, amortised on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in Note 2(g). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of entities with a functional currency different to that of the presentational currency of the Group.\n\n## Retained earnings/accumulated losses\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Group, less any distributions and dividends paid.\n\n## 18. Dividends declared and paid\n\nThe dividends declared and paid during the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\n|                                                               | US cents per  Ordinary Share   | Amount  US$ thousands   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December 2020                                   |                                |                         |\n| Final dividend for 2019 declared and paid during the year 1   | 11.90                          | 87,690                  |\n| Interim dividend for 2020 declared and paid during the year 2 | 2.30                           | 16,949                  |\n|                                                               | 14.20                          | 104,639                 |\n| Year ended 31 December 2019                                   |                                |                         |\n| Final dividend for 2018 declared and paid during the year 3   | 16.70                          | 123,061                 |\n| Interim dividend for 2019 declared and paid during the year 4 | 2.60                           | 19,160                  |\n|                                                               | 19.30                          | 142,221                 |\n\nThe Directors have proposed a final dividend of 23.5 US cents per share, which is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and is not recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2020. Dividends paid from the profits generated from 1 January 2014 to residents in Mexico and to non-resident shareholders may be subject to an additional tax of up to 10%, which will be withheld by the Group.\n\nIn late 2019, the Directors became aware of a technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) whereby certain dividends paid between 2011 and 2019 (the 'Historic Dividends') had been made without having filed interim accounts in accordance with the Act. The relevant interim accounts have now been filed with the Registrar of Companies and these show that the Company had sufficient distributable reserves at the point at which each of the Historic Dividends was paid. It is the intention of the Directors, as a matter of prudence, to put forward a resolution to shareholders in due course to regularise the position. This decision will have no effect on the monies received pursuant to these dividends and will not adversely impact shareholders or the Company. Nevertheless, the Directors will keep the matter under review.",

Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023 that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for consideration of US$543.0 million. Additional accrued interest at the date of the repurchase included in the settlement amounted US$10.8 million. The premium paid on purchase of these notes of US$60.9 million was recognised in financial expenses. The settlement occurred on 2 October 2020.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\nAs at 31 December\n\n|                                                | 2020  US$ thousands   | 2019  US$ thousands   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Opening balance                                | 801,239               | 800,127               |\n| Issuance of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050 1     | 828,325               | -                     |\n| Repayments of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023     | (482,121)             | -                     |\n| Accrued interest                               | 48,873                | 46,267                |\n| Interest paid 2                                | (43,144)              | (46,267)              |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 3,498                 | 1,112                 |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,156,670             | 801,239               |\n\nThe Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the Senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 20. Provision for mine closure cost\n\nThe provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling and reclamation alternatives, timing, and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied.\n\nThe Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 2020, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 4.35% to 8.12% (2019: range of 6.83% to 7.47%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 0.07% to 1.16% (2019: range of 1.43% to 1.82%). Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group's intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the lives of the mines.\n\nThe provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from 3 to 24 years from 31 December 2020 (2 to 29 years from 31 December 2019). As at 31 December 2020 the weighted average term of the provision is 12 years (2019: 13 years)\n\n|                                           | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                           | 2020  US$ thousands | 2019  US$ thousands |\n| Opening balance                           | 231,056             | 189,842             |\n| Increase/(decrease) to existing provision | 8,351               | (4,215)             |\n| Effect of changes in discount rate        | 3,896               | 27,961              |\n| Unwinding of discount rate                | 10,801              | 11,848              |\n| Payments                                  | (817)               | (24)                |\n| Foreign exchange                          | (7,599)             | 5,644               |\n| Closing balance                           | 245,688             | 231,056             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan.\n\nThe defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each Mexican non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers' contributions, capped at 8% of the employee's annual salary.\n\nThe defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker's earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired up to 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nDeath and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.\n\nThe following tables provide information relating to changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets:\n\n|                             | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands            | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands                      | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands                    | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands       | Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI US$ thousands   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                             | Balance at  1 January  2020               | Service  cost                             | Net  interest                             | Foreign  exchange                         | Sub-total  recognised  in the year        | Benefits  paid                                      | plan assets  (excluding  amounts  included  in net  interest | Actuarial  changes  arising from  changes in  demographic  assumptions | Actuarial  changes  arising from  changes in  financial  assumptions | Experience  adjustments                             | Foreign  exchange                                   | Sub-total  included  in OCI                         | Contributions  by employer                          | Defined  benefit  increase  due to  personnel  transfer | Balance at  31 December  2020                       |\n| Defined benefit  obligation | (31,294)                                  | (1,211)                                   | (1,738)                                   | 1,595                                     | (1,354)                                   | 985                                                 | -

All operating lease contracts contain market review clauses in the event that the lessee exercises its option to renew. The lessee does not have an option to purchase the equipment at the expiry of the lease period. The Group's leases as a lessor are not material.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December",

        "page_content": "## 25. Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the Group has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities ('SAT', by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 Certain of the Group's income tax returns are currently being reviewed by the SAT. The status of the material ongoing inspections is as follows: - On 13 February 2020, the SAT initiated an audit of the income tax and mining rights computations of Desarrollos Mineros Fresne for the year 2014. On 3 February 2021, the SAT delivered its findings to which the Company will respond no later than 4 March 2021. The findings relate to the tax treatments of capitalised stripping cost and exploration expenditure.\n- - During the year, the Group amended the tax treatment for income tax purposes in respect of mining works and mining concessions as described in Note 10(c). This amendment resulted in the closure of the previously reported income tax audits for the year 2013 at Minera Saucito and Minera Fresnillo.\n- \u00b7 It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n- \u00b7 In 2011, flooding occurred in the Saucito mine, following which the Group filed an insurance claim in respect of the damage caused (and in respect of business interruption). This insurance claim was rejected by the insurance provider. In early 2018, after the matter had been taken to mutually agreed arbitration, the insurance claim was declared valid; however, there is disagreement about the appropriate amount to be paid. In October 2018, the Group received US$13.6 million in respect of the insurance claim, however, this does not constitute a final settlement and management continues to pursue a higher insurance payment. Due to the fact that negotiations are ongoing and there is uncertainty regarding the timing and amount involved in reaching a final settlement with the insurer, it is currently not practicable to determine the total amount expected to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 In December 2020, the Group (directly and/or through one or more of its subsidiaries, herein referred to as 'Fresnillo') entered into an agreement with Orla Mining Ltd. and its Mexican Subsidiary, Minera Camino Rojo, S.A. de C.V. (together herein referred to as 'Orla'), granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto 21.8 hectares of Fresnillo's 782 hectares 'Guachichil D1' mineral concession, located immediately to the north of Orla's property for total consideration of US$62.8 million. This agreement allows Orla to access oxide and transitional heap leachable mineral resources on Orla's property at depth and grants Orla the right to mine from Fresnillo's mineral concession and recover for Orla's account all oxide and transitional material amenable to heap leaching that are within the expanded open pit. The effectiveness of the agreement with Orla was subject to approval of the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (COFECE), which was granted in February 2021, at which time the first payment in respect of this agreement amounting to US$25.0 million was received from Orla. Due to the fact that approval by COFECE was uncertain as at 31 December 2020, no amounts related to this agreement were recorded in the balance sheet as at that date or in the income statement for the year then ended.\n- \u00b7 It is probable that interest income will be earned on the Group's outstanding income and value added tax receivable balances; however, there is no certainty that this interest will be realised until the underlying balance is recovered. Due to that uncertainty, it is also not practicable to estimate the amount of interest income earned but not recovered to date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## CONTINUED",

Financial instruments continued\n\nThe following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n## Option and forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Silverstream contract\n\nThe fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs (Level 3). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/ or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.\n\nThe estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Pe\u00f1oles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the operational mine plan, with certain amendments to reflect a basis that a market participant would consider, that is provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.\n\nManagement regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.\n\nFor further information relating to the Silverstream contract see Note 13. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in Note 30.\n\n## Equity investments:\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2020, approximately 86% of the investments correspond to 9,746,193 shares (2019: 9,746,193 shares) of MAG Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$199.5 million (2019: US$114.4 million) and 6% of Endeavor, Inc. represented by 2,800,000 shares (2019: 2,800,000 shares) for an amount of US$14.1 million (2019: US$6.7 million). These equity investments are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2020 were US$20.47 (2019: US$11.74) and US$5.05 (2019: US$2.40), respectively.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Trade receivables:\n\nSales of concentrates, precipitates, dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon are 'provisionally priced' and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group's best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see Note 2(n)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and therefore the entire related trade receivable is measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, equity instruments at FVOCI, interestbearing loans and trade payables.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and the Group's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\nIn the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso and other foreign currencies which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and the payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nIn order to manage the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivatives financial instruments (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group's profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Strengthening/  (weakening)  of US dollar   | Effect on   profit before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   | Effect on equity:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 20%                                         | 2,792                                                                  | 30,056                                                    |\n|                          | (15%)                                       | (668)                                                                  | (12,378)                                                  |\n| 2019                     | 5%                                          | 694                                                                    | 2,295                                                     |\n|                          | (5%)                                        | (767)                                                                  | (1,939)                                                   |\n\nThe effects on profit before tax and equity of reasonably possible changes to the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso on the Silverstream contract are not material.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Silverstream contract valuation to a reasonably possible change in future silver prices, with all other inputs to the Silverstream valuation model held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in silver price is applied to all applicable periods in the valuation model. There is no impact on the Group's equity, other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Increase/  (decrease) in  silver price   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 45%                                      | 338,484                                                               |\n|                          | (45%)                                    | (338,494)                                                             |\n| 2019                     | 20%                                      | 146,873                                                               |\n|                          | (15%)                                    | (110,155)                                                             |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally relating to the cash balances and the Silverstream contract held at the balance sheet date. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Group's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\nEffect on profit\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/  (decrease)  in interest rate   | before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 25                                                     | 2,676                                               |\n|                          | (20)                                                   | (2,141)                                             |\n| 2019                     | 50                                                     | 1,683                                               |\n|                          | (50)                                                   | (1,683)                                             |\n\nThe sensitivity shown in the table above primarily relates to the full year of interest on cash balances held as at the year end.",

Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Group's financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in Note 26, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due, other than 'Other receivables' as disclosed in Note 15. The Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, the Group's sole customer throughout 2020 and 2019. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Pe\u00f1oles Group which currently owns 75 per cent of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating.\n\nThe Group's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor's) and above. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 22 percent of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which the total investment was held in short-term Mexican Government paper.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See Note 16 for the maximum credit exposure to cash and cash equivalents and Note 26 for related party trade and other receivables. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2020, being US$576.1 million (2019: US$541.2 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and equity instruments at FVOCI. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Group, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group's dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream contract.\n\nOne of the Group's metrics of capital is cash and other liquid assets which in 2020 and 2019 consisted of only cash and cash equivalents.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and equity securities which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\nThe basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the separated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nA number of new or amended standards (the Standards) became applicable for the current reporting period.

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe significant area of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial statements is:\n\n- \u00b7 Recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2(e) and 5):\n\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2020, the Company recognised a net impairment reversal of US$234.0 million (2019: impairment of US$911.2 million) to recognised a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$1,878.1 million (2019: US$2,112.1 million).\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Company's financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.\n\n## (e) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or having the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.\n\nWhen the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established.\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (f) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI); and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Company's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables from loans granted to related parties.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Company elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor loans granted to subsidiaries the Company evaluate the expecting credit loss using a one year probability of default corresponding to the mining industry determined by a specialised financial institution and considering an appropriate severity based on the cost of capital of the Group.\n\nFor other trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (g) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.\n\n## (h) Share capital\n\nOrdinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.\n\n## (i) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.\n\n## Trademark royalties\n\nTrademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.\n\n## (j) Income tax\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## (k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nIn the Group's consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company's stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.\n\nAny gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.\n\n## (l) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 16 and 17.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 in the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in Note 16.\n\n## (m) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.\n\nMexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals.\n\nDividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.\n\n## 3. Segment reporting\n\nSegmental information is not presented in the Company's stand-alone financial statements as this is presented in the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nCORPORATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION",

Management has considered a decrease in gold and silver of 20% and 45% respectively (2019: 10% gold, 15% silver). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$1,657.2 million (2019: US$577.5 million), Minera Mexicana la Ci\u00e9nega, S.A. de C.V. US$240.0 million (2019; US$85.1 million), Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. US$83.8 million (2019: US$186.4 million); and Minera San Juli\u00e1n, S.A. de C.V. US$141.9 million (2019: US$141.9 million).",

Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares only entitle the shareholder on winding up or on a return of capital to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary shareholders. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares at a price of \u00a31.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares. Except at the option of the Company the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares are not transferable.\n\n## Reserves\n\n## Share premium\n\nThis reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets acquired as part of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation and the nominal value of the shares issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Movements in this reserve during 2020 and 2019 represent the impairment losses and reversals of the carrying value of Fresnillo's investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in Note 2(f). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Company transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid.",

Dividends paid from the profits generated from 1 January 2014 to residents in Mexico and to non-resident shareholders may be subject to an additional tax of up to 10%, which will be withheld by the Group.\n\nIn late 2019, the Directors became aware of a technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act') whereby certain dividends paid between 2011 and 2019 (the 'Historic Dividends') had been made without having filed interim accounts in accordance with the Act. The relevant interim accounts have now been filed with the Registrar of Companies and these show that the Company had sufficient distributable reserves at the point at which each of the Historic Dividends was paid. It is the intention of the Directors, as a matter of prudence, to put forward a resolution to shareholders in due course to regularise the position. This decision will have no effect on the monies received pursuant to these dividends and will not adversely impact shareholders or the Company. Nevertheless, the Directors will keep the matter under review.\n\n## 10. Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023 that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for consideration of US$543.0 million. Additional accrued interest at the date of the repurchase included in the settlement amounted US$10.8 million. The premium paid on purchase of these notes of US$60.9 million was recognised in financial expenses. The settlement occurred on 2 October 2020.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2020  US$ thousands | 2019 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                                | 801,239             | 800,127             |\n| Issuance of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050 1     | 828,325             | -                   |\n| Repayments of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023     | (482,121)           | -                   |\n| Accrued interest                               | 48,873              | 46,267              |\n| Interest paid 2                                | (43,144)            | (46,267)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 3,498               | 1,112               |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,156,670           | 801,239             |\n\nThe Company has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the Senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Company is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Company shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Company may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUS cents per\n\nAmount",

The Company's exposure to currency and liquidity risk related to trade and other payables is disclosed in Note 17.\n\nFor total trade and other payables, balances corresponding to Other taxes and contributions and Accrued expenses are not considered as financial liabilities.\n\n## 12. Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the Company has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities ('SAT', by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n\n## 13. Related party balances and transactions\n\nRelated parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party and include the Company's subsidiaries disclosed in Note 5, as well as those entities who have a minority participation in Fresnillo Group companies. Related party balances will be settled in cash. All the balances as at 31 December 2020 and 2019 and the transactions carried-out with related parties for the years then ended correspond to subsidiaries.\n\n## (a) Related party accounts receivable and payable\n\n|         | Accounts receivable   US$ thousands   | Accounts receivable   US$ thousands   | Accounts payable   US$ thousands   | Accounts payable   US$ thousands   |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|         | 31 December  2020                     | 31 December   2019                    | 31 December  2020                  | 31 December   2019                 |\n| Loans 1 | 1,315,578                             | 1,240,385                             | 575,500                            | 746,869                            |\n| Other   | -                                     | 8,444                                 | 1,954                              | 5,937                              |\n| Total   | 1,315,578                             | 1,248,829                             | 577,454                            | 752,806                            |\n\nEffective interest rates on loans granted to related parties in US dollar range between 2.15% to 3.91% (2019: 3.91% to 4.33%) and in Mexican peso range 6.47% to 9.73% (2019: 9.74% to 10.34%).",

Financial Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Company's exposure to each of the above risks and the Company's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.\n\nThe Company's risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company's profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Strengthening/  (weakening)  of US dollar   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 20%                                         | (992)                                                                |\n|                          | (15%)                                       | 937                                                                  |\n| 2019                     | 5% (5%)                                     | (5) 5                                                                |\n\nThe Company's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/ (decrease)  in interest rate   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 25                                                    | 12                                                                   |\n|                          | (20)                                                  | (9)                                                                  |\n| 2019                     | 50                                                    | 55                                                                   |\n|                          | (50)                                                  | (55)                                                                 |\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nThe Company has exposure to changes in the price of equity instruments that it holds as available-for-sale financial assets.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Company's profit before tax and equity:\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Increase/ (decrease)   in equity price   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands   | Effect on equity:  increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                     | 70%                                      | -                                                                   | 148,803                                                  |\n|                          | (40%)                                    | -                                                                   | (85,031)                                                 |\n| 2019                     | 70%                                      | -                                                                   | 86,116                                                   |\n|                          | (25%)                                    | -                                                                   | (30,756)                                                 |\n\nExposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company's ordinary course of business and is applicable to trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, intercompany loans and derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe Company's policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties' failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company's financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in Note 13, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due. The Company's policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and equity investments at FVOCI. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company's dividend policy aims to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. The Company aim is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All /uniFB01gures rounded to re/uniFB02ect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate.\n- 2 Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq variable cut-offs grades are calculated by dividing the applicable costs by a variable Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities.\n- 3 The cut-off grade for Ci\u00e9nega's mineral resources varies between 181 and 288 g/t AgEq\n- 4 The Mega Centauro resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,600/oz Au price. Soledad-Dipolos, and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,400/oz Au price.\n- 5 Mega Centauro mineral resources are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 g/t Au and below 0.57 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material above 0.30 g/t and below 0.35 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.57 g/t Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.35 g/t Au reports to the mill.\n- 6 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access.\n- -   Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,600.00 for Mega Centauro, US$/oz 1,400.00 for all other properties), Silver (US$/oz 17.50), Lead (US$/lb 0.90) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.05).\n\n<!-- image -->",

All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Composites were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades, assuming reasonable metal recoveries. Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candame\u00f1a,and Rodeo mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulfide material. Equivalent metal grades are based on US$1,400 per ounce of gold, US$17.50 per ounce of silver, US$1.05 per pound of zinc, US$0.90 per pound of lead and US$2.95 per pound of copper.\n- 2 Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.\n- 3 Portions of the Valdeca\u00f1as deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest.

Additionally, based on mining method, floor dilution is included, and appropriate mining recovery factors are applied.\n- 3 The cut-off grades for the Ci\u00e9nega reserve vary between 186 and 411 g/t AgEq.\n- 4 Reserves have no additional dilution added to that inherent in the Selective Mining Unit (SMU) of 15m x 15m x 8m. Reserves are converted from resources through the process of pit optimization, pit design, production schedule and supported by a Minera Penmont cash flow model.\n- 5 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material above 0.30 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.57 g/t Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.35 g/t Au reports to the mill.\n- 6 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. In 2019 this material has been removed from reserves due to minimal progress on the outstanding legal items\n- and lack of detailed engineering.\n- -   Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,600.00 for Mega Centauro, US$/oz 1,400.00 for all other properties), Silver (US$/oz 17.50), Lead (US$/lb 0.90) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.05).\n- -   The reserves are valid as of May 31, 2020. All topography is valid as of May 31, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ore Reserves are reported at NSR cut-off value based on metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, mining costs, processing costs, G&A costs, sustaining capital costs, and variable smelting and transportation costs.\n- \u00b7 JORC Code was used for reporting Ore Reserves.\n- \u00b7 NSR values are calculated as:\n- -   NSR = 28.65*Au+0.40*Ag+16.48*Pb+12.07*Zn. -   Units gold (g/t), silver (g/t), lead (%), zinc (%)\n- \u00b7 NSR factors are based on metal prices of US$1,400/oz Au, US$17.50/oz Ag, US$0.90/lb Pb, and US$1.05/lb Zn and estimated recoveries of 81.15% Au, 94.62% Ag, 92.80% Pb, and 89.80% Zn.\n- \u00b7 Payable metal assumptions for Au are 95% for lead concentrates, 98% for precipitate, and 65% for zinc concentrate; for Ag: 95% for lead concentrates, 97% for precipitate, and 70% for zinc concentrate. Lead 95% payable and zinc 85% payable.\n- \u00b7 The all-inclusive stope cut-off value is US$100/t for longhole and US$110/t for Cut and Fill, marginal stope cut-off value is US$65/t.\n- \u00b7 The stope hangingwall and footwall dilution (ELOS) was included in the stope optimisation process. The dilution thickness for stope hangingwall and footwall are 0.7m and 0.4m respectively.\n- \u00b7 An additional operational dilution of 10% is applied to the reserve calculation.\n- \u00b7 Mining recovery factors range from 95% for backfilled stopes to 85% for sill pillars. CAF has a 95% recovery.\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate of 22 MXP to US$1.\n\n## Competent Person for the Ore Reserve statement for Minerva Juanicipio Mine.\n\nGary Methven, P.Eng., RPEQ, has verified the reserve estimations for the Minera Juanicipio Mine. Gary Methven has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralization and type of deposits under consideration and to the activities being undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the JORC Code. Gary Methven is independent of Fresnillo.",

These calls come from fraudsters operating in 'boiler rooms', mostly based abroad. While high profits are promised,\n\nthose who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money. Most victims are experienced investors, losing on average \u00a320,000.\n\n## Protect yourself\n\nIf you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research reports, take these steps before handing over any money:\n\n- 1. Get the name of the person and organisation.\n- 2. Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/register to ensure they are authorised.\n- 3. Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.\n- 4. Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.\n- 5.  Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with.\n- 6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\nIf you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review the latest scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## For further information, please visit our website:\n\nwww.fresnilloplc.com or contact:\n\nFresnillo plc Tel: +44(0)20 7399 2470 Gabriela Mayor, Head of Investor Relations",

These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms 'believes', 'estimates', 'plans', 'projects', 'anticipates', 'expects', 'intends', 'may', 'will', or 'should' or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this document and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group's results of operations, financial position, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the silver and gold industries. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances.\n\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results of the Group's operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates, may differ materially from those described in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. In addition, even if the results of operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this document, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of factors could cause results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business conditions, industry trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations (including the US dollar and Mexican peso exchange rates), the Group's ability to recover its reserves or develop new reserves, including its ability to convert its resources into reserves and its mineral potential into resources or reserves, changes in its business strategy, political and economic uncertainty.\n\nForward-looking statements may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this document, reflect the Group's current view with respect to future events and are subject to risks relating to future events and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to the Group's operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. Investors should specifically consider the factors identified in this document which could cause actual results to differ before making an investment decision. Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules or applicable law, the Group explicitly disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to release the result of any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this document that may occur due to any change in the Group's expectations or to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION",
