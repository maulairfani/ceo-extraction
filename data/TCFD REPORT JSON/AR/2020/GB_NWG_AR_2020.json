Substant/uni0069al government-backed /uni0069ntervent/uni0069ons kept ent/uni0069re /uni0069ndustr/uni0069es afloat and m/uni0069ll/uni0069ons of people /uni0069n work.\n\nThese measures were generally welcome and necessary and there has been pos/uni0069t/uni0069ve progress /uni0069n develop/uni0069ng and roll/uni0069ng out vacc/uni0069nes. But a return to anyth/uni0069ng approach/uni0069ng normal/uni0069ty w/uni0069ll take some t/uni0069me and be very d/uni0069fferent to what went before.\n\nAt the last m/uni0069nute, the trade agreement w/uni0069th the European Un/uni0069on avo/uni0069ded a d/uni0069sorderly ex/uni0069t. But there /uni0069s st/uni0069ll a lot of work to do and s/uni0069gn/uni0069ficant uncerta/uni0069nty pers/uni0069sts, part/uni0069cularly /uni0069n areas such as financ/uni0069al serv/uni0069ces. It rema/uni0069ns to be seen how cross-border ent/uni0069t/uni0069es w/uni0069ll be regulated and what level of regulatory equ/uni0069valence between the UK and EU w/uni0069ll be secured.\n\nAs a largely UK-focused bank, the d/uni0069rect /uni0069mpact of Brex/uni0069t /uni0069s not as s/uni0069gn/uni0069ficant for NatWest Group as /uni0069t /uni0069s for banks w/uni0069th larger EU or markets operat/uni0069ons. We are as prepared as we can be through our well-cap/uni0069tal/uni0069sed and fully operat/uni0069onal ent/uni0069t/uni0069es /uni0069n the EU. Any w/uni0069der econom/uni0069c /uni0069mpacts w/uni0069ll, however, clearly have /uni0069mpl/uni0069cat/uni0069ons for the bank's performance. Our focus cont/uni0069nues to be on prov/uni0069d/uni0069ng support for our customers as the new UK-EU trad/uni0069ng relat/uni0069onsh/uni0069p develops.\n\n## F/uni0069nanc/uni0069al performance\n\nIt /uni0069s always d/uni0069sappo/uni0069nt/uni0069ng to report a loss, even /uni0069f our performance /uni0069n 2020 was largely a reflect/uni0069on of the /uni0069mpact that COVID-19 had on our customers and the economy and the fact that we took a large prov/uni0069s/uni0069on under IFRS9 to cover potent/uni0069al future loan losses as the full /uni0069mpact of the pandem/uni0069c becomes clearer. We also saw a s/uni0069gn/uni0069ficant decl/uni0069ne /uni0069n share pr/uni0069ces across the UK bank/uni0069ng sector,\n\n/uni0069nclud/uni0069ng our own. Aga/uni0069n, th/uni0069s was to be expected g/uni0069ven the preva/uni0069l/uni0069ng econom/uni0069c cond/uni0069t/uni0069ons and there was a degree of pos/uni0069t/uni0069ve momentum towards the end of the year as a Brex/uni0069t deal was reached and a vacc/uni0069nat/uni0069on programme put /uni0069n place.\n\nThe pers/uni0069stently low /uni0069nterest rate env/uni0069ronment and ongo/uni0069ng COVID-19 restr/uni0069ct/uni0069ons w/uni0069ll cont/uni0069nue to challenge financ/uni0069al performance amongst all UK banks for the foreseeable future. However, desp/uni0069te the tough operat/uni0069ng env/uni0069ronment, the bank /uni0069s mak/uni0069ng good progress aga/uni0069nst /uni0069ts strategy. We cont/uni0069nued to grow /uni0069n key areas of focus and our strong levels of cap/uni0069tal and l/uni0069qu/uni0069d/uni0069ty mean we are well pos/uni0069t/uni0069oned to nav/uni0069gate the ongo/uni0069ng uncerta/uni0069nty.\n\nIn sp/uni0069te of numerous lockdowns, 2020 was an extremely busy per/uni0069od for many of our colleagues, most of whom were work/uni0069ng at home for much of the year. We rece/uni0069ved over 100,000 appl/uni0069cat/uni0069ons for the government-backed Bounce Back Loan Scheme /uni0069n the five days follow/uni0069ng /uni0069ts launch. And, by the end of 2020, 22% of our mortgage customers had taken a mortgage repayment hol/uni0069day at some po/uni0069nt dur/uni0069ng the year. We also kept almost all of our branches open. For our colleagues, pay was protected unt/uni0069l the end of September 2020, regardless of the need to take t/uni0069me off for COVID-19 related /uni0069llness, dependants care, /uni0069solat/uni0069on or ch/uni0069ldcare. But our remunerat/uni0069on needs to reflect the d/uni0069fficult econom/uni0069c c/uni0069rcumstances. Most of our colleagues do not rece/uni0069ve annual bonuses, but for those who are el/uni0069g/uni0069ble the overall pool has been cut back sharply by around a th/uni0069rd.\n\n## Susta/uni0069nable returns\n\nIn March 2020, follow/uni0069ng a formal request from the Prudent/uni0069al Regulat/uni0069on Author/uni0069ty (PRA), and /uni0069n l/uni0069ne w/uni0069th all our UK peers, the Board undertook not to make any d/uni0069v/uni0069dend payments /uni0069n 2020. We also undertook not to set out any d/uni0069str/uni0069but/uni0069on plans or to take part /uni0069n a share buyback dur/uni0069ng the course of the year. We understand the act/uni0069ons taken by the regulator g/uni0069ven the except/uni0069onal c/uni0069rcumstances. However, these restr/uni0069ct/uni0069ons were clearly a d/uni0069sappo/uni0069ntment for many shareholders and /uni0069mpacted the /uni0069nvestab/uni0069l/uni0069ty and share pr/uni0069ce performance of all UK banks.\n\nIn December 2020, the PRA made the welcome announcement that /uni0069t was l/uni0069ft/uni0069ng the restr/uni0069ct/uni0069ons on cap/uni0069tal returns, subject to certa/uni0069n sens/uni0069ble guardra/uni0069ls.

Central functions manages NatWest Group capital resources and NatWest Groupwide regulatory projects and provides services to the reportable segments.\n\n## Allocation of central items\n\nNatWest Group allocates all central costs relating to Services and Functions to the business using appropriate drivers, these are reported as indirect costs in the segmental income statements. Assets and risk-weighted assets held centrally, mainly relating to NatWest Group Treasury, are allocated to the business using appropriate drivers.\n\n## Non-IFRS financial information\n\nNatWest Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with the basis set out in the accounting policies, page 264, which constitutes a body of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).This document contains a number of adjusted or alternative performance measures, also known as non-GAAP or non-IFRS performance measures. These measures are adjusted for certain items which management believe are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-onperiod comparison. The non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include the calculation of metrics that are used throughout the banking industry. These non-IFRS financial measures are not measures within the scope of IFRS and are not a substitute for IFRS financial measures. Refer to the section, 'Non-IFRS financial measures', on pages 339 to 342 for further information and calculations of non-IFRS financial measures included throughout this document, and, where relevant, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures.\n\n## Business Developments\n\nIn December 2020, we acquired a \u00a33.0 billion portfolio of prime UK mortgages from Metro Bank plc. Growing the mortgage book is an important strategic priority, as NatWest Group builds a bank that delivers sustainable returns for shareholders. The addition of this loan book will supplement the strong organic growth that we continue to achieve.\n\nBusiness Rev\n\ni\n\ne\n\nw",

(2) 2019 Includes \u00a3290 million arising on the completion of the Alawwal bank merger, \u00a31,102 million arising on the liquidation of RFS Holdings and \u00a367 million in\n- (3) IFRS volatility relates to loans which are economically hedged but for which hedge accounting is not permitted under IFRS.\n- (4) Asset disposals/strategic risk reduction in 2020 relates to the cost of exiting positions and the impact of risk reduction transactions entered into, in respect of the strategic announcement on 14 February 2020. Prior period comparatives refer to the previously disclosed NatWest Markets legacy business disposal losses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\n- \uf0b7 Total income decreased by \u00a33,457 million, or 24.3%. Excluding notable items, income decreased by \u00a3958 million, or 7.9%, due to reductions across the retail and commercial businesses, partially offset by higher NatWest Markets income reflecting increased customer activity as the market reacted to the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n- \uf0b7 Income across the retail and commercial businesses, excluding notable items, decreased by 10.0% reflecting the lower yield curve, mortgage margin dilution, subdued business activity and lower consumer spending. Increased lending, whilst maintaining a disciplined approach to risk, has partially offset, with gross new mortgage lending of \u00a331.5 billion in Retail Banking and drawdowns against UK Government lending schemes in Commercial Banking.\n\n- \uf0b7 Bank net interest margin (NIM) of 1.71% was 28 basis points lower than 2019, principally reflecting the impact of the falling yield curve and mortgage margin dilution, although this partly receded in the latter part of the year.\n- \uf0b7 Structural hedges of \u00a3159 billion generated \u00a31.1 billion of incremental net interest income for the year, compared with \u00a30.6 billion of incremental net interest income on a balance of \u00a3159 billion in 2019.",

Headcount reduced by c.4,100, or 6.4%.\n- \uf0b7 Strategic costs of \u00a31,013 million included \u00a3256 million related to property charges, \u00a3173 million redundancy costs and a \u00a3154 million charge related to technology spend.\n- \uf0b7 Litigation and conduct costs of \u00a3113 million represent \u00a3473 million of additional charges offset by various releases as programmes conclude, including a \u00a3277 million PPI release, with final agreement reached on 18 February 2021 with the Official Receiver in relation to a portfolio of historical PPI claims. The additional charges mainly represent increased cost of review and execution of Other Customer Redress as well as Litigation provisions.\n\n| Impairments                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019* \u00a3m   | Variance \u00a3m   | Variance \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Loans - amortised cost and FVOCI          | 372,399   | 336,833    | 35,566        | 11%           |\n| ECL provisions                            | 6,186     | 3,792      | 2,394         | 63%           |\n| ECL provisions coverage ratio (%)         | 1.66      | 1.13       | 0.53          | 47%           |\n| Impairment losses                         |           |            |               |               |\n| ECL charge                                | 3,242     | 696        | 2,546         | nm            |\n| ECL loss rate - annualised (basis points) | 87        | 20         | 67            | nm            |\n| Amounts written off                       | 937       | 792        | 145           | 18%           |\n\n*2019 data has been restated for the accounting policy change for balances held with central banks.

Refer to Credit Risk - Banking activities in the Risk and capital management section for further details.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\n- \uf0b7 The net impairment loss of \u00a33,242 million increased by \u00a32,546 million compared with 2019, predominantly driven by stage one and two charges which reflected the expected deterioration in the economic environment. Stage three impairment losses were \u00a3616 million as government support measures mitigated defaults across lending portfolios and associated ECL stage migration. Total impairment provisions increased by \u00a32.4 billion to \u00a36.2 billion, mainly reflecting expected credit losses on non-defaulted portfolios, and the ECL coverage ratio increased from 1.13% to 1.66%.\n\n| Tax                     | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Tax charge              | 83        | 432       |\n| UK corporation tax rate | 19.0%     | 19.0%     |\n| Effective tax rate      | (23.7%)   | 10.2%     |\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\n- \uf0b7 A tax charge of \u00a383 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 arises rather than the expected tax credit of \u00a367 million based on the UK statutory tax rate of 19%. The higher tax charge reflects a reduction in the carrying value of the Group's deferred tax asset in respect of Irish tax losses, UK banking surcharge, and other non-deductible items such as UK bank levy. These factors have been partially offset by the impact on the Group's UK net deferred tax asset of the increased tax rate from 1 April 2020, enacted by the Finance Act 2020.

Refer to Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020 for further details.\n\n## Note:\n\n(1) Tangible net asset value per ordinary share represents tangible equity divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue.\n\n- \uf0b7 Total assets of \u00a3799.5 billion as at 31 December 2020 increased by \u00a376.5 billion, 11%, compared with 31 December 2019. This was primarily driven by increases in cash and balances at central banks, loans to customers and derivatives, partially offset by reductions in trading assets, settlement balances and other financial assets.\n- \uf0b7 Cash and balances at central banks increased by \u00a343.5 billion, 54%, to \u00a3124.5 billion mainly as a result of a net customer funding surplus driven by significant deposit inflows from March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 Trading assets decreased by \u00a37.8 billion, 10%, to \u00a369.0 billion mainly driven by reductions in reverse repos and cash collateral. Trading liabilities decreased by \u00a31.7 billion, 2%, to \u00a372.3 billion due to reductions in repos.\n- \uf0b7 Derivative assets were up \u00a316.5 billion, 11%, to \u00a3166.5 billion, and liabilities, increased by \u00a313.8 billion, 9% to \u00a3160.7 billion. These movements were driven by an increase in underlying volumes, together with an increase in mark-to-market driven by a downward shift in interest rate yields and FX rate fluctuation across major currencies in the year.\n- \uf0b7 Loans to customers - amortised cost, increased by \u00a333.6 billion, 10%, to \u00a3360.5 billion including \u00a313.4 billion in Retail Banking, as a result of strong new gross mortgage lending and retention, \u00a37.0 billion in Commercial Banking as \u00a312.6 billion drawdowns against UK Government lending schemes were partially offset by lower specialised business lending and increased loan provisions and \u00a312.5 billion in Treasury as part of liquidity management.\n- \uf0b7 Other financial assets include debt securities, equity shares and other loans, decreased by \u00a36.3 billion, 10%, to \u00a355.1 billion, primarily driven by reductions in debt securities.\n\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits increased by \u00a362.5 billion, 17%, to \u00a3431.7 billion including increases of \u00a321.5 billion in Retail Banking, \u00a332.7 billion in Commercial Banking and \u00a33.8 billion in Private Banking as customers retained liquidity in light of economic uncertainty, combined with the impact of government and central bank actions in response to COVID-19 schemes.\n- \uf0b7 Other financial liabilities, which includes customer deposits at fair value through profit and loss and debt securities in issue, increased by \u00a30.6 billion, 1%, to \u00a345.8 billion.\n- \uf0b7 Subordinated liabilities have remained at \u00a39.9 billion. Reflecting new issuances of \u00a31.6 billion and a reclassification from equity of \u00a31.6 billion, offset by redemptions of \u00a33.1 billion.\n- \uf0b7 Other liabilities decreased by \u00a31.2 billion, 15%, to \u00a36.4 billion mainly due to reductions in provisions and accruals in the year.\n- \uf0b7 Owners' equity increased by \u00a30.3 billion, 1%, to \u00a343.8 billion, driven by a net increase in paid-in equity, partially offset by the loss for the year, paid-in equity dividends paid and redemption and reclassification of paid-in equity.",

Additionally, approximately 17,000, or 2% of Retail Banking personal loan customers were active on repayment holidays as at Q4 2020.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group acquired a \u00a33.0 billion prime UK mortgage portfolio from Metro Bank plc on 18 December 2020. The impact on full year 2020 operating profit was a \u00a358 million loss on acquisition, a \u00a32 million increase in net interest income and a \u00a39 million increase in impairment losses. The impact on the Q4 2020 balance sheet was to increase net loans to customers by \u00a33.0 billion and RWAs by \u00a31.2 billion. The portfolio will be earnings accretive within two years.\n- \uf0b7 Total income was \u00a3685 million, or 14.1%, lower as regulatory changes and COVID-19 support measures impacted fee income, combined with lower deposit returns and unsecured balances, partially offset by strong balance growth in mortgages and customer deposits.\n- \uf0b7 Net interest margin decreased by 34 basis points reflecting the impact of the lower yield curve on deposit returns, lower unsecured balances and mortgage margin pressure, as front book margins were lower than back book margins.\n\n- \uf0b7 Other expenses decreased by \u00a3108 million, or 4.5%, reflecting a significant reduction in headcount, enabled by digital transformation benefits and increased digital adoption, lower fraud costs and COVID-19 slowing down investment spend. Litigation and conduct costs were \u00a319 million.\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses of \u00a3792 million largely reflect significant Stage two ECL uplifts taken in H1 2020 for expected future economic deterioration.\n- \uf0b7 Net loans to customers increased by \u00a313.4 billion, or 8.4%, as a result of strong gross new mortgage lending and retention. Gross new mortgage lending was \u00a331.5 billion with flow share of 13%, supporting a stock share of 10.9%, up from 10.2% at Q4 2019. Personal advances and cards reduced by \u00a31.2 billion and \u00a30.5 billion respectively reflecting lower spend and higher repayments due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits increased by \u00a321.5 billion, or 14.3%, as UK Government backed initiatives for COVID-19, combined with restrictions, resulted in lower customer spend and increased savings.\n- \uf0b7 RWAs decreased by \u00a31.1 billion, or 2.9%, supported by lower personal unsecured balances.\n\nBusiness Rev\n\ni\n\ne\n\nw",

As a result, we are to begin a phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland over the coming years which will be undertaken with careful consideration of the impact on customers and our colleagues.\n- \uf0b7 Throughout the difficulties and uncertainties of 2020, U lster Bank RoI has continued to support its customers through COVID-19 by keeping its branches, cash and call centres open throughout and by making significant improvements to its digital platforms. During 2020 almost 18,000 payment breaks were provided, with 82% returning to payment arrangements as at 31 December 2020. Additionally, Ulster Bank RoI continued to support its commercial customers by providing them assistance with the Future Growth Loan and Credit Guarantee schemes initiated by the Irish government.\n- \uf0b7 Total income decreased by \u20ac73 million, or 11.3%, reflecting lower lending volumes and fee income due to the impact of COVID-19, lower FX gains, lower hedging income and a one-off swap breakage benefit in 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Net Interest margin decreased by 9 basis points due to the impact of negative rates on increased liquid assets.\n- \uf0b7 Other expenses decreased by \u20ac25 million, or 4.7%, reflecting a 6.9% headcount reduction following the scale-down of functional teams and lower marketing, back office and project costs, partially offset by higher pension costs due to a one-off credit in 2019.\n\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses of \u20ac281 million reflect the charges taken in the first half of 2020 which were significantly impacted by the uncertain economic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 Net loans to customers decreased by \u20ac1.4 billion, or 6.5%, as repayments exceeded gross new lending of \u20ac2.1 billion, combined with a \u20ac0.3 billion de-recognition of non-performing loans (NPLs) from a sale agreed in Q4 2019, and increased loan provisions.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits increased by \u20ac0.1 billion, or 0.5%, due to a large one-off placement at the end of the year, partially offset by earlier reductions in commercial balances due to pricing changes, including the implementation of negative rates on large and midsized corporate customers and non-bank financial institutions.\n- \uf0b7 RWAs decreased by \u20ac2.1 billion, or 13.7%, reflecting the impact of NPL de-recognitions and lower lending volumes.",

During 2020, \u00a38.6 billion BBLS, \u00a33.9 billion CBILS and \u00a31.3 billion CLBILS had been approved. Since 22 March 2020 Commercial Banking provided payment holidays on over 74,000 customer accounts and as at 31 December 2020 had active payment holidays on c.11,000 customer accounts, representing 4% of the lending book by value.\n- \uf0b7 Total income decreased by \u00a3360 million, or 8.3%, reflecting lower deposit returns and subdued transactional business activity, combined with a \u00a321 million increase in fair value and disposal losses, primarily through risk mitigation actions.\n- \uf0b7 Net interest margin decreased by 27 basis points reflecting the impact of the lower yield curve on deposit returns and increased liquidity portfolio costs from higher deposit volumes, partially offset by deposit repricing.\n- \uf0b7 Other expenses, excluding OLD, increased by \u00a318 million, or 0.9%, as \u00a380 million higher back office operations costs, increased innovation spend and \u00a319 million lower VAT recoveries were partially offset by a headcount reduction of 1.0% following operating model efficiencies in the second half of 2019 and COVID19 slowing down investment spend.\n\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses of \u00a31,927 million primarily reflect the deterioration of the economic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic driving significant stage two charges, with total stage three charges of \u00a3318 million, including a small number of single name charges.\n- \uf0b7 Net loans to customers increased by \u00a37.0 billion, or 6.9%, as \u00a312.6 billion drawdowns against UK Government lending schemes were partially offset by lower specialised business lending and increased loan provisions. Revolving credit facility (RCF) utilisation decreased to c.22% of committed facilities, below Q4 2019 pre-COVID-19 levels of c.27% and significantly lower than the peak of c.40% in April 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits increased by \u00a332.7 billion, or 24.2%, as customers built and retained liquidity in light of economic uncertainty combined with the impact of government and central bank actions in light of COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 RWAs increased by \u00a32.6 billion, or 3.6%, reflecting volume growth and \u00a32.4 billion higher risk parameters, partially offset by a \u00a30.8 billion reduction related to active capital management and a c.\u00a31.5 billion reduction reflecting the CRR COVID-19 amendment to accelerate the planned changes to the SME supporting factor and the introduction of an Infrastructure supporting factor.\n\nBusiness Rev\n\ni\n\ne\n\nw",

The net impact on full year 2019 operating profit would have been to increase total income by \u00a344 million and other expenses by \u00a38 million. The net impact on the Q4 2019 balance sheet would have been to increase customer deposits by \u00a30.2 billion. AUMs would have been \u00a34.6 billion higher, with a corresponding decrease in AUAs. Variances in the commentary below have been adjusted for the impact of this transfer.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\n- \uf0b7 Private Banking remains committed to supporting clients through a range of initiatives, including the provision of mortgage and personal loan repayment deferrals in appropriate circumstances and via participation in the UK Government's financial support schemes. During 2020, \u00a358 million BBLS, \u00a3237 million CBILS and \u00a344 million CLBILS had been approved.\n- \uf0b7 Total income decreased by \u00a358 million, or 7.1%, primarily reflecting lower deposit funding benefits and a reduction in fee income partially offset by balance sheet growth.\n- \uf0b7 Net Interest margin decreased by 35 basis points reflecting lower deposit funding benefits and higher liquidity portfolio costs.\n- \uf0b7 Other expenses increased by \u00a319 million, or 4.3%, reflecting higher investment spend focused on enhancing the client proposition and a number of one-off items partially offset by lower back office operations costs.\n\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses of \u00a3100 million primarily reflect stage one and two charges due to the deterioration of the economic outlook, with total stage three charges of \u00a315 million.\n- \uf0b7 Net loans to customers increased by \u00a31.5 billion, or 9.7%, supported by \u00a30.7 billion of mortgage lending growth and \u00a30.3 billion drawdowns against UK Government lending schemes. RWAs increased by \u00a30.8 billion, or 7.9%, primarily reflecting increased lending volumes.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits increased by \u00a33.8 billion, or 13.3%, reflecting \u00a32.3 billion of commercial inflows and \u00a31.5 billion of personal inflows.\n- \uf0b7 AUMAs increased by \u00a31.7 billion, or 5.6%, reflecting positive investment performance of \u00a30.9 billion and net new money inflows of \u00a30.8 billion, which were impacted by EEA resident client outflows following the UK's exit from the EU.\n\n2020\n\n\u00a3m\n\n\u00a3m\n\n\u00a3bn\n\n2019\n\nVariance",

As progress has been made against the strategy, RWAs have reduced and the business is ahead of its plan to achieve the medium-term reduction to \u00a320 billion.\n- \uf0b7 By accelerating its transformation to become a more integrated and sustainable part of NatWest Group, NatWest Markets has focussed on what it does best and what matters to NatWest Group's customers. The product offering has been simplified and in Q2 2020 NatWest Markets entered an agreement with BNP Paribas to provide 'house' Futures and associated back office services. NatWest Markets has consolidated certain customer coverage teams and services and functional teams with their counterparts from across NatWest Group, enhancing our collaborative approach to customers.\n- \uf0b7 Total income decreased by \u00a3219 million, or 16.3%, reflecting the \u00a3444 million Alawwal bank merger gain in 2019 and an increase in disposal losses of \u00a348 million partially offset by stronger business performance in the current year.\n\n- \uf0b7 Income excluding asset disposals/strategic risk reduction, OCA and notable items increased by \u00a3217 million, or 21.4%,  reflecting a strong performance over the year, particularly in the first half of 2020 as customer activity increased as the market reacted to the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n- \uf0b7 Other expenses decreased by \u00a3140 million, or 11.9%, reflecting continued reductions in line with the strategic announcement in February 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses of \u00a340 million reflect the impact of stage two charges taken in the first half of 2020 compared with a net impairment release of \u00a351 million in the prior year for a small number of legacy cases.\n- \uf0b7 RWAs decreased by \u00a311.0 billion, or 29.0%, as market risk and counterparty credit risk decreased by \u00a33.6 billion and \u00a33.5 billion respectively and credit risk decreased by \u00a33.4 billion as the business exceeded its target for RWA reductions over the course of 2020.",

As the UK entered a national lockdown in March, our Board transitioned swiftly and smoothly to frequent virtual meetings. The Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) and wider executive management team kept the Board informed on our pandemic response, supporting effective Board oversight and challenge as the organisation pivoted its operations at pace, focusing on our customers' financial health, prioritising colleague safety and wellbeing, and helping our local communities.\n\nNatWest Group has made great strides as it focuses on becoming a purpose-led organisation. As a Board, we are working hard to embed our purpose in Board discussions and decision-making, ensuring different stakeholder needs are considered. Our section 172(1) statement on page 48 provides further information on our approach and includes case study examples.\n\n## Board and committee changes\n\nWe said farewell to two of our longer-serving directors during 2020. Alison Davis stepped down on 31 March 2020, and Baroness Noakes left the Board on 31 July 2020. I would like to record my thanks to Alison and Sheila for their immense contribution during their time with NatWest Group.\n\nOn 1 April 2020 Yasmin Jetha re-joined the Board of NatWest Group plc, having first been appointed in June 2017. Yasmin stepped down in April 2018 in order to serve solely as a director of our key ring-fenced entities, and, like the majority of our directors, she continues to serve on these boards in addition to the Board of NatWest Group plc. The following Board Committee chair and membership changes were also made during\n\n2020:-\n\n- \uf0b7 On 1 April 2020 Yasmin Jetha was appointed Chair of the Technology and Innovation Committee and joined the Group Sustainable Banking Committee.\n- \uf0b7 On 1 August 2020 Morten Friis assumed the Chair of the Group Board Risk Committee and joined the Group Nominations & Governance Committee.\n- \uf0b7 Lena Wilson stepped down as a member of the Technology and Innovation Committee on 31 March 2020; and joined the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee on 1 April 2020 and the Group Board Risk Committee on 1 August 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Robert Gillespie stepped down as a member of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee on 31 July 2020 and joined the Group Audit Committee on 1 August 2020.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nIn 2020, the Board and Committee evaluation was conducted by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. The review concluded that the Board and its Committees continue to operate effectively and within their terms of reference. Further information on the 2020 internal evaluation can be found on page 104.\n\nFurther details on how the Board operated during 2020, including principal areas of Board focus, are set out on page 101.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code 2018\n\nAll directors are committed to observing high standards of corporate governance, integrity and professionalism.\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) can be found in this Corporate governance report under the Code's 5 main section headings. A formal statement of compliance with the Code can be found on page 151.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their resilience and dedication throughout what has been an exceptional year.\n\nHoward Davies Chairman of the Board 1 9 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\n## How the Board operated in 2020\n\nIn March, reflecting the scale of the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, the Board's operating rhythm was revised to facilitate regular updates from the Group CEO and executive management team. A cycle of weekly meetings, later moving to fortnightly, supplemented the Board's scheduled meetings, and all meetings took place virtually.\n\nAt each scheduled Board meeting the directors received reports from the Chairman, Board Committee Chairs, Group CEO, Group Chief Financial Officer (Group CFO) and other members of the executive management team, as appropriate. Other senior executives attended Board meetings throughout the year to present reports to the Board. This provided the Board with an opportunity to engage directly with management on key issues and supports succession planning.\n\nDuring 2020 there was continued focus on the Board and Group Executive Committee (ExCo) operating rhythm to support a proactive and transparent agenda planning and paper preparation process. This process includes the following key elements:-\n\n- \uf0b7 A pre-Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO, Group CFO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary to ensure the Board and executive management are aligned on Board agendas.\n- \uf0b7 A post Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, to discuss what went well/could be improved after each meeting.\n- \uf0b7 A look ahead paper at each ExCo and Board meeting setting out key items that will be discussed at the next meeting.\n\n## Principal areas of Board focus in 2020\n\nAs in 2019, a short set of Board Objectives was adopted, closely aligned to our purpose and strategic priorities. These have supported agenda planning and helped to guide how the Board spends its time, ensuring appropriate focus on the longer-term and strategic issues. An overview of the principal areas of Board focus during 2020 is set out below:-\n\n## Purpose and Strategy\n\n- \uf0b7 Strategy development and implementation\n- \uf0b7 Consideration and approval of new purpose\n- \uf0b7 Company change of name\n- \uf0b7 Purpose and progress against external sustainability commitments\n\n## Customers\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 updates\n- \uf0b7 Business reviews from main customer businesses\n- \uf0b7 Customer experience\n\n## Colleagues\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 updates\n- \uf0b7 Executive appointments and executive succession planning\n- \uf0b7 Talent session\n- \uf0b7 Colleague opinion survey results\n\n## Culture\n\n- \uf0b7 Banking Standards Board (BSB) culture assessment report\n- \uf0b7 Modern Slavery and Human Rights statements\n\n## Risk & Conduct\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 updates\n- \uf0b7 Risk reports\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory submissions\n- \uf0b7 Risk appetite framework\n\n## Financial\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 updates\n- \uf0b7 Capital distributions\n- \uf0b7 Financial plans (budget, cost and investment and scenario planning)\n- \uf0b7 Brexit updates\n- \uf0b7 Annual and quarterly results\n- \uf0b7 IFRS9\n\n## Legal, Governance & Regulatory\n\n- \uf0b7 Annual General Meeting (AGM) arrangements\n- \uf0b7 Board evaluation outcomes and Board objectives\n- \uf0b7 Legal and regulatory reports\n- \uf0b7 Material regulatory correspondence\n- \uf0b7 Annual review of the governance framework and terms of reference for the Board and its Committees\n\nThe Board also held two strategy sessions with the executive management team, in June and October 2020. This provided an opportunity for the Board to assess opportunities and risks to the future success of the business, the sustainability of the company's business model and how its governance contributes to the delivery of its strategy.\n\n## Subsidiary governance and ring-fencing\n\nNatWest Group plc is a listed company with equity listed on the London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nNatWest Holdings Limited (NWH) is the holding company for our ring-fenced operations, which include our retail, commercial and wealth management services. A common board structure is operated such that directors of NWH are also directors of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, National Westminster Bank Plc and Ulster Bank Limited. Known collectively as the NWH Sub Group, the boards of these four entities meet concurrently.\n\nAn integral part of NatWest Group's governance arrangements is the appointment of three Double Independent Non-Executive Directors (DINEDs) to the boards, and board committees, of the NWH Sub Group.\n\nThe DINEDs are independent in two respects: (i) independent of management as nonexecutives; and (ii) independent of the rest of NatWest Group\n\nby virtue of their NWH Sub Group-only directorships.\n\nThe DINEDs play a critical role in NatWest Group's ring-fencing governance structure, and are responsible for exercising appropriate oversight of the independence and effectiveness of the NWH Sub Group's governance arrangements, including the ability of each board to take decisions independently.\n\nThe DINEDs attend NatWest Group plc Board meetings in an observer capacity.\n\nThe governance arrangements for the boards and board committees of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group have been designed to enable NatWest Group plc to exercise appropriate oversight and to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, the NWH Sub Group is able to take decisions independently of the wider Group.\n\nNatWest Markets supports NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customers through NatWest Markets Plc and its subsidiaries.\n\nRBS International serves retail, commercial and corporate customers and financial institutions and operates through The Royal Bank of Scotland International (Holdings) Limited and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group Nominations and Governance Committee monitors the governance arrangements of NatWest Group plc and its subsidiaries and approves appointments to the boards of principal and material regulated subsidiaries, as described in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee report on page 106.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\n## 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThroughout the year the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code, except in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 Provision 17 that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n- \uf0b7 Provision 33 that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nIn both instances, the Board considers that these are matters which should rightly be reserved for the Board, as set out in more detail in our statement of compliance on page 151.\n\nIn addition, the Board has delegated two particular aspects of the Code's provisions to Board Committees, with regular updates provided to the Board as appropriate:\n\n- \uf0b7 The Group Audit Committee retains responsibility for reviewing and monitoring NatWest Group's whistleblowing procedures.\n- \uf0b7 The Group Sustainable Banking Committee considers key workforce policies and practices (not related to pay) to ensure they are consistent with NatWest Group's values and support long-term sustainable success.\n\nFor further information please refer to the relevant Committee reports on the following pages.\n\nFurther information on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code is set out below under the Code's 5 main section headings.\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose Role of the Board\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the company, driving both shareholder value and contribution to wider society. The Board's role is to provide leadership of the company within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The Board establishes NatWest Group's purpose, values and strategy and leads the development of NatWest Group's culture. The Board sets the strategic aims of the company and its subsidiaries, ensures that the necessary resources are in place for NatWest Group to meet its objectives, is responsible for the raising and allocation of capital and reviews business and financial performance. It ensures that the company's obligations to its shareholders and other key stakeholders are understood and met.\n\nThe Board terms of reference include a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board's decision and are reviewed at least annually. They are available on natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established a number of Board Committees with particular responsibilities. Please refer to page 65 of the Strategic report for more details. Board committee terms of reference are available on natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Purpose, values, strategy and culture\n\nIn February 2020, and following an extensive period of stakeholder engagement, the Board approved NatWest Group's purpose and strategy. Our purpose has been a galvanising force across the organisation as our response to the pandemic has evolved, acting as an important point of reference during Board discussions, debate and decision-making. In October 2020 the Board received an update on NatWest Group's progress in becoming a purpose-led bank, covering achievements to date and future priorities. Further information on progress against our purpose and strategic priorities can be found on pages 6 to 7 of the Strategic report.\n\nThe Board is responsible for leading the development of NatWest Group's culture, values and standards. The Board assesses and monitors NatWest Group's culture in several ways. In February 2020, representatives from the BSB joined a Board meeting to present the results of their 2019 industry-wide survey and thematic reports, together with their 2019 Assessment report on NatWest Group. The Board also discussed an internal review of the BSB's thematic reports on 'Technology & Culture' and 'DecisionMaking' from a NatWest Group perspective, including impacts for customers and employees.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group Sustainable Banking Committee considered a summary of the results of the BSB's 2020 Assessment report on NatWest Group, in advance of a presentation by the BSB to the Board in February 2021\n\nThe Group Sustainable Banking Committee held a dedicated people and culture session in December 2020 which included culture measurement reporting, and this in turn helped to support the Board on assessing progress on building a healthy culture, and alignment between culture and purpose across NatWest Group.\n\nFor further information on the work of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee, refer to pages 116 to 117.\n\nColleague opinion survey results were another useful culture oversight tool available to the Board. Directors considered the results of colleague pulse surveys conducted in May and June, and in October 2020, reviewed the results of the annual colleague opinion survey, Our View. Key themes noted and discussed by the Board were culture, inclusion, capability, resilience and wellbeing (including financial wellbeing and colleague advocacy).\n\nIn December, as part of a spotlight on colleagues, the Board received an update on future ways of working and how this might evolve in a way that is consistent with our purpose and strategy; continues to support colleagues; drives greater collaboration; and supports the long-term sustainability of NatWest Group.\n\nDirectors are mindful of their responsibility to set the 'tone from the top' and take every opportunity to role model the desired culture both within the boardroom and beyond.\n\nWhile opportunities for face to face interaction with colleagues were significantly curtailed during 2020, directors continued to engage with colleagues virtually where possible, for example through Colleague Advisory Panel events, Committee function visits and a virtual talent engagement session.\n\nThe activities described above have supported the Board in meeting the Code requirement to satisfy itself that the company's purpose, values, strategy and culture are aligned.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn February 2020, the Board approved its annual objectives and confirmed the Board's key stakeholder groups. The Board's agenda and engagement plans were structured to enhance the Board's understanding of these stakeholders' views and interests. This in turn has informed Board discussions and decisionmaking.\n\nNatWest Group's Colleague Advisory Panel was set up in 2018 to help promote colleague voices in the boardroom and supports our compliance with Code requirements in relation to Board engagement with the workforce.\n\nFor further details on Board engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders, including how planned engagement activity was adapted in light of COVID-19 restrictions and the role and activities of the Colleague Advisory Panel, refer to the section 172(1) statement on page 48 of the Strategic report.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nThe effectiveness of Board stakeholder engagement mechanisms is considered during the annual Board evaluation. Further details of the outputs of the 2020 evaluation in relation to stakeholder engagement can be found on page 104.\n\nFurther details on NatWest Group's approach to investing in and rewarding its workforce can be found on page 57 of the Strategic report (Our Colleagues).\n\n## Workforce policies and practices\n\nAs referred to above, the Board has delegated certain Code provisions to Board Committees, with regular updates to the Board on relevant issues. The Group Sustainable Banking Committee considers key workforce policies and practices (not related to pay) to ensure they are consistent with NatWest Group's values and support long term sustainable success. The Group Audit Committee retains responsibility for reviewing and monitoring NatWest Group's whistleblowing procedures. Further details on Speak Up, NatWest Group's whistleblowing service, can be found on page 58 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Directors' Conflicts of Interest policy sets out procedures to ensure that the Board's management of conflicts of interest and its powers for authorising certain conflicts are operating effectively.\n\nEach director is required to notify the Board of any actual or potential situational or transactional conflict of interest and to update the Board with any changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding such conflicts. Situational conflicts can be authorised by the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the company's Articles of Association. The Board considers each request for authorisation on a case by case basis and has the power to impose conditions or limitations on any authorisation granted as part of the process. Details of all directors' conflicts of interest are recorded in a register which is maintained by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and reviewed annually by the Board.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\nThe Board has 11 directors comprising the Chairman, two executive directors and eight independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Senior Independent Director.\n\nDirector biographies and details of the Board Committees of which they are members can be found on pages 97 and 98.\n\n## Non-executive director independence\n\nThe Board considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment and that all current non-executive directors are independent for the purposes of the Code.\n\n## Chairman and Group CEO\n\nThe role of Chairman is distinct and separate from that of the Group CEO and there is a clear division of responsibilities, with the Chairman leading the Board and the Group CEO managing the business day to day.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThroughout 2020, Mark Seligman, as Senior Independent Director, acted as a sounding board for the Chairman, and as an intermediary for other directors when necessary. He was also available to shareholders to discuss any concerns they may have had, as appropriate.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nAlong with the Chairman and executive directors, the non-executive directors are responsible for ensuring the Board fulfils its responsibilities under its terms of reference.\n\nThe non-executive directors combine broad business and commercial experience with independent and objective judgement. They provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, and specialist advice to the executive directors and the executive management team and hold management to account.\n\nThe balance between non-executive and executive directors enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership across NatWest Group's business activities and ensures no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board's decisionmaking.\n\nThe Chairman and non-executive directors meet at least once every year without the executive directors present.\n\nDetails of the key responsibilities of the Chairman, Group CEO, Senior Independent Director and non-executive directors are available on natwestgroup.com.\n\nThe performance of the Chairman and nonexecutive directors is evaluated annually and further details of the process undertaken can be found on page 105.\n\n## Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, Jan Cargill, works closely with the Chairman to ensure effective and efficient functioning of the Board and appropriate alignment and information flows between the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board and individual directors on all governance matters, and also facilitates Board induction and directors' professional development.\n\n## Executive Management\n\nThe Group CEO is supported by Group ExCo, which considers strategic, financial, capital, risk and operational issues affecting NatWest Group and reviews relevant matters in advance of Board submission. Group ExCo's membership comprises the Group CEO, Group CFO and the Group Chief Risk Officer; who are also members of the wider executive management team. Biographies of the executive management team can be found on natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nIt is anticipated that non-executive directors will allocate sufficient time to the company to discharge their responsibilities effectively and will devote such time as is necessary to fulfil their role. Directors have been briefed on the limits on the number of other directorships that they can hold under the requirements of the fourth Capital Requirements Directive.\n\nThe Code emphasises the importance of ensuring directors have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. Prior to appointment, significant commitments require to be disclosed with an indication of the time involved. External appointments require prior Board approval, with the reasons for permitting significant appointments explained in the annual report. No such disclosures are required for 2020.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the commitments of the Chairman and directors and is satisfied that they are able to allocate sufficient time to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.\n\n## Information\n\nAll directors receive accurate, timely and clear information on all relevant matters and have access to the advice and services of the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. In addition, all directors are able, if necessary, to obtain independent professional advice at the company's expense.\n\nThe format for Board and Board Committee papers was further enhanced during 2020 and now includes a dedicated section which explains how the proposal or update aligns to our purpose, alongside existing sections detailing stakeholder impacts. This ensures that due consideration is given to our purpose and our stakeholders in the boardroom and supports the Board's oversight of NatWest Group's progress and performance as a purpose-led organisation.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\n## Induction and professional development\n\nEach new director receives a formal induction on joining the Board, which is co-ordinated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual concerned. This includes visits to NatWest Group's major businesses and functions and meetings with directors and senior management. Meetings with external auditors, counsel and stakeholders are also arranged as appropriate.\n\nAll new directors receive a copy of the NatWest Group Director Handbook. The Handbook operates as a consolidated governance support manual for directors of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group, providing both new and current directors with a single source of information relevant to their role. It covers a range of topics including NatWest Group's corporate structure; the Board and Board Committee operating model; Board policies and processes and a range of technical guidance on relevant matters including directors' duties, conflicts of interest, and the UK Senior Managers' Regime. The Handbook forms part of a wider library of reference materials available via our resources portal.\n\nDirectors have access to a wide range of briefing and training sessions and other professional development opportunities. Internal training relevant to the business of NatWest Group is also provided. Directors undertake the training they consider necessary to assist them in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The non-executive directors discuss their training and professional development with the Chairman at least annually.\n\nWith significant demands on Board time due to COVID-19, our Board training programme prioritised key areas of focus including financial crime and climate.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\nThe Board is structured to ensure that the directors provide NatWest Group plc with the appropriate combination of skills, experience and knowledge as well as independence. Given the nature of NatWest Group's businesses, experience of banking and financial services is clearly of benefit, and the Board has a number of directors with substantial experience in that area, including retail and commercial banking. In addition, the directors have relevant experience in customer service; government and regulatory matters; mergers and acquisitions; corporate recovery, resolution and insolvency; stakeholder management; environmental, social and governance, technology, digital and innovation; finance and accountancy; risk; and change management.\n\nBoard Committees also comprise directors with a variety of skills and experience so that no undue reliance is placed on any one individual.\n\nFurther information on Board appointments and succession planning can be found in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee report on page 106.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Code, all directors stand for election or re-election by shareholders at the company's AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors also requires approval by a majority of independent shareholders.\n\n## 2020 Board Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Code, an external evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual directors takes place every three years. An internal evaluation takes place in the intervening years. The last external evaluation was conducted in 2018.\n\n## Progress following the 2019 evaluation\n\nA number of actions were progressed during 2020 in response to the findings of the 2019 internal performance evaluation.\n\n- \uf0b7 A set of Board objectives was agreed for the year. Similar to 2019, these guided agenda planning and helped to ensure appropriate focus on the longer-term and strategic issues.\n- \uf0b7 A comprehensive review of Board composition and succession planning was carried out by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, including a review of the Board skills matrix and the overall balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board. Following this review, the Board approved the Board and Board Committee membership changes described earlier in this report. These changes addressed a number of focus areas identified during the 2019 evaluation, including reducing Board size, adding technology experience to the Board and improving Board diversity.\n- \uf0b7 Management reporting changes were introduced to provide consistent and concise information on key metrics and trends to the Board to support more focussed debate. Board paper templates were further enhanced to support purpose alignment.\n- \uf0b7 A virtual talent session enhanced the Board's visibility of the executive talent pipeline.\n\n## 2020 Performance evaluation\n\nThe 2020 Board evaluation was internally facilitated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, Jan Cargill, during Q4 2020. The process included:\n\n- \uf0b7 holding 1:1 interviews with directors;\n- \uf0b7 discussing key findings and recommendations for action with the Chairman; and\n- \uf0b7 presenting a final report to the Board.\n\n## Key findings and recommendations\n\nThe conclusion of the 2020 Board evaluation was that the Board operated effectively throughout the year and fulfilled its remit as set out in its terms of reference. Directors engaged fully with the evaluation exercise and commented positively in relation to many aspects of the Board's operations.\n\nKey findings and recommendations included the following\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 response - Directors felt that management had responded well to the pandemic. The Board had been kept regularly informed throughout, providing constructive challenge and support as appropriate, and virtual board meetings had worked efficiently.\n- \uf0b7 Purpose and strategy - Directors agreed that NatWest Group's purpose was clear and compelling, and that it was starting to embed and guide Board discussions and decision-making. The annual Board objectives were considered useful, but directors said a shorter list of focus items would be more impactful.\n- \uf0b7 Board stakeholder engagement Engagement activity during the year had been worthwhile, despite limited opportunities for face to face meetings. Board sessions with institutional investors had been particularly useful, and the Colleague Advisory Panel was working well. Directors were keen to explore different options to engage with customers and understand their views. They were also interested in deeper customer insights and further focus on key supplier relationships.\n- \uf0b7 Board composition and succession planning - The majority of directors felt the Board is now right-sized with no material skills gaps. Directors expressed a desire for greater visibility of ExCo successors.\n- \uf0b7 Board culture and dynamics - The 2019 evaluation had identified Board dynamics as an area for further improvement. In 2020, directors commented positively on Board culture and dynamics, noting an improvement over the past 12 months. Relationships were considered to be good, although directors missed the opportunity for informal interaction due to COVID-19 restrictions. Directors felt the balance of responsibilities between the Board and Board Committees was appropriate.\n- \uf0b7 How the Board operates - The Board's operating rhythm and increased meeting frequency had worked well. Directors expressed an interest in more in-depth business discussions and some observed there was scope to streamline Committee Chair reporting. Directors appreciated the enhanced approach to management reporting and observed that Board paper templates continued to drive better and shorter papers.\n\nCorporate Governance",

The Chairman also shared peer feedback provided to the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary as part of the individual evaluation process.\n\n## Audit, Risk & Internal Control\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions set out in this section of the Code can be found throughout the Annual Report and Accounts. The following sections are of particular relevance:\n\n- \uf0b7 the Group Audit Committee Chairman's letter and the report of the Committee (on page 107) which sets out the process undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of both the Internal Audit function and the external auditors in 2020, and the principal findings thereof. It also explains the approach taken to ensuring the integrity of financial and narrative statements, and confirms that it supports the Board in the assessment of the Group's disclosures to be fair, balanced and understandable;\n- \uf0b7 the Viability Statement (page 67) which details how the Board has assessed the future prospects of NatWest Group plc and the ways in which risks are considered and managed in order to achieve its strategic objectives;\n- \uf0b7 the Compliance report (page 151), which explains the internal control framework in place; and\n- \uf0b7 the Board Risk Committee Chairman's letter and report of the Committee (page 112) which explains how the Board oversees the principal risks facing NatWest Group and how management addresses these.\n\nSeparately, the Senior Independent Director sought feedback on the Chairman's performance from the non-executive directors, executive directors and other key internal and external stakeholders and discussed it with the Chairman.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe directors' remuneration report on pages 119 to 130 provides information on the activities of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee, the decisions taken on remuneration during the year and why the Committee believes these are the right outcomes in the circumstances.

In addition, the Committee monitors NatWest Group's governance arrangements to ensure that best corporate governance standards and practices are upheld and considers developments relating to banking reform and analogous issues affecting NatWest Group. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any consequential amendments to NatWest Group's operating model.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually, approved by the Board and are available at www.natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Principal activity during 2020\n\nAs highlighted in the Board's 2019 effectiveness review, the Committee acknowledges the tenure of a number of current Board directors and therefore made succession planning a priority in 2020. The Committee reviewed the contribution of a number of Board members under the Board Appointment Policy which sees non-executive directors appointed for an initial three year term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Following assessment by the Committee, they may then be appointed for a further three year term. Non-executive directors may continue to serve beyond six years, subject to a maximum tenure of nine years.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the structure, size and composition of the NatWest Group plc Board, the Committee has also continued to oversee work aimed at further enhancing the Group's subsidiary governance framework. A number of our material regulated subsidiaries made appointments to their boards during 2020, which the Committee has overseen. Spencer Stuart and Green Park have been engaged during the year to support NatWest Group's subsidiary board search activity. The firms are members of the retained executive search panel of suppliers (managed by NatWest Executive Search). Spencer Stuart also provide leadership advisory and senior executive search and assessment services to the Human Resources function.\n\nIn addition to succession planning, the Committee has overseen the process to reach agreement with the PRA in respect of the renewal of regulatory modifications which ensure the continuation of a governance\n\n## model that is compatible with ring-fencing legislation.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nAt the same time as standing down from the Board, Baroness Noakes stepped down from the Committee with effect from 31 July 2020. Morten Friis joined the Committee on 1 August 2020 meaning that throughout 2020 the Committee comprised the Chairman of the Board and four independent non-executive directors. Graham Beale also observes meetings of the Committee in his capacity as Senior Independent Director of NWH Ltd and member of the NWH Ltd Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Committee holds a minimum of four meetings per year and meets on an ad hoc basis as required. In 2020, there were five meetings - four scheduled meetings and one ad hoc. Individual attendance by directors at these meetings is shown in the table on page 100.\n\n## Tenure of non-executive directors\n\nThe tenure of non-executive directors as at 31 December 2020 is set out below.\n\n| 0 - 3 years   | 33%   |\n|---------------|-------|\n| 3 - 6 years   | 45%   |\n| 6+ years      | 22%   |\n|               | 100%  |\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees was conducted internally in 2020. The Committee has considered and discussed the outcomes of the evaluation and accepts the findings. Overall, the review concluded that the Committee operated effectively with no material recommendations being identified for action. The Committee will continue to ensure that the full Board is appropriately sighted on the work of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee will track progress during the year.\n\n## Boardroom Inclusion Policy\n\nThe Board operates a Boardroom Inclusion Policy which reflects the most recent industry targets and is aligned to the NatWest Inclusion Policy and Principles applying to the wider bank. This policy provides a framework to ensure that the Board attracts, motivates and retains the best talent and avoids limiting potential caused by bias, prejudice or discrimination. The policy currently applies to the most senior NatWest Group boards: NatWest Group plc, NWH Ltd, NWB Plc, RBS plc and Ulster Bank Limited. A copy of the Boardroom Inclusion Policy is available on natwestgroup.com>who we are.\n\n## Objectives and targets\n\nThe Boardroom Inclusion Policy's objectives ensure that the Board, and any Committee to which it delegates nominations responsibilities, follows an inclusive process when making nomination decisions. That includes ensuring that the nomination process\n\nis based on the principles of fairness, respect and inclusion, that all nominations and appointments are made on the basis of individual competence, skills and expertise measured against identified objective criteria and that searches for Board candidates are conducted with due regard to the benefits of diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Boardroom Inclusion Policy contains a number of measurable objectives, targets and ambitions reflecting the ongoing commitment of the Board to inclusion progress. The Board aims to meet the highest industry standards and recommendations wherever possible. That includes, but is not limited to, aspiring to meet the targets set by the HamptonAlexander Report: FTSE100 Women Leaders (33% female representation on the boards) and the Parker Report: Beyond 1 by '21 (at least one director from an ethnic minority background on the boards) by 2020/2021. The policy supports our bank-wide ambition to aim for a 50/50 gender balance across all levels of the organisation by 2030.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nThe boards of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Group meet consecutively and share a largely common membership. When considered together, the director population across both boards currently meets the Parker target and exceeds the Hampton-Alexander target with a female representation of 36%.\n\nNotwithstanding the largely common membership between boards, NatWest remains committed to ensuring that the NatWest Group plc Board meets the targets on a standalone basis. The NatWest Group plc Board currently meets the Parker Target and, notwithstanding the departures of Alison Davis and Baroness Noakes during 2020, continues to exceed the Hampton-Alexander target with a board composition including 36% female representation.\n\nDiversity and inclusion progress, including information about the appointment process, will continue to be reported in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee's report in the NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts. The balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity on the Board, and how the Board operates together as a unit is reviewed annually as part of the Board evaluation. Where appropriate, findings from the evaluation will be considered in the search, nomination and appointment process. Further details on NatWest Group's approach to diversity can be found on page 60.\n\nHoward Davies\n\nChairman of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee 1 9 February 2021\n\nCorporate Governance",

It also assists the Group Board in carrying out its responsibilities relating to accounting policies and internal control functions.\n\nIn 2020 the Committee's primary focus has continued to be on reviewing the integrity and quality of NatWest Group's published financial information, including the quarterly, interim and full year results announcements, Annual Report and Accounts, Pillar 3 and Form 20-F releases. In each case the Committee received detailed reports on the judgements applied by management in the preparation of the financial statements and legal and regulatory developments. Consideration was also given to management's assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting and the GAC also received reports from both the internal auditors on the internal control environment and the external auditors on internal controls over financial reporting and key accounting and judgemental matters.\n\nThroughout nearly all its work in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has been a key consideration. Much time was dedicated to reviewing accounting judgements and the potential and actual impact on expected credit losses, including modelling methodologies, as well as impairment levels and guidance.\n\n## Membership\n\nFull biographical details of the members of the Committee during 2020 are set out on pages 97 and 98. The members are all independent non-executive directors who also sit on other Board committees in addition to the GAC (as set out in their biographies). This common membership helps facilitate effective governance across all finance, risk and remuneration matters and ensures that agendas are aligned, and duplication of responsibilities is avoided.\n\nMembers of the GAC are selected with a view to the expertise and experience of the Committee as a whole and with proper regard to the key issues and challenges facing the NatWest Group. The Board is satisfied that all GAC members have recent and relevant financial experience and are independent as defined in the SEC rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'Exchange Act') and related guidance. The Board has further determined that Patrick Flynn, Mark Seligman, Robert Gillespie and, during her tenure as a member of the Committee, Baroness Noakes, are all 'financial experts' for the purposes of compliance with the Exchange Act Rules and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and that they have competence in accounting and/or auditing as required under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\nThe unprecedented impact the pandemic has had on the UK and global economies, coupled with the extensive government support for those affected by the pandemic, has presented challenges to all banks in modelling the likely impact under IFRS9. In the absence of relevant historic data points to model the impact of the crisis, the Committee found the benchmarking information provided by external parties particularly helpful. The Committee has supported enhancements to internal modelling processes implemented by management during 2020. In light of the economic conditions throughout the year it was necessary to overlay judgements to the modelled outputs. While such decisions are never easy, as by their nature they are highly subjective, the Committee was satisfied the approach taken by management to apply overlays and post-model adjustments was robust and consistently applied. The internal and external auditors also undertook work to provide comfort to the Committee in this respect. In addition, the Committee was satisfied with the assessments of the internal control environment, particularly given the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and supported management's plans to further enhance it.\n\nAs well as reviewing financial information, the Committee also considers NatWest Group's non-financial reporting. In this respect, the Committee reviewed the climate-related disclosures published alongside this report. The Committee is satisfied that the information contained in the document is consistent with that published in the Annual Report and Accounts and subject to robust controls.\n\n## Meetings and visits\n\nFive scheduled meetings of the Committee were held in 2020, four of which took place immediately prior to the release of the financial results each quarter. During the year all members attended the scheduled meetings, one of which was held in person and the remainder via video conferencing facilities. Two ad hoc meetings were held to consider regulatory submissions, including additional Pillar 3 disclosures requested by the regulators to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe annual programme of visits to control functions - held in conjunction with the Board Risk Committee - was undertaken virtually this year in order to comply with social distancing requirements. Constructive and insightful discussions were held with Risk, Internal Audit and Finance.\n\n## 'Throughout nearly all its work in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has been a key consideration'\n\nOversight of the performance of the internal audit function and ensuring its independence is a key responsibility of the Committee. In order to maintain the perceived independence of the Chief Audit Executive, I oversaw the process to appoint a new individual to the role in 2020. I was pleased that there was a highquality pool from which we selected a strong candidate, who takes on the role in February 2021. I am grateful to the outgoing Chief Audit Executive for his professionalism and support during the process and his significant contribution to the bank over the past 9 years.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all Committee members for their diligent contributions in 2020, including Baroness Noakes who stood down from the Board in July 2020. I was pleased to welcome Robert Gillespie to the Committee in August 2020, who brings with him a wealth of experience.\n\nPatrick Flynn Chairman of the Group Audit Committee 1 9 February 2021\n\n## Performance evaluations\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees, including the Audit Committee, was conducted internally in 2020. Themes focused on during the Committee's discussion session included: operating rhythm; effectiveness and dynamics of meetings; and future priorities. It was determined that the GAC had continued to operate effectively during 2020. Certain areas to be strengthened were identified and will be progressed in 2021.\n\nThe performance of the External Auditor and the Internal Audit function were monitored by the GAC in 2020 and assessed at the end of the year via an internal process. Feedback was provided by relevant stakeholders and a summary reviewed by the Committee. Progress made to address the recommendations of the previous year's evaluations was welcomed.",

Additional work was undertaken to monitor and address the challenges to the control environment  resulting from COVID-19, in particular those related to the introduction of new products and the  increased risk of fraud. The Committee also reviewed the process undertaken to support the CEO  and CFO in providing the certifications required under sections 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002. |\n|                               | 2020 it received  reports throughout  the year on the topic  and evaluated the  effectiveness of  NatWest Group's                                 | Control Environment Certification - The GAC considered the control environment ratings of the  businesses, functions and material subsidiaries and management's actions to ensure that the  control environment was maintained throughout new working arrangements brought about by the  COVID-19 pandemic and plans to address areas of weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                               | internal control  systems, including  any significant failings  or weaknesses.                                                                    | Notifiable Event Process - The GAC considered semi-annual reports on control breaches,  captured by the internal notifiable event process.

I would like to thank Baroness Noakes for her diligence and dedication throughout her tenure as Chairman of the BRC, for which we are very grateful.\n\nI am also pleased to welcome Lena Wilson as a member of BRC. She joined the Committee in August 2020.\n\nThe BRC has an important role in supporting the Board and overseeing the management of risk, and this report describes how the Committee fulfilled this responsibility during 2020. More detail on the remit of the Committee can also be found in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Membership\n\nBRC comprises four independent nonexecutive directors. The details of the members and their skills and experience are set out on pages 97 to 98.\n\nPatrick Flynn is chairman of the Group Audit Committee of which Robert Gillespie and I are also members. Robert is also chairman of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee (RemCo) and Lena Wilson sits on this Committee. This common membership across Committees helps to ensure effective governance across the committees.\n\nRegular attendees at BRC meetings include: the Group Chairman, Group CEO, Group CFO, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, Group Chief Audit Executive, and the External Auditor. External advice is sought by the Committee where appropriate.\n\n2020 has been an unprecedented period and BRC has amended its focus to ensure appropriate oversight of the management and mitigation of risks driven by COVID-19 whilst continuing to have oversight of the wider risk agenda. The cancellation of prescribed regulatory stress tests and a decision by the Regulator to delay certain other regulatory programmes ensured sufficient focus by BRC on key risk areas throughout the pandemic. This has included the control environment, operational risk and resilience, financial crime, fraud, incident management decisions impacting risk appetite, and the non-financial risks associated with the Government lending schemes and additional support measures.\n\nFurther information on all the key topics considered by the Committee during the year is provided on the following pages. Part of the BRC's role is to review reports and regulatory submissions on behalf of the Board and recommend them for approval. Where this is the case, the report on the following pages is annotated with an asterisk (*).\n\n## Meetings and visits\n\nThere were eight scheduled meetings of the Committee held in 2020. In addition, three ad hoc meetings were arranged to consider time critical matters such as capital distributions and the impact of COVID-19 on NatWest Group's risk profile. Meetings have been held virtually throughout the pandemic. Details of meeting attendance can be found on page 100.\n\nAs in previous years, during 2020, members of the Committee undertook a programme of visits to the Risk, Internal Audit and Finance functions, in conjunction with members of the Group Audit Committee. The Committee also held in-depth meetings on risk reporting. Again, all these meeting were held virtually during 2020.\n\nTwo non-executive directors of NWH Ltd (the ring-fenced bank) attended Committee meetings as observers in their capacity as members of NWH Ltd's BRC. Meetings of the Group and NWH Ltd's BRCs share much of a common agenda and are generally run in parallel.\n\nCOVID-19 headwinds will dominate our operating environment for some time, and I anticipate this will impact much of BRC's work in 2021. BRC will also continue to focus on financial crime and the delivery of regulatory programmes due in 2021 (LIBOR transition and the Resolvability Self-Assessment) and regulatory stress tests (including the biennial exploratory scenario on the financial risks from climate and the 2021 Solvency Stress Test).\n\n2020 has been an extraordinary year and I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their continued commitment, support and challenge throughout the year.\n\nMorten Friis Chairman of the Group Board Risk Committee 1 9 February 2021\n\n## Performance Evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees, including BRC, was conducted internally in 2020.\n\nThe Committee held a dedicated session to discuss its performance. The session was structured around a number of themes: operating rhythm; focus and priorities; effectiveness; and culture and dynamics. The Committee considered that it continued to operate effectively and identified some areas for potential enhancement. In 2021, there will be focus on streamlining and simplification of the Committee through prioritisation; reduction in volume of papers and length of meetings; improvement in paper quality; and an inclusive culture at meetings. The Committee will track progress during 2021.\n\nCorporate Governance",

As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, this was supplemented in H1 2020 by additional risk  reporting focussed specifically on the impact of the pandemic on NatWest Group, and  management's response to the crisis. Reporting and discussion included coverage of NatWest  Group's treatment of its customers and colleagues (with a particular focus on operationalisation of  COVID-19-related UK Government lending schemes and management of capital repayment  holidays), management of key credit, conduct and operational resilience risks, prioritisation and risk  appetite decisions, and impacts of the pandemic upon the change portfolio, including regulatory  forbearance.

In 2020, management commissioned a strategic review of Internal  Service Management and ensured that identified areas for improvement in relation to the OCiR  framework were incorporated, to ensure full alignment, BRC reviewed the outputs of this exercise  and will keep actions under review. BRC also reviewed management's approach and progress to  the resolvability self-assessment, including reviewing activity in plan to provide management and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Stress  testing             | BRC devoted  considerable time to  stress testing,  challenging and  scrutinising the  outputs.                                                                                                               | ICAAPs, ILAAPs and Budget Stress Tests - The BRC considered the budget and stress tests  ahead of review of the results of the ICAAPs and ILAAPs and the reverse stress tests for  NatWest Group, including the material judgements and areas for future enhancement. It was  noted that the tests did not cover NatWest Group's current and evolving view of COVID-19  implications (due to timing of submission). Management has since continued to update base  economic and stress scenarios as the pandemic has evolved, with oversight by BRC as  appropriate. BRC reviewed an annual update on the stress testing control environment, key  learnings including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent and imminent  outcomes from NatWest Group's investment in stress testing capability.

While the Board retains ownership of the overall strategic and purposeful direction, it was agreed that the Committee would oversee progress towards achieving NatWest Group's purposeful commitments and ambitions on behalf of the Board.\n\nThe refreshed pillars of sustainable banking for 2020 focussed on: Learning & Capability; Climate; Enterprise; Conduct & Ethics; and, People & Culture. This Purpose-focus informed our meeting structure and proved helpful in prioritising matters for which the Committee felt oversight and challenge, on behalf of the Board, was most valuable.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the April meeting of the Committee was repurposed from Learning & Capability to focus on our response to the crisis and our treatment of customers.\n\nThe Committee's stakeholder engagement model involves integrated engagement sessions aligned to our pillars of sustainable banking and seeks to bring internal and external voices and challenging perspectives into the boardroom. We will continue to keep SBC's focus and responsibilities under review.\n\n## Driving the Sustainable banking agenda\n\nSustainable banking and stakeholder engagement remain of vital importance as NatWest Group continues its transition to becoming purpose-led.\n\nWith shareholder, regulatory and societal expectations intensifying, embedding sustainable banking principles and targets within NatWest Group's broader strategic agenda will be critical. By continuing the Committee's focus beyond traditional environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters we have sought to ensure that the SBC continues to play a forward-looking role.\n\nAs a Committee we have continued to be reassured by the energy shown by colleagues across the organisation in driving the sustainable banking agenda.\n\n## 2020 Highlights\n\nI am pleased to report that the Committee believe they have played a key role in supporting the Board in the organisation's purpose-led journey, with the Committee benefitting from focussed discussion on matters such as Climate, Enterprise and our People & Culture.\n\nBelow are the key discussion points and outcomes from the year:\n\n## COVID-19 & Customer Treatment\n\n- \uf0b7 The Committee considered how the bank was approaching customer treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 Key topics debated included the organisational response, franchise specific updates from Retail Banking and Commercial Banking, conduct implications, potential future areas of focus and ensuring that our response was aligned to our Purpose.\n- \uf0b7 This topic has continued to be re-visited, with particular updates on the COVID-19 response in our Retail, Commercial and Private Banking teams. The sessions provided insights into the ongoing support being provided to customers and plans for continued support as the pandemic's impact on the economy progresses.\n\n## Climate\n\n- \uf0b7 The Committee met to consider how we become a leading bank driving the UK's transition to a low carbon economy, while also tracking broader ESG progress. Topics included progress against the climate risk agenda, future areas of focus and an update on progress against expectations in the UN Principles of Responsible Banking.\n- \uf0b7 Areas of debate and challenge included climate innovation, peer comparisons and industry collaboration, as well as the approach to disclosure. The Committee also received a further detailed update on best-in-class climate change action among European banks.\n- \uf0b7 We benefitted from external perspective provided by the Green Finance Institute who provided an overview of the relevant science, climate modelling and the case to de-carbonise.\n\n## Enterprise\n\n- \uf0b7 The Committee has spent time understanding how the bank is approaching becoming the Champion of UK business and removing barriers to ensure everyone has the same opportunity to progress.\n- \uf0b7 Against notable disruption of the sector as a result of COVID-19, the Committee sought updates from management on the support being provided to customers and progress against our targets in this area.\n- \uf0b7 We discussed opportunities to support our customers across the Retail, Commercial and Private Banking areas, and some of the positive ways the organisation had pivoted to support Enterprise given the challenging climate, including via the Business Builder and Accelerator programmes.\n\n- \uf0b7 External insights from customers were shared with the Committee via recorded customer testimonies and a presentation by one of our Enterprise customers.\n\n## Conduct & Ethics\n\n- \uf0b7 The Committee considered certain aspects of NatWest Group's decision-making framework to support its oversight of the safety and soundness of NatWest Group's commercial decisions. This included spotlights on Ethical Conduct by Colleagues and the new internal 'Yes Check'. It also considered NatWest Group's Modern Slavery and Human Rights obligations within the business and supply chain in support of discussion on the organisation's role in shaping societal responses to these challenges.\n- \uf0b7 Areas of focus included measurement of the impact of the updated colleague framework and support, the introduction of a Supplier Charter and the extent of NatWest Group's responsibilities in relation to Modern Slavery and Human Rights.\n- \uf0b7 We benefitted from the external perspectives provided by a speaker from Blueprint for Better Business who shared insights and challenges in relation to ethics and the interplay between organisational ethics and Purpose.\n\n## People & Culture\n\n- \uf0b7 The Committee, on behalf of the Board, debated how NatWest Group builds an engaged workforce and healthy culture for the future, given the importance of both in supporting NatWest Group's Purpose.\n- \uf0b7 The Committee noted management updates on progress and plans to embed culture, particularly given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on colleagues. Further to the Committee discussion, management provided additional peer comparison information to Members in support of the Committee's role in overseeing Culture.\n- \uf0b7 The Committee was provided with a Culture Measurement Report providing insights to understand the status of culture across NatWest Group. The report now follows the 'Five principles of a purpose driven business' model and uses Banking Standards Board (BSB) survey results, culture measures, inclusion and wellbeing data. It was noted that there had been some improvement in BSB survey results year-on-year and the Committee acknowledged that progress had been made across culture dimensions in 2020 despite the challenges of the global pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 The Committee, on behalf of the Board, considered workforce policies and practices to ensure they are consistent with NatWest Group's values and support long-term sustainable success. In particular, the Committee reviewed the fair pay charter, and received updates on pay gap reporting and the 5-year inclusion and diversity update report.\n\nCorporate Governance",

More details of membership and attendance at meetings can be found on page 100 of the Corporate governance report.\n\nMeetings and escalation mechanisms have not changed since last year's report. In many cases the Committee and the Sustainable Banking Committee of NatWest Holdings Limited met concurrently.\n\nAuthority is delegated to Group SBC by the Board and a regular report of the Committee's activities is provided. The terms of reference are available on natwestgroup.com and these are reviewed annually and approved by the Board.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees was conducted internally in 2020. Overall, the feedback on the Committee was positive and it was agreed that the Committee was operating in accordance with its terms of reference.\n\nAreas of focus for 2021 will be to continue to oversee the embedding of Purpose across NatWest Group, consider focus on Customer Service & Experience at the Committee, and ensure appropriate challenge from external speakers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this first year of supporting the embedding of our Purpose, my fellow directors and I have had the opportunity to help shape and oversee NatWest Group's future sustainable banking strategy and response to these important issues in the context of a challenging year. I want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee members, attendees and presenters for their continued contribution and support in 2020.\n\n2021 presents challenges and opportunities for the sustainable banking agenda as it builds on the progress achieved in 2020 and seeks to support the recovery post-2020. I am looking forward to steering future SBC discussions in such an important area for NatWest Group's strategy and to reporting on progress next year.\n\nMike Rogers Chairman of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee 1 9 February 2021",

The Committee has had oversight of actions being taken to transform capabilities across the bank.'\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nI am delighted to present my first report as Chairman of the Technology and Innovation Committee (the Committee or TIC).\n\n## Role and responsibilities\n\nDuring this unprecedented year, TIC has continued to support the Board in overseeing, monitoring and challenging the actions being taken by management in relation to technology and innovation and in doing so giving due consideration to NatWest Group's purpose.\n\nAuthority is delegated to TIC by the Board and a regular report of the Committee's activities is provided to the Board. The terms of reference are available on natwestgroup.com. These are reviewed annually and approved by the NatWest Group Board .\n\n## Principal activity during 2020\n\nDuring 2020, TIC priorities were reset to focus on the following key themes:\n\nDigitising the Core - TIC has considered actions being taken in relation to existing technology to enhance customer and colleague experience and improve the resilience of IT systems.\n\nCOVID-19 resulted in NatWest Group having to respond quickly to support colleagues and customers and ensure seamless uninterrupted delivery of all services.\n\nThe Committee considered how technology has been an enabler throughout the pandemic and how previous investment in the portfolio allowed NatWest Group to react at pace. This included actions taken to allow colleagues globally to work from home where appropriate, and customers to bank safely remotely as well as use data and analytics capabilities to allow NatWest Group to support the Government Loan Schemes, mortgage repayment holidays and loan deferrals.\n\nIt also highlighted how NatWest Group could collaborate as one-team to deliver digital enhancements, automated solutions and critical changes at pace for customers.\n\nNatWest Group's cloud strategy provides capabilities to support customers and colleagues. TIC discussed the continued development, adoption and practical implementation of the cloud strategy and cloud technologies. It also considered the potential future use and opportunities presented by cloud.\n\nFuture Ready - Technology and innovation are enabling fundamental shifts in the way\n\nfinancial services are delivered. This has been significantly accelerated due to COVID-19. TIC has had oversight of actions being taken to transform data and technology capabilities and deploy 'forward-looking' technology across the bank. It has received updates on the implementation of the One-Bank technology transformation strategy, which includes the consolidation of services and creation of centres of excellence. The Committee considered how technology services are provided from NWH to NatWest Markets and steps being taken to improve NatWest Group's long-term data capabilities.\n\nCollaboration - TIC considered management's new approach to the operating model overseeing innovation, partnerships and ventures. The framework will provide oversight across NatWest Group, driving alignment and a One-Bank approach. It will promote customer focussed innovation and partnerships and build on the innovation ecosystem that has been established.\n\nVentures - to continue the bank's journey to introduce new and innovative customer solutions, TIC considered the strategic options to deliver a digital bank. This included the viability assessment for Mettle (our digital banking proposition for small businesses to combine their current account with invoicing, payment chasing and bookkeeping capabilities) and B\u00f3, (our digital bank pilot) and lessons learnt following the decision to close B\u00f3.\n\nInnovation - TIC has continued to oversee the development and delivery of NatWest Group's innovation approach supporting NatWest Group's long-term strategic priorities. This included an overview of innovation activity underway from seed to scale and how innovation activity aligns to the bank's broader purpose and strategy. The Committee also considered innovation investment prioritisation and how this has been informed. From a macro perspective, the Committee discussed top technology trends across the industry and areas which had been most impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and considered how NatWest Group might respond to these.\n\nTIC also considered emerging skills, capabilities and technologies critical to future success such as data management, greater use of cloud and increased opportunities to partner .\n\n## External Insights\n\nObtaining an external view of the industry, external trends, developments and competitor activity has been valuable to the Committee. It allows the Committee to better understand both opportunities and emerging threats from continued market disruption.\n\nDuring 2020, Michael Dell (Dell Technologies Inc.) joined the Committee and provided his views on external trends and challenges, including innovation priorities and the technology advances accelerated by COVID19. Astro Teller, CEO and Captain of Moonshots of Alphabet's Google X, joined the Committee to share more about Google X and his perspectives on emerging and disruptive technologies.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nFollowing Alison Davis' departure from the Board on 31 March 2020, the Committee is comprised of three non-executive Director members; Frank Dangeard, Patrick Flynn and myself. More details of membership and attendance at meetings can be found on page 100 of the Corporate governance report.\n\nThe Committee is supported by management and the CEO, Chief Administration Officer, Chief Risk Officer, CFO, Director of Innovation, Director of Strategy & Corporate Development and Chief Technology Officer are all standing attendees.\n\nThe Committee held three scheduled meetings during 2020. An ad hoc meeting was also convened to consider the viability assessment of the Mettle and B\u00f3 propositions. All meetings were convened virtually. Details of meeting attendance can be found on page 100 of the Corporate governance report.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe Committee held a dedicated session to discuss its performance. The session was structured around themes, including effectiveness; focus and priorities; operating rhythm; and escalation. The Committee considered that it continued to operate effectively and act in accordance with its terms of reference. It agreed that in the coming year it would focus on digitisation of the core; transformation of data and technology capabilities; and ventures, partnerships and innovation. There would be deep dives on specific topics to support more focussed discussion.\n\nThe Committee will track progress on the outcomes of the evaluation during 2021.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI am delighted to chair this Committee as it continues to support the Board in an area critical to the bank's future strategy.\n\nTogether with my fellow directors, we will retain our focus on monitoring the future technology and innovation landscape and its impact on NatWest Group. The Committee will continue to shape opportunities arising from management's response to both threats and opportunities that align with NatWest Group's purpose.\n\nI want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee members and attendees for their direction, enthusiasm and support in 2020. In particular, I would like to thank Alison Davis, my predecessor, for chairing the Committee since it was established in 2017. Her strong technology and innovation knowledge and experience provided great benefit to the Committee throughout her tenure. I would also like to thank Lena Wilson who stepped down from the Committee in March 2020.\n\nYasmin Jetha Chairman of the Technology & Innovation Committee 1 9 February 2021\n\nCorporate Governance",

It has been a year unlike any other in living memory. As a result, I felt that it was particularly important as part of my letter this year to not only share a summary of the key activities and decisions, but to add some colour on our thinking and our approach to balancing the varied considerations of an unprecedented year.\n\n## Setting the scene\n\nThe Committee is acutely aware of the significant adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our customers, our stakeholders, including our shareholders, and broader society. This has significantly influenced our decisions this year.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, Alison Rose, CEO and Howard Davies, our Chairman, felt the need to send clear leadership messages to all stakeholders in order to signify that NatWest Group was aware of the need to demonstrate responsibility, even though the magnitude of events relating to COVID-19 was unclear at the time. Accordingly, Ms Rose decided to forgo 25% of her fixed pay for the rest of the year with NatWest Group making a comparable donation to the National Emergencies Trust (NET) Coronavirus Appeal and the Chairman made a similar commitment to donate 25% of his fees for the rest of the year. Ms Rose also indicated she did not wish to receive a variable pay award for 2020. The Committee is grateful for the clear leadership given by the Chairman and CEO through these actions.\n\nThe challenge for the Committee, as we now look back on 2020, lies in striking an appropriate balance between acknowledging the macroeconomic environment, but at the same time addressing the business imperative of retaining and motivating colleagues, protecting our franchises and scarce skill sets, and recognising the significant efforts of colleagues in delivering an extremely strong business response to the pandemic.\n\n## Bonus pool for the wider workforce\n\nWe recognise that while underlying performance has been resilient, profitability and shareholder value have been severely impacted. Share price performance has unsurprisingly been highly volatile but not entirely unexpected given the macroeconomic environment. Analysis of our share price shows a clear correlation with that of\n\ncompetitors over the period, which indicates share price movements were largely sector driven, which in turn was a reaction to the pandemic.\n\nThe absence of dividend payments during the year, in line with guidance from our regulators in April 2020, will have disappointed ordinary shareholders. The capital and liquidity of NatWest Group has remained very strong through the period. In December 2020, the PRA eased its restriction on shareholder capital distributions and the Board has confirmed its intention to pay a dividend of 3p per ordinary share in respect of financial year 2020, this being the maximum amount permitted under the regulations.\n\nBalanced against such factors, the Committee has been mindful of the role that colleagues have performed in NatWest Group's reaction to the pandemic. Our colleagues have worked tirelessly, often in difficult circumstances, demonstrating real resilience and huge commitment to continue to serve our customers. They have reacted with speed and agility to an unprecedented set of circumstances and have taken a proactive approach to deliver business support schemes offered by the Government whilst taking a careful approach to the management of risk. The Committee felt it was appropriate to recognise this exceptional contribution of our colleagues in serving the needs of customers during the year.\n\nThe pandemic resulted in the majority of employees working from home, which put an immense strain on the maintenance of internal systems in order to allow this to happen seamlessly and without creating incremental operational risk. The Committee also felt it was appropriate to recognise the extraordinary efforts to achieve this outcome.\n\nNatWest Group has not benefitted from any direct government support although it is acknowledged that government intervention to support the economy has mitigated some of the risks resulting from the pandemic. NatWest Group has also taken steps to protect all its employees. It decided that no colleagues should be furloughed, it protected pay for six months, including for those colleagues unable to work during this period, and implemented a broad range of initiatives to provide practical and emotional support. This is explained in further detail in this report.\n\nHaving regard to all the matters set out above, the Committee has considered carefully a spectrum of compensation outcomes, including the possibility of no bonus payments. The Committee has concluded, weighing up all the relevant factors, it is appropriate to deliver variable pay for this year at a significantly moderated level in comparison to prior years.\n\nIn reaching its decision to pay a bonus pool to the wider workforce, the Committee has relied on a multi-step process in order to assess performance and balance this against relevant\n\nexternal factors. We believe that proceeding with a significantly reduced bonus pool demonstrates the restraint and caution expected by our shareholders and regulators, yet still offers a fair level of reward for colleagues in recognition of their performance in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe agreed bonus pool is \u00a3206 million, which is down 33% on 2019. The Committee feels this is appropriate to reflect NatWest Group's business mix and the varied performance of its business units during the year. The vast majority of the pool will be allocated to revenue-generating business units and the teams which were pivotal in enabling colleagues to seamlessly work from home during the pandemic. Immediate cash bonuses continue to be limited to \u00a32,000.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) awards\n\nTurning to LTI awards, the Committee decided early in the year not to make any adjustment to performance targets for 2020 as a result of the pandemic. These targets formed the basis of the pre-grant assessment for LTI awards to be granted in 2021.\n\nThe 2021 LTI awards proposed have been adjusted with reference to performance over 2020 and have also been subjected to a further reduction of an amount greater than the overall reduction to the bonus pool, in order to reinforce the 'one bank' approach underpinning senior leadership at NatWest Group.\n\nOverall, the Committee believes the approach we have taken on LTI awards demonstrates restraint on executive pay whilst still paying fairly for the role performed.\n\n## Executive director pay policy\n\nThe policy was renewed at the AGM in April 2020 for another three years with over 90% of votes in favour. The Committee believes the policy is continuing to work well. It incentivises executive management in a manner that is easily understood and demonstrates to the wider workforce that we are following a restrained but fair approach within a culture of prudent risk-taking.\n\nVariable pay for executive directors is delivered entirely in shares with no annual bonus. The main performance test takes place before granting the LTI award with a further assessment prior to vesting to ensure that the performance has proved to be sustainable.\n\nNearly 70% of expected remuneration for our executive directors is delivered in shares; far higher than typical market practice. Extensive deferral and retention periods are in place and LTI awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions. Furthermore, our executive directors are required to acquire substantial shareholdings which must be retained for two years post-employment. This creates clear alignment between the executives and shareholders, which is one of the main intents of the remuneration construct.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report\n\nWe recognise that the construct has some unique features which require explanation. Engagement with stakeholders, therefore, continued during 2020.\n\nSome investors highlighted that disclosing greater detail on the factors leading to LTI outcomes would be welcomed. As a result, the pre-grant disclosures in this report for performance year 2020 have been expanded with ratings to give an indication of the extent of over or underperformance against targets. I hope this enables shareholders to better understand our deliberations for this year and in future.\n\n## Executive director pay for 2020 Alison Rose\n\nMs Rose's salary and pension was unchanged over the year while her fixed share allowance (FSA) was reduced from \u00a31,100,000 to \u00a3673,922, as a result of her decision in April 2020 to forgo 25% of her total fixed pay for the rest of the year. NatWest Group made a comparable donation to the NET Coronavirus Appeal.\n\nWhile Ms Rose confirmed in April 2020 that she did not wish to receive a 2021 LTI award, the Committee was still required to assess her performance over the year. The Committee also agreed that, while it did not intend to grant Ms Rose a 2021 LTI, in line with her request, it was important to agree a notional 2021 LTI award for her, in order to assist with future benchmarking.\n\nThe Committee agreed that Ms Rose's first full year as CEO had been highly impressive. The effective launch of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy was a particular highlight. Ms Rose had displayed strong leadership and energy in helping to navigate the business through a remarkably challenging year, with significant progress having been made on key strategic priorities, including the implementation of the 'one bank' transformation programme and strengthening her executive team through internal and external hiring of talent.\n\nAgainst the pre-set 2020 performance targets, underlying financial performance was deemed very respectable, despite the impact of COVID-19 on full year results, and there had been progress on customer scores. People scores performed very strongly in a difficult year for colleagues and the new climaterelated targets were all met.\n\nUnderstandably, the enterprise target relating to the creation of new businesses had not been achieved due to the pandemic, but a switch to support existing customers had been effective with 6.4m interventions aimed at helping customers survive and thrive throughout the pandemic having been logged. The risk control environment was one area where performance had not improved sufficiently to meet the target. Full details of the 2020 performance assessment for executive directors can be found on page 135 to 138.\n\nAn assessment of performance against the pre-set and unadjusted 2020 performance targets resulted in a recommended LTI award level of \u00a31,450,000, or 75% of Ms Rose's maximum LTI award level. This grant was then subject to an overall pay restraint reduction of 38% to reflect the impact of COVID-19, resulting in a notional LTI award of \u00a3899,000 for Ms Rose, or 47% of her maximum LTI award level. Ms Rose had already indicated that she did not wish to accept an LTI award for this year and accordingly no award will be made.\n\n## Katie Murray\n\nMs Murray's fixed pay remained unchanged during 2020. Ms Murray's performance was assessed against the same core goals that applied to Ms Rose. The performance of the Finance function was also taken into account.\n\nThe Committee agreed that Ms Murray had performed strongly during 2020. Highlights included management of crucial parts of the COVID-19 agenda, especially management of the capital, liquidity and funding plans, and delivery of annual cost reductions in line with target. There had also been improved management of investor engagement with positive feedback received. Ms Murray had also made a significant contribution to progress on key strategic priorities and had demonstrated excellent leadership, with good progress having been made on transforming the Finance function, its executive team and its inclusion agenda.\n\nAn assessment of performance against the pre-set and unadjusted 2020 performance targets resulted in a recommended LTI award level of \u00a31,100,000, or 73% of Ms Murray's maximum LTI award level. This grant was then subject to an overall pay restraint reduction of 38% to reflect the impact of COVID-19, resulting in a LTI award for 2020 of \u00a3682,000, or 45% of her maximum LTI award level.\n\nThe impact of these decisions against maximum levels is shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive directors also entitled to benefits in line with the policy, as detailed later in this report. Had Ms Rose not indicated that she would not accept an LTI award for 2020 her total compensation excluding benefits would have been \u00a32,783,000.\n\nLooking ahead, no changes are proposed to remuneration levels for executive directors in 2021, while salaries for the wider workforce will be increased by around 2% on average. In making increases across the wider workforce, the majority of the funding is targeted to our more junior colleagues.\n\n## 2018 LTI award vesting outcome\n\nMs Rose received an LTI award in 2018 while CEO of Commercial & Private Banking. The pre-grant assessment of performance over 2017 led to a reduction of 13.33% from the maximum award level. Ms Murray was on a different remuneration construct at that time and did not receive a 2018 LTI award.\n\nThe Committee undertook the pre-vest assessment at the end of 2020. It operates as a 'look back' to the performance year for which the award was made so we can consider whether anything has come to light since the grant that would change our original view of performance. A structured set of questions and evidence factors were used to guide discussions on whether we correctly assessed performance for 2017 and whether any further adjustment should be made prior to vesting. From the analysis, three areas were identified for further investigation covering share price, customer and risk performance.\n\nIn considering the underperformance of the share price since 2017, we did not believe this was due to factors within management's reasonable control. The reduction in our share price showed a clear correlation with other large UK banks over the period. While customer NPS had declined in three of the six areas since 2017, this was primarily due to management actions in subsequent years and had been accounted for in adjustments to the relevant LTI awards. Therefore, we did not believe any further adjustments were necessary for these areas.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report\n\nTurning to risk, there had been no decline in performance but the expected improvement in the control environment rating had not been attained in subsequent years as the progress envisaged on Customer Due Diligence and associated matters (CDD) had not been achieved.\n\nAs a result, the Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) recommended that the Committee consider making a pre-vest adjustment to Ms Rose's 2018 LTI award using the Risk & Control underpin. The Committee was advised that management had not fully appreciated the scale and complexity of the challenges relating to the remediation of CDD during 2017. While Ms Rose was not primarily responsible for the 2017 CDD remediation plan, she had associated responsibility as the CEO of one of the franchises in which remediation was required. The Committee agreed that this should result in a 5% pre-vest reduction on Ms Rose's original maximum LTI award level.\n\nWe have also made a pre-vest reduction of 7.5% of maximum to Ross McEwan's award in relation to the same issue. The reduction in Mr McEwan's 2018 LTI award was greater than Ms Rose's as he was considered to have had supervisory oversight responsibility.\n\nFull details of the pre-vest assessment for both Ms Rose and Mr McEwan can be found on page 135.\n\n## 2018 LTI award to Alison Rose\n\n|        | Maximum   | Granted   | Shares to  vest   |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Shares | 564,122   | 488,906   | 460,700           |\n| Value  | \u00a31.5m     | \u00a31.3m     | \u00a30.65m            |\n\nThe \u00a30.65m value reflects both an aggregate reduction of 18.33% of the maximum LTI award level for Ms Rose across pre-grant and pre-vest stages and also the fall in the share price over the performance period.\n\nWhile the performance cycle has completed, the shares from the 2018 LTI award will vest in tranches up to 2025 and remain subject to retention and malus and clawback provisions to ensure recipients maintain a long-term focus in their decision-making.\n\n## Executive pay in a market context\n\nThe Committee receives annual updates that compare executive remuneration at NatWest Group to a broad peer group, consisting primarily of UK and overseas-based banks but also some insurers. A further comparison is made against the FTSE30. The latest analysis shows that CEO target total compensation at NatWest Group remains at the lower quartile of the FTSE30 and is also at the lower end of the main UK banks. The position against the broad peer group is around median.\n\nThe CFO is positioned slightly higher against the market with target total compensation at median against the FTSE30 but again at the lower end of the main UK banks. The position against the broad peer group is above median.\n\n## Approach to windfall gains\n\nThis has been a focal point for shareholders in 2020 due to share prices being highly volatile and we have given the matter a great deal of thought. Over an executive's tenure it is likely that there will be some years where awards will be granted at times when the share price appears low compared with the long-run trend and other times where the opposite will occur. The key principle here is alignment with shareholders and our heavily share-based construct, with shares granted at different prices over the years, already creates close symmetry with market movements in either direction.\n\nThe LTI awards granted in March 2020 were made at a time when the true impact of COVID-19 was just beginning to emerge. The share price fell significantly after the grant was made before recovering some of that ground by the end of the year. I wrote to our major shareholders before the AGM confirming that the Committee would consider any potential windfall gains prior to vesting and would use its discretion where appropriate.\n\nAfter considering a number of options, we continue to believe that assessing windfall gains prior to vesting, rather than at grant, is the optimal time to consider any adjustments.\n\nIn order to help guide our judgement in these circumstances, and to reassure shareholders that there is rigour involved, a framework has been implemented to assess whether windfall gains have arisen over the period from grant to vest and the factors to consider in making any adjustments.\n\nFor the 2021 LTI award this framework ensures the following factors are taken into account:\n\n- \uf0b7 the level of the grant price in comparison to pre COVID-19 levels;\n- \uf0b7 the level of share price appreciation (if any) over the period up to vest;\n- \uf0b7 consideration of whether share price appreciation was unique to NatWest Group and indicative of strong management performance; and\n- \uf0b7 whether any reduction had been applied to award levels at pre-grant.\n\nOn the final point above, as set out earlier in this letter, the 2021 LTI award levels were significantly reduced to reflect the impact of COVID-19. The significant reductions applied prior to grant will, in line with the framework, be an important factor in determining whether any windfall gains have arisen prior to vesting.\n\n## Other workforce considerations Fairness\n\nThe Committee continued to review remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce during the year and worked closely with the Sustainable Banking Committee. A decision was taken to introduce a Fair Pay Charter for NatWest Group, which is based around ten key principles and builds on the existing elements of our fair pay approach.\n\nIt is pleasing to see that the number of colleagues at NatWest Group who believe they are paid fairly increased again during 2020, to a level significantly above the Global Financial Services Norm. In the UK, our rates of pay continue to exceed the Living Wage foundation benchmarks. For our major hubs outside the UK, we continue to pay above the minimum and Living Wage rates in the Republic of Ireland as well as exceeding the minimum wage benchmarks in India and Poland.\n\n## Gender and ethnicity\n\nThe Committee considers gender and ethnicity pay gap metrics to be another important indicator and full details can be found in the Strategic report and on natwestgroup.com. This is the third year that we have published ethnicity pay gap information on a voluntary basis. We are confident that colleagues are paid fairly, and policies and processes are kept under review to make sure this continues to be the case.\n\n## Financial wellbeing\n\nWe also discussed the financial wellbeing of colleagues. Following a successful campaign over the last two years, the number of colleagues saving nothing for life after work has reduced by 13% and pension contributions have increased by over \u00a331 million. Colleagues have access to a range of flexible benefits and in certain jurisdictions they can choose to join one of our employee share plans. The Committee agreed to the extension of our popular Sharesave plan to Poland and India for the first time.\n\n## Engaging with colleagues\n\nI enjoyed attending another meeting with the Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) during the year, which provides direct engagement between colleagues and Board members. I provided the CAP with an update on our approach to executive director remuneration and how it aligns with the wider company pay policy. Feedback was positive with members stating that the principles behind executive director pay were clear and fair.\n\nIn addition to the commitment to maintain workforce pay at the outset of COVID-19 and not to place colleagues on furlough, measures were put in place to enable colleagues to work safely and productively, including home working support. A virtual GP service was also introduced together with a guided suite of wellbeing programmes to help support mental health. Steps were also taken to maintain internships and NatWest Group did not cut any apprenticeship programmes during 2020.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nNatWest Group will shortly publish an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report, to provide additional information on ESG issues to investors, regulators, customers, suppliers, colleagues and other stakeholders. The report will be available on natwestgroup.com. Along with the Fair Pay Charter, this provides a further platform for us to explain how various aspects of wider workforce remuneration provide a link between culture, pay and ESG.",

ESG measures form an integral part of our LTI goals. For 2021, there are targets related to our climate ambitions as well as supporting enterprise and building financial capability, aligned with our purpose.\n\n## Response to shareholder feedback\n\nPriority areas have been identified for the first time to provide increased transparency to shareholders on the goals considered to be key deliverables for the year. This is intended to address stakeholder feedback on the level of discretion afforded to the Committee under our LTI construct.\n\nTogether with the new ratings that have been introduced to indicate the extent of over or underperformance against targets, this will provide additional insight into how the Committee viewed performance over the year and the factors it regarded as having more of a bearing on executive pay decisions. The priority areas for 2021 include financial and risk performance as well as measures related to climate, enterprise, customers, shared purpose and culture.\n\nThe revised remuneration requirements under the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) will be another focus for the Committee during 2021. It will bring about some changes to remuneration arrangements for Material Risk Takers, including extending the minimum deferral period from three to four years for variable pay awards.\n\nI hope this letter and the rest of the report will help to explain the Committee's approach to pay decisions for the year and why we believe these strike an appropriate balance.

This provides opportunities to improve by assessing colleague sentiment and checking progress in making NatWest Group a great place to work.\n\n| Engagement with  colleagues      | A colleague opinion (Our View) survey provides all colleagues with the opportunity to have a say on what it feels like to  work at NatWest Group, twice per year. Nearly 50,000 colleagues participated in the latest survey, which took place in  September 2020. Regular engagement with colleagues also takes place throughout the year. Board members would  normally visit business areas to hear directly from colleagues along with townhall meetings and question and answer  sessions with senior executives. Due to the restrictions in place for most of the year, there has been more focus on  regular online engagement. Feedback from colleagues is included in the people measures that impact executive pay.   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Colleague  Advisory Panel  (CAP) | voice in the boardroom. The CAP is chaired by Lena Wilson as a designated non-executive director and facilitates  regular dialogue between colleagues and Board members.

Following each meeting, a summary is provided to the Board and a follow-up call is held so that members of the CAP  can hear how their views were shared and what happened as a result. Feedback has been good with members  highlighting that the CAP is open, transparent, engaging and members feel able to share their views with the Board.                          |\n\n## Supporting colleagues throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nFrom the outset, supporting colleagues has been a priority and a summary of the measures put in place is set out below:\n\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group did not furlough any colleagues during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Pay was protected until the end of September regardless of the need to take time off for COVID-19 related illness, dependants care, isolation or childcare.\n- \uf0b7 Steps were taken to ensure all physical distancing and protective measures were in place, including the use of static desks, recommendations on the use of face coverings and thermal imaging where appropriate.\n- \uf0b7 A commitment was made to pay expenses incurred to travel to work if normal public transport was disrupted or not safe.\n- \uf0b7 Home working was quickly made available to over 50,000 colleagues, who could also request equipment to work from home effectively.\n- \uf0b7 A virtual GP service was made available, allowing colleagues to access a doctor 24 hours a day.\n- \uf0b7 Silvercloud was launched, which contains a guided suite of wellbeing programmes to help support mental health.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group maintained all its internships and did not cut any apprenticeship programmes during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Support continues for colleagues through a comprehensive employment policy suite. In particular, there are competitive leave and sickness absence policies, where all COVID-19 sickness absences continue to be fully paid.\n\nFurther details on NatWest Group's broader response to the pandemic and support for colleagues can be found in the Strategic report.",

The objective is to deliver reward in a way that is aligned to the current and future needs of the business, enabling managers to use reward as a business tool alongside other people initiatives.\n\n## Our Fair Pay Charter\n\n## Principles to support fairness for all our colleagues\n\n| 1. Simplicity   | The reward proposition has been simplified to make it easier for colleagues to understand.                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.

Flexibility  | Colleagues are supported in working flexibly, in ways that balance customer and business needs and their personal  circumstances. Colleagues can also select the combination and level of benefits that best meets their needs.        |\n| 4. Transparency | Pay decisions reflect the performance of NatWest Group and the individual, taking into account the behaviours and  values demonstrated. Information on salary ranges and the annual pay review is readily available to all colleagues. |\n|                 | Gender and ethnicity pay gaps are reported.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 5.

All Grade A and the majority of Grade B level colleagues are remunerated through fixed pay only, which was increased when variable pay was removed. This provides them with greater security and allows them to fully focus on the needs of the customer.\n\nRegular performance conversations, coaching and development help colleagues to do their best every day. Colleague performance and development is managed continuously through setting goals and regular check-ins to discuss progress, development and feedback. Importantly, performance is assessed not just on what has been achieved but also on how it has been achieved. Critical People Capability behaviours are used to provide a consistent Group-wide behavioural measure.\n\nNatWest Group continues to target colleague financial wellbeing with a strategy that focuses on budgeting & planning, savings & investment, debt management, protection and saving for life after work.\n\nThe long-term success of NatWest Group depends on building and nurturing a healthy culture where colleagues are engaged, and where the working environment is underpinned by robust risk behaviours.\n\nOur Values and Our Code are there to guide colleagues in their interactions with customers and to reinforce the right behaviours and long-term decision making.\n\nProgress on culture is monitored and feedback is received from regulators and industry bodies, including the Banking Standards Board's (BSB) annual assessment of culture in the UK banking sector.\n\nThere has been continued progress for 2020 with four of the BSB survey categories improving during the year, four staying the same and only one, on resilience, showing a slight decline.\n\nThe NatWest Group Learning Academy was launched in 2020 to recognise the importance of having a continuous learning culture. The aim is to help colleagues learn and reflect as well as build current and future skills.\n\nThe goal is to create a sustainable, progressive, inclusive and diverse workplace, that champions potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive. NatWest Group's positive action approach ensures that people policies and processes are inclusive and accessible from attracting and recruiting colleagues to how we reward and engage them - and is helping to achieve a better balance of diversity throughout the organisation.\n\nIn 2015 a target was set for each business area to have >30% women in their most senior roles by 2020. 14 of our 15 businesses have achieved this. Overall, there are now 39% women in this population, representing a 10% increase since 2015. NatWest Group is committed to full gender balance by 2030. In 2018, a goal was set to have 14% Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic leaders in the UK by 2025. At 10%, this has increased by 2% since targets were introduced. During 2020, a new goal was set to have c.3% Black colleagues in UK senior roles by 2025.\n\nInclusivity continues to score highly in the colleague opinion survey, with colleagues scoring NatWest Group 17 points above the GFS Norm.\n\n## Alignment with executive pay\n\nTargets to support building the capability of colleagues, strengthening culture and building a diverse workforce with an inclusive environment are part of the measures that impact the pay awarded to executive directors. See pages 135 to 138 for further details.\n\n## Excellent development\n\nHelp to build the capabilities needed to thrive and do a great job (both now and in the future)\n\n## Great leadership\n\nEquipping all managers to give their teams the support and leadership they need to thrive\n\nA healthy and inclusive environment",

These were set to reflect the new strategy and key focus areas of Climate, Enterprise & Learning. New goals were created around climate ('to be a leading bank helping to address the climate challenge'), enterprise ('new business creation irrespective of gender, background or geography') and people targets were focussed on shared purpose and building the capability of colleagues.

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## 2018 LTI award - Pre-vest performance assessment framework\n\nLTI awards were made in early 2018 following an assessment of performance over the 2017 financial year. In accordance with the LTI construct, the Committee has undertaken a further review of performance for 2017 to consider whether anything has come to light which might call into question the original award. Any indication of underperformance is reviewed to assess whether it would be appropriate to make a reduction. The process that has been followed to determine whether sustainable performance has been delivered for the 2018 LTI award is set out below. An assessment of performance was provided by internal control functions and PwC provided an independent view to the Committee.\n\n## Pre-vest test for 2018 LTI award - when looking back to performance for 2017, and 'knowing what we know now', has NatWest Group:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhere the answer is 'Yes', three further questions have been considered:\n\n- 1. Is the underperformance due to factors within management's reasonable control in the circumstances?\n- 2. Can the underperformance be linked back to the performance year to which the award relates, rather than performance developments since?\n- 3. Is it appropriate to reflect the underperformance in the current pre-vest test (i.e. if the underperformance has not been adequately reflected in other ways such as subsequent pre-grant tests for awards granted in the interim)?\n\nIf the answer to each of these questions is 'Yes', the Committee may decide that a further adjustment prior to vesting is appropriate, and it has the discretion to decide the amount.\n\n## Further analysis\n\nThree areas were investigated - share price, customer and risk with a specific focus on Customer Due Diligence remediation.\n\n- \uf0b7 Supported by external opinion, it was concluded that share price underperformance was not due to factors within management's reasonable control, given the close correlation in share price performance over the period with our main competitors.\n- \uf0b7 While NPS had declined in some areas and management's decisions to close branches had a bearing, this had already been accounted for through adjustments to LTI awards in subsequent years.\n- \uf0b7 Whilst on risk there had been no material deterioration in risk culture or profile over the period, it was felt appropriate that consideration of management performance relating to Customer Due Diligence and associated matters (CDD) should be assessed using the Risk & Control underpin.\n\n## Risk & Control and Stakeholder Perception underpins\n\nThe underpins provide scope to consider significant risk, stakeholder or reputational matters not already captured in the performance assessment, taking into account advice from the BRC and the SBC. The underpins can also be used to consider events arising during the period between grant and the end of year three. Having reviewed the facts relating to management performance with regard to CDD, and recognising its significance, BRC agreed it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider an adjustment to 2018 LTI vest levels.\n\nAchievement of 'threshold level of sustainable performance' has been evidenced.\n\nNo adjustment proposed, subject to the underpins below.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## BRC assessment and recommendation to invoke the Risk & Control underpin\n\nFollowing a detailed investigation by management, the BRC concluded that there had not been a full appreciation across management of the scale and complexity of the challenges related to the remediation of CDD during 2017. This had led to issues with the in-year remediation plan which had not been fully reflected at grant or in subsequent grants. Following the steps above, the BRC recommended that the Committee consider the application of the Risk & Control underpin for 2018 LTI awards.\n\n## RemCo assessment and final outcome\n\nFollowing the recommendation from the BRC to consider the application of the Risk & Control underpin, it was agreed that the awards of four individuals holding 2018 LTI awards would be adjusted. Ross McEwan was viewed as having supervisory responsibility for the CDD remediation plan during 2017 and Alison Rose was considered to have had associated responsibility, in her role as CEO of Commercial and Private Banking during 2017. Of the two other recipients, one was also considered to have associated responsibility, with the other being considered primarily responsible for the 2017 plan. The Committee considered at length the differing level of involvement and responsibility for the CDD remediation programme in 2017 across the four individuals, to ensure fair and proportionate adjustments were made.\n\nMr McEwan received an LTI award of 592,328 shares in 2018 following the application of the pre-grant performance assessment which resulted in a reduction of 10% from the maximum award level of 658,142 shares. Under the pre-vest assessment above, a further reduction of 7.5% of the maximum award was applied using the Risk & Control underpin, resulting in a balance of 542,968 shares. As a member of the Executive Committee at the time, Ms Rose received a 2018 LTI award of 488,906 shares following the pre-grant test, representing a 13.33% reduction from the maximum possible award. The Committee and the Board agreed that a further reduction of 5% on Ms Rose's LTI maximum award level would be appropriate using the Risk & Control underpin. Applying a slightly lower reduction for Ms Rose compared to Mr McEwan was considered to be proportionate as while Ms Rose, as a franchise CEO, had associated responsibility for CDD remediation in 2017, Mr McEwan had supervisory oversight of the in-year remediation plan. Further details on Mr McEwan's arrangements can be found in the payments to past directors section.\n\nA summary of the agreed award level for Ms Rose and the estimated vesting value is set out below.\n\n| Alison Rose    | Maximum  shares at grant   | Reduction at  pre-grant test   | Shares  granted   | Further reduction from  maximum at pre-vest test   | Shares to  vest   | Vested  value (1)   |\n|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| 2018 LTI award | 564,122                    | 13.33%                         | 488,906           | 5%                                                 | 460,700           | \u00a3649,586            |\n\nNote:\n\n(1) Based on a share price of \u00a31.41, the average over the three-month period from October to December 2020.\n\n## Pre-grant assessment of performance in 2020 (for LTI awards to be granted in 2021)\n\nFor each of the core performance areas, the Committee considers whether the executive director has achieved what would reasonably have been expected over the performance year prior to grant. The achievement of reasonable or 'target' performance expectations can deliver full or nearly full pay-out of the LTI awards, as long as executives deliver good, sustainable performance. This approach reflects the significantly reduced level of LTI awards expected to be granted under the company's LTI construct, in comparison to traditional LTI structures, which is designed to create more predictable outcomes and encourage safe and secure growth within risk appetite.\n\nThe Committee follows a robust process to review performance against pre-set goals relevant to NatWest Group's strategic aims for that year but applies its judgement without a formulaic range for vesting or mechanistic weightings. Performance is assessed taking into account circumstances applying over the period. Risk & Control and Stakeholder Perception underpins also apply under which the Committee can consider if there are any other factors that would lead to a downwards adjustment. Awards may be reduced, potentially down to zero, further to the application of either the pre-grant or pre-vest tests where there has been significant underperformance or risk management failings. In line with feedback received from some shareholders, ratings have been added to the table below to show the extent of under or overperformance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Core strategic  areas                                                                                  | Measures and targets to assess pre-grant performance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Performance against targets for 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Ratings   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Scorecard Financial &  Business  Delivery Purpose  alignment Has a  purpose  which delivers  long-term | Run a safe and secure bank Achieve NatWest Group cost reduction target of  \u00a3250m based on operating expense reduction.

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## Outcome of the pre-grant assessment for the 2021 LTI award\n\nThe Committee also received advice from the BRC and the SBC in making its final assessment. As part of its 'performance in the round' judgement, the Committee noted that targets had been met or exceeded for six of the areas above, one was partially met and four were missed, albeit narrowly in some cases. Of these areas the resilience of underlying financial performance, despite the exceptionally challenging environment, and the progress in embedding and demonstrating the Group's purpose internally and externally were viewed as having a significant bearing on the overall view of performance. Whilst progress against the enterprise goal fell significantly short of target, the Committee acknowledged the response had been appropriate in prioritising support to existing customers over new business growth.\n\n## Alison Rose\n\nTurning to individual performance, Ms Rose was considered to have had a highly impressive first full year in her CEO role. Despite it being a remarkably challenging year, an effective launch of the Group's purpose and her strong leadership and energy through the pandemic had resulted in an excellent operating performance. There had been effective engagement with key external stakeholders, some progress on customer scores and good people scores in a difficult year. Underlying financial performance was viewed as very respectable despite the impact of COVID-19 on results. NatWest Group continued to be behind target on risk measures, although risk culture had continued to improve. Taking into account performance against the core goals as set out above and the uniquely challenging and unanticipated external events of 2020, the Committee agreed an LTI award level of \u00a3899,000 would be appropriate. This would equate to 82% of salary and 47% of the maximum LTI award level. This outcome included an exceptional COVID-19 reduction of 38% to reflect the impact of the pandemic on the wider economic environment and NatWest Group's performance and affordability, otherwise performance against the pre-set and unadjusted 2020 performance targets would have resulted in an award level equal to 75% of Ms Rose's maximum. This is below the longterm guidance of 80% for assumed average vesting over a CEO's tenure. The Committee went on to acknowledge that Ms Rose had informed the Board in April that she did not wish to be considered for an LTI award for 2020 and, therefore, no award will be made.\n\n## Katie Murray\n\nMs Murray's performance in 2020 was also considered to be strong, with highlights including managing crucial parts of the COVID-19 agenda, especially capital, liquidity and funding plans, and driving annual cost reductions in line with target. There had been improved management of investor engagement with positive feedback received and Ms Murray had demonstrated excellent leadership and had made progress on transforming the Finance function and its executive team as well as its inclusion agenda. In light of performance achieved, the Committee agreed that an LTI award of \u00a3682,000 would be appropriate, which equates to 90% of salary and 45% of the maximum award available. Again, this outcome included an exceptional COVID-19 reduction of 38%, otherwise performance against the pre-set unadjusted 2020 performance targets would have resulted in an award level equal to 73% of Ms Murray's maximum. This is also below the long-term guidance of 80% for assumed average vesting.\n\n|              | Maximum award   | Reduction for  pre-grant performance   | Reduction for  COVID-19 and affordability   | Award level agreed by  Committee (% of max.)   | LTI award to be  made in 2021   |\n|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | \u00a31,925,000      | \u00a3475,000                               | \u00a3551,000                                    | 47%                                            | -                               |\n| Katie Murray | \u00a31,500,000      | \u00a3400,000                               | \u00a3418,000                                    | 45%                                            | \u00a3682,000                        |\n\nNote:\n\n(1) 2021 LTI award for Ms Murray represents a 38% reduction on her 2020 LTI award.\n\n## Pre-vest performance assessment for 2021 LTI awards\n\nThe pre-vest assessment for LTI awards due to be granted in March 2021 will operate in a similar way to the pre-vest framework in place for 2018 LTI awards, as described in detail on page 134. In early 2024, the Committee will look back to consider whether anything has come to light that would indicate that the pre-grant assessment based on the 2020 performance year did not represent a correct view of performance at that time, thereby requiring a reduction or cancellation in the vesting of the award. Underpins provide scope to consider significant risk and control, stakeholder or reputational matters not already captured in the performance assessment. Full details of the assessment will be disclosed prior to the first vesting taking place in 2024.\n\nCorporate Governance",

One change was made to the level of fees, with the Chairman of the CAP receiving a temporary increase from \u00a315,000 to \u00a330,000 per annum to reflect the additional engagement with the workforce as a result of COVID-19. The increase applies for the period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. For NatWest Group plc Board directors who also serve on the boards and committees of NatWest Holdings Limited, National Westminster Bank Plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Ulster Bank Limited, the fees below reflect membership of all five boards and their respective board committees. Where appropriate, directors also received fees for membership of other subsidiary company boards and committees including NatWest Markets Plc, the value of which is included below. The year on year (YoY) percentage change for fees and benefits has been added below in line with new reporting regulations. Membership of Board Committees is reviewed regularly and changes in membership will impact the level of fees paid to non-executive directors from one year to the next. Two directors left during the year which had a further impact and the benefits figures have largely fallen due to there being significantly less travel in 2020.\n\n## Total single figure of remuneration for the Chairman and non-executive directors during 2020\n\n|                          | Fees   | Fees   | Fees   | Benefits  (1)   | Benefits  (1)   | Total   | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                          | 2020   | 2019   | YoY%   | 2020            | 2019            | YoY%    | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Chairman (composite fee) | \u00a3000   | \u00a3000   | change | \u00a3000            | \u00a3000            | change  | \u00a3000    | \u00a3000    |\n| Howard Davies            | 750    | 750    | -      | 12              | 11              | 9       | 762     | 761     |\n\n|                         |            |          |          |      | BRC RemCo SBC   |    |          |           |      |                          | Fees      |             | Benefits  (2)   | Benefits  (2)   |             | Total     | Total     |\n|-------------------------|------------|----------|----------|------|-----------------|----|----------|-----------|------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-executive directors | Board \u00a3000 | N&G \u00a3000 | GAC \u00a3000 | \u00a3000 | \u00a3000 \u00a3000       |    | TIC \u00a3000 | SID  \u00a3000 | \u00a3000 | CAP Other 2020 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 | 2019 \u00a3000 | YoY% change | 2020 \u00a3000       | 2019 \u00a3000       | YoY% change | 2020 \u00a3000 | 2019 \u00a3000 |\n| Frank Dangeard (3)      |            |          |          |      |                 |    |          |           |      | 260 260                  | 260       | 0           | 1               | 4               | (75)        | 261       | 264       |\n| Alison Davis (4)        | 20         |          |          |      | 8               | 7  | 15       |           |      | 50                       |           | 200 (75)    | 2               | 24              | (92)        | 52        | 224       |\n| Patrick Flynn           | 80         | 15       | 68       | 34   |                 |    | 30       |           |      | 227                      | 223       | 2           | 3               | 10              | (70)        | 230       | 233       |\n| Morten Friis            | 80         | 6        | 34       | 48   |                 |    |          |           |      | 168                      | 148       | 14          | 7               | 35              | (80)        | 175       | 183       |\n| Robert Gillespie        | 80         | 15       | 14       | 34   | 60              | 18 |          |           |      | 221                      | 227       | (3)         | 3               | 19              | (84)        | 224       | 246       |\n| Yasmin Jetha (4)        | 60         |          |          |      |                 | 23 | 45       |           |      | 128                      | -         | n/a         | -               | -               | n/a         | 128       | -         |\n| Baroness Noakes (4)     | 47         | 9        | 20       | 39   |                 |    |          |           |      | 115                      | 205       | (44)        | 1               | 17              | (94)        | 116       | 222       |\n| Mike Rogers             | 80         |          |          |      | 30              | 60 |          |           |      | 170                      | 170       | 0           | 2               | 12              | (83)        | 172       | 182       |\n| Mark Seligman           | 80         | 15       | 34       |      | 30              |    |          | 30        |      | 189                      | 197       | (4)         | 1               | 8               | (88)        | 190       | 205       |\n| Lena Wilson             | 80         |          |          | 14   | 22              | 30 | 8        |           | 26   | 180                      | 155       | 16          | 4               | 11              | (64)        | 184       | 166       |\n\nNo variable pay is provided to the Chairman and non-executive directors in line with the Code.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (1) The benefits column for Howard Davies, Chairman, includes private medical cover (\u00a311,007) as well as life cover and expenses in connection with attendance at Board meetings (c.\u00a31,000 in total).

The Board agreed that Mr McEwan qualified for good leaver treatment, as per the requirements in the policy section of this report, in respect of his unvested LTI awards. In line with good leaver status, outstanding LTI awards granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 will continue to vest on their scheduled vesting dates and pro -rating will not apply. All awards remain subject to a performance assessment prior to vesting and the potential application of malus and clawback provisions.\n\nAs set out on page 135, Mr McEwan received an LTI award of 592,328 shares in 2018 which was reduced to 542,968 shares following the prevest assessment and the application of the Risk & Control underpin. The remaining shares are due to vest between 2021 and 2025, subject to the good leaver criteria continuing to be met and the potential application of malus and clawback provisions. The value of the shares is \u00a3765,585, based on the average share price over October to December 2020. Similar disclosures will be made in future reports for Mr McEwan's 2019 and 2020 LTI awards, once the pre-vest assessment has taken place. In addition, Mr McEwan received assistance with his UK tax return in relation to a tax year during which he was still employed by NatWest Group, with a value of \u00a32,108. There are no other payments to past directors to disclose for 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nEvery year an extensive consultation is undertaken with major shareholders and other stakeholders prior to the Committee making any final decisions on remuneration and variable pay awards. In late 2020, meetings took place with a number of institutional shareholders, UK Government Investments (UKGI) and other stakeholders. A range of topics were discussed including the impact of COVID-19 on remuneration decisions, potential approaches to windfall gains and the disclosure framework for LTI awards.\n\nAs part of the discussions on COVID-19, it was explained that NatWest Group had not placed any colleagues on furlough or sought other forms of government support. Shareholders were interested in the reasons for withdrawing dividend payments during the year and the Committee Chairman explained that NatWest Group remained very well capitalised, with the decision made at the request of regulators as a precaution. It was clear from the discussions that windfall gains from LTI awards was a key area of focus, due to the high volatility in share prices, although views on how such gains should be mitigated were not always aligned across investors. The Committee acknowledged these concerns and a new framework was established to address potential windfall gains as explained earlier in this report.\n\nDisclosure relating to LTI awards was another theme from the engagement meetings, with feedback that greater clarity on the factors the Committee had taken into account in exercising its discretion would be welcomed. As a result, the Committee agreed to make two enhancements to LTI disclosures: inclusion of a ratings system to give some indication of the extent of over or underperformance against the targets for the current year; and the identification of the measures the Committee is expecting to be priority areas for the performance year ahead. The intention is to provide shareholders with additional insight on how the Committee viewed performance over the year and which factors had more of a bearing than others in determining the final outcome. The first disclosures to incorporate these features are included in this report.\n\nMore generally, meetings also take place with retail shareholders allowing Board members to hear directly from the wider shareholder base on any matters of importance. Three virtual retail shareholder events were held in 2020 providing shareholders with the opportunity to pose questions to a panel of executives and non-executive directors. Similar events are planned for 2021. Shareholders continue to play a vital role in developing remuneration practices and the Committee is very grateful for their involvement in the process.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy in 2021\n\nDetails are set out below of remuneration to be awarded in 2021 to executive directors. The salary, benefits, pension and fixed share allowance for the CEO and CFO are unchanged. The LTI pre-grant assessment has been completed with the Committee making a recommendation to the Board on the CFO's LTI award. The Board approved the recommendation, as set out below. Details of the performance measures and assessment relating to the CEO and CFO LTI awards can be found on pages 135 to 138.\n\n## Executive directors' remuneration to be awarded in 2021\n\n|              | Salary     | Standard benefits (1)   | Pension (% of salary)   | Fixed share allowance 100% of salary (2)   | Maximum  LTI award (3)   | LTI award following pre-grant  assessment over 2020 (4)   |\n|--------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | \u00a31,100,000 | \u00a326,250                 | \u00a3110,000 (10%)          | \u00a31,100,000                                 | \u00a31,925,000               | -                                                         |\n| Katie Murray | \u00a3750,000   | \u00a326,250                 | \u00a375,000 (10%)           | \u00a3750,000                                   | \u00a31,500,000               | \u00a3682,000                                                  |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (1) Amount shown relates to standard benefit funding. Executive directors are also entitled to travel assistance and security arrangements in line with the policy. The value of benefits received will be disclosed each year.\n- (2) Fixed share allowance payable broadly in arrears, currently in four instalments per year, with shares released in equal amounts over a three-year period.\n- (3) If the maximum LTI award was made, the maximum remuneration receivable by the CEO and CFO would increase by \u00a3962,500 and \u00a3750,000 respectively from the amounts shown above in the event that there was a 50% increase in the NatWest Group plc share price over the period from grant to vest.\n- (4) The Committee agreed that, if Ms Rose had not indicated she did not wish to be considered for an award, it would have granted her an LTI award in 2021 of \u00a3899,000, which reflected adjustments for the performance assessment and a further exceptional reduction in light of the impact of COVID-19.\n\n## Timing of payments to executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance Goals for 2021 (for the pre-grant assessment of LTI awards to be made in 2022)\n\nPerformance will be assessed across four core areas using a balanced scorecard and with measures that align with NatWest Group's purpose. It should be noted that the pre-grant assessment for LTI awards operates over a one-year period based on strategic targets for that year and, in this respect, it has some similarities to the operation of annual bonus awards rather than traditional long-term incentive awards. Targets are disclosed in advance where these are not deemed commercially sensitive.\n\nThere are no weightings set for the performance categories, however, the Committee follows a robust process to review performance against pre-set goals, measures and targets with certain 'priority measures' having been identified below for 2021. These priority measures will be a key focus for the Committee as it applies its judgement to the assessment of performance for the year. Full details of the targets and the assessment of performance against such targets will be set out in next year's report. Priority measures for 2021 are highlighted in grey shading.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## Other external directorships\n\nAgreement from the Board must be sought before directors accept any additional roles outside of NatWest Group. Procedures are in place to make sure that regulatory limits on the number of directorships held are complied with. The Board would also consider whether it was appropriate for executive directors to retain any remuneration receivable in respect of any new external directorships, taking into account the nature of the appointment. Details of the directorships held by directors can be found in the biographies section of the Corporate governance report.\n\n## CEO to employee pay ratios\n\nThe ratios compare the total remuneration of the CEO, as set out in this report, against the remuneration of the median UK employee as well as employees at the lower and upper quartiles. A significant proportion of the CEO's pay is delivered in LTI awards, where awards are linked to performance and share price movements over the longer term. Therefore, the ratios will depend significantly on LTI outcomes and may fluctuate from one year to the next. None of the three individuals identified at the 25th, 50th and 75th quartiles this year received LTI awards. The table also includes ratios based on salary only as well as remuneration values for further comparison.\n\nThe pay ratios are reflective of a diverse range of roles and pay levels across NatWest Group as a large financial services company. The median employee identified for the 2020 comparison works in the Retail Banking division and the median pay ratio is believed to be consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees taken as a whole. For each individual, NatWest Group is committed to paying a fair rate for the role performed, using consistent reward policies and with opportunities for progression. The steps that NatWest Group takes to ensure employees are paid fairly are set out earlier in this report. The change in total remuneration ratios since 2018 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of variable pay for the CEO. An additional factor that caused the ratio to fall in 2020 was the CEO's decision in April 2020 to forgo 25% of her fixed pay for the rest of the year with NatWest Group making a comparable donation to the NET Coronavirus Appeal. The trend based on a comparison of salary only is more stable over the period.\n\n|                 |             |                                 | Pay ratios   | Pay ratios    | Pay ratios   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)     | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Financial  Year | Methodology |                                 | P25  (LQ)    | P50  (Median) | P75          | (UQ) Calculation               | Chief  Executive             | Y25  (LQ)                    | Y50  (Median)                | Y75  (UQ)                    |\n| 2018            | A           | total remuneration              | 143:1        | 97:1          | 56:1         | total remuneration             | 3,578                        | 25                           | 37                           | 64                           |\n|                 |             | salary only                     | 44:1         | 30:1          | 19:1         | salary only                    | 1,000                        | 23                           | 33                           | 51                           |\n| 2019            | A           | total remuneration  salary only | 175:1 44:1   | 118:1 30:1    | 69:1 19:1    | total remuneration salary only | 4,517 1,017                  | 26 23                        | 38 34                        | 66 52                        |\n| 2020            | A           | total remuneration salary only  | 99:1 46:1    | 66:1 31:1     | 39:1 20:1    | total remuneration salary only | 2,615 1,100                  | 26 24                        | 40 36                        | 66 54                        |\n\nSupplementary information on pay ratio table:\n\n- (1) The data for 2020 is based on remuneration earned by Alison Rose, as set out in the single figure of remuneration table in this report.\n- (2) The employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles (lower, median and upper quartile) were determined as at 31 December of the relevant year, based on full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees. This includes fixed pay (salary, pension funding and where relevant benefit funding and other allowances) and also any variable pay where the amount to be paid has been used. For employees that work part-time, fixed pay is grossed up to the full-time equivalent.\n\n## Annual change in directors' pay compared to average change in employee pay\n\nUnder new reporting regulations, it is necessary to show a comparison of the annual change in director pay to the average pay of employees of the parent company. However, NatWest Group plc is a holding company and is not an employing entity, and therefore the disclosure below is made on a voluntary basis to compare any change with all employees based in the UK. In each case, remuneration is based on salary, benefits and annual bonus. The CEO and CFO receive fixed share allowances and are eligible for LTI awards rather than annual bonus. Non-executive directors receive fixed fees rather than salary and do not receive any variable pay. Fees for Board and Committee attendance have remained unchanged over the year other than an increase to the Chairman of the Colleague Advisory Panel. Further details on the fees and benefits for the Chairman and non-executive directors and the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 can be found on page 139.\n\n| Annual change 2019 to 2020   | Salary   | Benefits  (2)   | Annual Bonus   |\n|------------------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer (1)  | 8.2%     | 0%              | n/a            |\n| Chief Financial Officer      | 0%       | 0%              | n/a            |\n| UK employees (3)             | 2.86%    | 1.70%           | -32.4%         |\n\n## Notes:\n\n## Summary of remuneration levels for employees in 2020\n\n43,144 employees earned total remuneration up to \u00a350,000\n\n12,606 employees earned total remuneration between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000\n\n4,813 employees earned total remuneration between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3250,000\n\n803 employees earned total remuneration over \u00a3250,000",

These awards count on a net of tax basis towards meeting the shareholding requirement.\n- (3) Awards shown are still subject to the LTI pre-vest performance assessment and also subject to deferral periods and employment conditions before vesting. The pre-vest assessment of the 2018 LTI award concluded in January 2021, as set out earlier in this report.\n- (4) Awards granted under the Sharesave plan where colleagues can choose to save from their salary with an option to buy shares at the end of the savings period. The award price is the option price at which shares can be bought at the end of the savings period. Sharesave options are normally exercisable for a period of six months from the maturity date.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## Membership of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee\n\nAll members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors. In order to be considered for the role of Committee Chairman, an individual must first have served on a remuneration committee for at least 12 months.\n\nThe Committee held seven scheduled meetings in 2020 and a further eight ad hoc meetings. Details of members and attendance can be found in the Corporate governance report on page 100.\n\n## The role and responsibilities of the Committee\n\nThe Committee is responsible for:\n\n- \uf0b7 approving the remuneration policy for all colleagues and reviewing the effectiveness of its implementation;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing performance and making recommendations to the Board on arrangements for executive directors;\n- \uf0b7 approving performance and remuneration for a defined 'in scope' population capturing members and attendees of the Group and NWH Executive Committees, the direct reports of the CEO and heads of key legal entities, control function heads and the Company Secretary. The Committee also approves arrangements where individuals earn total compensation above \u00a31 million; and\n- \uf0b7 setting the remuneration framework and principles for colleagues identified as Material Risk Takers (MRTs) falling within the scope of UK regulatory requirements.\n\nThe remuneration policy operated broadly as intended during the year, with adjustments made for performance where appropriate. The Committee reviewed performance for senior executives and the implementation of the remuneration policy for all colleagues. The CEO's decision to forgo part of her fixed pay and all of her variable pay for 2020 meant that total remuneration was lower than envisaged.\n\nKey tasks for the Committee in 2020 included securing approval from shareholders for the renewal of the directors' remuneration policy and expanding its review of wider workforce remuneration and fair pay across the organisation. The Committee also considered the impact of COVID-19 on remuneration decisions.\n\nTo mitigate potential conflicts of interest, directors are not involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration and remuneration advisers are appointed by the Committee rather than management. Attendees also play an important role in advising the Committee but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed. The Group Chief HR Officer may be present when discussions take place on senior executive pay, as there is considerable benefit from her participation, but is never\n\npresent for discussions on her remuneration.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually and available on natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Summary of the principal activity in 2020\n\nTasks undertaken by the Committee included reviewing and, where appropriate, approving:\n\n## First half of 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 2019 performance assessments and remuneration arrangements for the Committee's 'in scope' population.\n- \uf0b7 2020 performance objectives for the 'in scope' population.\n- \uf0b7 Assessments of vesting levels for LTI awards granted in 2017.\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory updates and submissions.\n- \uf0b7 Total pay spend across the wider workforce, including analysis by colleague level, geography and diversity.\n- \uf0b7 The directors' remuneration policy with support from shareholders at the AGM.\n- \uf0b7 An enhancement to MRT identification and reporting for subsidiary entities.\n\n## Second half of 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 A 'masterclass' session with SBC to consider wider workforce remuneration.\n- \uf0b7 Half-year and year-end performance reviews for the 'in scope' population.\n- \uf0b7 Remuneration arrangements for the departing and incoming members of the Group's Executive Committees.\n- \uf0b7 The plan to engage with stakeholders on remuneration proposals.\n- \uf0b7 Management's assurance of the implementation of the Group-wide remuneration policy.\n- \uf0b7 Fixed pay proposals for the year ahead.\n- \uf0b7 The 2020 Sharesave offer.\n- \uf0b7 2020 variable pay proposals and the 2020 Directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe 2020 performance evaluation was conducted internally by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. This was structured around: operating rhythm; purpose & priorities; culture & dynamics; and input & support. The Committee was considered to have managed well in a difficult year and had been particularly supportive and responsive to multiple urgent requests from management. Ad hoc meetings aside, members agreed the operating rhythm was appropriate, with the Committee well sighted on wider workforce remuneration and also sufficiently engaged on the impact of COVID-19 on remuneration.\n\nMembers continued to see the benefits of the masterclass, with broad support for annual joint engagement sessions with the SBC on areas of mutual interest around the changing nature of the workforce, diversity and inclusion and wider workforce remuneration. Some concerns were expressed over the granular detail often included within papers. However, it was acknowledged that this was principally driven by the heavily regulated nature of the banking sector.\n\nThere was also a genuine appreciation for the Committee Chairman's dedication to the role, with members noting significant time commitment required from the Chairman in liaising with key internal and external stakeholders in order to deliver the year end pay process. Actions arising from the evaluation will be tracked during 2021.\n\n## Advisers to the Committee\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was first appointed as remuneration adviser by the Committee in 2010, following a review of potential advisers and the services provided. An annual review of the quality of advice and the associated level of fees was undertaken during 2020, following which the Committee agreed to retain the services of PwC. The Committee will continue to review the performance of its advisers each year.\n\nPwC is a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to remuneration consulting in the UK. As well as receiving advice from PwC, the Committee took account at meetings of the views of the Chairman; the CEO; the CFO; the Group Chief HR Officer; the Director of Reward & Employment; and the Group Chief Risk Officer. The Committee also received input from the BRC, the GAC and the SBC. Input was also received from Performance and Remuneration Committees for key legal entities across NatWest Group.\n\nPwC provides professional services in the ordinary course of business including assurance, advisory, tax and legal advice to NatWest Group subsidiaries. The Committee is satisfied that the advice received is independent and objective, and receives an annual statement setting out protocols that have been followed by PwC to maintain independence. There are no connections between PwC and individual directors to be disclosed.\n\nFees paid to PwC for advising the Committee are based on a fixed fee structure to cover standard services with any exceptional items charged on a time/cost basis. Fees for 2020 in relation to directors' remuneration amounted to \u00a3136,830 excluding VAT (2019 - \u00a3194,463).\n\n## Statement of shareholder voting\n\nThe tables below set out the latest resolutions to approve the directors' remuneration policy and the Annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Directors' remuneration policy - 2020\n\n| Vote     | No. of shares   | Percentage   |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------|\n| For      | 39,142,662,676  | 90.14%       |\n| Against  | 4,281,775,516   | 9.86%        |\n| Withheld | 12,426,752      | -            |\n\n## Annual report on remuneration - 2020\n\n| Vote     | No. of shares   | Percentage   |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------|\n| For      | 39,241,815,668  | 90.40%       |\n| Against  | 4,166,591,108   | 9.60%        |\n| Withheld | 28,522,020      | -            |\n\n## Robert Gillespie\n\nChairman of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee 1 9 February 2021\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nThis section contains a number of disclosures which are required in accordance with Article 450 of the Capital Requirements Regulation, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on sound remuneration policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the Directors' remuneration report starting on page 119.\n\n## Remuneration policy for all colleagues\n\nThe remuneration policy supports the business strategy and is designed to promote the long-term success of NatWest Group. It aims to reward the delivery of good performance provided this is achieved in a manner consistent with NatWest Group values and within acceptable risk parameters.\n\nThe remuneration policy applies the same principles to everyone, including MRTs, with some minor adjustments to the policy where necessary to comply with local regulatory requirements. The key elements of the policy are set out below.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe purpose is to provide a competitive level of fixed cash remuneration.\n\n## Operation\n\nBase salaries are reviewed annually and should reflect the talents, skills and competencies that the individual brings to the business.\n\n## Role-based allowance\n\nCertain MRT roles receive a role-based allowance. The purpose is to provide fixed pay that reflects the skills and experience required for the role.\n\n## Operation\n\nRole-based allowances are fixed allowances which form an element of overall fixed remuneration for regulatory purposes and are based on the role the individual performs.\n\nThey are delivered in cash and/or shares depending on the level of the allowance and the seniority of the recipient. Shares are subject to a three-year retention period.\n\n## Benefits and pension\n\nThe purpose is to provide a range of flexible and competitive benefits.\n\n## Operation\n\nIn most jurisdictions, benefits or a cash equivalent are provided from a flexible benefits account.\n\nPension funding forms part of fixed remuneration and NatWest Group does not actively provide discretionary pension benefits.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe purpose is to support a culture where individuals recognise the importance of serving customers well and are rewarded for superior performance.\n\n## Operation\n\nThe annual bonus pool is based on a balanced scorecard of measures including Financial & Business Delivery, Customer, People & Culture and Risk & Control measures. Allocation from the pool depends on performance of the business area and the individual.\n\nIndividual performance assessment is supported by a structured performance management framework. This is designed to assess performance against longer term business requirements across a range of financial and non-financial metrics as well as an evaluation of adherence to internal controls and risk management. A balanced scorecard is used to align with the business strategy. Each individual will have defined measures of success appropriate to their role.\n\nRisk and conduct performance is also taken into account. Control functions are assessed independently of the business units that they oversee, with the objectives and remuneration being set according to the priorities of the control area, not the targets of the businesses they support. The Group Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Audit Executive have the authority to escalate matters to Board level if management do not respond appropriately.\n\nIndependent control functions exist for key legal entities outside the ring-fence (NWM Plc and RBS International), with dual solid reporting lines into both the legal entity CEO and the NatWest Group Control Function Head.\n\nFor awards made in respect of the 2020 performance year, immediate cash awards continue to be limited to a maximum of \u00a32,000. In line with regulatory requirements, a significant proportion of annual bonus awards for more senior roles is deferred and includes partial delivery in shares.\n\nThe deferral period varies from three years for standard MRTs, rising to five years for individuals identified as Risk Manager MRTs and seven years for Senior Managers under the UK's Senior Managers Regime. All awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions. For MRTs, a minimum of 50% of any annual bonus is delivered in shares and a twelve-month retention period will apply post vesting in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) took effect on 28 December 2020 which will impact remuneration requirements for the 2021 performance year. This includes extending the minimum deferral period from three to four years for MRTs and also some changes to the criteria for identifying MRTs. Further details will be included in next year's report.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) awards\n\nThe purpose and operation of LTI awards is explained in detail in the Directors' remuneration report. Instead of an annual bonus, NatWest Group provides executive directors and certain members of NatWest Group's senior executive committees with LTI awards. Any awards made are subject to a performance assessment prior to grant and again prior to vesting.\n\n## Shareholding requirements\n\nThe requirements promote long-term alignment between senior executives and shareholders.\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive directors and certain members of NatWest Group's senior executive committees are required to build up and hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of salary. There is a restriction on the number of shares that individuals can sell until the requirement is met.\n\n## Company share plans\n\nThe purpose is to provide an easy way for individuals to hold shares in NatWest Group plc, which helps to encourage long-term thinking and provides a direct involvement in NatWest Group's performance.\n\n## Operation\n\nColleagues in certain jurisdictions are offered the opportunity to contribute from salary and acquire shares in NatWest Group plc through company share plans. This includes Sharesave and the Buy As You Earn plan in the UK. Any shares held are not subject to performance conditions.\n\n## Criteria for identifying MRTs\n\nThe EBA has issued criteria for identifying MRT roles, which captures those staff whose activities have a material influence over NatWest Group's performance or risk profile. The criteria are both qualitative (based on the nature of the role) and quantitative (for example those who exceed the stipulated total remuneration threshold).\n\nIn 2019, MRTs were identified for five key 'institutions' within NatWest Group but this has been expanded to eleven entities for 2020 to bring greater focus on MRT identification across subsidiary entities. The MRT criteria are applied for each of these institutions, and consequently some MRTs are identified in relation to more than one entity.\n\nThe qualitative criteria can be summarised as: staff within the management body; senior management; other staff with key functional or managerial responsibilities; and staff who individually, or as part of a Committee, have authority to approve new business products or to commit to credit risk exposures and market risk transactions above certain levels.",

        "page_content": "## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nThe quantitative criteria are: individuals earning \u20ac500,000 or more in the previous year; individuals in the top 0.3% of earners of the relevant legal entity for the previous year; and individuals who earned more than the lowest paid identified staff per certain qualitative criteria. In addition to the qualitative and quantitative criteria, NatWest Group has applied its own minimum standards to identify roles that are considered to have a material influence over its risk profile.\n\n## Personal hedging strategies\n\nThe conditions attached to discretionary share-based awards prohibit the use of any personal hedging strategies to lessen the impact of a reduction in value of such awards. These conditions are explicitly acknowledged and accepted by recipients when any sharebased awards are granted.\n\n## Risk in the remuneration process\n\nNatWest Group's approach to remuneration promotes effective risk management through having a clear distinction between fixed remuneration, which reflects the role undertaken by an individual, and variable remuneration, which is directly linked to performance and can be risk-adjusted. Fixed pay is set at an appropriate level to discourage excessive risk-taking, and at a level which would allow NatWest Group to pay zero variable pay.\n\nFocus on risk is achieved through clear risk input into performance goals, performance reviews, the determination of variable pay pools, incentive plan design and the application of malus and clawback. The Committee is supported by the BRC and the Risk function.\n\nA robust process is used to assess risk performance. A range of measures are considered, specifically capital, liquidity and funding risk, credit risk, market risk, pension risk, compliance & conduct risk, financial crime, operational risk, business risk and reputational risk. Consideration is also given to overall risk culture.\n\nRemuneration arrangements are in line with regulatory requirements and the steps taken to ensure appropriate and thorough risk adjustment are also fully disclosed and discussed with the PRA and the FCA.\n\n## Variable pay determination\n\nFor the 2020 performance year, NatWest Group operated a robust multi-step process, which is control function led, to assess performance and determine the appropriate bonus pool by business area and function. At multiple points throughout the process, reference is made to Group-wide business performance (from both affordability and appropriateness perspectives) and the need to distinguish between go-forward and resolution activities.\n\nThe process considers a balanced scorecard of performance assessments at the level of each business area or function, across financial, customer and people measures. Risk and conduct assessments at the same level are then undertaken to ensure that performance achieved without appropriate consideration of risk, risk culture and conduct controls, is not inappropriately rewarded.\n\nBRC reviews any material risk and conduct events and, if appropriate, an underpin may be applied to the individual business and function bonus pools or to the overall bonus pool. BRC may recommend a reduction of a bonus pool if it considers that risk and conduct performance is unacceptable or that the impact of poor risk management has yet to be fully reflected in the respective inputs.\n\nFollowing further review against overall performance and conduct, and taking into account input from the CFO on affordability, the CEO will make a final recommendation to the Committee, informed by all the previous steps in the process and her strategic view of the business. The Committee will then make an independent decision on the final bonus pool taking all of these earlier steps into account.\n\nThe assessment process for LTI awards to executive directors and other recipients is also founded on a balanced scorecard approach. The scorecard is aligned with the multi-step bonus pool process, reflecting a consistent risk management performance assessment.\n\n## Remuneration and culture\n\nNatWest Group continues to assess conduct and its impact on remuneration as part of the annual Group-wide bonus pool process and also via the accountability review framework. NatWest Group has taken steps in recent years to remove incentives for colleagues where this could drive unintended behaviours. The Committee will continue to review workforce remuneration and the alignment of incentives and reward with culture.\n\nThe governance of culture is clearly laid out with Senior Management Function roles having clearly defined accountabilities, which is taken into account in their pay decisions. The Board and SBC also play key roles in building cultural priorities. Frameworks are in place to measure progress.\n\n## Accountability review process and malus/clawback\n\nThe accountability review process was introduced in 2012 to identify any material risk management, control and general policy breach failures, and to ensure accountability for those events.\n\nThis allows NatWest Group to respond to instances where new information would change the variable pay decisions made in previous years and/or the decisions to be made in the current year. Potential outcomes under the accountability review process are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Malus - to reduce (to zero if appropriate) the amount of any unvested variable pay awards prior to payment;\n- \uf0b7 Clawback - to recover awards that have already vested; and\n- \uf0b7 In-year bonus reductions - to adjust variable pay that would have otherwise been awarded for the current year.\n\nAs part of the acceptance of variable pay awards, MRTs must agree to terms that state that malus and clawback may be applied. Any variable pay awarded to MRTs in respect of the 2014 performance year onwards is subject to clawback for seven years from the date of grant.\n\nFor awards made in respect of the 2016 performance year onwards, this period can be extended to ten years for MRTs who perform a 'senior management function' under the Senior Managers Regime where there are outstanding internal or regulatory investigations at the end of the normal sevenyear clawback period.\n\nThe circumstances in which malus, clawback or in-year bonus reduction may be applied can be found on page 130.\n\nDuring 2020 a number of issues and events were considered under the accountability review framework. The outcomes covered a range of actions including reduction (to zero where appropriate) of unvested awards through malus, and suspension of awards pending further investigation.\n\nCorporate Governance",

        "page_content": "## Other remuneration disclosures\n\n## Remuneration of MRTs\n\nThe quantitative disclosures below are made in accordance with regulatory requirements in relation to 1,605 individuals who have been identified as MRTs for NatWest Group plc (NatWest Group). The number of MRTs identified has increased since last year due to the increase in the number of legal entities for which MRTs are identified.\n\nIdentifying MRTs for additional entities results in the application of a lower threshold for certain MRT criteria (including the one relating to credit risk exposures), because the threshold to be used (as required by regulations) is set at 0.5% of the CET1 capital of each entity. In the course of carrying out MRT analysis in H1 2020 it was identified that the Business Approval Authority Framework used in some areas of the business referred to NatWest Holdings Limited but was otherwise silent on legal entity. A prudent approach was taken, applying the lowest applicable legal entity threshold to a broad population, even if the individual had not and would not be expected to expose that particular entity to credit risk. This issue and approach taken was discussed with the PRA.\n\nThe Business Approval Authority Framework was reviewed in Q3 2020 to make this more legal-entity specific, and as a consequence, MRT status has been withdrawn for c.600 colleagues from September 2020. However, these colleagues remain subject to the MRT remuneration rules (including 'de minimis' rules where applicable) and associated governance for the 2020 performance year. They will not be MRTs for 2021 and the expectation is that population will revert to a more normalised level.\n\nDetails of remuneration paid to MRTs identified for subsidiary institutions is included in Pillar 3 reporting, which can be found on natwestgroup.com.\n\n## 1.

Guaranteed Awards (including 'Sign-on' awards) and Severance Payments\n\nNatWest Group does not offer 'Sign-on awards'. Guaranteed awards may only be granted to new hires in exceptional circumstances in compensation for awards forgone in their previous company and are limited to the first year of service. No new hire guarantees were made to MRTs in respect of the 2020 performance year.\n\nSeverance payments and/or arrangements can be made to colleagues who leave NatWest Group in certain situations, including redundancy. Such payments are calculated by a pre-determined formula set out within the relevant social plans, policies, agreements or local laws. Where local laws permit, there is a cap on the maximum amount that can be awarded.\n\nNo severance payments in excess of contractual payments, local policies, standards or statutory amounts were made to MRTs during the year, other than payments to four individuals of \u00a350,000; \u00a350,000; \u20ac55,836; and \u00a3460,000. The two non-standard payments of \u00a350,000 related to enhanced outplacement support, one of which was to a senior management MRT. The two other payments were made to MRTs in commercial settlement of potential legal proceedings related to the termination of their respective employment.\n\nSeverance payments do not reward failure or misconduct in line with regulatory requirements. Where required, remuneration is constrained within the limit of variable to fixed remuneration in accordance with EBA guidelines.\n\n## 6. Ratio between fixed and variable remuneration\n\nThe variable component of total remuneration for MRTs at NatWest Group shall not exceed 100% of the fixed component (except where local jurisdictions apply a lower maximum ratio for variable pay). The average ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for 2020 is approximately 1 to 0.30. The majority of MRTs were based in the UK.\n\n-\n\n| Ratio of fixed to  variable   | Senior  mgmt             | Other MRTs               | Total                    |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Number of beneficiaries       | 16                       | 1,307                    | 1,323                    |\n|                               | ratio                    | ratio                    | ratio                    |\n| NatWest Group plc EDs         | 1:0.43                   | -                        | 1:0.43                   |\n| NatWest Group plc NEDs        | -                        | -                        |                          |\n| Corporate Functions           | 1:0.53   1:0.27   1:0.30 |                          |                          |\n| Control Functions             |                          | 1:0.43   1:0.18   1:0.19 |                          |\n| NatWest Holdings              |                          |                          | 1:0.42   1:0.20   1:0.21 |\n| NatWest Markets               |                          | 1:0.49   1:0.59   1:0.59 |                          |\n| RBS International             |                          | 1:0.43   1:0.22   1:0.24 |                          |\n| Consolidated                  |                          | 1:0.47   1:0.29   1:0.30 |                          |\n\n## 7. Discount Rate\n\nUnder CRD IV regulations, a notional discount is available which allows variable pay to be awarded at a level that would otherwise exceed the 1:1 ratio, provided that at least 25% of variable pay is delivered 'in instruments' (shares) and deferred over five years or more. The discount rate was not used for remuneration awarded in respect of the 2020 performance year.\n\n## Total remuneration by band for all colleagues earning >\u20ac1 million\n\nNumber of employees\n\n| \u20ac million      |   2020 |\n|----------------|--------|\n| \u20ac1.0 - \u20ac1.5    |     42 |\n| \u20ac1.5 - \u20ac2.0    |     13 |\n| \u20ac2.0 - \u20ac2.5    |      5 |\n| \u20ac2.5 - \u20ac3.0    |      3 |\n| \u20ac3.0 - \u20ac3.5    |      1 |\n| \u20ac3.5 - \u20ac4.0    |      0 |\n| More than \u20ac4.0 |      0 |\n| Total          |     64 |\n\nNotes:\n\nColleagues who earned total remuneration of over \u20ac1 million in 2020 represent just 0.1% of the workforce.

        "page_content": "## Compliance report\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nNatWest Group plc is committed to high standards of corporate governance, business integrity and professionalism in all its activities.\n\nThroughout the year ended 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc has applied the Principles and complied with all of the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council dated July 2018 (the 'Code') except in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 Provision 17, in respect of the requirement that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n- \uf0b7 Provision 33 that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee (Group RemCo) should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nIn respect of Provision 17, the Board considers this is a matter of significant importance which should rightly be reserved for the full Board. Adopting this approach ensures that all directors have an opportunity to contribute to succession planning discussions for Board and senior management, in support of achieving an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity at senior levels within NatWest Group and on the Board. It also means that all directors have an opportunity to review, consider and become familiar with the next generation of executive leaders.\n\nIn respect of Provision 33, the Board also considers that this is a matter which should rightly be reserved for the Board and this is an approach the Board has adopted for a number of years. Remuneration for the executive directors is first considered by the Group RemCo which then makes recommendations to the Board for consideration. This approach allows all non-executive directors, and not just those who are members of the Group RemCo, to participate in decisions on the executive directors' and the Chairman's remuneration and also allows the executive directors to input to the decision on the Chairman's remuneration. The Board believes this approach is very much in line with the spirit of the Code and no director is involved in decisions regarding his or her own remuneration. A copy of the Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.\n\nThe Board does not anticipate any changes to its approach on these aspects of the Code.\n\nFurther information on how NatWest Group plc has applied the Principles, and complied with the Provisions, of the Code can be found in the Governance section of this Report, which includes cross-references to relevant sections of the Strategic Report and other related disclosures.\n\nNatWest Group plc has also implemented the recommendations arising from the Walker Review and complied in all material respects with the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Audit Committees issued in September 2012 and April 2016.\n\nUnder the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, specific standards of corporate governance and business and financial disclosures and controls apply to companies with securities registered in the US. NatWest Group plc complies with all applicable sections of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, subject to a number of exceptions available to foreign private issuers.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the system of internal controls that is designed to maintain effective and efficient operations, compliant with applicable laws and regulations. The system of internal controls is designed to manage, or mitigate, risk to an acceptable residual level rather than eliminate it entirely. Systems of internal control can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement, fraud or loss.\n\nOngoing processes for the identification, evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by NatWest Group operated throughout the period from 1 January 2020 to 1 9 February 2021, the date the directors approved the Annual Report and Accounts. These included the semi-annual Control Environment Certification process, which requires senior members of the executive and management to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control frameworks and certify that their business or function is compliant with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 and the UK Corporate Governance Code Section C2. Policies are in place to govern these processes. Reports on internal controls arising from them are reviewed by the Board and meet the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance On Risk Management Internal Control & Related Financial & Business Reporting.\n\nNatWest Group operates a three lines of defence model, which provides a framework for responsibilities and accountabilities across the organisation. As part of its second line of defence role, the Risk function oversees and challenges the firm-wide management of risk and the efficacy of the related controls. In addition, the Risk function is responsible for developing material risk policies and strategic frameworks for the business to use.\n\nThe effectiveness of NatWest Group's internal controls is reviewed regularly by the Board, the Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Internal Audit function undertakes independent assurance activities and provides reports to the Board and executive management on the quality and effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls to monitor, manage and mitigate risks in achieving the bank's objectives. In addition, the Board receives a risk management report at each scheduled Board meeting. Executive management committees in each of NatWest Group's businesses also receive regular reports on significant risks facing their business and how these are being controlled. Details of the bank's approach to risk management are given in the Risk & Capital Management section of the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nWhile several planned activities designed to enhance the control environment were disrupted by the extensive impact of COVID19 (thereby delaying the achievement of the NatWest Group's control environment target), the control environment remained largely stable in 2020. There was continuing management focus on the delivery of regulatory programmes - including the internal transformation programme established in response to updated IRB regulation from the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) - as well as a review of the controls and processes relating to certain regulatory reporting. There was also significant focus on work to enhance controls relating to financial crime risks - including ongoing work to strengthen customer due diligence standards. The focus of the of NatWest Group in establishing and maintaining a robust risk culture made a valuable contribution to the overall control environment.\n\nThe remediation of known control issues remained a focus of the Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee during 2020. For further information on their oversight of remediation of the most significant issues, please refer to the Report of the Group Audit Committee and the Report of the Board Risk Committee. The Group Audit Committee has received confirmation that management has taken, or is taking, action to remedy significant failings or weaknesses identified through NatWest Group's control framework. The Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee will continue to focus on such remediation activity, particularly in view of the transformation agenda.\n\nWhile not being part of the Group's system of internal control, the Group's independent auditors present to the Group Audit Committee reports that include details of any significant internal control deficiencies they have identified. Further, the system of internal controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Additional details of regulatory oversight are given in the Risk & Capital Management section.",

        "page_content": "## Compliance report\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nNatWest Group plc is required to comply with Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020.\n\nNatWest Group has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 publication of 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework'.\n\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of 31 December 2020, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nNatWest Group's auditors have audited the effectiveness of NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting and have given an unqualified opinion.\n\nManagement's report on NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the 2020 Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nAs required by Exchange Act rules, management (including the Group CEO and Group CFO) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and design of NatWest Group's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act rules) as at 31 December 2020. Based on this evaluation, management (including the Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) concluded that NatWest Group plc's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\n\n## Changes in internal control\n\nThere was no change in NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## The New York Stock Exchange\n\nAs a foreign private issuer with American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, preference shares and debt securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), NatWest Group plc is not required to comply with all of the NYSE governance standards applicable to US domestic companies (the NYSE Standards) provided that it follows home country practice in lieu of the NYSE Standards and discloses any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from the NYSE Standards.\n\nNatWest Group plc is also required to provide an Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE of its compliance with the mandatory applicable NYSE Standards. In March 2020 NatWest Group plc submitted its most recent Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE, and in August 2020 an interim written affirmation was submitted following a change in membership of the Group Audit Committee. Both affirmations confirmed NatWest Group plc's full compliance with the applicable provisions.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee fully complies with the mandatory provisions of the NYSE Standards (including by reference to the rules of the Exchange Act) that relate to the composition, responsibilities and operation of audit committees. More detailed information about the Group Audit Committee and its work during 2020 is set out in the Group Audit Committee report on pages 107 to 111.\n\nThe Board has reviewed its corporate governance arrangements and is satisfied that these are consistent with the NYSE Standards, subject to the following departures:\n\n(i) NYSE Standards require the majority of the Board to be independent. The NYSE Standards contain different tests from the Code for determining whether a director is independent. NatWest Group plc follows the Code's requirements in determining the independence of its directors and currently has 8 independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the senior independent director.\n\n(ii) The NYSE Standards require nonmanagement directors to hold regular sessions without management present, and that independent directors meet at least once a year. The Code requires the Chairman to hold meetings with non-executive directors without the executives present and nonexecutive directors are to meet without the Chairman present at least once a year to appraise the Chairman's performance and NatWest Group plc complies with the requirements of the Code.\n\n(iii) The NYSE Standards require that the nominating/corporate governance committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. The Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, which is permitted under the Code (since the Chairman was considered independent on appointment). The terms of reference of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee differ in certain limited respects from the requirements set out in the NYSE Standards, including because the Group Nominations and Governance Committee does not have responsibility for overseeing the evaluation of management.\n\n(iv) The NYSE standards require that the compensation committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. Although the members of the Group RemCo are deemed independent in compliance with the provisions of the Code, the Board has not assessed the independence of the members of the Group RemCo and Group RemCo has not assessed the independence of any compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser, in each case, in accordance with the independence tests prescribed by the NYSE Standards. The NYSE Standards require that the compensation committee must have direct responsibility to review and approve the CEO's remuneration. As stated at the start of this Compliance report, in the case of NatWest Group plc, the Board rather than the Group RemCo reserves the authority to make the final determination of the remuneration of the CEO.\n\n(v) The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc has complied with all of the provisions of the Code (subject to the exception described above) and the Code does not require NatWest Group plc to disclose the full range of corporate governance guidelines with which it complies.\n\n(vi) The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. NatWest Group has adopted a code of conduct which is supplemented by a number of key policies and guidance dealing with matters including, among others, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, sanctions, confidentiality, inside information, health, safety and environment, conflicts of interest, market conduct and management records. This code of conduct applies to all officers and employees and is fully aligned to the PRA and FCA Conduct Rules which apply to all directors. The Code of Conduct is available to view on NatWest Group's website at natwestgroup.com.\n\nThis Compliance report forms part of the Corporate governance report and the Report of the directors.\n\nCorporate Governance",

Following these changes the company owns three main subsidiaries, NatWest Holdings Limited (the parent of the ring-fenced group which includes National Westminster Bank Plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC), NatWest Markets Plc (the investment bank and the parent of NatWest Markets N.V.) and The Royal Bank of Scotland International (Holdings) Limited (the parent of The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited).\n\nFurther details of the principal subsidiary undertakings are shown in Note 9 and a full list of subsidiary undertakings and overseas branches is shown in Note 12 of the parent company accounts.\n\nFollowing placing and open offers in December 2008 and in April 2009, HM Treasury (HMT) owned approximately 70.3% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the company. In December 2009, the company issued a further \u00a325.5 billion of new capital to HMT in the form of B shares. HMT sold 630 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in August 2015. In October 2015 HMT converted its entire holding of 51 billion B shares into 5.1 billion new ordinary shares of \u00a31 each in the company. HMT sold a further 925 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in June 2018.\n\n## Activities\n\nNatWest Group is engaged principally in providing a wide range of banking and other financial services. Further details of the organisational structure and business overview of NatWest Group, including the products and services provided by each of its operating segments and the markets in which they operate are contained in the Business review. Details of the strategy for delivering the company's objectives can be found in the Strategic report.\n\n## Results and dividends\n\nUK company law provides that dividends can only be paid if a company has sufficient distributable profits available to cover the dividend. A company's distributable profits are its accumulated, realised profits not previously distributed or capitalised, less its accumulated, realised losses not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital.\n\nThe loss attributable to the ordinary shareholders of NatWest Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to \u00a3753 million compared with a profit of \u00a33,133 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, as set out in the consolidated income statement on page 258.\n\nIn 2019 NatWest Group paid an interim dividend of \u00a3241 million, or 2.0p per ordinary share (2018 - \u00a3241 million, or 2.0p per ordinary share) and a special dividend of \u00a31,449 million, or 12.0p per ordinary share (2018 - nil). In addition, the company had announced that the directors had recommended a final dividend of \u00a3364 million, or 3.0p per ordinary share (2018 - \u00a3422 million, or 3.5p per ordinary share), and a further special dividend of \u00a3606 million, or 5.0p per ordinary share (2018 \u00a3904 million, or 7.5p per ordinary share), both of which were subject to shareholders' approval at the AGM on 29 April 2020.\n\nIn response to a formal request from the Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Board cancelled the final ordinary and special dividend payments in relation to the 2019 financial year and did not submit them for approval at the AGM held on 29 April 2020.\n\nThe company has announced that the directors have recommended a final dividend of \u00a3364 million, or 3p per ordinary share (2019 - nil). The final dividend recommended by directors is subject to shareholders' approval at the AGM on 28 April 2021.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, HMT's holding in the company's ordinary shares was 61.9%.\n\nIf approved, payment will be made on 4 May 2021 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 March 2021. The exdividend date will be 25 March 2021. Subject to above mentioned condition, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary shares is at the discretion of the Board.\n\n## Going concern\n\nNatWest Group's business activities and financial position, the factors likely to affect its future development and performance and its objectives and policies in managing the financial risks to which it is exposed and its capital are discussed in the Business review. The risk factors which could materially affect NatWest Group's future results are set out on pages 345 to 362. NatWest Group's regulatory capital resources and significant developments in 2020 and anticipated future developments are detailed in the Capital, liquidity and funding section on pages 213 to 228. This section also describes NatWest Group's funding and liquidity profile, including changes in key metrics and the build up of liquidity reserves.\n\nHaving reviewed NatWest Group's forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for a period of not less than twelve months. Accordingly, the financial statements of NatWest Group and of the company have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## UK Finance disclosure code\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2020 financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the principles set out in the Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure published by the British Bankers' Association in 2010. The Code sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance. The principles are that NatWest Group and other major UK banks will provide high quality, meaningful and decision-useful disclosures; review and enhance their financial instrument disclosures for key areas of interest to market participants; assess the applicability and relevance of good practice recommendations to their disclosures, acknowledging the importance of such guidance; seek to enhance the comparability of financial statement disclosures across the UK banking sector; and clearly differentiate in their annual reports between information that is audited and information that is unaudited.\n\n## Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) and Disclosures on Expected Credit Losses (DECL) Taskforce recommendations\n\nThe EDTF, established by the Financial Stability Board, published its report 'Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks' in October 2012, with an update in November 2015 covering IFRS 9 expected credit losses (ECL). The DECL Taskforce, jointly established by the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Reporting Council and the Prudential Regulatory Authority, published its phase 2 report recommendations in December 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2020 Annual Report and Accounts and Pillar 3 Report reflect EDTF and have regard to DECL Taskforce recommendations.\n\n## Authority to repurchase shares\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2020 shareholders authorised the company to make market purchases of up to 1,209,390,919 ordinary shares. The directors have not exercised this authority to date. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.\n\nOn 6 February 2019 the company held a General Meeting and shareholders approved a special resolution to give the company authority to make off-market purchases of up to 4.99 per cent of its ordinary share capital in issuance from HM Treasury (or its nominee) at such times as the Directors may determine is appropriate. Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting available on natwestgroup.com. This authority was renewed at the 2020 Annual General Meeting and Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.\n\n## Additional information\n\nWhere not provided elsewhere in the Report of the directors, the following additional information is required to be disclosed by Part 6 of Schedule 7 to the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.\n\nThe rights and obligations attached to the company's ordinary shares and preference shares are set out in our Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or can be found at natwestgroup.com. Non-cumulative preference share details are set out in Note 21 of the consolidated accounts.\n\nThe cumulative preference shares represent less than 0.008% of the total voting rights of the company, the remainder being represented by the ordinary shares.\n\nOn a show of hands at a General Meeting of the company, every holder of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have one vote.\n\nOn a poll, every holder of ordinary shares or cumulative preference shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have four votes for every share held. The notices of Annual General Meetings and General Meetings specify the deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the meeting.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the company other than certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws). At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, shareholders gave authority to directors to offer a scrip dividend alternative on any dividend paid up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2021. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2021. Pursuant to the UK Listing Rules, certain employees of the company require the approval of the company to deal in the company's shares.\n\nThe rules governing the powers of directors, including in relation to issuing or buying back shares and their appointment, are set out in our Articles of Association. It will be proposed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting that the directors' authorities to allot shares under the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act) be renewed. The Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. The company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. There are no persons holding securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the company. A number of the company's employee share plans include restrictions on transfers of shares while shares are subject to the plans. Note 3 sets out a summary of the plans.\n\nUnder the rules of certain employee share plans, voting rights are exercised by the Trustees of the plan on receipt of participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the Trustee no vote is registered.\n\nFor shares held in the company's other Employee Share Trusts, the voting rights are exercisable by the Trustees. However, in accordance with investor protection guidelines, the Trustees abstain from voting. The Trustees would take independent advice before accepting any offer in respect of their shareholdings for the company in a takeover bid situation. The Trustees have chosen to waive their entitlement to the dividend on shares held by the Trusts.\n\nA change of control of the company following a takeover bid may cause a number of agreements to which the company is party to take effect, alter or terminate. All of the company's employee share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. In the context of the company as a whole, these agreements are not considered to be significant.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe names and brief biographical details of the current directors are shown on pages 97 and 98.\n\nHoward Davies, Frank Dangeard,, Patrick Flynn, Morten Friis, Robert Gillespie, Katie Murray, Mike Rogers, Alison Rose, Mark Seligman and Lena Wilson all served throughout the year and to the date of signing of the financial statements.\n\nYasmin Jetha was appointed on 1 April 2020\n\nAlison Davis resigned from the Board on 31 March 2020. Baroness Noakes resigned from the Board on 31 July 2020.\n\nAll directors of the company are required to stand for election or re-election annually by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and, in accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors requires approval by all shareholders and also by independent shareholders.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe interests of the directors in the shares of the company at 31 December 2020 are shown on page 144. None of the directors held an interest in the loan capital of the company or in the shares or loan capital of any of the subsidiary undertakings of the company, during the period from 1 January 2020 to 18 February 2021.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nIn terms of section 236 of the Companies Act, Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions have been issued by the company to its directors, members of the NatWest Group and NWH Executive Committees, individuals authorised by the PRA/FCA, certain directors and/or officers of NatWest Group subsidiaries and all trustees of NatWest Group pension schemes.\n\n## Controlling shareholder\n\nIn accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the company has entered into an agreement with HM Treasury (the 'Controlling Shareholder') which is intended to ensure that the Controlling Shareholder complies with the independence provisions set out in the UK Listing Rules. The company has complied with the independence provisions in the relationship agreement and as far as the company is aware the independence and procurement provisions in the relationship agreement have been complied with in the period by the controlling shareholder.\n\nCorporate Governance",

This authorisation was taken as a precaution only, as the company has a longstanding policy of not making political donations or incurring political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words.\n\nDuring 2020, NatWest Group made no political donations, nor incurred any political expenditure in the UK or EU and it is not proposed that NatWest Group's longstanding policy of not making contributions to any political party be changed. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.\n\n## Directors' disclosure to auditors\n\nEach of the directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that:\n\n(a) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and (b) the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act.\n\n## Auditors\n\nErnst & Young LLP (EY LLP) are the auditors and have indicated their willingness to continue in office. A resolution to re-appoint EY LLP as the company's auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\nJan Cargill Company Secretary 1 9 February 2021\n\nNatWest Group plc is registered in Scotland No. SC45551",

NatWest Group remained committed to supporting its customers while operating safely and soundly in line with its strategic objectives. Most notably, the credit risk profile was heightened due to deteriorating economic conditions. NatWest Group provided a significant level of payment holidays during the crisis, and facilitated a high volume of loans through the UK government CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS initiatives. This is detailed in the Credit risk section.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group's operational risk profile became heightened due to the need to adapt working methods and practices to large-scale working from home and the requirement to respond to the crisis - and provide customer support - at pace.\n\nAs a result of its strong balance sheet and prudent approach to risk management, NatWest Group remains well placed to withstand the impacts of the pandemic as well as providing support to customers when they need it most.\n\n## Risk management framework Introduction\n\nNatWest Group operates an enterprise wide risk management framework, which is centred around the embedding of a strong risk culture. The framework ensures the governance, capabilities and methods are in place to facilitate risk management and decisionmaking across the organisation.\n\nThe framework ensures that NatWest Group's principal risks - which are detailed in this section - are appropriately controlled and managed. In addition, there is a process to identify and manage top risks, which are those which could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. A complementary process operates to identify emerging risks. Both top and emerging risks are reported to the Board on a regular basis alongside reporting on the principal risks.\n\nRisk appetite, supported by a robust set of principles, policies and practices, defines the levels of tolerance for a variety of risks and provides a structured approach to risk-taking within agreed boundaries.\n\nAll NatWest Group colleagues share ownership of the way risk is managed, working together to make sure business activities and policies are consistent with risk appetite.\n\nThe methodology for setting, governing and embedding risk appetite is being further enhanced with the aim of revising current risk appetite processes and increasing alignment with strategic planning and external threat assessments.\n\n## Culture\n\nCulture is at the centre of both the risk management framework and risk management practice. NatWest Group's risk culture target is to make risk part of the way employees work and think.\n\nA focus on leaders as role models and action to build clarity, develop capability and motivate employees to reach the required standards of behaviour are key to achieving the risk culture target. Colleagues are expected to:\n\n- \uf0b7 Take personal responsibility for understanding and proactively managing the risks associated with individual roles.\n- \uf0b7 Respect risk management and the part it plays in daily work.\n- \uf0b7 Understand the risks associated with individual roles.\n- \uf0b7 Align decision-making to NatWest Group's risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Consider risk in all actions and decisions.\n- \uf0b7 Escalate risks and issues early; taking action to mitigate risks and learning from mistakes and near-misses.\n- \uf0b7 Challenge others' attitudes, ideas and actions.\n- \uf0b7 Report and communicate risks transparently.\n\nThe target risk culture behaviours are embedded in Our Standards and are clearly aligned to the core values of 'serving customers', 'working together', 'doing the right thing' and 'thinking long term'. These act as an effective basis for a strong risk culture because Our Standards are used for performance management, recruitment and development.\n\n## Training\n\nA wide range of learning, both technical and behavioural, is offered across the risk disciplines. This training can be mandatory, rolespecific or for personal development and enables colleagues to develop the capabilities and confidence to manage risk effectively.\n\n## Our Code\n\nNatWest Group's conduct guidance, Our Code, provides direction on expected behaviour and sets out the standards of conduct that support the values. The code explains the effect of decisions that are taken and describes the principles that must be followed.\n\nThese principles cover conduct-related issues as well as wider business activities. They focus on desired outcomes, with practical guidelines to align the values with commercial strategy and actions. The embedding of these principles facilitates sound decision-making and a clear focus on good customer outcomes.\n\nIf conduct falls short of NatWest Group's required standards, the accountability review process is used to assess how this should be reflected in pay outcomes for those individuals concerned. The NatWest Group remuneration policy ensures that the remuneration arrangements for all employees reflect the principles and standards prescribed by the PRA rulebook and the FCA handbook. Any employee falling short of the expected standards would also be subject to internal disciplinary policies and procedures. If appropriate, the relevant authority would be notified.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Risk management framework continued Three lines of defence\n\nNatWest Group uses the industry-standard three lines of defence model to articulate accountabilities and responsibilities for managing risk. It supports the embedding of effective risk management throughout the organisation. All roles below the CEO sit within one of these three lines. The CEO ensures the efficient use of resources and the effective management of risks as stipulated in the risk management framework and is therefore considered to be outside the three lines of defence principles.\n\n## First line of defence\n\nThe first line of defence incorporates most roles in NatWest Group, including those in the customer-facing franchises, Technology and Services as well as support functions such as Human Resources, Legal and Finance.\n\n- \uf0b7 The first line of defence is empowered to take risks within the constraints of the risk management framework and policies as well as the risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n- \uf0b7 The first line of defence is responsible for managing its direct risks. With the support of specialist functions such as Legal, HR and Technology, it is also responsible for managing its consequential risks by identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting risks.\n\n## Second line of defence\n\nThe second line of defence comprises the Risk function and is independent of the first line.\n\n- \uf0b7 The second line of defence is empowered to design and maintain the risk management framework and its components. It undertakes proactive risk oversight and continuous monitoring activities to confirm that NatWest Group engages in permissible and sustainable risk-taking activities.\n- \uf0b7 The second line of defence advises on, monitors, challenges, approves, escalates and reports on the risk-taking activities of the first line, ensuring that these are within the constraints of the risk management framework and policies as well as the risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n\n## Third line of defence\n\nThe third line of defence is the Internal Audit function and is independent of the first and second lines.\n\n- \uf0b7 The third line of defence is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance to the Board, its subsidiary legal entity boards and executive management on the adequacy and effectiveness of key internal controls, governance and the risk management in place to monitor, manage and mitigate the key risks to NatWest Group and its subsidiary companies achieving their objectives.\n- \uf0b7 The third line of defence executes its duties freely and objectively in accordance with the Institute of Internal Auditors' Code of Ethics & Standards.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite defines the level and types of risk NatWest Group is willing to accept, within risk capacity, in order to achieve strategic objectives and business plans. It links the goals and priorities to risk management in a way that guides and empowers staff to serve customers well and achieve financial targets.\n\nStrategic risks are those that threaten the safety and soundness of NatWest Group or its ability to achieve strategic objectives. For certain strategic risks, risk capacity defines the maximum level of risk NatWest Group can assume before breaching constraints determined by regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, the operational environment, and from a conduct perspective. Establishing risk capacity helps determine where risk appetite should be set, ensuring there is a buffer between internal risk appetite and NatWest Group's ultimate capacity to absorb losses.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nThe risk appetite framework bolsters effective risk management by promoting sound risk-taking through a structured approach, within agreed boundaries. It also ensures emerging risks and risk-taking activities that might be out of appetite are identified, assessed, escalated and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nTo facilitate this, a detailed annual review of the framework is carried out. The review includes:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the adequacy of the framework when compared to internal and external expectations.\n- \uf0b7 Ensuring the framework remains effective and acts as a strong control environment for risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the level of embedding of risk appetite across the organisation.\n\nThe Board approves the risk appetite framework annually.\n\n## Establishing risk appetite\n\nIn line with NatWest Group's risk appetite framework, risk appetite is maintained across NatWest Group through risk appetite statements. The risk appetite statements provide clarity on the scale and type of activities that can be undertaken in a manner that is easily conveyed to staff.\n\nRisk appetite statements consist of qualitative statements of appetite supported by risk limits and triggers that operate as a defence against excessive risk-taking. They are established at NatWest Group-wide level for all strategic risks and material risks, and at legal entity, business, and function level for all other risks.\n\nThe annual process of establishing risk appetite statements is completed alongside the business and financial planning process. This ensures plans and risk appetite are appropriately aligned.\n\nThe Board sets risk appetite for the most material risks to help ensure NatWest Group is well placed to meet its priorities and long-term targets even in challenging economic environments. It is the basis on which NatWest Group remains safe and sound while implementing its strategic business objectives.\n\nNatWest Group's risk profile is frequently reviewed and monitored and management focus is concentrated on all strategic risks, material risks and emerging risk issues. Risk profile relative to risk appetite is reported regularly to the Board and senior management.\n\nRisk controls and their associated limits are an integral part of the risk appetite approach and a key part of embedding risk appetite in day-today risk management decisions. A clear tolerance for material risk types is set in alignment with business activities.\n\nNatWest Group policies directly support the qualitative aspects of risk appetite. They ensure that appropriate controls are set and monitored.\n\n## Identification and measurement\n\nIdentification and measurement within the risk management process comprise:\n\n- \uf0b7 Regular assessment of the overall risk profile, incorporating market developments and trends, as well as external and internal factors.\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring of the risks associated with lending and credit exposures.\n- \uf0b7 Assessment of trading and non-trading portfolios.\n- \uf0b7 Review of potential risks in new business activities and processes.\n- \uf0b7 Analysis of potential risks in any complex and unusual business transactions.\n\nThe financial and non-financial risks that NatWest Group faces are detailed in the Risk Directory. This provides a common risk language to ensure consistent terminology is used across NatWest Group. The Risk Directory is subject to annual review. This ensures that it continues to provide a comprehensive and meaningful list of the inherent risks within NatWest Group.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Risk management framework continued Mitigation\n\nMitigation is an important aspect of ensuring that risk profile remains within risk appetite. Risk mitigation strategies are discussed and agreed within NatWest Group.\n\nWhen evaluating possible strategies, costs and benefits, residual risks (risks that are retained) and secondary risks (those that are due to risk mitigation actions) are considered. Monitoring and review processes are in place to evaluate results. Early identification, and effective management of changes in legislation and regulation are critical to the successful mitigation of compliance and conduct risk. The effects of all changes are managed to ensure the timely achievement of compliance. Those changes assessed as having a high or mediumhigh impact are managed more closely. Significant and emerging risks that could affect future results and performance are reviewed and monitored. Action is taken to mitigate potential risks as and when required. Further in-depth analysis, including the stress testing of exposures relative to the risk, is also carried out.\n\n## Testing and monitoring\n\nTargeted credit risk, compliance & conduct risk and financial crime risk activities are subject to testing and monitoring to confirm to both internal and external stakeholders - including the Board, senior management, the customer-facing businesses, Internal Audit and NatWest Group's regulators - that policies and procedures are being correctly implemented and operating adequately and effectively. Selected key controls are also reviewed. Thematic reviews and deep dives are also carried out where appropriate.\n\nThe adequacy and effectiveness of selected key controls owned and operated by the second line of defence are also tested (with a particular focus on credit risk controls). Selected controls within the scope of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, as well as selected controls supporting risk data aggregation and reporting, are also reviewed.\n\nAnti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-bribery and corruption and tax evasion processes and controls are also tested and monitored. This helps provide an independent understanding of the financial crime control environment, whether or not controls are adequate and effective and whether financial crime risk is appropriately identified, managed and mitigated.\n\nThe Risk Testing & Monitoring Forum and methodology ensures a consistent approach to all aspects of the second-line review activities. The forum also monitors and validates the annual plan and ongoing programme of reviews.\n\n## Stress testing\n\n## Stress testing - capital management\n\nStress testing is a key risk management tool and a fundamental component of NatWest Group's approach to capital management. It is used to quantify and evaluate the potential impact of specified changes to risk factors on the financial strength of NatWest Group, including its capital position.\n\n## Stress testing includes:\n\n- \uf0b7 Scenario testing, which examines the impact of a hypothetical future state to define changes in risk factors.\n- \uf0b7 Sensitivity testing, which examines the impact of an incremental change to one or more risk factors.\n\nThe process for stress testing consists of four broad stages:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify specific vulnerabilities and risks.\n\n| Define scenarios                          | \uf0b7 Define and calibrate scenarios to examine  risks and vulnerabilities. \uf0b7 Formal governance process to agree  scenarios.                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assess  impact                            | \uf0b7 Translate scenarios into risk drivers. \uf0b7 Assess impact to current and projected P&L  and balance sheet. \uf0b7 Impact assessment captures input across  NatWest Group.                                                                    |\n| Calculate results and assess implications | \uf0b7 Aggregate impacts into overall results. \uf0b7 Results form part of the risk management  process. \uf0b7 Scenario results are used to inform business  and capital plans.                                                                      |\n| Develop and agree management actions      | \uf0b7 Scenario results are analysed by subject  matter experts. Appropriate management  actions are then developed. \uf0b7 Scenario results and management actions  are reviewed and agreed by senior  committees, including the Executive Risk |\n\nStress testing is used widely across NatWest Group. The diagram below summarises key areas of focus.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Risk management framework continued\n\nSpecific areas that involve capital management include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Strategic financial and capital planning - by assessing the impact of sensitivities and scenarios on the capital plan and capital ratios.\n- \uf0b7 Risk appetite - by gaining a better understanding of the drivers of, and the underlying risks associated with, risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Risk monitoring - by monitoring the risks and horizon scanning events that could potentially affect NatWest Group's financial strength and capital position.\n- \uf0b7 Risk mitigation - by identifying actions to mitigate risks, or those that could be taken, in the event of adverse changes to the business or economic environment. Key risk mitigating actions are documented in NatWest Group's recovery plan.\n\nReverse stress testing is also carried out in order to identify circumstances that may lead to specific, defined outcomes such as business failure. Reverse stress testing allows potential vulnerabilities in the business model to be examined more fully.\n\n## Capital sufficiency - going concern forward-looking view\n\nGoing concern capital requirements are examined on a forwardlooking basis - including as part of the annual budgeting process - by assessing the resilience of capital adequacy and leverage ratios under hypothetical future states. These assessments include assumptions about regulatory and accounting factors (such as IFRS 9). They are linked to economic variables and impairments and seek to demonstrate that NatWest Group and its operating subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital. A range of future states are tested. In particular, capital requirements are assessed:\n\n- \uf0b7 Based on a forecast of future business performance, given expectations of economic and market conditions over the forecast period.\n- \uf0b7 Based on a forecast of future business performance under adverse economic and market conditions over the forecast period. Scenarios of different severity may be examined.\n\nThe examination of capital requirements under normal economic and adverse market conditions enables NatWest Group to determine whether its projected business performance meets internal and regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe examination of capital requirements under adverse economic and market conditions is assessed through stress testing. The results of stress tests are not only used widely across NatWest Group but also by the regulators to set specific capital buffers. NatWest Group takes part in stress tests run by regulatory authorities to test industry-wide vulnerabilities under crystallising global and domestic systemic risks.\n\nStress and peak-to-trough movements are used to help assess the amount of capital NatWest Group needs to hold in stress conditions in accordance with the capital risk appetite framework.\n\n## Internal assessment of capital adequacy\n\nAn internal assessment of material risks is carried out annually to enable an evaluation of the amount, type and distribution of capital required to cover these risks. This is referred to as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The ICAAP consists of a point-in-time assessment of exposures and risks at the end of the financial year together with a forward-looking stress capital assessment. The ICAAP is approved by the Board and submitted to the PRA.\n\nThe ICAAP is used to form a view of capital adequacy separately to the minimum regulatory requirements. The ICAAP is used by the PRA to assess NatWest Group's specific capital requirements through the Pillar 2 framework.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nNatWest Group has mechanisms to allocate capital across its legal entities and businesses. These aim to optimise the use of capital resources taking into account applicable regulatory requirements, strategic and business objectives and risk appetite. The framework for allocating capital is approved by the Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\n## Governance\n\nCapital management is subject to substantial review and governance. The Board approves the capital plans, including those for key legal entities and businesses as well as the results of the stress tests relating to those capital plans.\n\n## Stress testing - liquidity\n\n## Liquidity risk monitoring and contingency planning\n\nA suite of tools is used to monitor, limit and stress test the risks on the balance sheet. Limit frameworks are in place to control the level of liquidity risk, asset and liability mismatches and funding concentrations. Liquidity risks are reviewed at significant legal entity and business levels daily, with performance reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee on a regular basis. Liquidity Condition Indicators are monitored daily. This ensures any build-up of stress is detected early and the response escalated appropriately through recovery planning.\n\n## Internal assessment of liquidity\n\nUnder the liquidity risk management framework, NatWest Group maintains the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process. This includes assessment of net stressed liquidity outflows under a range of severe but plausible stress scenarios. Each scenario evaluates either an idiosyncratic, market-wide or combined stress event as described in the table below.\n\n| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Idiosyncratic  scenario | The market perceives NatWest Group to be suffering  from a severe stress event, which results in an  immediate assumption of increased credit risk or  concerns over solvency.                                                                                      |\n| Market-wide  scenario   | A market stress event affecting all participants in a  market through contagion, potential counterparty  failure and other market risks. NatWest Group is  affected under this scenario but no more severely  than any other participants with equivalent exposure. |\n| Combined  scenario      | This scenario models the combined impact of an  idiosyncratic and market stress occurring at once,  severely affecting funding markets and the liquidity of  some assets.                                                                                           |\n\nNatWest Group uses the most severe outcome  to set the internal stress testing scenario which underpins its internal liquidity risk appetite. This complements the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio requirement.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Risk management framework continued Stress testing - recovery and resolution planning\n\nThe NatWest Group recovery plan explains how NatWest Group and its subsidiaries - as a consolidated group - would identify and respond to a financial stress event and restore its financial position so that it remains viable on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe recovery plan ensures risks that could delay the implementation of a recovery strategy are highlighted and preparations are made to minimise the impact of these risks. Preparations include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Developing a series of recovery indicators to provide early warning of potential stress events.\n- \uf0b7 Clarifying roles, responsibilities and escalation routes to minimise uncertainty or delay.\n- \uf0b7 Developing a recovery playbook to provide a concise description of the actions required during recovery.\n- \uf0b7 Detailing a range of options to address different stress conditions.\n- \uf0b7 Appointing dedicated option owners to reduce the risk of delay and capacity concerns.\n\nThe plan is intended to enable NatWest Group to maintain critical services and products it provides to its customers, maintain its core business lines and operate within risk appetite while restoring NatWest Group's financial condition. It is assessed for appropriateness on an ongoing basis and is updated annually. The plan is reviewed and approved by the Board prior to submission to the PRA each year. Individual recovery plans are also prepared for NatWest Holdings Limited, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International (Holdings) Limited, Ulster Bank Ireland DAC and NatWest Markets N.V.. These plans detail the recovery options, recovery indicators and escalation routes for each entity.\n\nFire drill simulations of possible recovery events are used to test the effectiveness of NatWest Group and individual legal entity recovery plans. The fire drills are designed to replicate possible financial stress conditions and allow senior management to rehearse the responses and decisions that may be required in an actual stress. The results and lessons learnt from the fire drills are used to enhance NatWest Group's approach to recovery planning.\n\nUnder the resolution assessment part of the PRA rulebook, NatWest Group is required to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA and publish a summary of this report.\n\nResolution would be implemented if NatWest Group was assessed by the UK authorities to have failed and the appropriate regulator put it into resolution. The process of resolution is owned and implemented by the Bank of England (as the UK resolution authority). A multi-year programme is in place to further develop resolution capability in line with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Stress testing - climate\n\nNatWest Group will be carrying out climate scenario and stress-testing analysis as part of the Bank of England's 2021 biennial exploratory scenario. The exercise will explore three distinct climate scenarios over a 30 year horizon to test the financial system's resilience to climate-related risks.\n\nNatWest Group is also participating in the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative focusing on analysis of how physical and transition risks could affect the agriculture and real estate sectors.\n\n## Stress testing - market risk Non-traded market risk\n\nNon-traded exposures are reported to the PRA on a quarterly basis. This provides the regulator with an overview of NatWest Group's banking book interest rate exposure. The report includes detailed product information analysed by interest rate driver and other characteristics, including accounting classification, currency and counterparty type.\n\nScenario analysis based on hypothetical adverse scenarios is performed on non-traded exposures as part of the Bank of England and European Banking Authority stress exercises. NatWest Group also produces an internal scenario analysis as part of its financial planning cycles.\n\nNon-traded exposures are capitalised through the ICAAP. This covers gap risk, basis risk, credit spread risk, pipeline risk, structural foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk, equity risk and accounting volatility risk. The ICAAP is completed with a combination of value and earnings measures. The total non-traded market risk capital requirement is determined by adding the different charges for each sub risk type. The ICAAP methodology captures at least ten years of historical volatility, produced with a 99% confidence level. Methodologies are reviewed by NatWest Group Model Risk and the results are approved by the NatWest Group Technical Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\nNon-traded market risk stress results are combined with those for other risks into the capital plan presented to the Board. The cross-risk capital planning process is conducted once a year, with a planning horizon of five years. The scenario narratives cover both regulatory scenarios and macroeconomic scenarios identified by NatWest Group.\n\nVulnerability-based stress testing begins with the analysis of a portfolio and expresses its key vulnerabilities in terms of plausible, vulnerability scenarios under which the portfolio would suffer material losses. These scenarios can be historical, macroeconomic or forwardlooking/hypothetical. Vulnerability-based stress testing is used for internal management information and is not subject to limits. The results for relevant scenarios are reported to senior management.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nNatWest Group carries out daily market risk stress testing to identify vulnerabilities and potential losses in excess of, or not captured in, value-at-risk. The calculated stresses measure the impact of changes in risk factors on the fair values of the trading and fair value through other comprehensive income portfolios.\n\nNatWest Group conducts historical, macroeconomic and vulnerabilitybased stress testing. Historical stress testing is a measure that is used for internal management. Using the historical simulation framework employed for value-at-risk, the current portfolio is stressed using historical data since 1 January 2005. This methodology simulates the impact of the 99.9 percentile loss that would be incurred by historical risk factor movements over the period, assuming variable holding periods specific to the risk factors and the businesses.\n\nHistorical stress tests form part of the market risk limit framework and their results are reported daily to senior management. Macroeconomic stress tests are carried out periodically as part of the bank-wide, crossrisk capital planning process. The scenario narratives are translated into risk factor shocks using historical events and insights by economists, risk managers and the first line.\n\nMarket risk stress results are combined with those for other risks into the capital plan presented to the Board. The cross-risk capital planning process is conducted once a year, with a planning horizon of five years. The scenario narratives cover both regulatory scenarios and macroeconomic scenarios identified by NatWest Group.\n\nVulnerability-based stress testing begins with the analysis of a portfolio and expresses its key vulnerabilities in terms of plausible, vulnerability scenarios under which the portfolio would suffer material losses. These scenarios can be historical, macroeconomic or forwardlooking/hypothetical. Vulnerability-based stress testing is used for internal management information and is not subject to limits. The results for relevant scenarios are reported to senior management.",

These scenarios included:\n\n- \uf0b7 The impact of travel restrictions, social distancing policies, selfisolation and sickness on GDP, employment and consumer spending.\n- \uf0b7 The impacts on business investment in critical sectors.\n- \uf0b7 The effect on house prices, commercial real estate values and major project finance.\n- \uf0b7 The effect of government interventions such as the Job Retention Scheme and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.\n\nApplying  the  macro-scenarios  to  NatWest  Group's  earnings,  capital, liquidity  and  funding  positions  did  not  result  in  a  breach  of  any regulatory thresholds.\n\n## Regulatory stress testing\n\nNatWest Group has participated in the regulatory stress tests conducted annually by the Bank of England and biennially by the European Banking Authority (EBA).

NatWest Group is also exposed to settlement risk through foreign exchange, trade finance and payments activities.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 The outlook for credit risk and asset quality deteriorated during the year driven by the unprecedented economic impact and disruption from COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 The severity of the disruption impacted both Personal and Wholesale customers.\n- \uf0b7 The overall expected credit loss (ECL) charge increased materially as a result during 2020, largely during the second quarter of the year. The ECL charge was driven by Stage 2 where, due to the forward-looking nature of the IFRS 9 ECL model, there was a large migration of exposure into this category. Stage 3 ECL charges remained supressed as a result of government support schemes mitigating against defaults at this stage.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group participated in government backed support mechanisms, including granting payment holidays (also referred to as payment deferrals), originating loans and offering concessions where appropriate. As the various support schemes conclude, NatWest Group anticipates further credit deterioration in portfolios.\n- \uf0b7 Further details on the impact of COVID-19 on credit risk in NatWest Group are disclosed in the impact of COVID-19 section.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Credit Risk function provides oversight of frontline credit risk management activities.\n\nGovernance activities include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Defining credit risk appetite for the management of concentration risk and credit policy to establish the key causes of risk in the process of providing credit and the controls that must be in place to mitigate them.\n- \uf0b7 Approving and monitoring credit limits.\n- \uf0b7 Oversight of the first line of defence to ensure that credit risk remains within the appetite set by the Board and that controls are being operated adequately and effectively.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the adequacy of ECL provisions including approving any necessary in-model and post model adjustments through NatWest Group and business unit provisions and model committees.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nCredit risk appetite aligns to the strategic risk appetite set by the Board and is set and monitored through risk appetite frameworks tailored to NatWest Group's Personal and Wholesale segments.\n\n## Personal\n\nThe Personal credit risk appetite framework sets limits that measure and control the quality and concentration of both existing and new business for each relevant business segment. The actual performance of each portfolio is tracked relative to these limits and management action is taken where necessary. The limits apply to a range of credit risk-related measures including expected loss at both portfolio and product level, projected credit default rates across products and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the mortgage portfolios.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nFor Wholesale credit, the framework has been designed to reflect factors that influence the ability to operate within risk appetite. Tools such as stress testing and economic capital are used to measure credit risk volatility and develop links between the framework and risk appetite limits.\n\nFour formal frameworks are used, classifying, measuring and monitoring credit risk exposure across single name, sector and country concentrations and product and asset classes with heightened risk characteristics.\n\nThe framework is supported by a suite of transactional acceptance standards that set out the risk parameters within which businesses should operate.\n\nCredit policy standards are in place for both the Wholesale and Personal portfolios. They are expressed as a set of mandatory controls.\n\n## Identification and measurement Credit stewardship\n\nRisks are identified through relationship management and credit stewardship of customers and portfolios. Credit risk stewardship takes place throughout the customer relationship, beginning with the initial approval. It includes the application of credit assessment standards, credit risk mitigation and collateral, ensuring that credit documentation is complete and appropriate, carrying out regular portfolio or customer reviews and problem debt identification and management. Additional stewardship measures were put in place in response to COVID-19. Refer to the Impact of COVID-19 section for further details.\n\n## Asset quality\n\nAll credit grades map to an asset quality (AQ) scale, used for financial reporting. Performing loans are defined as AQ1-AQ9 (where the probability of default (PD) is less than 100%) and defaulted nonperforming loans as AQ10 or Stage 3 under IFRS 9 (where the PD is 100%). Loans are defined as defaulted when the payment status becomes 90 days past due, or earlier if there is clear evidence that the borrower is unlikely to repay, for example bankruptcy or insolvency.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk arises from the obligations of customers under derivative and securities financing transactions.\n\nNatWest Group mitigates counterparty credit risk through collateralisation and netting agreements, which allow amounts owed by NatWest Group to a counterparty to be netted against amounts the counterparty owes NatWest Group.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nMitigation techniques, as set out in the appropriate credit policies and transactional acceptance standards, are used in the management of credit portfolios across NatWest Group. These techniques mitigate credit concentrations in relation to an individual customer, a borrower group or a collection of related borrowers. Where possible, customer credit balances are netted against obligations. Mitigation tools can include structuring a security interest in a physical or financial asset, the use of credit derivatives including credit default swaps, creditlinked debt instruments and securitisation structures, and the use of guarantees and similar instruments (for example, credit insurance) from related and third parties. Property is used to mitigate credit risk across a number of portfolios, in particular residential mortgage lending and commercial real estate (CRE).\n\nThe valuation methodologies for collateral in the form of residential mortgage property and CRE are detailed below.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nResidential mortgages - NatWest Group takes collateral in the form of residential property to mitigate the credit risk arising from mortgages. NatWest Group values residential property during the loan underwriting process by either appraising properties individually or valuing them collectively using statistically valid models. NatWest Group updates residential property values quarterly using the relevant residential property index namely:\n\n| Region              | Index used                                                  |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UK (including       | Office for National Statistics House                        |\n| Northern Ireland)   | Price Index                                                 |\n| Republic of Ireland | Central Statistics Office Residential  Property Price Index |\n\nThe current indexed value of the property is a component of the ECL provisioning calculation.\n\nCommercial real estate valuations - NatWest Group has a panel of chartered surveying firms that cover the spectrum of geography and property sectors in which NatWest Group takes collateral. Suitable valuers for particular assets are contracted through a single service agreement to ensure consistency of quality and advice. Valuations are generally commissioned when an asset is taken as security; a material increase in a facility is requested; or a default event is anticipated or has occurred. In the UK, an independent third-party market indexation is applied to update external valuations once they are more than a year old and every three years a formal independent valuation is commissioned. In the Republic of Ireland, assets are revalued in line with the Central Bank of Ireland threshold requirements, which permits indexation for lower value residential assets, but demands regular Red Book valuations for higher value assets.\n\n## Assessment and monitoring\n\nPractices for credit stewardship - including credit assessment, approval and monitoring as well as the identification and management of problem debts - differ between the Personal and Wholesale portfolios.\n\n## Personal\n\nPersonal customers are served through a lending approach that entails offering a large number of small-value loans. To ensure that these lending decisions are made consistently, NatWest Group analyses internal credit information as well as external data supplied by credit reference agencies (including historical debt servicing behaviour of customers with respect to both NatWest Group and other lenders). NatWest Group then sets its lending rules accordingly, developing different rules for different products.\n\nThe process is then largely automated, with each customer receiving an individual credit score that reflects both internal and external behaviours and this score is compared with the lending rules set. For relatively high-value, complex personal loans, including some residential mortgage lending, specialist credit managers make the final lending decisions. These decisions are made within specified delegated authority limits that are issued dependent on the experience of the individual.\n\nUnderwriting standards and portfolio performance are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain adequate in the current market environment and are not weakened materially to sustain growth.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nWholesale customers - including corporates, banks and other financial institutions - are grouped by industry sectors and geography as well as by product/asset class and are managed on an individual basis. Customers are aggregated as a single risk when sufficiently interconnected.\n\nA credit assessment is carried out before credit facilities are made available to customers. The assessment process is dependent on the complexity of the transaction. Credit approvals are subject to environmental, social and governance risk policies which restrict exposure to certain highly carbon intensive industries as well as those with potentially heightened reputational impacts.\n\nFor lower risk transactions below specific thresholds, credit decisions can be approved through self-sanctioning within the business. This process is facilitated through an auto-decision making system, which utilises scorecards, strategies and policy rules. Such credit decisions must be within the approval authority of the relevant business sanctioner.\n\nFor all other transactions, credit is only granted to customers following joint approval by an approver from the business and the credit risk function or by two credit officers. The joint business and credit approvers act within a delegated approval authority under the Wholesale Credit Authorities Framework Policy. The level of delegated authority held by approvers is dependent on their experience and expertise with only a small number of senior executives holding the highest approval authority. Both business and credit approvers are accountable for the quality of each decision taken, although the credit risk approver holds ultimate sanctioning authority.\n\nTransactional acceptance standards provide detailed transactional lending and risk acceptance metrics and structuring guidance. As such, these standards provide a mechanism to manage risk appetite at the customer/transaction level and are supplementary to the established credit risk appetite.\n\nCredit grades (PD) and loss given default (LGD) are reviewed and if appropriate re-approved annually. The review process assesses borrower performance, including reconfirmation or adjustment of risk parameter estimates; the adequacy of security; compliance with terms and conditions; and refinancing risk.\n\n## Problem debt management Personal Early problem identification\n\nPre-emptive triggers are in place to help identify customers that may be at risk of being in financial difficulty. These triggers are both internal, using NatWest Group data, and external using information from credit reference agencies. Proactive contact is then made with the customer to establish if they require help with managing their finances. By adopting this approach, the aim is to prevent a customer's financial position deteriorating which may then require intervention from the Collections and Recoveries teams.\n\nPersonal customers experiencing financial difficulty are managed by the Collections team. If the Collections team is unable to provide appropriate support after discussing suitable options with the customer, management of that customer moves to the Recoveries team. If at any point in the collections and recoveries process, the customer is identified as being potentially vulnerable, the customer will be separated from the regular process and supported by a specialist team to ensure the customer receives appropriate support for their circumstances.\n\n## Collections\n\nWhen a customer exceeds an agreed limit or misses a regular monthly payment the customer is contacted by NatWest Group and requested to remedy the position. If the situation is not regularised then, where appropriate, the Collections team will become more fully involved and the customer will be supported by skilled debt management staff who endeavour to provide customers with bespoke solutions. Solutions include short-term account restructuring, refinance loans and forbearance which can include interest suspension and 'breathing space'. In the event that an affordable/sustainable agreement with a customer cannot be reached, the debt will transition to the Recoveries team. For provisioning purposes, under IFRS 9, exposure to customers managed by the Collections team is categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment, unless it is 90 days past due or has an interest non-accrual status, in which case it is categorised as Stage 3.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the relationship may pass to a specialist support team prior to any transfer to recoveries, depending on the outcome of customer financial assessment.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Credit risk continued Recoveries\n\nThe Recoveries team will issue a notice of intention to default to the customer and, if appropriate, a formal demand, while also registering the account with credit reference agencies where appropriate. Following this, the customer's debt may then be placed with a thirdparty debt collection agency, or alternatively a solicitor, in order to agree an affordable repayment plan with the customer. An option that may also be considered, is the sale of unsecured debt. Exposures subject to formal debt recovery are defaulted and categorised as Stage 3 impaired.\n\n## Wholesale\n\n## Early problem identification\n\nEach segment and sector have defined early warning indicators to identify customers experiencing financial difficulty, and to increase monitoring if needed. Early warning indicators may be internal, such as a customer's bank account activity, or external, such as a publiclylisted customer's share price. If early warning indicators show a customer is experiencing potential or actual difficulty, or if relationship managers or credit officers identify other signs of financial difficulty, they may decide to classify the customer within the Risk of Credit Loss framework.\n\n## Risk of Credit Loss framework\n\nThe framework focuses on Wholesale customers whose credit profiles have deteriorated materially since origination. Expert judgement is applied by experienced credit risk officers to classify cases into categories that reflect progressively deteriorating credit risk to NatWest Group. There are two classifications which apply to non-defaulted customers within the framework - Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss. For the purposes of provisioning, all exposures subject to the framework are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment. The framework also applies to those customers that have met NatWest Group's default criteria (AQ10 exposures). Defaulted exposures are categorised as Stage 3 impaired for provisioning purposes.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers are performing customers that have met certain characteristics, which have led to significant credit deterioration. Collectively, characteristics reflect circumstances that may affect the customer's ability to meet repayment obligations. Characteristics include trading issues, covenant breaches, material PD downgrades and past due facilities.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers require pre-emptive actions (outside the customer's normal trading patterns) to return or maintain their facilities within NatWest Group's current risk appetite prior to maturity.\n\nRisk of Credit Loss customers are performing customers that have met the criteria for Heightened Monitoring and also pose a risk of credit loss to NatWest Group in the next 12 months should mitigating action not be taken or not be successful.\n\nOnce classified as either Heightened Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss, a number of mandatory actions are taken in accordance with policies. Actions include a review of the customer's credit grade, facility and security documentation and the valuation of security. Depending on the severity of the financial difficulty and the size of the exposure, the customer relationship strategy is reassessed by credit officers, by specialist credit risk or relationship management units in the relevant business, or by Restructuring.\n\nAgreed customer management strategies are regularly monitored by both the business and credit teams. The largest Risk of Credit Loss exposures are regularly reviewed by a Risk of Credit Loss Committee. The committee members are experienced credit, business and restructuring specialists. The purpose of the committee is to review and challenge the strategies undertaken for customers that pose the largest risk of credit loss to NatWest Group.\n\nAppropriate corrective action is taken when circumstances emerge that may affect the customer's ability to service its debt (refer to Heightened Monitoring characteristics). Corrective actions may include granting a customer various types of concessions. Any decision to approve a concession will be a function of specific appetite, the credit quality of the customer, the market environment and the loan structure and security. All customers granted forbearance are classified Heightened Monitoring as a minimum.\n\nOther potential outcomes of the relationship review are to: remove the customer from the Risk of Credit Loss framework, offer additional lending and continue monitoring, transfer the relationship to Restructuring if appropriate, or exit the relationship.\n\nThe Risk of Credit Loss framework does not apply to problem debt management for business banking customers. These customers are, where necessary, managed by specialist problem debt management teams, depending on the size of exposure or by the business banking recoveries team where a loan has been impaired.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nWhere customers are categorised as Risk of Credit Loss, relationships are mainly managed by the Restructuring team. The purpose of Restructuring is to protect NatWest Group's capital. Restructuring does this by working with corporate and commercial customers in financial difficulty on their restructuring and repayment strategies. Restructuring will always aim to recover capital fairly and efficiently.\n\nSpecialists in Restructuring work with customers experiencing financial difficulties and showing signs of financial stress. Throughout Restructuring's involvement, the mainstream relationship manager will remain an integral part of the customer relationship, unless a repayment strategy is deemed appropriate. The objective is to find a mutually acceptable solution, including restructuring of existing facilities, repayment or refinancing.\n\nWhere a solvent outcome is not possible, insolvency may be considered as a last resort. However, helping the customer return to financial health and restoring a normal banking relationship is always the preferred outcome.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nForbearance takes place when a concession is made on the contractual terms of a loan/debt in response to a customer's financial difficulties.\n\nThe aim of forbearance is to support and restore the customer to financial health while minimising risk. To ensure that forbearance is appropriate for the needs of the customer, minimum standards are applied when assessing, recording, monitoring and reporting forbearance.\n\nA credit exposure may be forborne more than once, generally where a temporary concession has been granted and circumstances warrant another temporary or permanent revision of the loan's terms.\n\nIn the Personal portfolio, loans are reported as forborne until they meet the exit criteria set out by the European Banking Authority. These include being classified as performing for two years since the last forbearance event, making regular repayments and the loan/debt being less than 30 days past due. Exit criteria are not currently applied for Wholesale portfolios.\n\n## Types of forbearance Personal\n\nIn the Personal portfolio, forbearance may involve payment concessions and loan rescheduling (including extensions in contractual maturity), capitalisation of arrears and, in the Republic of Ireland only, temporary interest-only or partial capital and interest arrangements. Forbearance support is provided for both mortgages and unsecured lending.",

The ultimate outcome of a forbearance strategy is highly dependent on the co-operation of the borrower and a viable business or repayment outcome. Where forbearance is no longer appropriate, NatWest Group will consider other options such as the enforcement of security, insolvency proceedings or both, although these are options of last resort.\n\nProvisioning requirements on forbearance are detailed in the Provisioning for forbearance section.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has necessitated various changes to the 'business as usual' credit risk management approaches set out above.  Specific adjustments made to credit risk management as a result of COVID-19 are set out below.\n\n## Risk appetite Personal\n\nThe onset of COVID-19 resulted in a significant deterioration in the economic outlook and consequently the credit environment. In response, credit risk appetite was tightened including changes to credit score acceptance thresholds and certain credit policy criteria, for example, maximum loan-to-values on new mortgage business. The criteria were reviewed and adapted on an ongoing basis throughout the year.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nAt the outset of COVID-19, Wholesale Credit Risk undertook a vulnerability assessment of sectors and conducted more frequent monitoring of these portfolios, including sub-sector and single name analysis. Additional oversight forums for both new and existing customer requests linked to sector, customer viability and transaction value were also introduced. Monitoring of government support scheme lending, including tracking customer lending journeys to prioritise resources, ensured customers could be supported in a timely manner. Risk appetite limits were reduced to reflect current risks and remain under constant review.\n\n## Identification and measurement Credit stewardsh i p Wholesale\n\nNatwest Group's credit stewardship included carrying out regular portfolio or customer reviews and problem debt identification and management.\n\nIn line with existing credit policy parameters, relationship managers were able to defer annual reviews for a maximum of three months. These deferrals were used during 2020 to provide capacity to focus on supporting government lending scheme requests. Customer review meetings took place virtually unless a specific customer request was made, prior approval obtained and a risk assessment carried out.\n\n## Mitigation Personal\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown from April to June in the UK, valuers were prohibited from conducting physical property inspections. As a result, mortgage application processing was suspended where a physical valuation was required. Applications eligible for remote valuations (known as desktops) and automated valuations (AVM) were able to continue and NatWest Group increased its valuation capacity to provide an additional quality assurance benchmark for ongoing assessment of desktop and AVM standards. Following the April to June lockdown, the application backlog was cleared once valuers were able to safely return to physical property inspections.\n\n## Commercial real estate valuations\n\nCommercial property valuations were not conducted during the initial national lockdown due to travel restrictions, during which time physical valuations were postponed. Following this period, government guidance across the UK nations in respect of local and national lockdowns, confirmed that full internal property inspections could continue subject to adopting COVID-19 secure protocols. However, this required the full co-operation of occupiers and in addition, some commercial premises remained closed. Due to the limitations of some property valuations, The Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors introduced a Material Valuation Uncertainty Clause (MVUC) for use at the time. There was a general lifting of the MVUC for all UK real estate valuations in September. However, where there is still considerable uncertainty for a location or particular sub-sector (for example, assets valued with reference to their trading potential such as hotels), the MVUC may still apply. This position has not changed with second wave local or subsequent national lockdowns.\n\n## Assessment and monitoring Personal\n\nReflecting the deteriorated economic outlook, underwriting standards were tightened including additional information requirements from selfemployed applicants.\n\nCustomers requesting a COVID-19 related payment holiday were not subject to a credit assessment for those requests.\n\nPortfolio performance monitoring was expanded to include insight on customers accessing payment holiday support and their performance at the end of the payment holiday period.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nNatWest Group established guidance on credit grading in response to COVID-19 to ensure consistent and fair outcomes for customers, whilst appropriately reflecting the economic outlook.\n\n- \uf0b7 Within the Wholesale portfolio, customer credit grades were reassessed when a request for financing was made, a scheduled customer credit review undertaken or a material event specific to that customer occurred.\n- \uf0b7 A request for support using one of the government-backed COVID-19 support schemes was not, in itself, a reason for a customer's credit grade to be amended.\n- \uf0b7 Large or complex customers were graded using financial forecasts, incorporating both the effect of COVID-19 and the estimated length of time to return to within credit appetite metrics.\n- \uf0b7 All other customers who were not subject to any wider significant increase in credit risk (SICR) triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium-term post-COVID-19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics were graded using audited accounts.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group identified those customers for whom additional borrowing would require remedial action to return to within risk appetite over the medium term, and customers who were exhibiting signs of financial stress before COVID-19. These customers were graded with reference to the impact COVID-19 had on their business.\n- \uf0b7 Tailored guidance applies to financial institutions and, where appropriate, specialist credit grading models such as CRE.\n- \uf0b7 For certain types of COVID-19 related lending under government support schemes, notably BBLs, in line with the requirements of those schemes, a credit assessment was not undertaken.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Such payment holidays would not necessarily have been considered forbearance (refer to Forbearance below).\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group suspended new formal repossession recovery action for Personal customers.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nIn response to COVID-19, a new framework was introduced to categorise clients in a consistent manner across the Wholesale portfolio, based on the impact of COVID-19 on their financial position and outlook in relation to the sector risk appetite. This framework was extended to all Wholesale customers and supplemented the Risk of Credit Loss framework in assessing whether customers exhibited a SICR, and if support was considered to be granting forbearance. Tailored approaches were also introduced for business banking, commercial real estate and financial institutions customers.\n\n## Forbearance Personal\n\nIn the absence of any other forbearance or SICR triggers, customers granted COVID-19 related payment holidays were not considered forborne and were not subject to Collections team engagement. However, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2. Any support provided beyond the completion of a second payment holiday is considered forbearance, provided the customer's circumstances met the definitions for forbearance as described above.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nCustomers seeking COVID-19 related support, including payment holidays, who were not subject to any wider SICR triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium term post-COVID19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics, were not considered to have been granted forbearance.\n\n## ECL modelling\n\nThe unprecedented nature of COVID-19 required various interventions in ECL modelling to ensure reasonable and supportable ECL estimates. These are detailed in the Model monitoring and enhancement section.\n\n## Credit grading models\n\nCredit grading models is the collective term used to describe all models, frameworks and methodologies used to calculate PD, exposure at default (EAD), LGD, maturity and the production of credit grades.\n\nCredit grading models are designed to provide:\n\n- \uf0b7 An assessment of customer and transaction characteristics.\n- \uf0b7 A meaningful differentiation of credit risk.\n- \uf0b7 Accurate internal default, loss and EAD estimates that are used in the capital calculation or wider risk management purposes.\n\n## Impairment, provisioning and write-offs\n\nIn the overall assessment of credit risk, impairment provisioning and write-offs are used as key indicators of credit quality.\n\nNatWest Group's IFRS 9 provisioning models, which used existing Basel models as a starting point, incorporate term structures and forward-looking information. Regulatory conservatism within the Basel models has been removed as appropriate to comply with the IFRS 9 requirement for unbiased ECL estimates.\n\nFive key areas may materially influence the measurement of credit impairment under IFRS 9 - two of these relate to model build and three relate to model application:\n\n## \uf0b7 Model build:\n\n- o The determination of economic indicators that have most influence on credit loss for each portfolio and the severity of impact (this leverages existing stress testing models which are reviewed annually).\n- o The build of term structures to extend the determination of the risk of loss beyond 12 months that will influence the impact of lifetime loss for assets in Stage 2.\n\n## \uf0b7 Model application:\n\n- o The assessment of the SICR and the formation of a framework capable of consistent application.\n- o The determination of asset lifetimes that reflect behavioural characteristics while also representing management actions and processes (using historical data and experience).\n- o The choice of forward-looking economic scenarios and their respective probability weights.\n\nRefer to Accounting policy 13 for further details.\n\n## IFRS 9 ECL model design principles\n\nModelling of ECL for IFRS 9 follows the conventional approach to divide the problem of estimating credit losses for a given account into its component parts of PD, LGD and EAD.\n\nTo meet IFRS 9 requirements, the PD, LGD and EAD parameters differ from their Pillar 1 internal ratings based counterparts in the following aspects:\n\n- \uf0b7 Unbiased - material regulatory conservatism has been removed from IFRS 9 parameters to produce unbiased estimates.\n- \uf0b7 Point-in-time - IFRS 9 parameters reflect actual economic conditions at the reporting date instead of long-run average or downturn conditions.\n- \uf0b7 Forward-looking - IFRS 9 PD estimates and, where appropriate, EAD and LGD estimates reflect forward-looking economic conditions.\n- \uf0b7 Tenor - IFRS 9 PD, LGD and EAD are provided as multi-period term structures up to exposure lifetimes instead of a fixed one-year horizon.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the PD over the remaining lifetime at the reporting date) with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nFor assets originated before IFRS 9 was introduced, comparable lifetime origination PDs did not exist. These have been retrospectively created using the relevant model inputs applicable at initial recognition.\n\n## PD estimates\n\n## Personal models\n\nPersonal PD models use the Exogenous, Maturity and Vintage (EMV) approach to model default rates. The EMV approach separates portfolio default risk trends into three components: vintage effects (quality of new business over time), maturity effects (changes in risk relating to time on book) and exogenous effects (changes in risk relating to changes in macro-economic conditions). The EMV methodology has been widely adopted across the industry because it enables forward-looking economic information to be systematically incorporated into PD estimates. However, the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 required certain modelling interventions that are detailed in the UK economic uncertainty section.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Wholesale models\n\nWholesale PD models use a point-in-time/through-the-cycle framework to convert one-year regulatory PDs into point-in-time estimates that accurately reflect economic conditions observed at the reporting date. The framework utilises credit cycle indices (CCIs) across a comprehensive set of region/industry segments. Further detail on CCIs is provided in the Economic loss drivers section.\n\nOne year point-in-time PDs are subsequently extended to forwardlooking lifetime PDs using a conditional transition matrix approach and a set of econometric models.\n\n## LGD estimates\n\nThe general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models is to leverage corresponding Basel LGD models with bespoke adjustments to ensure estimates are unbiased and where relevant, forward-looking.\n\n## Personal\n\nForward-looking information has only been incorporated for the secured portfolios, where changes in property prices can be readily accommodated. Analysis has shown minimal impact of economic conditions on LGDs for the other Personal portfolios. For Ulster Bank RoI, a bespoke IFRS 9 mortgage LGD model is used, reflecting its specific regional market.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nForward-looking economic information is incorporated into LGD estimates using the existing CCI framework. For low default portfolios, including sovereigns and banks, loss data is too scarce to substantiate estimates that vary with economic conditions. Consequently, for these portfolios, LGD estimates are assumed to be constant throughout the projection horizon.\n\n## EAD estimates\n\n## Personal\n\nThe IFRS 9 Personal modelling approach for EAD is dependent on product type.\n\n- \uf0b7 Revolving products use the existing Basel models as a basis, with appropriate adjustments incorporating a term structure based on time to default.\n- \uf0b7 Amortising products use an amortising schedule, where a formula is used to calculate the expected balance based on remaining terms and interest rates.\n- \uf0b7 There is no EAD model for Personal loans. Instead, debt flow (i.e. combined PD x EAD) is modelled directly.\n\nAnalysis has indicated that there is minimal impact on EAD arising from changes in the economy for all Personal portfolios except mortgages. Therefore, forward-looking information is only incorporated in the mortgage EAD model (through forecast changes in interest rates).\n\n## Wholesale\n\nFor Wholesale, EAD values are projected using product specific credit conversion factors (CCFs), closely following the product segmentation and approach of the respective Basel model. However, the CCFs are estimated over multi-year time horizons to produce unbiased model estimates.\n\nNo explicit forward-looking information is incorporated, on the basis that analysis has shown that temporal variations in CCFs are mainly attributable to changes in exposure management practices rather than economic conditions.\n\n## Governance and post model adjustments\n\nThe IFRS 9 PD, EAD and LGD models are subject to NatWest Group's model risk policy that stipulates periodic model monitoring, periodic revalidation and defines approval procedures and authorities according to model materiality. Various post model adjustments (PMAs) were applied where management judged they were necessary to ensure an adequate level of overall ECL provision. All PMAs were subject to formal approval through provisioning governance, and were categorised as follows (business level commentary is provided below):\n\n- \uf0b7 Deferred model calibrations - ECL adjustments where PD model monitoring indicated that losses were being over predicted but where it was judged that an implied ECL release was not supportable. As a consequence, any potential ECL release was deferred and retained on the balance sheet.\n- \uf0b7 Economic uncertainty - ECL adjustments primarily arising from uncertainties associated with multiple economic scenarios (also for 2019) and credit outcomes as a result of the effect of COVID-19 and the consequences of government interventions. In both cases, management judged that additional ECL was required until further credit performance data became available on the behavioural and loss consequences of COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 Other adjustments - ECL adjustments where it was judged that the modelled ECL required to be amended.\n\n| ECL post model adjustments 2020   | Retail  Banking \u00a3m   | Ulster Bank RoI \u00a3m   | Commercial Banking \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deferred model calibrations       | 34                   | 2                    | 13                      | -          | 49         |\n| Economic uncertainty              | 158                  | 176                  | 526                     | 18         | 878        |\n| Other adjustments                 | 20                   | 26                   | 19                      | 3          | 68         |\n| Total                             | 212                  | 204                  | 558                     | 21         | 995        |\n| 2019                              |                      |                      |                         |            |            |\n| Deferred model calibrations       | -                    | 1                    | -                       | -          | 1          |\n| Economic uncertainty              | 83                   | 14                   | 98                      | 7          | 202        |\n| Other adjustments                 | 45                   | 25                   | 5                       | 4          | 79         |\n| Total                             | 128                  | 40                   | 103                     | 11         | 282        |\n\n## Note:\n\nRisk and capital management",

In addition, there was a holdback of a modelled ECL release of \u00a369 million, again due to the delayed default emergence reflective of the various customer support mechanisms (\u00a315 million related to mortgages and \u00a354 million related to unsecured lending). The overlay as at 31 December 2019 was reflective of the uncertainty associated with Brexit, subsequently systematically incorporated within the multiple economic scenarios. The 2020 overlay also included an ECL uplift on buy-to-let mortgages of \u00a315 million (2019 - \u00a38 million) to mitigate the risk of a disproportionate credit deterioration in challenging economic circumstances.\n\nOther judgmental overlays included \u00a313 million (2019 - \u00a315 million) in respect of the repayment risk not captured in the models, that a proportion of customers on interest-only mortgages would not be able to repay the capital element of their loan at the end of term, as well as a \u00a37 million overlay for an identified weakness in the mortgage PD model pending remediation.\n\nUlster Bank RoI - The PMA for economic uncertainty included an adjustment of \u00a3103 million in the mortgage portfolio reflecting concerns that expected losses arising from defaults in the year ahead would be significantly higher than modelled. Like Commercial Banking (further detail below), there was an overlay of \u00a330 million in the Wholesale portfolio relative to concerns about debt recovery values and the risk of idiosyncratic credit outcomes. It also included adjustments of \u00a310 million in respect of high risk payment break mortgage customers and \u00a331 million in the SME portfolio reflective of the elevated risk for this sector. These two overlays were also associated with a collective migration of exposures to Stage 2. Refer to the Stage 2 decomposition analysis for further details.\n\nOther judgemental overlays included a Stage 3 ECL uplift of \u00a325 million in the mortgage portfolio to address concerns that the loss outcome under the forecast macro-economic scenarios would be higher than modelled. Similar to Retail Banking and Commercial Banking, there was also a PMA for deferred model calibrations of \u00a32 million in the retail unsecured and business banking portfolios.\n\nCommercial Banking - The PMA for economic uncertainty included an overlay of \u00a3409 million (\u00a3450 million across NatWest Group's Wholesale portfolio) based on a judgemental thesis, reflecting concern that the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 could result in longer debt recovery periods and lower values than history suggested, and also the risk of idiosyncratic credit outcomes. It also included an overlay of \u00a352 million in respect of elevated concerns around borrowers' ability to refinance facilities at the end of the contractual term. Additionally, it included overlays to address the effects of customer support mechanisms. Similar to Retail Banking, the overlay as at 31 December 2019 was reflective of the uncertainty associated with Brexit, subsequently systematically incorporated within the multiple economic scenarios.\n\nThere was also a PMA for deferred model calibrations on the business banking portfolio reflecting management's judgement that the beneficial modelling impact, and implied ECL decrease, was not supportable again whilst portfolio performance was being underpinned by the various support mechanisms. Other adjustments included an overlay of \u00a319 million to mitigate the effect of operational timing delays in the identification and flagging of a SICR.\n\nOther - The PMAs in the other businesses were for similar reasons as those described above.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nExposures that are considered significantly credit deteriorated since initial recognition are classified in Stage 2 and assessed for lifetime ECL measurement (exposures not considered deteriorated carry a 12 month ECL). NatWest Group has adopted a framework to identify deterioration based primarily on relative movements in lifetime PD supported by additional qualitative backstops. The principles applied are consistent across NatWest Group and align to credit risk management practices, where appropriate.\n\n## The framework comprises the following elements:\n\n- \uf0b7 IFRS 9 lifetime PD assessment (the primary driver) - on modelled portfolios, the assessment is based on the relative deterioration in forward-looking lifetime PD and is assessed monthly. To assess whether credit deterioration has occurred, the residual lifetime PD at balance sheet date (which PD is established at date of initial recognition (DOIR)) is compared to the current PD. If the current lifetime PD exceeds the residual origination PD by more than a threshold amount, deterioration is assumed to have occurred and the exposure transferred to Stage 2 for a lifetime loss assessment. For Wholesale, a doubling of PD would indicate a SICR subject to a minimum PD uplift of 0.1%. For Personal portfolios, the criteria vary by risk band, with lower risk exposures needing to deteriorate more than higher risk exposures, as outlined in the following table:\n\n| Personal risk bands   | PD bandings (based on  residual lifetime PD calculated at DOIR)   | PD deterioration  threshold criteria   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Risk band A           | <0.762%                                                           | PD@DOIR + 1%                           |\n| Risk band B           | <4.306%                                                           | PD@DOIR + 3%                           |\n| Risk band C           | >=4.306%                                                          | 1.7 x PD@DOIR                          |\n\n- \uf0b7 Qualitative high-risk backstops - the PD assessment is complemented with the use of qualitative high-risk backstops to further inform whether significant deterioration in lifetime risk of default has occurred. The qualitative high-risk backstop assessment includes the use of the mandatory 30+ days past due backstop, as prescribed by IFRS 9 guidance, and other features such as forbearance support, Wholesale exposures managed within the Risk of Credit Loss framework, and adverse credit bureau results for Personal customers. Where a Personal customer was granted a payment holiday (also referred to as a payment deferral) in response to COVID-19, they were not automatically transferred into Stage 2. However, a subset of Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2 (if not in Stage 2 already). Any support provided beyond completion of the second payment holiday was considered forbearance. Wholesale customers accessing the various COVID-19 support mechanisms were assessed as detailed in the Impact of COVID-19 section.\n- \uf0b7 Persistence (Personal and business banking customers only) - the persistence rule ensures that accounts which have met the criteria for PD driven deterioration are still considered to be significantly deteriorated for three months thereafter. This additional rule enhances the timeliness of capture in Stage 2. The persistence rule is applied to PD driven deterioration only.\n\nThe criteria are based on a significant amount of empirical analysis and seek to meet three key objectives:\n\n- \uf0b7 Criteria effectiveness - the criteria should be effective in identifying significant credit deterioration and prospective default population.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 2 stability - the criteria should not introduce unnecessary volatility in the Stage 2 population.\n- \uf0b7 Portfolio analysis - the criteria should produce results which are intuitive when reported as part of the wider credit portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\nCredit risk continued\n\n## Provisioning for forbearance\n\n## Personal\n\nThe methodology used for provisioning in respect of Personal forborne loans will differ depending on whether the loans are performing or nonperforming and which business is managing them due to local market conditions.\n\nGranting forbearance will only change the arrears status of the loan in specific circumstances, which can include capitalisation of principal and interest in arrears, where the loan may be returned to the performing book if the customer has demonstrated an ability to meet regular payments and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nThe loan would continue to be reported as forborne until it meets the exit criteria set out by the European Banking Authority.\n\nAdditionally, for some forbearance types, a loan may be transferred to the performing book if a customer makes payments that reduce loan arrears below 90 days (Retail Banking collections function).\n\nFor ECL provisioning, all forborne but performing exposures are categorised as Stage 2 and are subject to a lifetime loss provisioning assessment.\n\nFor non-performing forborne loans, the Stage 3 loss assessment process is the same as for non-forborne loans.\n\nIn the absence of any other forbearance or SICR triggers, customers granted COVID-19 related payment holidays were not considered forborne. However, any support provided beyond completion of a second payment holiday is considered forbearance.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nProvisions for forborne loans are assessed in accordance with normal provisioning policies. The customer's financial position and prospects - as well as the likely effect of the forbearance, including any concessions granted, and revised PD or LGD gradings - are considered in order to establish whether an impairment provision increase is required.\n\nWholesale loans granted forbearance are individually assessed in most cases. Performing loans subject to forbearance treatment are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment.\n\nForbearance may result in the value of the outstanding debt exceeding the present value of the estimated future cash flows. This difference will lead to a customer being classified as non-performing.\n\nIn the case of non-performing forborne loans, an individual loan impairment provision assessment generally takes place prior to forbearance being granted. The amount of the loan impairment provision may change once the terms of the forbearance are known, resulting in an additional provision charge or a release of the provision in the period the forbearance is granted.\n\nThe transfer of Wholesale loans from impaired to performing status follows assessment by relationship managers and credit. When no further losses are anticipated and the customer is expected to meet the loan's revised terms, any provision is written-off or released and the balance of the loan returned to performing status. This is not dependent on a specified time period and follows the credit risk manager's assessment.\n\nCustomers seeking COVID-19 related support, including payment holidays, who were not subject to any wider SICR triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium term post-COVID19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics, were not considered to have been granted forbearance. Refer to the Impact of COVID-19 section for further details.\n\n## Asset lifetimes\n\nThe choice of initial recognition and asset duration is another critical judgement in determining the quantum of lifetime losses that apply.\n\n- \uf0b7 The date of initial recognition reflects the date that a transaction (or account) was first recognised on the balance sheet; the PD recorded at that time provides the baseline used for subsequent determination of SICR as detailed above.\n- \uf0b7 For asset duration, the approach applied (in line with IFRS 9 requirements) is:\n- o Term lending - the contractual maturity date, reduced for behavioural trends where appropriate (such as, expected prepayment and amortisation).\n- o Revolving facilities - for Personal portfolios (except credit cards), asset duration is based on behavioural life and this is normally greater than contractual life (which would typically be overnight). For Wholesale portfolios, asset duration is based on annual counterparty review schedules and will be set to the next review date.\n\nIn the case of credit cards, the most significant judgement is to reflect the operational practice of card reissuance and the associated credit assessment as enabling a formal re-origination trigger. As a consequence, a capped lifetime approach of up to 36 months is used on credit card balances. If the approach was uncapped the ECL impact is estimated at approximately \u00a3110 million (2019 - \u00a390 million). However, credit card balances originated under the 0% balance transfer product, and representing approximately 12% of drawn cards balances, have their ECL calculated on a behavioural life-time approach as opposed to being capped at a maximum of three years.\n\nThe capped approach reflects NatWest Group practice of a creditbased review of customers prior to credit card issuance and complies with IFRS 9. Benchmarking information indicates that peer UK banks use behavioural approaches in the main for credit card portfolios with average durations between three and ten years. Across Europe, durations are shorter and are, in some cases, as low as one year.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Credit risk continued Economic loss drivers\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe portfolio segmentation and selection of economic loss drivers for IFRS 9 follow closely the approach used in stress testing. To enable robust modelling the forecasting models for each portfolio segment (defined by product or asset class and where relevant, industry sector and region) are based on a selected, small number of economic factors, (typically three to four) that best explain the temporal variations in portfolio loss rates. The process to select economic loss drivers involves empirical analysis and expert judgement.\n\nThe most material economic loss drivers for the Personal portfolio include unemployment rates, house price indices and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank base rates. For the Wholesale portfolio, in addition to interest and unemployment rates, national GDP, stock price indices and world GDP are primary loss drivers.\n\n## Economic scenarios\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the range of anticipated future economic conditions was defined by a set of four internally developed scenarios and their respective probabilities. They comprised upside, base case, downside and extreme downside scenarios. The scenarios primarily reflect a range of outcomes for the path of COVID-19 and associated effects on labour and asset markets. The scenarios were consistent with the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement and are summarised as follows:\n\nUpside - This scenario assumes a very strong recovery through 2021, facilitated by a very rapid rollout of the vaccine. Economic output regains its pre-COVID-19 peak by the end of the year. The rebound in consumer spending from an easing in lockdown restrictions is rapid, enabling a more successful reabsorption of furloughed labour compared to the base case. That limits the rise in unemployment. Consequently, the effect on asset prices is more limited compared to the base case.\n\nBase case - The current lockdown restrictions are gradually loosened enabling a recovery over the course of 2021. The rollout of the vaccines proceeds as planned. Consumer spending rebounds as accumulated household savings are spent, providing support to the recovery in consumer-facing service sectors. Unemployment rises through to the second half of 2021, peaking at 7%, before gradually retreating. Housing activity slows in the second half of 2021 with a very limited decline in prices.\n\nDownside - This scenario assumes the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine is slower compared to base case, leading to a more sluggish recovery.  Business confidence is slower to return while households remain more cautious. This scenario assumes that the labour market and asset market damage is greater than in the base case. Unemployment peaks at 9.4%, surpassing the financial crisis peak and causing more scarring.\n\nExtreme downside - This scenario assumes a new variant of COVID19 necessitates a new vaccine, which substantially slows the speed of rollout, prolonging the recovery. There is a renewed sharp downturn in the economy in 2021. Firms react by shedding labour in significant numbers, leading to a very difficult recovery with the unemployment rate surpassing the levels seen in the 1980s. There are very sharp declines in asset prices. The recovery is tepid throughout the five-year period, meaning only a gradual decline in joblessness.\n\nIn contrast, as at 31 December 2019, NatWest Group used five discrete scenarios to characterise the distribution of risks in the economic outlook. For 2020, the four scenarios were deemed appropriate in capturing the uncertainty in economic forecasts and the non-linearity in outcomes under different scenarios. These four scenarios were developed to provide sufficient coverage across potential rises in unemployment, asset price falls and the degree of permanent damage to the economy, around which there are pronounced levels of uncertainty at this stage.\n\nThe tables and commentary below provide details of the key economic loss drivers under the four scenarios.\n\nThe main macroeconomic variables for each of the four scenarios used for ECL modelling are set out in the main macroeconomic variables table below. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for GDP is shown. It also shows the five-year average for unemployment and the Bank of England base rate. The House Price Inflation and commercial real estate figures show the total change in each asset over five years.\n\n| Main macroeconomic variables                | 2020     | 2020        | 2020       | 2020               | 2019       | 2019       | 2019        | 2019         | 2019         |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|------------|--------------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Five-year summary                           | Upside % | Base case % | Downside % | Extreme downside % | Upside 2 % | Upside 1 % | Base case % | Downside 1 % | Downside 2 % |\n| UK                                          |          |             |            |                    |            |            |             |              |              |\n| GDP - CAGR                                  | 3.6      | 3.1         | 2.8        | 1.3                | 2.5        | 2.3        | 1.6         | 1.3          | 0.9          |\n| Unemployment - average                      | 4.4      | 5.7         | 7.1        | 9.7                | 3.6        | 3.9        | 4.4         | 4.6          | 5.2          |\n| House Price Inflation - total change        | 12.5     | 7.6         | 4.4        | (19.0)             | 22.4       | 17.6       | 8.3         | 4.0          | (5.1)        |\n| Bank of England base rate - average         | 0.2      | -           | (0.1)      | (0.5)              | 1.0        | 0.7        | 0.3         | -            | -            |\n| Commercial real estate price - total change | 4.3      | 0.7         | (12.0)     | (31.5)             | 13.0       | 8.1        | (1.3)       | (5.8)        | (15.1)       |\n| Republic of Ireland                         |          |             |            |                    |            |            |             |              |              |\n| GDP - CAGR                                  | 4.2      | 3.5         | 3.0        | 1.6                | 3.8        | 3.5        | 2.7         | 2.3          | 1.8          |\n| Unemployment - average                      | 5.6      | 7.5         | 9.3        | 11.2               | 4.0        | 4.3        | 4.8         | 5.6          | 6.8          |\n| House Price Inflation - total change        | 21.0     | 13.3        | 6.8        | (7.0)              | 29.3       | 25.7       | 15.5        | 10.8         | 4.2          |\n| European Central Bank base rate - average   | 0.1      | -           | -          | -                  | 1.5        | 0.8        | -           | -            | -            |\n| World GDP - CAGR                            | 3.5      | 3.4         | 2.9        | 2.8                | 3.9        | 3.3        | 2.8         | 2.5          | 2.0          |\n| Probability weight                          | 20.0     | 40.0        | 30.0       | 10.0               | 12.7       | 14.8       | 30.0        | 29.7         | 12.7         |\n\nNote:",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Credit risk continued Economic loss drivers Probability weightings of scenarios\n\nNatWest Group's approach to IFRS 9 multiple economic scenarios (MES) involves selecting a suitable set of discrete scenarios to characterise the distribution of risks in the economic outlook and assigning appropriate probability weights. The scale of the economic impact of COVID-19 and the range of recovery paths necessitates a change of approach to assigning probability weights from that used in recent updates. Previously GDP paths for NatWest Group's scenarios were compared against a set of 1,000 model runs, following which a percentile in the distribution was established that most closely corresponded to the scenario. This approach does not produce meaningful outcomes in the current circumstances because GDP is highly volatile and highly uncertain.\n\nInstead, NatWest Group has subjectively applied probability weights, reflecting expert views within NatWest Group. The probability weight assignment was judged to present good coverage to the central scenarios and the potential for a far more robust recovery on the upside and exceptionally challenging outcomes on the downside. A 20% weighting was applied to the upside scenario, a 40% weighting applied to the base case scenario, a 30% weighting applied to the downside scenario and a 10% weighting applied to the extreme downside scenario. NatWest Group judged a downside-biased weighting as appropriate given the risk to the outlook posed by the numerous factors influencing the path of COVID-19, the rollout of the vaccine and the pace at which social distancing restrictions can be relaxed.\n\n## Use of the scenarios in Personal lending\n\nPersonal lending follows a discrete scenario approach which means that for each account, PD and LGD values are calculated as probability weighted averages across the individual, discrete economic scenarios. The PD values for each discrete scenario are in turn calculated using product specific econometric models that aggregate forecasts of the relevant economic loss drivers into forecasts of the exogenous component of the respective PD models (refer to IFRS 9 ECL model design principles).\n\n## Use of the scenarios in Wholesale lending\n\nThe Wholesale lending methodology is based on the concept of CCIs. The CCIs represent, similar to the exogenous component in Personal, all relevant economic loss drivers for a region/industry segment aggregated into a single index value that describes the loss rate conditions in the respective segment relative to its long-run average. A CCI value of zero corresponds to loss rates at long-run average levels, a positive CCI value corresponds to loss rates below long-run average levels and a negative CCI value corresponds to loss rates above longrun average levels.\n\nThe four economic scenarios are translated into forward-looking projections of CCIs using a set of econometric models. Subsequently the CCI projections for the individual scenarios are averaged into a single central CCI projection according to the given scenario probabilities. The central CCI projection is then overlaid with an additional mean reversion assumption, i.e. that after one to two years into the forecast horizon the CCI gradually revert to their long-run average of zero.\n\nFinally, ECL is calculated using a Monte Carlo approach by averaging PD and LGD values arising from many CCI paths simulated around the central CCI projection.\n\nThe rationale for the Wholesale approach is the long-standing observation that loss rates in Wholesale portfolios tend to follow regular cycles. This allows NatWest Group to enrich the range and depth of future economic conditions embedded in the final ECL beyond what would be obtained from using the discrete macroeconomic scenarios alone.\n\nBusiness banking, while part of the Wholesale segment, for reporting purposes, utilises the Personal lending rather than the Wholesale lending methodology.\n\n## UK economic uncertainty\n\n## Treatment of COVID-19 relief mechanisms\n\nUse of COVID-19 relief mechanisms (for example, payment holidays, CBILS and BBLS) will not automatically merit identification of SICR and trigger a Stage 2 classification in isolation. However, a subset of Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk were collectively migrated to Stage 2 (if not already captured by other SICR criteria).\n\nFor Wholesale customers, NatWest Group continues to provide support, where appropriate, to existing customers. Those who are deemed either (a) to require a prolonged timescale to return to within NatWest Group's risk appetite, (b) not to have been viable pre-COVID19, or (c) not to be able to sustain their debt once COVID-19 is over, will trigger a SICR and, if concessions are sought, be categorised as forborne, in line with regulatory guidance.\n\nAs some of the government support mechanisms conclude, NatWest Group anticipates further credit deterioration in the portfolios. There are a number of key factors that could drive further downside to impairments, through deteriorating economic and credit metrics and increased stage migration as credit risk increases for more customers. A key factor would be a more adverse deterioration in GDP and unemployment in the economies in which NatWest Group operates, but also, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 The timing and nature of governmental exit plans from lockdown, notably in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and any future repeated lockdown requirements.\n- \uf0b7 The progress of COVID-19, with potential for changes in worker/consumer behaviour and sickness levels.\n- \uf0b7 The efficacy of the various government support initiatives in terms of their ability to defray customer defaults is yet to be proven, notably over an extended period.\n- \uf0b7 Any further damage to certain supply chains, most notably in the case of any re-tightening of lockdown rules but also delays caused by social distancing measures and possible export/import controls.\n- \uf0b7 The level of revenues lost by corporate clients and pace of recovery of those revenues may affect NatWest Group's clients' ability to service their borrowing, especially in those sectors most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 Higher unemployment if companies fail to restart jobs after periods of staff furlough.\n\nThis could potentially lead to further ECL increases. However, the income statement impact of this will be mitigated to some extent by the forward-looking provisions taken as at 31 December 2020.\n\nRisk and capital management",

To account for these structural changes, model adjustments have been applied and model changes have been implemented.\n\n## Government support\n\nMost notably as a result of various government support measures, the increase in model-predicted defaults caused by the sharp contraction in GDP and consumer spending in Q2 2020 has to date not materialised.\n\nAccordingly, model-projected default rates in Wholesale and Personal have been adjusted by introducing lags of up to 12 months. These lags are based partly on objective empirical data (i.e. the absence of increases in realised default rates by the reporting date) and partly judgmental, based on the extension of government support measures into 2021 and their expected effectiveness.\n\nIn Wholesale lending, most importantly business and commercial banking, model-projected default rates have also been scaled down based on the expectation that credit extended under various government support loan schemes will allow many businesses, not only to delay, but to sustainably mitigate their default risk profile.\n\n## Extreme GDP movements - Wholesale only\n\nDue to the specific nature of COVID-19, GDP year-on-year movements in both directions are extremely sharp, many multiples of their respective extremes observed previously.\n\nThis creates a risk of overstretched, invalid extrapolations in statistical models. Therefore, all Wholesale econometric models were updated to make them robust against extreme GDP movements by capping projected CCI values at levels corresponding to three times the default rates observed at the peak of the global financial crisis and using quarterly averages rather than spot values for CCI projections.\n\n## Industry sector detail - Wholesale only\n\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 is highly differentiated by industry sector, with hospitality and other contact-based leisure, service, travel and passenger transport activities significantly more affected than the overall economy. On the other hand, the corporate and commercial econometric forecasting models used in Wholesale are sector agnostic. Sector performance was therefore monitored throughout the year and additional adjustments were applied when PDs were deemed inconsistent with expected loss outcomes at sector level. No such interventions were necessary at the year end.\n\n## Scenario sensitivity - Personal only\n\nFor the Personal lending portfolio, the forward-looking components of the IFRS 9 PD models were modified, leveraging existing econometric models used in stress testing to ensure that PDs appropriately reflect the forecasts for unemployment and house prices in particular.\n\nAll in-model adjustments described have been applied by correcting the PD and LGD estimates within the core ECL calculation process and therefore consistently and systematically inform SICR identification and ECL measurement.\n\nAdditionally, post model ECL adjustments were made in Personal to ensure that the ECL was adjusted for known model over and underpredictions pre-existing COVID-19, pending the systematic recalibration of the underlying models.\n\n## Government guarantees\n\nDuring 2020, the UK government launched a series of temporary schemes designed to support businesses deal with the impact of COVID-19. The BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS lending products are originated by NatWest Group but are covered by government guarantees. These are to be set against the outstanding balance of a defaulted facility after the proceeds of the business assets have been applied. The government guarantee is 80% for CBILS and CLBILS and 100% for BBLS. NatWest Group recognises lower LGDs for these lending products as a result, with 0% applied to the government guaranteed part of the exposure.\n\nNotwithstanding the government guarantees, NatWest Group's measurements of PD are unaffected and NatWest Group continues to move exposures to Stage 2 and Stage 3 where a significant deterioration in credit risk or a default is identified.\n\n## Wholesale support schemes\n\nThe table below shows the uptake of Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) in Wholesale, by sector.\n\n|                                     | BBLS            | BBLS                  | BBLS                      | CBILS           | CBILS                 | CBILS                      | CLBILS          | CLBILS      | CLBILS                                |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 2020                                | Approved volume | Drawdown  amount (\u00a3m) | % of BBLS to sector loans | Approved volume | Drawdown  amount (\u00a3m) | % of CBILS to sector loans | Approved volume | amount (\u00a3m) | Drawdown  % of CLBILS to sector loans |\n| Wholesale lending by sector         |                 |                       |                           |                 |                       |                            |                 |             |                                       |\n| Airlines and aerospace              | 253             | 7                     | 0.35%                     | 21              | 9                     | 0.45%                      | 4               | 8           | 0.40%                                 |\n| Automotive                          | 12,301          | 416                   | 6.60%                     | 553             | 139                   | 2.21%                      | 31              | 58          | 0.92%                                 |\n| Education                           | 1,943           | 53                    | 3.24%                     | 111             | 73                    | 4.46%                      | 11              | 37          | 2.26%                                 |\n| Health                              | 9,821           | 314                   | 5.41%                     | 601             | 101                   | 1.74%                      | 3               | 24          | 0.41%                                 |\n| Land transport and logistics        | 8,575           | 255                   | 5.31%                     | 365             | 97                    | 2.02%                      | 3               | 5           | 0.10%                                 |\n| Leisure                             | 31,148          | 989                   | 10.07%                    | 1,983           | 512                   | 5.21%                      | 34              | 173         | 1.76%                                 |\n| Oil and gas                         | 303             | 9                     | 0.58%                     | 15              | 8                     | 0.51%                      |                 |             | -                                     |\n| Retail                              | 31,315          | 1,078                 | 11.75%                    | 1,548           | 416                   | 4.54%                      | 29              | 121         | 1.32%                                 |\n| Property                            | 67,698          | 1,996                 | 5.24%                     | 2,350           | 664                   | 1.74%                      | 41              | 133         | 0.35%                                 |\n| Other (including Business  Banking) | 118,486         | 3,181                 | 3.57%                     | 8,504           | 1,752                 | 1.97%                      | 86              | 267         | 0.30%                                 |\n| Total                               | 281,843         | 8,298                 | 4.93%                     | 16,051          | 3,771                 | 2.24%                      | 242             | 826         | 0.49%                                 |\n\n## Notes:",

This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic conditions into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate.\n\nThe focus of the simulations is on ECL provisioning requirements on performing exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. The simulations are run on a stand-alone basis and are independent of each other; the potential ECL impacts reflect the simulated impact as at 31 December 2020. Scenario impacts on SICR should be considered when evaluating the ECL movements of Stage 1 and Stage 2. In all scenarios the total exposure was the same but exposure by stage varied in each scenario.\n\nStage 3 provisions are not subject to the same level of measurement uncertainty - default is an observed event as at the balance sheet date. Stage 3 provisions therefore have not been considered in this analysis.\n\nThe impact arising from the upside, downside and extreme downside scenarios has been simulated. These scenarios are three of the four discrete scenarios used in the methodology for Personal multiple economic scenarios as described in the Economic loss drivers section. In the simulations, NatWest Group has assumed that the economic macro variables associated with these scenarios replace the existing base case economic assumptions, giving them a 100% probability weighting and thus serving as a single economic scenario.\n\nThese scenarios have been applied to all modelled portfolios in the analysis below, with the simulation impacting both PDs and LGDs. Modelled overlays present in the underlying ECL estimates are also sensitised in line with the modelled ECL movements, but those that were judgmental in nature, primarily those for economic uncertainty, were not (refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section). As expected, the scenarios create differing impacts on ECL by portfolio and the impacts are deemed reasonable. In this simulation, it is assumed that existing modelled relationships between key economic variables and loss drivers hold, but in practice other factors would also have an impact, for example, potential customer behaviour changes and policy changes by lenders that might impact on the wider availability of credit.\n\nNatWest Group's core criterion to identify a SICR is founded on PD deterioration, as discussed above. Under the simulations, PDs change and result in exposures moving between Stage 1 and Stage 2 contributing to the ECL impact.\n\nThe simulated ECL impacts in the December 2020 sensitivity analysis were significantly higher than in the sensitivity analysis carried out at December 2019 (refer to the NatWest Group plc (formerly The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc) 2019 Annual Report and Accounts for further details). The relative ECL movements across the scenarios were reflective of a higher actual reported ECL, including certain treatments to capture the idiosyncratic risk of COVID-19, with the economics in the extreme downside scenario significantly more adverse than in the 2019 downside 2 scenario.",

Downside risk persisted and was reflected in the scenario weightings with heavier weighting to the downside than to the upside. Judgemental ECL post model adjustments reflected heightened uncertainty and expectation of increased defaults in 2021 and beyond. To a certain extent, these adjustments dampen the ECL uplift in the downside scenario, particularly in Wholesale which had already observed a larger proportionate increase in actual reported ECL and coverage.\n- \uf0b7 If the economics were as negative as observed in the extreme downside, overall Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL was simulated to increase by over 60%. The non-linearity was more apparent in the Personal portfolio driven by mortgages, with the ECL mitigation impact of Wholesale portfolio securitisations observed in downside scenarios, where ECL did not increase to the same extent.\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis section details the credit risk profile of NatWest Group's banking activities.

Refer to Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020 for further details.\n\nThe assets outside the IFRS 9 ECL framework were as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 Settlement balances, items in the course of collection, cash balances and other non-credit risk assets of \u00a34.1 billion (2019 \u00a36.1 billion). These were assessed as having no ECL unless there was evidence that they were credit impaired.\n- \uf0b7 Equity shares of \u00a30.3 billion (2019 - \u00a30.9 billion) as not within the IFRS 9 ECL framework by definition.\n- \uf0b7 Fair value adjustments on loans hedged by interest rate swaps, where the underlying loan was within the IFRS 9 ECL scope - \u00a31.4 billion (2019 - \u00a31.1 billion).\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group-originated securitisations, where ECL was captured on the underlying loans of \u00a30.4 billion (2019 - \u00a30.4 billion).\n\n## Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nIn addition to contingent liabilities and commitments disclosed in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements - reputationally-committed limits are also included in the scope of the IFRS 9 ECL framework. These are offset by \u00a30.2 billion (2019 - \u00a32.6 billion) out of scope balances primarily related to facilities that, if drawn, would not be classified as amortised cost or FVOCI, or undrawn limits relating to financial assets exclusions. Total contingent liabilities (including financial guarantees) and commitments within IFRS 9 ECL scope of \u00a3133.6 billion (2019 - \u00a3127.9 billion) comprised Stage 1 \u00a3107.4 billion (2019 - \u00a3121.7 billion); Stage 2 \u00a325.2 billion (2019 - \u00a35.6 billion) and Stage 3 \u00a31.0 billion (2019 - \u00a30.6 billion).\n\n- \uf0b7 The relatively small ECL uplift in the downside scenario (\u00a3246 million, 7% of actual) reflected the weighting within the multiple economic scenarios used in the actual reported ECL to the downside.\n- \uf0b7 In the upside scenario, the simulated ECL reduction (\u00a3844 million, 24% of actual) was lower than the uplift observed in the extreme downside (\u00a32.2 billion), again reflecting the expectation that the non-linearity of losses was skewed to the downside.\n- \uf0b7 The simulated value of exposures in Stage 2 increased significantly in the extreme downside and was the key driver of the simulated ECL increase. The movement in Stage 2 balances in the other simulations was less marked, with the exception of Wholesale, where a significant reduction was observed in the upside scenario reflecting the sensitivity of SICR criteria to relatively small movements in PD.\n- \uf0b7 In a separate simulation covering the base case economic scenario (one of the multiple economic scenarios), and assuming a 100% weighting to that scenario, the total Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL was simulated to be approximately 8% lower than the actual reported ECL.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Refer to Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020 for further details.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (1) Includes \u00a36 million (2019 - \u00a34 million) related to assets classified as FVOCI.\n- (2) ECL provisions coverage is calculated as ECL provisions divided by loans - amortised cost and FVOCI.\n- (3) ECL provisions coverage and ECL loss rates are calculated on third party loans and related ECL provisions and charge respectively. ECL loss rate is calculated as annualised third party ECL charge divided by loans - amortised cost and FVOCI.\n- (4) Includes a \u00a312 million charge (2019 - \u00a32 million) related to other financial assets, of which \u00a32 million (2019 - \u00a31 million release) related to assets classified as FVOCI; and \u00a328 million (2019 - nil) related to contingent liabilities.\n- (5) The table shows gross loans only and excludes amounts that are outside the scope of the ECL framework. Refer to the Financial instruments within the scope of the IFRS 9 ECL framework section for further details. Other financial assets within the scope of the IFRS 9 ECL framework were cash and balances at central banks totalling \u00a3122.7 billion (2019 - \u00a379.2 billion) and debt securities of \u00a353.8 billion (2019 - \u00a359.4 billion).\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The ECL requirement increased significantly year-on-year, primarily in Stage 1 and Stage 2, in expectation of credit deterioration reflecting the severity of the economic impact arising from COVID-19. The deteriorated economic outlook also resulted in a significant migration of exposures from Stage 1 to Stage 2, consequently moving from a 12 month to a life-time ECL requirement.\n- \uf0b7 The various customer support mechanisms continued to mitigate against flows to default during the year. Hence, there was a more limited impact on Stage 3 ECL requirements which reduced slightly year-on-year reflecting the lower Stage 3 stock of exposures, driven by the sale of legacy non-performing mortgages in Ulster Bank RoI.\n\n- \uf0b7 Reflecting the continued high level of uncertainty arising from COVID-19, management judged that certain ECL post model adjustments were necessary. Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further detail.\n- \uf0b7 Reflective of the economic environment, the annualised loss rate was elevated and significantly above the previously advised view of NatWest Group's normalised blended long-term loss rate of 30 to 40 basis points.\n- \uf0b7 Business level commentary is provided in the Segmental loans and impairment metrics section.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Refer to Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020 for further details.\n\n## Notes:\n\n(1) 30 DPD - 30 days past due, the mandatory 30 days past due backstop as prescribed by the IFRS 9 guidance for a SICR. (2) ECL provisions on contingent liabilities and commitments are included within the Financial assets section so as not to distort ECL coverage ratios.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 Retail Banking - Balance sheet growth was primarily due to mortgages. This reflected strong customer demand as well as the \u00a33.0 billion acquisition of an owner-occupied mortgage portfolio from Metro Bank (for which a Stage 1 ECL charge of \u00a39 million was incurred on acquisition).\n- \uf0b7 Unsecured lending balances decreased reflecting reduced customer demand and the pay down of existing borrowing as well as a more restrictive risk appetite reflective of the uncertain external environment. The deteriorated economic outlook, including forecast increases in unemployment, resulted in increased account level IFRS 9 PDs. Consequently, compared to 2019, a larger proportion of customer accounts exhibited a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) which caused a migration of assets from Stage 1 to Stage 2. As a result, the ECL requirement increased.\n\n- \uf0b7 While the granting of a COVID-19 related payment holiday did not automatically trigger a migration to Stage 2, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2 and their ECL uplifted (refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details). The various COVID-19 related customer support mechanisms (loan repayment holidays, government job retention scheme) continued to mask actual portfolio deterioration in the short-term, with the days past due, and flows to Stage 3 metrics, yet to be impacted. Provisions coverage increased overall. However, coverage in Stage 2 alone reduced, mainly due to a proportionately higher share of mortgage exposures where coverage levels were lower. This reflected the secured nature of the borrowing. The loss rate was significantly higher than in the prior year.\n\nRisk\n\nand\n\ncapital\n\nmaagement",

Further drawdowns on existing facilities and new lending across both the Wholesale and Personal portfolios were offset by ongoing reduction of the non-performing mortgage portfolio through the execution of a portfolio sale agreed in 2019. The deteriorated economic outlook included forecast increases in unemployment, reductions in property prices and GDP, which resulted in increased IFRS 9 PDs across all portfolios. Consequently, compared to 2019, a larger proportion of the exposures exhibited a SICR with an associated migration of assets from Stage 1 to Stage 2. As a result, the ECL increased. The various COVID-19 related customer support mechanisms (for example, loan payment breaks, government job retention scheme) masked actual portfolio deterioration in the short-term, with the days past due, and flows to Stage 3, yet to be materially affected. The loss rate was significantly higher than in the prior year.\n\n- \uf0b7 Commercial Banking - Balance sheet growth was primarily due to further drawdowns on existing facilities and new lending under the COVID-19 government lending schemes. The deteriorated economic outlook, including significant reductions in GDP and commercial real estate valuations, resulted in increased IFRS 9 PDs. Consequently, compared to 2019, a larger proportion of the exposures exhibited a SICR which caused a migration of assets from Stage 1 to Stage 2. As a result, the ECL requirement increased. Reflecting the continued high level of uncertainty arising from COVID-19, management judged that certain ECL post model adjustments were necessary, refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details. The increase in Stage 2 assets due to PD deterioration was also the primary driver of the increase in the Stage 2 exposures less than 30 days past due. A small number of large cases resulted in the increase in the 1-30 DPD category. The various COVID-19 related customer support mechanisms mitigated against flows into default in the short-term. Increased coverage in Stage 1 and Stage 2 was mainly due to the increased ECL, primarily as a result of the deteriorated economic outlook, which was partially offset by a decrease in Stage 3 coverage driven by a small number of individual cases with low ECL. The loss rate was significantly higher than in the prior year.\n- \uf0b7 Other businesses - The drivers of the increased ECL requirement were similar to those described above.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\nCredit risk - Banking activities continued Portfolio summary - sector analysis Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 Loans by geography - In the Personal portfolio, exposures continued to be concentrated in the UK and heavily weighted to mortgages; the vast majority of exposures in the Republic of Ireland remained in mortgages. Balance sheet growth was within mortgages including the acquisition by Retail Banking of the owneroccupied portfolio detailed earlier; unsecured lending balances reduced also as described earlier. In the Wholesale portfolio, exposures remained heavily weighted to the UK. Balance sheet growth was driven by additional drawings on existing facilities and new lending under the various government supported lending schemes which are primarily to UK customers.\n- \uf0b7 Loans by asset quality (based on Basel II PD) - In the Personal portfolio, the asset quality distribution deteriorated slightly in credit cards, with balance reductions in higher asset quality bands. In the Wholesale portfolio, Basel II PDs were based on a through-thecycle approach. The asset quality distribution demonstrated some deterioration across the portfolio consistent with the wider impacts of COVID-19. Lending under government-backed COVID-19 related support schemes was mostly in the AQ8 band. Increased exposure in the AQ2 band in financial institutions is related to Treasury activities as customer deposit levels have increased. In addition, some AQ migration within financial institutions occurred as a result of the downgrade of the UK sovereign. For further details refer to the Asset quality section.\n- \uf0b7 Loans by stage - In both the Personal and Wholesale portfolios, the deteriorated economic outlook resulted in increased account level IFRS 9 PDs. Consequently, compared to 2019, a larger proportion of accounts exhibited a SICR with an associated migration of exposures from Stage 1 to Stage 2, the vast majority of which were up-to-date with payments. In the absence of any other forbearance or SICR triggers, customers granted COVID-19 related payment holidays were not considered forborne and did not result in an automatic trigger to Stage 2. However, a subset of personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2.\n- \uf0b7 Loans - Past due analysis and Stage 2 - The various COVID-19 related customer support mechanisms (capital repayment holidays, government job retention scheme, government supported lending schemes) are mitigating actual portfolio deterioration in the short term, although there have been some increases in past due exposures in the Wholesale portfolio.\n- \uf0b7 Weighted average 12 months PDs - In Personal, the Basel II pointin-time PDs have yet to be materially affected by COVID-19. The forward-looking IFRS 9 PDs increased reflecting the deteriorated economics. The IFRS 9 PDs for both unsecured loans (reported within other personal) and mortgages were under-predicting and the ECL was adjusted upwards pending the model parameters being systematically updated. In the Wholesale portfolio, the Basel II PDs were based on a through-the-cycle approach and increased less than the forward looking IFRS 9 PDs which increased, reflecting the deteriorated economic outlook.\n- \uf0b7 ECL provision by geography - In line with loans by geography, the vast majority of ECL related to exposures in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\n- \uf0b7 ECL provisions by stage - Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions increased reflecting the deteriorated economic outlook. As outlined above, Stage 3 provisions have yet to be materially impacted by COVID-19, being mitigated by the various customer support mechanisms detailed earlier. In mortgages, the Stage 3 ECL reduction was primarily a result of a debt sale in Ulster Bank RoI, where the exposure value also reduced.\n\n- \uf0b7 ECL provisions coverage - Overall provisions coverage increased. In Stage 2 alone, at a total Personal level, coverage reduced, due to a proportionately higher share of mortgage exposures where coverage levels were lower reflecting the secured nature of the borrowing. In Wholesale, overall provisions coverage increased, primarily due to the effect of the deteriorated economic conditions. Stage 1 and Stage 2 coverage increased, particularly in those sectors suffering the most disruption as a result of COVID-19. The decrease in Stage 3 coverage was due to a small number of individual cases with low ECL.\n- \uf0b7 The ECL charge and loss rate - Reflecting the deteriorated economic outlook, the impairment charge was elevated, with the loss rate significantly higher than the prior year.\n- \uf0b7 Loans by residual maturity - In mortgages, the vast majority of exposures remained greater than five years. In unsecured lending - credit cards and other - exposures were concentrated in less than five years. In Wholesale, with the exception of financial institutions where new lending was concentrated in less than 1 year, the majority of new lending was for residual maturity of onefive years, with some greater than five years in line with lending under the government support schemes.\n- \uf0b7 Other financial assets by asset quality - Consisting almost entirely of cash and balances at central banks and debt securities, held in the course of treasury related management activities, these assets were mainly within the AQ1-AQ4 category.\n- \uf0b7 Off-balance sheet exposures by asset quality - In Personal, undrawn exposures were reflective of available credit lines in credit cards and current accounts and reduced reflecting an initiative to right-size customer unutilised borrowing limits. Additionally, the mortgage portfolio had undrawn exposure, where a formal offer had been made to a customer but had not yet been drawn down. There was also a legacy portfolio of flexible mortgages where a customer had the right and ability to draw down further funds. The asset quality distribution in mortgages remained heavily weighted to the highest quality bands AQ1-AQ4, with credit card concentrated in the risk bands AQ5-AQ8. In Wholesale, undrawn exposures increased reflecting the effect of COVID-19 and the utilisation of the various government support schemes. The vast majority of new corporate loan commitments were in the AQ5-AQ8 asset quality bands.\n- \uf0b7 Wholesale forbearance - The value of Wholesale forbearance increased significantly during the year. Customers seeking COVID19 related support, including payment holidays, who were not subject to any wider SICR triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium term post-COVID-19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics, were not considered to have been granted forbearance. The leisure, CRE and automotive sectors represented the largest share of forbearance flow in the Wholesale portfolio by value, with the increase in automotive resulting from forbearance completed on individually significant exposures. In addition, within the retail sector, there was a high volume of lower value forbearance. Payment holidays and covenant waivers were the most common forms of forbearance granted.\n- \uf0b7 Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss - Consistent with the effects of COVID-19, increased flows into Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss were noted across a number of sectors. The most material increases in both volumes and value were seen within other corporate and particularly in leisure, land transport & logistics and automotive sectors. In the CRE sector, inflows by value increased, but by volume remained largely stable.",

It excludes loans that are commercial in nature.\n\n- (4) Retail Banking excludes additional lending to existing customers.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 Although the economic outlook deteriorated, reflected in the IFRS 9 stage migrations and ECL described earlier, the overall credit risk profile and underlying performance of the Personal portfolio remained stable during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Personal lending increased during 2020 primarily due to mortgage growth and, in Retail Banking the acquisition of a \u00a33 billion portfolio of owner occupied mortgages from Metro Bank. Unsecured lending reduced due to lower credit cards and overdraft usage during COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 New mortgage lending was slightly lower than in 2019. COVID-19 restrictions affected volumes in the second and third quarters of the year. The existing mortgage stock and new business were closely monitored against agreed risk appetite parameters. These included loan-to-value ratios, buy-to-let concentrations, new-build concentrations and credit quality. These criteria were appropriately amended during the year to manage the effects of COVID-19 on the credit risk profile and underwriting standards were maintained.\n- \uf0b7 As at 31 December 2020, \u00a32 billion (1%) of the UK Retail Banking mortgage portfolio had active COVID-19 payment holidays. This compared with \u00a337 billion (22%) which had requested a payment holiday during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Mortgage growth was driven by the owner occupied portfolio.\n\n- \uf0b7 By value, the proportion of mortgages on interest only and mixed terms (capital and interest only) reduced. This was mainly due to low proportions of buy-to-let and owner occupier interest only new business.\n- \uf0b7 37% of the stock of lending was in Greater London and the South East (2019 - 35%). The average weighted loan-to-value for these regions was 54% (2019 - 52%) compared to all regions 56%.\n- \uf0b7 In the Retail Banking mortgage portfolio, 83% of customer balances were on fixed rates (61% of these on five-year deals). In addition, 99% of all new mortgage completions were fixed rate deals (45% of these on five-year deals).\n- \uf0b7 Unsecured balances declined, with the decrease primarily a result of reductions in overdrafts and credit card utilisation in Retail Banking, following the COVID-19 lockdown. NatWest Group also responded to COVID-19 with a more cautious approach to new lending, to protect NatWest Group and customers from potentially unaffordable borrowing.\n- \uf0b7 As detailed previously, the deteriorated economic outlook, including forecast increases in unemployment and declines in house prices, resulted in an increased ECL requirement.",

legacy portfolios.\n- (2) ECL provisions coverage is ECL provisions divided by mortgages.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 ECL coverage rates increased through the LTV bands with both Retail Banking and Ulster Bank RoI having only limited exposures in the highest LTV bands. The relatively high coverage level in the lowest LTV band for Retail Banking included the effect of timediscounting on expected recoveries. Additionally, this also reflected the modelling approach that recognised an element of expected loss on mortgages that were not subject to formal repossession activity.\n\n- \uf0b7 The deteriorated economic outlook resulted in increased account level IFRS 9 PDs. Consequently, compared to the 2019 year-end, a larger proportion of accounts exhibited a SICR with an associated migration of exposures from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\n\nRisk and capital management",

The sector is reviewed regularly by senior executive committees. Reviews include portfolio credit quality, capital consumption and control frameworks. All disclosures in the CRE section are based on current exposure (gross of provisions and risk transfer). Current exposure is defined as: loans; the amount drawn under a credit facility plus accrued interest; contingent obligations; the issued amount of the guarantee or letter of credit; derivatives - the markto-market value, netted where netting agreements exist and net of legally enforceable collateral.\n\n|                                 | 2020   | 2020   | 2020     | 2020     | 2019   | 2019   | 2019     | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| By geography and sub-sector (1) | UK \u00a3m  | RoI \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | UK \u00a3m  | RoI \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Investment                      |        |        |          |          |        |        |          |          |\n| Residential (2)                 | 4,507  | 360    | 14       | 4,881    | 4,507  | 462    | 27       | 4,996    |\n| Office (3)                      | 3,386  | 226    | 28       | 3,640    | 2,916  | 183    | 83       | 3,182    |\n| Retail (4)                      | 5,423  | 68     | 118      | 5,609    | 5,277  | 63     | 62       | 5,402    |\n| Industrial (5)                  | 2,773  | 18     | 202      | 2,993    | 2,457  | 18     | 115      | 2,590    |\n| Mixed/other (6)                 | 2,688  | 154    | 74       | 2,916    | 3,672  | 187    | 56       | 3,915    |\n|                                 | 18,777 | 826    | 436      | 20,039   | 18,829 | 913    | 343      | 20,085   |\n| Development                     |        |        |          |          |        |        |          |          |\n| Residential (2)                 | 2,685  | 200    | 3        | 2,888    | 2,464  | 165    | 5        | 2,634    |\n| Office (3)                      | 123    | 30     | -        | 153      | 78     | 17     | -        | 95       |\n| Retail (4)                      | 126    | -      | -        | 126      | 134    | 2      | 1        | 137      |\n| Industrial (5)                  | 125    | 2      | -        | 127      | 85     | 2      | -        | 87       |\n| Mixed/other (6)                 | 24     | 2      | -        | 26       | 16     | 2      | -        | 18       |\n|                                 | 3,083  | 234    | 3        | 3,320    | 2,777  | 188    | 6        | 2,971    |\n| Total                           | 21,860 | 1,060  | 439      | 23,359   | 21,606 | 1,101  | 349      | 23,056   |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (1) Geographical splits are based on country of collateral risk.\n- (2) Properties including houses, flats and student accommodation.\n- (3) Properties including offices in central business districts, regional headquarters and business parks.\n- (4) Properties including high street retail, shopping centres, restaurants, bars and gyms.\n- (5) Properties including distribution centres, manufacturing and warehouses.\n- (6) Properties that do not fall within the other categories above.

The low Stage 3 ECL provisions coverage was driven by a single large exposure, which was written down to the expected recoverable amount.\n- (6) Relates to the development of commercial and residential properties. LTV is not a meaningful measure for this type of lending activity.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 Overall - The majority of the CRE portfolio was located and managed in the UK. Business appetite and strategy remained aligned across the segments.\n- \uf0b7 2020 trends - The portfolio remained broadly unchanged in composition although a migration of some assets from the mixed/other sub-sector was noted, following a reclassification carried out during the year. While new activity in 2020 was subdued due to COVID-19, NatWest Group supported existing customers with capital repayment holidays, interest roll-ups and extensions using CRE specific criteria and government backed COVID-19 support schemes. Demand for scheme support reduced in the latter part of the year.\n- \uf0b7 The retail and leisure sectors were heavily affected by the lockdown, resulting in low rental payments, and these sectors remained under stress. The office sector was more resilient overall, albeit the smaller serviced-office sub-sector came under some stress given the short-term nature of income and site closures. Demand for office space in the medium-term was expected to decline, with flexible working trends continuing post COVID-19. Market sentiment remained negative for most retail assets, but there were tentative signs of improvement for retail warehousing (accounting for approximately\n\n15% of the retail sub-sector) where investment in industrial assets was demonstrating increased demand. The residential development sector continued to attract institutional capital and was generally performing well.\n\n- \uf0b7 Credit quality - Despite significant challenges across the CRE sector, with customers utilising COVID-19 related government support measures, Heightened Monitoring inflows by volume were stable. By value however, Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss exposures increased, with a rise of migration into AQ10. This increase was largely due to individually significant names, particularly in the retail sub-sector.\n- \uf0b7 Risk appetite - Appetite in CRE remained cautious. Pre-COVID-19 conservative lending criteria remained in place, including lower leverage required for new London office originations and parts of the retail sector. From January 2021, new minimum standards were introduced for CRE lending appetite for residential new build lending, which requires properties to achieve a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating of B. In addition, standard lending terms for CRE now include NatWest Group's preference for green leases to be used by commercial landlords. Green leases are a mechanism for landlords and tenants to work together to improve the sustainability of a building.\n\nRisk and capital management",

They also show the changes in ECL as well as the changes in related financial assets used in determining ECL. Due to differences in scope, exposures in this section may therefore differ from those reported in other tables, principally in relation to exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. These differences do not have a material ECL impact. Other points to note:\n\n- \uf0b7 Financial assets include treasury liquidity portfolios, comprising balances at central banks and debt securities, as well as loans. Both modelled and non-modelled portfolios are included.\n- \uf0b7 Stage transfers (for example, exposures moving from Stage 1 to Stage 2) are a key feature of the ECL movements, with the net remeasurement cost of transitioning to a worse stage being a primary driver of income statement charges. Similarly, there is an ECL benefit for accounts improving stage.\n- \uf0b7 Changes in risk parameters shows the reassessment of the ECL within a given stage, including any ECL overlays and residual income statement gains or losses at the point of write-off or accounting write-down.\n- \uf0b7 Amounts written-off represent the gross asset written-down against accounts with ECL, including the net asset write-down for any debt sale activity.\n- \uf0b7 There were small ECL flows from Stage 3 to Stage 1. This does not, however, indicate that accounts returned from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly. On a similar basis, there were flows from Stage 1 to Stage 3 including transfers due to unexpected default events. The small number of write-offs in Stage 1 and Stage 2 reflect the effect of portfolio debt sales and also staging at the start of the analysis period.\n- \uf0b7 The effect of any change in PMAs during the year is typically reported under changes in risk parameters, as are any impacts arising from changes to the underlying models. Refer to the section on Governance and post model adjustments for further details.\n- \uf0b7 All movements are captured monthly and aggregated. Interest suspended post default is included within Stage 3 ECL with the movement in the value of suspended interest during the year reported under currency translation and other adjustments.\n- \uf0b7 Other (P&L only items) includes any subsequent changes in the value of written-down assets (for example, fortuitous recoveries) along with other direct write-off items such as direct recovery costs. Other (P&L only items) affects the income statement but does not affect balance sheet ECL movements.\n\n|                                             | Stage 1             | Stage 1   | Stage 2             | Stage 2   | Stage 3             | Stage 3   | Total               | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|\n| NatWest Group total                         | Financial assets \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m    | Financial assets \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m    | Financial assets \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m    | Financial assets \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m  |\n| At 1 January 2020                           | 428,604             | 322       | 28,630              | 752       | 7,135               | 2,718     | 464,369             | 3,792   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments  | 3,334               | 2         | (304)               | 5         | 142                 | 11        | 3,172               | 18      |\n| Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2           | (117,545)           | (581)     | 117,545             | 581       | -                   | -         | -                   | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 1           | 48,342              | 865       | (48,342)            | (865)     | -                   | -         | -                   | -       |\n| Transfers to Stage 3                        | (574)               | (3)       | (3,327)             | (303)     | 3,901               | 306       | -                   | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 3                      | 325                 | 35        | 1,728               | 165       | (2,053)             | (200)     | -                   | -       |\n| Net re-measurement of ECL on stage transfer |                     | (689)     |                     | 2,204     |                     | 493       |                     | 2,008   |\n| Changes in risk parameters (model inputs)   |                     | 366       |                     | 815       |                     | 328       |                     | 1,509   |\n| Other changes in net exposure               | 84,180              | 202       | (14,261)            | (271)     | (1,666)             | (44)      | 68,253              | (113)   |\n| Other (P&L only items)                      |                     | -         |                     | (1)       |                     | (161)     |                     | (162)   |\n| Income statement (releases)/charges         |                     | (121)     |                     | 2,747     |                     | 616       |                     | 3,242   |\n| Amounts written-off                         | -                   | -         | (2)                 | (2)       | (935)               | (935)     | (937)               | (937)   |\n| Unwinding of discount                       |                     | -         |                     | -         |                     | (91)      |                     | (91)    |\n| At 31 December 2020                         | 446,666             | 519       | 81,667              | 3,081     | 6,524               | 2,586     | 534,857             | 6,186   |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 446,147             |           | 78,586              |           | 3,938               |           | 528,671             |         |\n| At 1 January 2019                           | 422,541             | 297       | 27,360              | 772       | 8,251               | 2,782     | 458,152             | 3,851   |\n| 2019 movements                              | 6,063               | 25        | 1,270               | (20)      | (1,116)             | (64)      | 6,217               | (59)    |\n| At 31 December 2019                         | 428,604             | 322       | 28,630              | 752       | 7,135               | 2,718     | 464,369             | 3,792   |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 428,282             |           | 27,878              |           | 4,417               |           | 460,577             |         |",

Stage 1 ECL increased reflecting the economic environment, and also approximately \u00a39 million of ECL resulted from the acquisition of the owner-occupied mortgage portfolio from Metro Bank.\n- \uf0b7 The updated economics also resulted in a net migration of assets from Stage 1 to Stage 2 with a consequent increase from a 12 month ECL to a lifetime ECL. While the granting of a COVID-19 related payment holiday did not automatically trigger a migration to Stage 2, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2 and their ECL uplifted, refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.\n\n- \uf0b7 In Stage 3, reflecting the various customer support mechanisms available, ECL was less affected than in Stage 2. The relatively small ECL cost for net re-measurement on stage transfer included the effect of risk targeted ECL adjustments when previously in Stage 2. Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.\n- \uf0b7 In Stage 3, the ECL cost within changes in risk parameters included the monthly assessment of the loss requirement, capturing underlying portfolio movements.\n- \uf0b7 Write-off occurs once the repossessed property has been sold and there is a residual shortfall balance remaining outstanding. Write-off would typically be within five years from default but can be longer.\n\nRisk and capital management",

While the granting of a COVID-19 related payment holiday did not automatically trigger a migration to Stage 2, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2 and their ECL uplifted, refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.\n\n- \uf0b7 In Stage 3, reflecting the various customer support mechanisms available that mitigated against defaults, ECL was affected relatively less. In addition, debt sales also contributed to a slight ECL reduction year-on-year.\n- \uf0b7 Write-off occurs once recovery activity with the customer has been concluded or there are no further recoveries expected, but no later than six years after default.",

Government support mechanisms continued to suppress a higher level of flows into Stage 3.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 3 recovery values started to show evidence of being negatively affected by deteriorated market conditions, leading to higher ECL charges.\n- \uf0b7 Other changes in net exposures increased in Stage 1 as customers drew down on existing facilities and undertook new lending supported by government schemes.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Consequently, compared to 2019, a larger proportion of accounts exhibited a SICR causing Stage 2 exposures to increase significantly.\n- \uf0b7 In the absence of PD deterioration or other backstop SICR triggers, the granting of a COVID-19 related payment holiday did not automatically result in a migration to Stage 2.\n- \uf0b7 However, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2. For mortgages, in Retail Banking, approximately \u00a31 billion of exposures were collectively migrated from Stage 1 to Stage 2, and approximately \u00a3340 million in Ulster Bank RoI. The impact of collective migrations on unsecured lending was much more limited.\n- \uf0b7 As expected, ECL coverage was higher in accounts that were more than 30 days past due than those in Stage 2 for other reasons.\n\nFinancial\n\n- \uf0b7 There was an increase in flows on to the Risk of Credit Loss framework. However, these were recorded under PD deterioration if the Stage 2 trigger was also met.\n- \uf0b7 In Ulster Bank RoI, approximately \u00a3400 million of exposures relating to small and medium size enterprises were collectively migrated from Stage 1 to Stage 2 reflective of the elevated risk for this sector.\n\n|                                        | Property   | Property   | Corporate   | Corporate   | institutions   | institutions   | Other    | Other   | Total    | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| 2020                                   | Loans \u00a3m   | ECL \u00a3m     | Loans \u00a3m    | ECL \u00a3m      | Loans \u00a3m       | ECL \u00a3m         | Loans \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m  | Loans \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m  |\n| Wholesale                              |            |            |             |             |                |                |          |         |          |         |\n| Currently >30 DPD                      | 136        | 6          | 215         | 28          | 110            | -              | -        | -       | 461      | 34      |\n| Currently <=30 DPD                     | 12,885     | 501        | 27,501      | 1,459       | 3,514          | 90             | 204      | 1       | 44,104   | 2,051   |\n| - PD deterioration                     | 11,765     | 450        | 23,268      | 1,229       | 3,182          | 85             | 97       |         | - 38,312 | 1,764   |\n| - PD persistence                       | 162        | 5          | 623         | 20          | 7              | -              | -        | -       | 792      | 25      |\n| - Other driver (forbearance, RoCL etc) | 958        | 46         | 3,610       | 210         | 325            | 5              | 107      | 1       | 5,000    | 262     |\n| Total Stage 2                          | 13,021     | 507        | 27,716      | 1,487       | 3,624          | 90             | 204      | 1       | 44,565   | 2,085   |\n| 2019                                   |            |            |             |             |                |                |          |         |          |         |\n| Wholesale                              |            |            |             |             |                |                |          |         |          |         |\n| Currently >30 DPD                      | 57         | 2          | 219         | 6           | 7              | -              | -        | -       | 283      | 8       |\n| Currently <=30 DPD                     | 2,523      | 45         | 9,485       | 192         | 539            | 4              | 4        |         | - 12,551 | 241     |\n| - PD deterioration                     | 1,386      | 28         | 6,083       | 144         | 368            | 3              | 3        | -       | 7,840    | 175     |\n| - PD persistence                       | 45         | 1          | 183         | 5           | 2              | -              | -        | -       | 230      | 6       |\n| - Other driver (forbearance, RoCL etc) | 1,092      | 16         | 3,219       | 43          | 169            | 1              | 1        | -       | 4,481    | 60      |\n| Total Stage 2                          | 2,580      | 47         | 9,704       | 198         | 546            | 4              | 4        |         | - 12,834 | 249     |\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The deteriorated economic outlook due to COVID-19, including significant reductions in GDP and commercial real estate valuations, resulted in increased IFRS 9 PDs.

There was also a collective migration of a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk.\n- \uf0b7 The increase in exposures in Stage 2 due to persistence, primarily within UK mortgages, reflected the slight reduction in PDs arising from the relative improvement in the multiple economic scenarios in the second half of the year compared to the mid-year point; exposures cannot migrate back to Stage 1 until their PD has been back within the criteria threshold for three consecutive months.\n\n- \uf0b7 High risk back-stops, for example, forbearance and adverse credit bureau, provide additional valuable discrimination. However, with a larger proportion of exposures triggering PD deterioration following the deteriorated economic outlook, the proportion of accounts triggering high risk backstops alone decreased.\n\nRisk and capital management",

As the economic outlook deteriorated, it accounted for a higher proportion of the balances migrated to Stage 2.\n- \uf0b7 Moving exposures on to the Risk of Credit Loss framework remained an important backstop indicator of a SICR. The exposures classified under the Stage 2 Risk of Credit Loss framework trigger decreased over the period as more exposures were captured under the PD deterioration Stage 2 trigger.\n- \uf0b7 PD persistence relates to the business banking portfolio only, with the reason for the year-on-year increase the same as described above for the Personal portfolio.\n\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group continued to appraise its IFRS 9 SICR rules in the context of effectiveness, volatility and industry consistency. The recent PD driven increase in Stage 2 exposures in the Wholesale portfolio, highlighted the gradual diminished impact on ECL of the threshold for better quality portfolios under stress, suggesting possible conservatism in the SICR rules for these portfolios. As an illustration, an increase of the de minimus PD threshold to 0.75% (from 0.1%) in the SICR rules could decrease the Wholesale portfolio Stage 2 exposure by 11% with only a four basis point reduction on good book ECL coverage.",

When customers continue to engage constructively with NatWest Group, making regular payments, NatWest Group continues to support them. NatWest Group's provisioning approach retains customers in Stage 3 for a life-time loss provisioning calculation, even when their arrears status reverts to below 90 days past due.\n- \uf0b7 Wholesale - The increase in the proportion of loans in Stage 3 for less than one year was mainly due to individually large exposures within the CRE sector, which were new into Stage 3. Exposures which were in Stage 3 for in excess of five years were mainly related to customers being in a protracted formal insolvency process or subject to litigation or a complaints process.\n\n## Asset quality\n\nThe table below shows asset quality bands of gross loans and ECL, by stage, for the Personal portfolio.\n\n|                | Gross loans Stage 3   | Gross loans Stage 3   | Gross loans Stage 3   | Gross loans Stage 3   | ECL provisions   | ECL provisions   | ECL provisions   | ECL provisions   | ECL provisions coverage Stage 2 Stage 3 Total % % %   | ECL provisions coverage Stage 2 Stage 3 Total % % %   | ECL provisions coverage Stage 2 Stage 3 Total % % %   | ECL provisions coverage Stage 2 Stage 3 Total % % %   |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020           | Stage 1 \u00a3m            | Stage 2 \u00a3m            | \u00a3m                    | Total \u00a3m              | Stage 1 \u00a3m       | Stage 2 \u00a3m       | Stage 3 \u00a3m       | Total \u00a3m         | Stage 1 %                                             |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |\n| UK mortgages   |                       |                       |                       |                       |                  |                  |                  |                  |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |\n| AQ1-AQ4        | 108,869               | 6,634                 |                       | -

As expected, mortgage exposures had a higher proportion in AQ1-AQ4 than unsecured borrowing.\n\n- \uf0b7 The high level of Stage 3 impaired assets (AQ10) in RoI mortgages, reflected the legacy mortgage portfolio and the residual effects from the global financial crisis. The reduction in the year was a result of deleveraging through the execution of a portfolio sale agreed in 2019 and improvements in the portfolio.\n- \uf0b7 In other personal, the relatively high level of exposures in AQ10 reflected that impaired assets can be held on the balance sheet, with commensurate ECL provision, for up to six years after default.\n- \uf0b7 ECL provisions coverage showed the expected trend with increased coverage in the poorer asset quality bands, and also by stage.",

For further details, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 section.\n- \uf0b7 ECL provisions coverage showed the expected trend with increased coverage in the poorer asset quality bands, and also by stage.\n- \uf0b7 The relatively low provision coverage for Stage 3 loans in the property sector reflected the secured nature of the exposures.\n\n## Credit risk Trading activities\n\nThis section details the credit risk profile of NatWest Group's trading activities.\n\n## Securities financing transactions and collateral\n\nThe table below shows securities funding transactions in NatWest Markets and Treasury.

Exposures comprise loans and advances, including finance leases and instalment credit receivables, and other monetary assets, such as debt securities. The geographical breakdown is based on the country of domicile of the borrower or guarantor of ultimate risk. Cross border exposures include non-local currency claims of overseas offices on local residents but exclude exposures to local residents in local currencies. The table shows cross border exposures greater than 0.5% of NatWest Group's total assets.\n\n| 2020             | Government \u00a3m   | Banks \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   | Short positions \u00a3m   | Net of short  positions \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Western Europe   | 23,651          | 9,232      | 21,091     | 53,974     | 18,756               | 35,218                       |\n| Of which: France | 5,098           | 1,574      | 6,270      | 12,942     | 2,465                | 10,477                       |\n| Germany          | 4,913           | 4,020      | 2,343      | 11,276     | 3,833                | 7,443                        |\n| Italy            | 4,985           | 319        | 791        | 6,095      | 3,583                | 2,512                        |\n| Spain            | 2,980           | 731        | 1,120      | 4,831      | 3,773                | 1,058                        |\n| United States    | 12,430          | 4,316      | 7,186      | 23,932     | 1,239                | 22,693                       |\n| 2019             |                 |            |            |            |                      |                              |\n| Western Europe   | 21,646          | 8,989      | 23,490     | 54,125     | 14,370               | 39,755                       |\n| Of which: France | 3,097           | 1,943      | 4,365      | 9,405      | 2,497                | 6,908                        |\n| Germany          | 6,597           | 3,903      | 1,270      | 11,770     | 2,371                | 9,399                        |\n| Italy            | 3,757           | 532        | 880        | 5,169      | 3,642                | 1,527                        |\n| Luxembourg       | 4               | 38         | 4,592      | 4,634      | 2                    | 4,632                        |\n| Netherlands      | 971             | 626        | 5,692      | 7,289      | 541                  | 6,748                        |\n| Spain            | 2,410           | 260        | 1,410      | 4,080      | 2,493                | 1,587                        |\n| United States    | 14,441          | 5,754      | 7,974      | 28,169     | 1,483                | 26,686                       |\n| Japan            | 2,722           | 2,685      | 302        | 5,709      | 12                   | 5,697                        |\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk\n\nNatWest Group continually ensures a comprehensive approach is taken to the management of capital, liquidity and funding, underpinned by frameworks, risk appetite and policies, to manage and mitigate capital, liquidity and funding risks. The framework ensures the tools and capability are in place to facilitate the management and mitigation of risk ensuring NatWest Group operates within its regulatory requirements and risk appetite.\n\n## Definitions\n\nRegulatory capital consists of reserves and instruments issued, have a degree of permanency and are capable of absorbing losses. A number of strict conditions set by regulators must be satisfied to be eligible as capital.\n\nCapital adequacy risk is the risk that there is or will be insufficient capital and other loss-absorbing debt instruments to operate effectively including meeting minimum regulatory requirements, operating within Board approved risk appetite and supporting its strategic goals.\n\nLiquidity consists of assets that can be readily converted to cash within a short timeframe at a reliable value. Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when they fall due.\n\nFunding consists of on-balance sheet liabilities that are used to provide cash to finance assets. Funding risk is the risk of not maintaining a diversified, stable and cost-effective funding base.\n\nLiquidity and funding risks arise in a number of ways, including through the maturity transformation role that banks perform. The risks are dependent on factors such as:\n\n- \uf0b7 Maturity profile;\n- \uf0b7 Composition of sources and uses of funding;\n- \uf0b7 The quality and size of the liquidity portfolio;\n- \uf0b7 Wholesale market conditions; and\n- \uf0b7 Depositor and investor behaviour.\n\n## Sources of risk Capital\n\nThe eligibility of instruments and financial resources as regulatory capital is laid down by applicable regulation. Capital is categorised under two tiers (Tier 1 and Tier 2) according to the ability to absorb losses, degree of permanency and the ranking of absorbing losses on either a going or gone concern basis. There are three broad categories of capital across these two tiers:\n\n- \uf0b7 CET1 capital. CET1 capital must be perpetual and capable of unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur. This includes ordinary shares issued and retained earnings.\n- \uf0b7 Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital. This is the second type of loss absorbing capital and must be capable of absorbing losses on a going concern basis. These instruments are either written down or converted into CET1 capital when the CET1 ratio falls below a prespecified level.\n- \uf0b7 Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is NatWest Group's supplementary capital and provides loss absorption on a gone concern basis. Tier 2 capital absorbs losses after Tier 1 capital. It typically consists of subordinated debt securities with a minimum maturity of five years.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nIn addition to capital, other specific loss-absorbing instruments, including senior notes issued by NatWest Group, may be used to cover certain gone concern capital requirements which, is referred to as MREL. Gone concern refers to the situation in which resources must be available to enable an orderly resolution, in the event that the Bank of England (BoE) deems that NatWest Group has failed or is likely to fail.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nNatWest Group maintains a prudent approach to the definition of liquidity resources. NatWest Group manages its liquidity to ensure it is always available when and where required, taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints. Following ring-fencing legislation, liquidity is no longer considered fungible across NatWest Group. Principal liquidity portfolios are maintained in the UK Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (UK DoLSub) (primarily in NatWest Bank Plc), UBI DAC, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International Limited and NWM N.V.. Some disclosures in this section where relevant are presented, on a consolidated basis, for NatWest Group, the UK DoLSub and on a solo basis for NatWest Markets Plc.\n\nLiquidity resources are divided into primary and secondary liquidity as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 Primary liquid assets include cash and balances at central banks, Treasury bills and other high quality government and supranational securities.\n- \uf0b7 Secondary liquid assets are eligible as collateral for local central bank liquidity facilities. These assets include own-issued securitisations or whole loans that are retained on balance sheet and pre-positioned with a central bank so that they may be converted into additional sources of liquidity at very short notice.\n\n## Funding\n\nNatWest Group maintains a diversified set of funding sources, including customer deposits, wholesale deposits and term debt issuance. NatWest Group also retains access to central bank funding facilities.\n\nFor further details on capital constituents and the regulatory framework covering capital, liquidity and funding requirements, please refer to the NatWest Group Pillar 3 Report 2020 Capital, liquidity and funding section.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk continued Capital management\n\nCapital management ensures that there is sufficient capital and other loss-absorbing instruments to operate effectively including meeting minimum regulatory requirements, operating within Board-approved risk appetite, maintaining its credit rating and supporting its strategic goals.\n\nCapital management is critical in supporting the businesses and is enacted through an end-to-end framework across businesses and the legal entities. Capital is managed within the organisation at the following levels; NatWest Group consolidated, NWH Group sub consolidated, NatWest Markets Plc, NatWest Markets N.V. and RBS International Limited. The subsidiaries within NWH Group are governed by the same principles, processes and management as NatWest Group. Note that although the aforementioned entities are regulated in line with Basel III principles, local implementation of the framework differs across geographies.\n\nCapital planning is integrated into NatWest Group's wider annual budgeting process and is assessed and updated at least monthly. Regular returns are submitted to the PRA which include a two-year rolling forecast view. Other elements of capital management, including risk appetite and stress testing, are set out on pages 160 and 161.\n\n## Produce capital plans\n\n## Assess capital adequacy\n\n## Inform capital actions\n\n- \uf0b7 Capital plans are produced for NatWest Group, its key operating entities and its businesses over a five year planning horizon under expected and stress conditions. Stressed capital plans are produced to support internal stress testing in the ICAAP for regulatory purposes.\n- \uf0b7 Shorter term forecasts are developed frequently in response to actual performance, changes in internal and external business environment and to manage risks and opportunities.\n- \uf0b7 Capital plans are developed to maintain capital of sufficient quantity and quality to support NatWest Group's business, its subsidiaries and strategic plans over the planning horizon within approved risk appetite, as determined via stress testing, and minimum regulatory requirements.\n- \uf0b7 Capital resources and capital requirements are assessed across a defined planning horizon.\n- \uf0b7 Impact assessment captures input from across NatWest Group including from businesses.\n- \uf0b7 Capital planning informs potential capital actions including buy backs, redemptions, dividends and new issuance to external investors or via internal transactions.\n- \uf0b7 Decisions on capital actions will be influenced by strategic and regulatory requirements, risk appetite, costs and prevailing market conditions.\n- \uf0b7 As part of capital planning, NatWest Group will monitor its portfolio of external capital securities and assess the optimal blend and most cost effective means of financing.\n\nCapital planning is one of the tools that NatWest Group uses to monitor and manage capital risk on a going and gone concern basis, including the risk of excessive leverage.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages its liquidity risk taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints to ensure sufficient liquidity is available where required to cover liquidity stresses. The principal levels at which liquidity risk is managed are:\n\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Holdings Group\n- \uf0b7 UK DoLSub\n- \uf0b7 UBI DAC\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Markets Plc\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Markets Securities Inc.\n- \uf0b7 RBS International Limited\n- \uf0b7 NWM N.V.\n\nThe UK DoLSub is PRA regulated and comprises NatWest Group's four licensed deposit-taking UK banks: National Westminster Bank Plc (NWB Plc), The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc), Coutts & Company and Ulster Bank Limited.\n\nNatWest Group categorises its liquidity portfolio, including its locally managed liquidity portfolios, into primary and secondary liquid assets. The size of the liquidity portfolios are determined by referencing NatWest Group's liquidity risk appetite. NatWest Group retains a prudent approach to setting the composition of the liquidity portfolios, which is subject to internal policies applicable to all entities and limits over quality of counterparty, maturity mix and currency mix.\n\nRBS International Limited, NWM N.V. and UBI DAC hold locally managed portfolios that comply with local regulations that may differ from PRA rules.\n\nThe liquidity value of the portfolio is determined by taking current market prices and applying a discount or haircut, to give a liquidity value that represents the amount of cash that can be generated by the asset.\n\n## Funding risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages funding risk through a comprehensive framework which measures and monitors the funding risk on the balance sheet including quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities as well as the funding concentration.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk continued Relief measures\n\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 during the year was significant. While liquidity, capital and funding were closely monitored throughout, NatWest Group benefited from its strong positions - particularly in relation to CET1 - going into the crisis. Prudent risk management continues to be important as the full economic effects of the global pandemic unfold.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, a number of relief measures to alleviate the financial stability impact have been announced and recommended by regulatory and supervisory bodies. One significant announcement in the year was on 26 June when the European Parliament passed an amended regulation to the CRR in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ('the CRR COVID-19 amendment'); NatWest Group has applied a number of the CRR amendments for FY 2020 reporting. The impact on capital and leverage of the CRR amendment and other relief measures are set out below.\n\n- \uf0b7 CRR Leverage exposure - The CRR COVID-19 amendment accelerated a change in CRR2 to allow the netting of regular-way purchase and sales settlement balances. NatWest Group has applied this, and it has reduced the CRR leverage exposure by c.\u00a32.3 billion.\n- \uf0b7 Infrastructure and SME RWA supporting factors - The CRR COVID-19 amendment allowed an acceleration of the planned changes to the SME supporting factor and the introduction of an Infrastructure supporting factor. NatWest Group has implemented these beneficial changes to supporting factors which have reduced RWAs by c.\u00a31 billion for SMEs and c.\u00a30.9 billion for Infrastructure.\n- \uf0b7 Prudential Valuation Adjustment (PVA) - The European Commission amended the prudent valuation Regulatory Technical Standard such that, due to the exceptional levels of market volatility, the aggregation factor was increased from 50% to 66% until 31 December 2020 inclusive. This has reduced NatWest Group's PVA deduction by c.\u00a3120 million.\n- \uf0b7 IFRS 9 Transition - NatWest Group has elected to take advantage of the transitional regulatory capital rules in respect of expected credit losses following the adoption of IFRS 9; it had previously had a negligible impact up to Q4 2019. The CRR COVID-19 amendment now requires a full CET1 addback for the movement in stage 1 and stage 2 ECL from 1 January 2020 for the next two years. The IFRS 9 transitional arrangement impact on NatWest Group CET1 regulatory capital at 31 December 2020 is \u00a31.7 billion. \uf0b7 \uf0b7\n- \uf0b7 UK Leverage exposure - The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced the ability for firms to apply for a modification by consent to permit the netting of regular-way purchase and sales settlement balances. The PRA also offered a further modification that gave an exclusion from the UK Leverage Exposure for Bounce Back Loans (BBL) and other 100% guaranteed government COVID-19 lending schemes.  NatWest Group has received permission to apply these and it has reduced the UK leverage exposure by c.\u00a32.3 billion and \u00a38.3 billion respectively.\n\n- Market Risk Value-at-risk (VaR) model capital multiplier - the CRR COVID-19 amendment allowed for back-testing exceptions due to the exceptional levels of market volatility caused by COVID-19 to be excluded from the capital multiplier. This approach resulted in c.\u00a31.4 billion benefit.\n- Capital buffers - Many countries announced reductions in their countercyclical capital buffer rates in response to COVID-19. Most notably for NatWest Group, the Financial Policy Committee reduced the UK rate from 1% to 0% effective from 11 March 2020. The CBI also announced a reduction of the Republic of Ireland rate from 1% to 0% effective from 1 April 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Software Assets - The CRR COVID-19 amendment accelerated the change to the regulatory treatment of software assets so this revision came in prior to the year end. The change introduces the concept of prudential amortisation for software assets so that unamortised software is no longer deducted from CET1. By applying this amendment the impact to NatWest Group is an increase of 23 bps to CET1 and an 8 bps increase to the UK leverage ratio.",

Note that different capital requirements apply to individual legal entities or sub-groups and that the table shown does not reflect any incremental PRA buffer requirements, which are not disclosable.\n\nThe current capital position provides significant headroom above both our minimum requirements and our MDA threshold requirements.\n\n| Type                               | CET1   | Total Tier 1   | Total capital   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Pillar 1 requirements              | 4.5%   | 6.0%           | 8.0%            |\n| Pillar 2A requirements             | 1.9%   | 2.6%           | 3.4%            |\n| Minimum Capital Requirements       | 6.4%   | 8.6%           | 11.4%           |\n| Capital conservation buffer        | 2.5%   | 2.5%           | 2.5%            |\n| Countercyclical capital buffer (1) | -      | -              | -               |\n| G-SIB buffer (2)                   | -      | -              | -               |\n| MDA Threshold (3)                  | 8.9%   | n/a            | n/a             |\n| Subtotal                           | 8.9%   | 11.1%          | 13.9%           |\n| Capital ratios at 31 December 2020 | 18.5%  | 21.4%          | 24.5%           |\n| Headroom (4)                       | 9.6%   | 10.3%          | 10.6%           |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (3) Pillar 2A requirements for NatWest Group are set on a nominal capital basis which result in an implied 8.9% MDA.\n- (4) The headroom does not reflect excess distributable capital and may vary over time.\n\n## Leverage ratios\n\nThe table below summarises the minimum ratios of capital to leverage exposure under the binding PRA UK leverage framework applicable for NatWest Group.\n\n| Type                                      | CET1    | Total Tier 1   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Minimum ratio                             | 2.4375% | 3.2500%        |\n| Countercyclical leverage ratio buffer (1) | -       | -              |\n| Total                                     | 2.4375% | 3.2500%        |\n\n## Notes:\n\n## Liquidity and funding ratios\n\nThe table below summarises the minimum requirements for key liquidity and funding metrics, under the relevant legislative framework.\n\nType\n\n| Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)      | 100%   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) (1) | -      |\n\n## Note:",

has elected to take advantage of the transitional regulatory capital rules in respect of expected credit losses following the adoption of IFRS 9, it had previously had a negligible impact up to Q4 2019. The CRR COVID-19 amendment now requires a full CET1 addback for the movement in stage 1 and stage 2 ECL from 1 January 2020 for the next two years. The IFRS 9 transitional arrangement impact on NatWest Group CET1 regulatory capital at 31 December 2020 is \u00a31.7 billion.\n\n- \uf0b7 Cancellation of 2019 dividends and associated pension contribution offset by the inclusion of the 2020 foreseeable dividends and charges resulted in an increase in CET1 of \u00a30.7 billion.\n- \uf0b7 The implementation of CRR2 amended Article 36 for the prudential treatment of software assets has resulted in an increase to CET1 of \u00a30.5 billion.\n- \uf0b7 Foreign exchange movements include a \u00a30.4 billion charge, in relation to a $2 billion AT1 redemption announcement on 28 June 2020.\n\nRisk and capital management",

In practice, the behavioural profiles of many liabilities show greater stability and longer maturity than the contractual maturity. This is particularly true of many types of retail and corporate deposits which, despite being repayable on demand or at short notice, have demonstrated very stable characteristics even in periods of acute stress.\n\nIn its analysis to assess and manage asset and liability maturity gaps, NatWest Group determines the expected customer behaviour through qualitative and quantitative techniques. These incorporate observed customer behaviours over long periods of time. This analysis is subject to governance through NatWest Group ALCo Technical committee down to a segment level.\n\nThe net behavioural funding surplus/(gap) and contractual maturity analysis is set out below.\n\n|                                   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Contractual maturity (1)   | Behavioural maturity      | Behavioural maturity      | Behavioural maturity      | Behavioural maturity      |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                   | Loans to customers         | Loans to customers         | Loans to customers         | Loans to customers         | Customer accounts          | Customer accounts          | Customer accounts          | Customer accounts          | Net funding surplus/(gap)  | Net funding surplus/(gap)  | Net funding surplus/(gap)  | Net funding surplus/(gap)  | Net surplus/(gap) Greater | Net surplus/(gap) Greater | Net surplus/(gap) Greater | Net surplus/(gap) Greater |\n|                                   | Less than                  |                            | Greater                    |                            | Less than                  |                            | Greater                    |                            | Less                       |                            | Greater than               |                            | Less than                 |                           | than                      |                           |\n|                                   | 1 year                     | 1-5 years                  | than 5 years               | Total                      | 1 year                     | 1-5 years                  | than 5 years               | Total                      | than 1 year                | 1-5 years                  | 5 years                    | Total                      | 1 year                    | 1-5 years                 | 5 years                   | Total                     |\n| 2020                              | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                        | \u00a3bn                       | \u00a3bn                       | \u00a3bn                       | \u00a3bn                       |\n| Retail Banking                    | 12                         | 37                         | 123                        | 172                        | 171                        | 1                          | -

Non-traded and traded market risk exposures are managed and discussed separately. The non-traded market risk section begins below. The traded market risk section begins on page 236. Pensionrelated activities also give rise to market risk. Refer to page 240 for more information on risk related to pensions.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\n## Definition\n\nNon-traded market risk is the risk to the value of assets or liabilities outside the trading book, or the risk to income, that arises from changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, or from changes in managed rates.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nThe key sources of non-traded market risk are interest rate risk; credit spread risk; foreign exchange risk; equity risk; and accounting volatility risk.\n\nEach of these risk types are largely managed separately. For detailed qualitative and quantitative information on each of them, refer to the separate sub-sections following the VaR table below.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 The outbreak of COVID-19 triggered exceptional volatility in nontraded market risk factors in March 2020 and a global sell-off across all asset classes. This notably affected credit spreads (the spread between bond yield and swap rates) arising from the liquidity portfolios held by Treasury and resulted in a sharp increase in total non-traded VaR for 2020.\n- \uf0b7 During 2020, the Bank of England signalled a negative UK base rate as a possibility. This could have an adverse impact on NatWest Group's earnings, primarily because it could result in: (i) a lower yield on the structural hedge; and (ii) a narrower margin between loan and deposit rates. The impact on earnings of a downward shift resulting in a negative base rate is discussed on page 232.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\n## Non-traded internal VaR (1-day 99%)\n\nThe following table shows one-day internal banking book value-at-risk (VaR) at a 99% confidence level, split by risk type. NatWest Group's VaR metrics are explained on page 231. Each of the key risk types are discussed in greater detail in their individual sub-sections following this table.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n|                                  | Average  \u00a3m   | Maximum  \u00a3m   | Minimum  \u00a3m   |   Period end \u00a3m | Average \u00a3m   | Maximum \u00a3m   | Minimum \u00a3m   | Period end \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Interest rate                    | 14.1          | 17.7          | 8.0           |            12.3 | 11.0         | 14.0         | 8.0          | 8.2             |\n| Euro                             | 1.9           | 4.6           | 1.1           |             4.6 | 1.3          | 2.3          | 0.7          | 1.3             |\n| Sterling                         | 13.3          | 20.1          | 6.6           |            14.1 | 10.8         | 14.1         | 8.0          | 8.0             |\n| US dollar                        | 10.7          | 16.5          | 5.9           |             8.7 | 4.6          | 6.0          | 3.4          | 5.2             |\n| Other                            | 0.6           | 0.9           | 0.3           |             0.3 | 0.4          | 0.7          | 0.2          | 0.7             |\n| Credit spread                    | 103.2         | 121.1         | 63.7          |           111.5 | 55.6         | 59.7         | 49.2         | 59.7            |\n| Structural foreign exchange rate | 10.8          | 14.7          | 9.1           |             8.9 | 15.2         | 23.8         | 7.2          | 8.6             |\n| Equity                           | 28.5          | 35.4          | 24.9          |            11.6 | 34.5         | 38.6         | 31.6         | 33.5            |\n| Pipeline risk (1)                | 0.5           | 0.7           | 0.3           |             0.3 | 0.4          | 0.9          | 0.2          | 0.2             |\n| Diversification (2)              | (18.9)        |               |               |             4.2 | (57.1)       |              |              | (45.6)          |\n| Total                            | 138.2         | 159.9         | 70.8          |           148.8 | 59.6         | 64.6         | 48.1         | 64.6            |\n\n## Notes:\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The increase in credit spread and total VaR reflects the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19, as explained in 'Key developments in 2020' above.\n\n- \uf0b7 The five-year sterling interest rate swap rate fell to 0.08% at 31 December 2020 from 0.81% at 31 December 2019. The corresponding ten-year rate fell to 0.26% from 0.93%. The structural hedge provides some protection against volatility in interest rates. As a result, the move in the structural hedge yield over the same period was less material, falling to 1.06% from 1.20%.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group continued to make progress on the transition from LIBOR to alternative risk-free rates. An increasing proportion of structural hedges and hedges of other portfolios are written against swaps linked to SONIA, instead of LIBOR.\n- \uf0b7 Sterling strengthened against the US dollar and weakened against the euro over the period. Against the dollar, sterling was 1.37 at 31 December 2020 compared to 1.32 at 31 December 2019. Against the euro, it was 1.11 at 31 December 2020 compared to 1.18 at 31 December 2019. Structural foreign currency exposures increased, in sterling equivalent terms, by \u00a349 million over the period.\n\n## Governance\n\nResponsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from non-trading activities lies with the relevant business. Oversight is provided by the independent Risk function.\n\nRisk positions are reported monthly to the Executive Risk Committee and quarterly to the Board Risk Committee, as well as to the Asset & Liability Management Committee (monthly in the case of interest rate, credit spread and accounting volatility risks and quarterly in the case of foreign exchange and equity risks). Market risk policy statements set out the governance and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite is set out in the non-traded market risk appetite statement.\n\nIts quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of value-at-risk (VaR), stressed value-at-risk (SVaR), sensitivity and stress limits, and earnings-at-risk limits.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments. To ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers at NatWest Group and lower levels have been set and are actively managed. For further information on risk appetite and risk controls, refer to page 160.\n\n- \uf0b7 The decrease in equity VaR reflects the disposal of SABB in Q4 2020.",

When aggregated, these products form portfolios of assets and liabilities with varying degrees of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Mismatches can give rise to volatility in net interest income as interest rates vary.\n\nNTIRR comprises the following three primary risk types:\n\n- \uf0b7 Gap risk - arises from the timing of rate changes in non-trading book instruments. The extent of gap risk depends on whether changes to the term structure of interest rates occur consistently across the yield curve (parallel risk) or differentially by period (nonparallel risk).\n- \uf0b7 Basis risk - captures the impact of relative changes in interest rates for financial instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices, or on the same interest rate indices but with different tenors.\n- \uf0b7 Option risk - arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in assets, liabilities and/or off-balance sheet items, where NatWest Group or its customer can alter the level and timing of their cash flows. Option risk also includes pipeline risk.\n\nTo manage exposures within its risk appetite, NatWest Group aggregates interest rate positions and hedges its residual exposure, primarily with interest rate swaps.\n\nStructural hedging aims to reduce gap risk and the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate shocks. It also provides some protection against prolonged periods of falling rates. Structural hedging is explained in greater detail below, followed by information on how NatWest Group measures NTIRR from both an economic value-based and an earnings-based perspective.\n\n## Structural hedging\n\nNatWest Group has a significant pool of stable, non and low interest-bearing liabilities, principally comprising equity and money transmission accounts. These balances are usually hedged, either by investing directly in longer-term fixed-rate assets (such as fixed-rate mortgages or UK government gilts) or by using interest rate swaps, which are generally booked as cash flow hedges of floating-rate assets, in order to provide a consistent and predictable revenue stream.\n\nAfter hedging the net interest rate exposure externally, NatWest Group allocates income to equity or products in structural hedges by reference to the relevant interest rate swap curve. Over time, this approach has provided a basis for stable income attribution to products and interest rate returns. The programme aims to track a time series of medium-term swap rates, but the yield will be affected by changes in product volumes and NatWest Group's capital composition.\n\nThe table below shows the incremental income allocation above three-month LIBOR, total income allocation including three-month LIBOR, the period end and average notional balances, and the total yield including three-month LIBOR associated with the structural hedges managed by NatWest Group.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n|                            |                       |                 |                         |                      |               | Average Total         | Average Total   | Average Total           | Average Total   | Average Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                            | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | Average notional \u00a3bn | Total yield % | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | notional \u00a3bn    | yield %         |\n| Equity structural hedging  | 478                   | 580             | 23                      | 24                   | 2.43          | 399                   | 644             | 25                      | 27              | 2.36            |\n| Product structural hedging | 543                   | 958             | 125                     | 115                  | 0.83          | 183                   | 1,094           | 111                     | 111             | 0.99            |\n| Other structural hedges    | 119                   | 150             | 21                      | 20                   | 0.73          | 61                    | 166             | 21                      | 21              | 0.79            |\n| Total                      | 1,140                 | 1,688           | 169                     | 159                  | 1.06          | 643                   | 1,904           | 157                     | 159             | 1.20            |\n\nEquity structural hedges refer to income allocated primarily to equity and reserves. At 31 December 2020, the equity structural hedge notional was allocated between NWH Group and NWM Plc in a ratio of approximately 80/20 respectively. Rates on new equity structural hedges continued to fall, but the reduction in the hedge notional has resulted in a higher overall yield.\n\nProduct structural hedges refer to income allocated to customer products by NWH Treasury, mainly current accounts and customer deposits in Commercial Banking and Retail Banking (excluding Ulster Bank Limited). Other structural hedges refer to hedges managed by UBI DAC, Private Banking, Ulster Bank Limited and RBS International.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, approximately 92% by notional of total structural hedges were sterling-denominated.\n\nThe following table presents the incremental income associated with product structural hedges at segment level.\n\n|                    |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Retail Banking     |       251 |        85 |\n| Commercial Banking |       292 |        98 |\n| Total              |       543 |       183 |\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The five-year sterling swap rate fell to 0.08% at the end of December 2020 from 0.81% at the end of December 2019. The tenyear sterling swap rate also fell, to 0.26% from 0.93%.\n- \uf0b7 The yield of the structural hedge fell as new product hedges and maturing hedges across the portfolio are reinvested at lower market rates. At 1.06%, the overall yield was still higher than market swap rates at 31 December 2020.\n\n- \uf0b7 The increase in hedge notional, on a period-end basis, mainly resulted from increased hedging of Personal and Commercial deposits. This reflected the increase in underlying customer deposit balances in 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Incremental income in excess of three-month LIBOR increased in 2020. This was primarily due to lower three-month LIBOR fixings, resulting in increased income benefit from the hedge.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Value-based approaches measure the change in value of the balance sheet assets and liabilities including all cash flows. Earnings-based approaches measure the potential impact on the income statement of changes in interest rates over a defined horizon, generally one to three years.\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR as its value-based approach and sensitivity of net interest earnings as its earnings-based approach.\n\nThese two approaches provide complementary views of the impact of interest rate risk on the balance sheet at a point in time. The scenarios employed in the net interest earnings sensitivity approach may incorporate assumptions about how NatWest Group and its customers will respond to a change in the level of interest rates. In contrast, the VaR approach measures the sensitivity of the balance sheet at a point in time. Capturing all cash flows, VaR also highlights the impact of duration and repricing risks beyond the one-to-three-year period shown in earnings sensitivity calculations.\n\n## Value-at-risk\n\nVaR is a statistical estimate of the potential change in the market value of a portfolio (and, thus, the impact on the income statement) over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.\n\nNatWest Group's standard VaR metrics - which assume a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99% - are based on interest rate repricing gaps at the reporting date. Daily rate moves are modelled using observations from the last 500 business days. These incorporate customer products plus associated funding and hedging transactions as well as non-financial assets and liabilities. Behavioural assumptions are applied as appropriate.\n\nThe non-traded interest rate risk VaR metrics for NatWest Group's retail and commercial banking activities are included in the banking book VaR table presented earlier in this section. The VaR captures the risk resulting from mismatches in the repricing dates of assets and liabilities.\n\nIt also includes any mismatch between the maturity profile of external hedges and NatWest Group's target maturity profile for the hedge.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Non-traded market risk continued Sensitivity of net interest earnings\n\nNet interest earnings are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates, mainly because maturing structural hedges are replaced at higher or lower rates and changes to coupons on managed rate customer products do not always match changes in market rates of interest or central bank policy rates.\n\nEarnings sensitivity is derived from a market-implied forward rate curve. A simple scenario is shown that projects forward earnings based on the 31 December 2020 balance sheet, which is assumed to remain constant. A base-case earnings forecast is derived from the market-implied curve, which is then subject to interest rate shocks. The difference between the base-case forecast and the shock gives an indication of underlying sensitivity to interest rate movements.\n\n## Three-year 25-basis-point sensitivity table\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of net interest earnings - for both structural hedges and managed rate accounts - on a one, two and three-year forward-looking basis to an upward or downward interest rate shift of 25 basis points.\n\nIn the upward rate scenario, yield curves were assumed to move in parallel, at both year-ends.\n\nThe downward rate scenario at 31 December 2020 allows interest rates to fall to negative rates. The downward rate scenario at 31 December 2019 assumed that interest rates would floor at 0%, or the then negative rate. This assumption affected only euro, not sterling or US dollar, interest rates.\n\nReported sensitivities should not be considered a forecast of future performance in these rate scenarios. Actions that could reduce interest earnings sensitivity include changes in pricing strategies on customer loans and deposits as well as hedging. Management action may also be taken to stabilise total income also taking into account non-interest income.\n\n|                   | +25 basis points upward shift   | +25 basis points upward shift   | +25 basis points upward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2020              | Year 1  \u00a3m                      | Year 2 (1) \u00a3m                   | Year 3 (1) \u00a3m                   | Year 1  \u00a3m                        | Year 2 (1) \u00a3m                     | Year 3 (1) \u00a3m                     |\n| Structural hedges | 37                              | 118                             | 199                             | (37)                              | (118)                             | (199)                             |\n| Managed margin    | 319                             | 380                             | 387                             | (258)                             | (285)                             | (292)                             |\n| Other             | 15                              |                                 |                                 | (20)                              |                                   |                                   |\n| Total             | 371                             | 498                             | 586                             | (315)                             | (403)                             | (491)                             |\n| 2019              |                                 |                                 |                                 |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Structural hedges | 31                              | 97                              | 168                             | (27)                              | (90)                              | (154)                             |\n| Managed margin    | 195                             | 195                             | 196                             | (158)                             | (127)                             | (128)                             |\n| Other             | (14)                            |                                 |                                 | 15                                |                                   |                                   |\n| Total             | 212                             | 292                             | 364                             | (170)                             | (217)                             | (282)                             |\n\n## Note:\n\n(1) The projections for Year 2 and Year 3 consider only the main drivers of earnings sensitivity, namely structural hedging and margin management.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The increased favourable sensitivity to the 25-basis-point upward shifts in yield curves over 2020 was mainly driven by: (i) significantly increased volumes of savings and current accounts; and (ii) changes to estimates of the extent to which NatWest Group passes through the impact of changes in interest rates to these products.\n- \uf0b7 The estimated impact on managed margin portfolios of the downward shift into negative interest rates is affected by assumptions regarding the extent to which negative rates are passed through to both deposits and loans.\n\n## One-year 25 and 100-basis-point sensitivity table\n\nThe following table analyses the one-year scenarios by currency and, in addition, shows the impact over one year of a 100-basis-point upward shift in all interest rates.\n\n|           | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   | 2019 Shifts in yield curve   | 2019 Shifts in yield curve   | 2019 Shifts in yield curve   |\n|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|           | +25                          | -25                          | +100                         | +25                          | -25                          | +100                         |\n|           | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 |\n|           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           |\n| Euro      | 7                            | (6)                          | 99                           | 25                           | (2)                          | 129                          |\n| Sterling  | 336                          | (287)                        | 1,109                        | 172                          | (158)                        | 716                          |\n| US dollar | 26                           | (22)                         | 102                          | 16                           | (11)                         | 66                           |\n| Other     | 2                            | -                            | 7                            | (1)                          | 1                            | (3)                          |\n| Total     | 371                          | (315)                        | 1,317                        | 212                          | (170)                        | 908                          |\n\nRisk and capital management",

Valuation changes that are not hedged (or not in effective hedge accounting relationships) are recognised in FVOCI reserves.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used to implement the structural hedging programme and also hedging of some personal and commercial lending portfolios, primarily fixed-rate mortgages. Generally, these swaps are booked in hedge accounting relationships. Changes in the valuation of swaps that are in effective cash flow hedge accounting relationships are recognised in cash flow hedge reserves.\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of FVOCI reserves and cash flow hedge reserves to a parallel shift in all rates. In this analysis, interest rates have not been floored at zero. Cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective and interest rate hedges of bonds in the liquidity portfolio are also assumed to be subject to fully effective hedge accounting. Hedge accounting ineffectiveness would result in some deviation from the results below, with some gains or losses recognised in P&L instead of reserves. Hedge ineffectiveness P&L is monitored, and the effectiveness of cash flow and fair value hedge relationships is regularly tested in accordance with IFRS requirements. Note that a movement in the FVOCI reserve would have an impact on CET1 capital but a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not be expected to do so. Volatility in both reserves affects tangible net asset value.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n- \uf0b7 Cash flow hedge reserve sensitivity fell in 2020, mainly driven by increased hedging of mortgage funding.\n\n|                          | +25 basis points -25 basis points   |     | +100 basis  points   | -100 basis  points   | +25 basis points   | -25 basis points   | +100 basis points   | -100 basis points   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                          | \u00a3m                                  | \u00a3m  | \u00a3m                   | \u00a3m                   | \u00a3m                 | \u00a3m                 | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  |\n| FVOCI reserves           | (50)                                | 48  | (207)                | 181                  | (56)               | 55                 | (227)               | 210                 |\n| Cash flow hedge reserves | (108)                               | 109 | (421)                | 447                  | (153)              | 155                | (597)               | 638                 |\n| Total                    | (158)                               | 157 | (628)                | 628                  | (209)              | 210                | (824)               | 848                 |\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The main driver of NatWest Group's cash flow hedge reserve sensitivity is the interest rate swaps that form part of the structural hedge.",

Additionally, other high-quality bond portfolios are held for collateral purposes and to support payment systems.\n\nCredit spread risk is monitored daily through sensitivities and VaR measures. The dealing authorities in place for the bond portfolios further mitigate the risk by imposing constraints by duration, asset class and credit rating. Exposures and limit utilisations are reported to senior management on a daily basis.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nNon-traded foreign exchange risk arises from three main sources:\n\n- \uf0b7 Structural foreign exchange risk - arises from the capital deployed in foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint arrangements and related currency funding where it differs from sterling.\n- \uf0b7 Non-trading book foreign exchange risk - arises from customer transactions and profits and losses that are in a currency other than the functional currency of the transacting operation.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe table below shows structural foreign currency exposures.\n\n| 2020               | Net investments in foreign operations \u00a3m   | Net investment hedges \u00a3m   | Structural foreign currency exposures pre-economic  hedges \u00a3m   | Economic hedges (1) \u00a3m   | Residual  Structural foreign currency exposures \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| US dollar          | 1,299                                      | (3)                        | 1,296                                                           | (1,296)                  | -                                                    |\n| Euro               | 6,485                                      | (829)                      | 5,656                                                           | -                        | 5,656                                                |\n| Other non-sterling | 1,077                                      | (350)                      | 727                                                             |                          | 727                                                  |\n| Total              | 8,861                                      | (1,182)                    | 7,679                                                           | (1,296)                  | 6,383                                                |\n| 2019               |                                            |                            |                                                                 |                          |                                                      |\n| US dollar          | 1,519                                      | -                          | 1,519                                                           | (1,519)                  | -                                                    |\n| Euro               | 5,914                                      | (650)                      | 5,264                                                           | -                        | 5,264                                                |\n| Other non-sterling | 1,498                                      | (651)                      | 847                                                             | -                        | 847                                                  |\n| Total              | 8,931                                      | (1,301)                    | 7,630                                                           | (1,519)                  | 6,111                                                |\n\n## Note:\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 Over the period, sterling strengthened against the US dollar while it weakened against the euro.\n- \uf0b7 Hedging of other non-sterling businesses decreased following the receipt of a distribution from Coutts & Co. Ltd as part of the wind down of this company's operations.\n\n- \uf0b7 Forecast earnings or costs in foreign currencies - NatWest Group assesses its potential exposure to forecast foreign currency income and expenses. NatWest Group hedges forward some forecast expenses.\n\nThe most material non-traded open currency positions are the structural foreign exchange exposures arising from investments in foreign subsidiaries, branches and associates and their related currency funding. These exposures are assessed and managed to predefined risk appetite levels under delegated authority from the Asset & Liability Management Committee. NatWest Group seeks to limit the potential volatility impact on its CET1 ratio from exchange rate movements by maintaining a structural open currency position. Gains or losses arising from the retranslation of net investments in overseas operations are recognised in equity reserves and reduce the sensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movements primarily arising from the retranslation of non-sterling denominated RWAs. Sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to RWAs equals the CET1 ratio.\n\nThe sensitivity of this ratio to exchange rates is monitored monthly and reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee at least quarterly. Foreign exchange exposures arising from customer transactions are sold down by businesses on a regular basis in line with NatWest Group policy.\n\n- \uf0b7 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect equity in proportion to structural foreign currency exposure. For example, a 5% strengthening or weakening in foreign currencies against sterling would result in a gain or loss of \u00a30.4 billion in equity respectively.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Equity exposures may arise through strategic acquisitions, venture capital investments and restructuring arrangements.\n\nInvestments, acquisitions or disposals of a strategic nature are referred to the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee. Once approved by the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee for execution, such transactions are referred for approval to the Board, the Executive Committee, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer or as otherwise required. Decisions to acquire or hold equity positions in the non-trading book that are not of a strategic nature, such as customer restructurings, are taken by authorised persons with delegated authority.\n\nEquity positions are carried at fair value on the balance sheet based on market prices where available. If market prices are not available, fair value is based on appropriate valuation techniques or management estimates.\n\nThe table below shows the balance sheet carrying value of equity positions in the banking book.\n\n|                        |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Exchange-traded equity |        14 |       627 |\n| Private equity         |       160 |       249 |\n| Other                  |        78 |        76 |\n|                        |       252 |       952 |\n\nThe exposures may take the form of (i) equity shares listed on a recognised exchange, (ii) private equity shares defined as unlisted equity shares with no observable market parameters or (iii) other unlisted equity shares.\n\n|                                                       | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net realised gains arising from disposals             | (248)     | 114       |\n| Unrealised gains included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital | 82        | (40)      |\n\n## Note:\n\n(1) Includes gains or losses on FVOCI instruments only.\n\n## Key point\n\n- \uf0b7 The decrease in equity investment and losses on disposals mainly reflect the disposal of SABB.\n\n## Accounting volatility risk\n\nAccounting volatility risk arises when an exposure is accounted for at amortised cost but economically hedged by a derivative that is accounted for at fair value. Although this is not an economic risk, the difference in accounting between the exposure and the hedge creates volatility in the income statement.\n\nAccounting volatility can be mitigated through hedge accounting. However, residual volatility will remain in cases where accounting rules mean that hedge accounting is not an option, or where there is some hedge ineffectiveness. Accounting volatility risk is reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee monthly and capitalised as part of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Traded market risk\n\n## Definition\n\nTraded market risk is the risk arising from changes in fair value on positions, assets, liabilities or commitments in trading portfolios as a result of fluctuations in market prices.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nTraded market risk mainly arises from NatWest Group's trading activities. These activities provide a range of financing, risk management and investment services to clients -including corporations and financial institutions -around the world. From a market risk perspective, activities are focused on rates; currencies; and traded credit. NatWest Group undertakes transactions in financial instruments including debt securities, as well as securities financing and derivatives.\n\nAll material traded market risk resides in NatWest Markets. The key categories are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign currency price risk.\n\nTrading activities may also give rise to counterparty credit risk. For further detail refer to the Credit risk section.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 initially resulted in periods of exceptional market volatility as well as increased illiquidity.\n- \uf0b7 Traded VaR remained broadly consistent on an average basis with 2019 levels despite this increased market volatility. This was due to ongoing business de-risking as part of the overall RWA reduction strategy.\n\n## Governance\n\nMarket risk policy statements set out the governance and risk management framework. Responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from trading activities lies with the relevant trading business. The Market Risk function independently advises on, monitors and challenges the risk-taking activities undertaken by the trading business ensuring these are within the constraints of the market risk framework, policies, and risk appetite statements and measures.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite for traded market risk is set out in the traded market risk appetite statement. Quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of exposure limits. The limits at NatWest Group level comprise value-at-risk (VaR) and stressed value-at-risk (SVaR). More details on these are provided on the following pages.\n\nFor each trading business, a document known as a dealing authority compiles details of all applicable limits and trading restrictions. The desk-level mandates comprise qualitative limits related to the product types within the scope of each desk, as well as quantitative metrics specific to the desk's market risk exposures. These additional limits and metrics aim to control various risk dimensions such as exposure size, aged inventory, currency and tenor.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments. The limit review has been enhanced to improve the alignment between traded market risk exposure and capital usage. This is done by analysing the relationship between VaR and SVaR and NWM Plc's solo CET1 ratio.\n\nTo ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers at NatWest Group and lower levels have been set such that if exposures exceed a specified level, action plans are developed by the relevant business and the Market Risk function and implemented. For more detail on risk appetite and risk controls, refer to page 160.\n\n## Monitoring and mitigation\n\nTraded market risk is identified and assessed by gathering, analysing, monitoring and reporting market risk information at desk, business, franchise and NatWest Group-wide levels. Industry expertise, continued system developments and techniques such as stress testing\n\nare also used to enhance the effectiveness of the identification and assessment of all material market risks.\n\nTraded market risk exposures are monitored against limits and analysed daily. A daily report summarising the position of exposures against limits at desk, business, franchise and NatWest Group levels is provided to senior management and market risk managers across the function. Limit reporting is supplemented with regulatory capital and stress testing information as well as ad hoc reporting.\n\nA risk review of trading businesses is undertaken weekly with senior risk and front office staff. This includes a review of profit and loss drivers, notable position concentrations and other positions of concern.\n\nBusiness profit and loss performance is monitored automatically through loss triggers which, if breached, require a remedial action plan to be agreed between the Market Risk function and the business. The loss triggers are set using both a fall-from-peak approach and an absolute loss level. In addition, regular updates on traded market risk positions are provided to the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Measurement\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR, SVaR and the incremental risk charge to measure traded market risk. Risks that are not adequately captured by VaR or SVaR are captured by the Risks Not In VaR (RNIV) framework to ensure that NatWest Group is adequately capitalised for market risk. In addition, stress testing is used to identify any vulnerabilities and potential losses.\n\nThe key inputs into these measurement methods are market data and risk factor sensitivities. Sensitivities refer to the changes in trade or portfolio value that result from small changes in market parameters that are subject to the market risk limit framework. Revaluation ladders are used in place of sensitivities to capture the impact of large moves in risk factors or the joint impact of two risk factors.\n\nThese methods have been designed to capture correlation effects and allow NatWest Group to form an aggregated view of its traded market risk across risk types, markets and business lines while also taking into account the characteristics of each risk type.\n\n## Value-at-risk\n\nFor internal risk management purposes, VaR assumes a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal VaR model - which captures all trading book positions including those products approved by the regulator - is based on a historical simulation, utilising market data from the previous 500 days on an equally-weighted basis.\n\nThe model also captures the potential impact of interest rate risk; credit spread risk; foreign currency price risk; equity price risk; and commodity price risk.\n\nWhen simulating potential movements in such risk factors, a combination of absolute, relative and rescaled returns is used.\n\nThe performance and adequacy of the VaR model are tested regularly through the following processes:\n\n- \uf0b7 Back-testing - Internal and regulatory back-testing is conducted on a daily basis. (Information on internal back-testing is provided in this section. Information on regulatory back-testing appears in the Pillar 3 report).\n- \uf0b7 Ongoing model validation - VaR model performance is assessed both regularly, and on an ad-hoc basis, if market conditions or portfolio profile change significantly.\n- \uf0b7 Model Risk Management review - As part of the model lifecycle, all risk models (including the VaR model) are independently reviewed to ensure the model is still fit for purpose given current market conditions and portfolio profile. For further detail on the independent model validation carried out by Model Risk Management refer to page 244. More information relating to pricing and market risk models is presented in the Pillar 3 report.\n\nRisk and capital management",

The extent of the diversification benefit depends on the correlation between the assets and risk factors in the portfolio at a particular time. The diversification factor is the sum of the VaR on individual risk types less the total portfolio VaR.\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 COVID-19 and geopolitical risk resulted in periods of exceptional market volatility and increased illiquidity during 2020. Despite this volatility, traded VaR remained within appetite throughout the year.\n- \uf0b7 Although traded VaR fluctuated throughout 2020, it remained broadly unchanged year-on-year on an average basis, due to business de-risking.",

For more details on the back-testing approach, refer to the Pillar 3 report.\n\nThe table below shows internal back-testing exceptions in the major NatWest Markets businesses for the 250-business-day period to 31 December 2020. Internal back-testing compares one-day 99% traded internal VaR with Actual and Hypo P&L.\n\nBack-testing exceptions\n\n- \uf0b7 The exceptions in the Currencies business were mainly driven by volatility in the foreign exchange market.\n- \uf0b7 The exceptions in the Credit business were mainly driven by bond mark-downs due to overall market weakness.\n\n|            |   Actual |   Hypo |\n|------------|----------|--------|\n| Rates      |        1 |      4 |\n| Currencies |        2 |      5 |\n| Credit     |       10 |     10 |\n\n## Key points\n\n- \uf0b7 The exceptional market volatility resulting from COVID-19 led to back-testing exceptions across NWM businesses.\n- \uf0b7 The exceptions in the Rates business were mainly driven by market moves in sterling and euro rates and underperformance of US Treasuries.\n\n## Stressed VaR (SVaR)\n\nAs with VaR, the SVaR methodology produces estimates of the potential change in the market value of a portfolio, over a specified time horizon, at a given confidence level. SVaR is a VaR-based measure using historical data from a one-year period of stressed market conditions.\n\nA simulation of 99% VaR is run on the current portfolio for each 250-day period from 2005 to the current VaR date, moving forward one day at a time. The SVaR is the worst VaR outcome of the simulated results.\n\nThis is in contrast with VaR, which is based on a rolling 500-day historical data set. A time horizon of ten trading days is assumed with a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal traded SVaR model captures all trading book positions.\n\n|                            | 2020       | 2020       | 2020       | 2020          | 2019          |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                            | Average \u00a3m | Maximum \u00a3m | Minimum \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m |\n| Total internal traded SVaR | 97         | 196        | 59         | 87            | 90            |\n\n## Key point\n\n- \uf0b7 Despite the market volatility and illiquidity resulting from COVID-19, SVaR decreased year-on-year on an average basis, primarily due to the ongoing business de-risking.\n\n## Risks Not In VaR (RNIVs)\n\nThe RNIV framework is used to identify and quantify market risks that are not fully captured by the internal VaR and SVaR models.\n\nRNIV calculations form an integral part of ongoing model and data improvement efforts to capture all market risks in scope for model approval in VaR and SVaR.\n\nFor further qualitative and quantitative disclosures on RNIVs, refer to the Market risk section of the Pillar 3 Report.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nFor information on stress testing, refer to page 161.\n\n## Incremental risk charge (IRC)\n\nThe IRC model quantifies the impact of rating migration and default events on the market value of instruments with embedded credit risk (in particular, bonds and credit default swaps) held in the trading book. It further captures basis risk between different instruments, maturities and reference entities. For further qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the IRC, refer to the Market risk section of the Pillar 3 Report.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Pension risk Definition\n\nPension risk is the risk to NatWest Group caused by its contractual or other liabilities to, or with respect to, a pension scheme (whether established for its employees or those of a related company or otherwise). It is also the risk that NatWest Group will make payments or other contributions to, or with respect to, a pension scheme because of a moral obligation or because NatWest Group considers that it needs to do so for some other reason.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to pension risk through its defined benefit schemes worldwide. The Main section of The NatWest Group Pension Fund (the Main section) is the largest source of pension risk with \u00a351.3 billion of assets and \u00a343.9 billion of liabilities at 31 December 2020 (2019 - \u00a346.6 billion of assets and \u00a339.7 billion of liabilities). Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, for further details on NatWest Group's pension obligations, including sensitivities to the main risk factors.\n\nPension scheme liabilities vary with changes in long-term interest rates and inflation as well as with pensionable salaries, the longevity of scheme members and legislation. Pension scheme assets vary with changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, credit spreads, exchange rates, and equity and property prices. NatWest Group is exposed to the risk that the schemes' assets, together with future returns and additional future contributions, are estimated to be insufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due. In such circumstances, NatWest Group could be obliged (or might choose) to make additional contributions to the schemes or be required to hold additional capital to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 There have been no material changes to NatWest Group's exposure to pension risk during the year. In particular, the interest rate and inflation hedging, along with limited exposure to equities, has meant that the positions of the main defined benefit schemes that NatWest Group sponsors have remained resilient despite the market shocks caused by COVID-19. More details on the assets held by the schemes are set out in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n- \uf0b7 During 2020, the Group Pension Committee, a key component of NatWest Group's approach to managing pension risk, was subsumed into the Group Asset & Liability Management Committee, including taking on the responsibilities previously held by the Group Pension Committee. This change was made to increase efficiency, reflecting the steps NatWest Group has taken to reduce the level of pension risk within NatWest Group in recent years, but to ensure that pension risk still receives appropriate executive attention.\n- \uf0b7 The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund formally changed its name to the NatWest Group Pension Fund on 1 August 2020, to align with the name of NatWest Group's parent company.\n- \uf0b7 The next triennial actuarial valuation for the Main section will have an effective date of 31 December 2020. Under current legislation, agreement with the Trustee would need to be reached no later than 31 March 2022.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Group Asset & Liability Management Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. Having replaced the Group Pension Committee during 2020, the Group Asset & Liability Management Committee is a key component of NatWest Group's approach to managing pension risk and it considers the pension impact of the capital plan for NatWest Group and reviews performance of NatWest Group's material pension funds and other issues material to NatWest Group's pension strategy on behalf of NatWest Group. It also considers investment strategy proposals from the Trustee of the Main section.\n\nFor further information on governance, refer to page 158.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group maintains an independent view of the risk inherent in its pension funds. NatWest Group has an annually reviewed pension risk appetite statement incorporating defined metrics against which risk is measured.\n\nPolicies and standards are in place to provide formal controls for pension risk reporting, modelling, governance and stress testing. A pension risk policy, which sits within the NatWest Group policy framework, is also in place and is subject to associated framework controls.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nPension risk is monitored by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee by way of the monthly Risk Management Report.\n\nNatWest Group also undertakes stress tests on its material defined benefit pension schemes each year. These tests are also used to satisfy the requests of regulatory bodies such as the Bank of England.\n\nThe stress testing framework includes pension risk capital calculations for the purposes of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process as well as additional stress tests for a number of internal management purposes. The results of the stress tests and their consequential impact on NatWest Group's balance sheet, income statement and capital position are incorporated into the overall NatWest Group stress test results.\n\nNatWest Bank Plc (a subsidiary of NatWest Group) is the principal employer of the Main section and could be required to fund any deficit that arises.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFollowing risk mitigation measures taken by the Trustee in recent years, the Main section is now well protected against interest rate and inflation risks and is being run on a low risk basis with relatively small equity risk exposure. The Main section also uses derivatives to manage the allocation of the portfolio to different asset classes and to manage risk within asset classes.\n\nThe potential impact of climate change is one of the factors considered in managing the assets of the Main section. The Trustee monitors the risk to its investments from changes in the global environment and invests, where return justifies the risk, in sectors that reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels, or that may otherwise promote environmental benefits. Further details regarding the Main section Trustee's approach to managing climate change risk can be found in its Responsible Ownership Policy. The Trustee has reported in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in its Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Compliance & conduct risk Definition\n\nCompliance risk is the risk that the behaviour of NatWest Group towards customers fails to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards and codes of conduct. Such a failure may lead to breaches of regulatory requirements, organisational standards or customer expectations and could result in legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or reputational damage.\n\nConduct risk is the risk that the conduct of NatWest Group and its subsidiaries and its staff towards customers - or in the markets in which it operates - leads to unfair or inappropriate customer outcomes and results in reputational damage, financial loss or both.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nCompliance and conduct risks exist across all stages of NatWest Group's relationships with its customers and arise from a variety of activities including product design, marketing and sales, complaint handling, staff training, and handling of confidential insider information. As set out in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, NatWest Group and certain members of staff are party to legal proceedings and are subject to investigation and other regulatory action in the UK, the US and other jurisdictions.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Compliance & conduct risk continued Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 A customer-focused COVID-19 response was mobilised, which included prioritised resource and operational capacity, forbearance and participation in government schemes.\n- \uf0b7 In-life monitoring of customer outcomes was extended to ensure treatment strategies remained timely, relevant and consistent, as a result of the continued economic uncertainty arising from COVID19 and Brexit.\n- \uf0b7 Specialist training was delivered to support the continuous oversight of ring-fencing embeddedness.\n- \uf0b7 Work to develop a Digitised Rules Mapping platform was a significant management focus. The platform aims to facilitate riskbased rules mapping to regulatory obligations. This will enable more efficient risk management of regulatory compliance matters as well as intelligent risk taking.\n- \uf0b7 The roll-out of the Banking My Way service - which enables vulnerable customers to record their support needs - was also a focus, helping to drive tailored solutions and outcomes.\n- \uf0b7 A review of historic investment advice remediation was conducted in order to ensure the appropriate customer outcomes were achieved.\n\n## Governance\n\nNatWest Group defines appropriate standards of compliance and conduct and ensures adherence to those standards through its risk management framework. Relevant compliance and conduct matters are escalated through Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite for compliance and conduct risks is set at Board level. Risk appetite statements articulate the levels of risk that legal entities, businesses and functions work within when pursuing their strategic objectives and business plans.\n\nA range of controls is operated to ensure the business delivers good customer outcomes and is conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. A suite of policies addressing compliance and conduct risks set appropriate standards across NatWest Group. Examples of these include the Complaints Management Policy, Client Assets & Money Policy, and Product Lifecycle Policy as well as policies relating to customers in vulnerable situations, cross-border activities and market abuse. Continuous monitoring and targeted assurance is carried out as appropriate.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nCompliance and conduct risks are measured and managed through continuous assessment and reporting to NatWest Group's senior risk committees and at Board level. The compliance and conduct risk framework facilitates the consistent monitoring and measurement of compliance with laws and regulations and the delivery of consistently good customer outcomes. The first line of defence is responsible for effective risk identification, reporting and monitoring, with oversight, challenge and review by the second line. Compliance and conduct risk management is also integrated into NatWest Group's strategic planning cycle.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nActivity to mitigate the most-material compliance and conduct risks is carried out across NatWest Group with specific areas of focus in the customer- facing businesses and legal entities. Examples of mitigation include consideration of customer needs in business and product planning, targeted training, complaints management, as well as independent monitoring activity. Internal policies help support a strong customer focus across NatWest Group. Independent assessments of compliance with applicable regulations are also carried out at a legal entity level.\n\n## Financial crime risk Definition\n\nFinancial crime risk is presented by criminal activity in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions and tax evasion. It does not include fraud risk management.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nFinancial crime risk may be presented if NatWest Group's customers, employees or third parties undertake or facilitate financial crime, or if NatWest Group's products or services are used to facilitate such crime. Financial crime risk is an inherent risk across all lines of business.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 In view of the challenges presented by COVID-19, financial crime policies were reviewed and, where appropriate, updated to reflect the evolving environment as well as industry best practice.\n- \uf0b7 A new enterprise-wide Financial Crime Hub was established in the first line to detect and prevent financial crime. The Hub will facilitate a common, consistent approach to managing financial crime.\n- \uf0b7 A multi-year transformation plan was developed to ensure that, as the financial crime threat evolves with changes in technology, the economy and wider society, risks relating to money-laundering, terrorist-financing, tax evasion, bribery and corruption and financial sanctions are managed, mitigated and controlled as effectively as possible.\n- \uf0b7 A new Financial Crime executive steering committee was established to provide oversight of the transformation plan and its implementation.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Financial Crime Risk Executive Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Crime Risk Officer, is the principal financial crime risk management forum. The committee reviews and, where appropriate, escalates material financial crime risks and issues across NatWest Group to the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThere is no appetite to operate in an environment where systems and controls do not enable the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and mitigation of financial crime risk. The NatWest Group's systems and controls must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its businesses. There is no tolerance to systematically or repeatedly breach relevant financial crime regulations and laws.\n\nNatWest Group operates a framework of preventative and detective controls designed to mitigate the risk that it could facilitate financial crime. These controls are supported by a suite of policies, procedures and detailed instructions to ensure they operate effectively.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nFinancial crime risks are identified and reported through continuous risk management and regular monthly reporting to the NatWest Group's senior risk committees and the NatWest Group Board. Quantitative and qualitative data is reviewed and assessed to measure whether financial crime risk is within risk appetite.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThrough the financial crime framework, relevant policies, systems, processes and controls are used to mitigate financial crime risk. This includes the use of dedicated screening and monitoring controls to identify people, organisations, transactions and behaviours that may require further investigation or other actions. Centralised expertise is available to detect and disrupt threats to NatWest Group and its customers. Intelligence is shared with law enforcement, regulators and government bodies to strengthen national and international defences against those who would misuse the financial system for criminal motives.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Climate-related risk Definition\n\nClimate-related risk is the threat of financial loss or adverse nonfinancial impacts associated with climate change and the political, economic and environmental responses to it.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nPhysical risks may arise from climate and weather-related events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises. They can potentially result in financial losses, impairing asset values and the creditworthiness of borrowers. NatWest Group could be exposed to physical risks directly by the effects on its property portfolio and, indirectly, by the impacts on the wider economy as well as on the property and business interests of its customers.\n\nTransition risks may arise from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and sentiment could prompt reassessment of customers' financial risk and may lead to falls in the value of a large range of assets. NatWest Group could be exposed to transition risks directly through the costs of adaptation within economic sectors and markets as well as supply chain disruption leading to financial impacts on it and its customers. Potential indirect effects include the erosion of NatWest Group's competitiveness, profitability, or reputation damage.\n\nWithin these broad categories specific climate risk factors have been identified, which give rise to climate-related risks over the short, medium and long-term.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 Climate-related risk was elevated to a principal risk. In line with NatWest Group's risk management framework, the elevation will see the implementation of a dedicated risk policy, risk appetite statement and risk appetite measures, which are reportable to the Board Risk Committee.\n- \uf0b7 To support alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement, NatWest Group developed the capability to estimate financed emissions and emissions intensities for the following: residential mortgages, agriculture (primary farming), automotive manufacturers and oil & gas extractors. The residential mortgage portfolio and these three sectors were deemed the most material in terms of their proportion of NatWest Group's total loans and investments and susceptibility to disruption resulting from climate change.\n- \uf0b7 In preparation for the Bank of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, NatWest Group developed and tested a scenario analysis methodology to quantify a range of climaterelated risks to support business decision making and the development of management actions. Dry runs were conducted on a cross section of NatWest Group's wholesale and retail counterparties.\n- \uf0b7 Climate-related risk was included as a factor in setting sector oversight classifications, which drive the frequency and level at which sector credit risk appetite is reviewed.\n- \uf0b7 Guidance was issued to ensure appropriate consideration of climate-related risk in internal risk and control assessments.\n- \uf0b7 Within operational risk, a scenario analysis pilot was performed on NatWest Group's operations in India to assess the potential effects of climate driven events including disruption to business services, damage to physical assets and health & safety.\n- \uf0b7 Enhancements have been made to the Environmental, Social & Ethical risk management framework to mitigate reputational risk from carbon intensive sectors and support the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board is responsible for monitoring and overseeing climaterelated risk within NatWest Group's overall business strategy and risk appetite. The potential impact, likelihood and preparedness of climaterelated risk is reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Board approved the allocation of Senior Management Function responsibility for identifying and managing financial risks from climate\n\nchange jointly to the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Group Chief Risk Officer. This updated accountability supports the CEO's ownership of NatWest Group's strategic climate purpose. This responsibility includes ensuring that the financial risks from climate change are adequately reflected in risk management frameworks, and that NatWest Group can identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report on its exposure to these risks.\n\nA Group-wide Climate Change Programme (GCCP) supports the delivery of climate-related objectives. The GCCP is overseen by an Executive Steering Group (ESG) which is responsible for coordinating NatWest Group's response across climate-related regulations, risks and opportunities. The ESG is co-chaired by the Group CEO and Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's ambition is to be a leading bank in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in helping to address climate change. NatWest Group's stated purpose is to reduce the climate impact of its financing activity by at least 50% by 2030 and to do what is necessary to achieve alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nWork continued in 2020 to integrate climate-related risk into the risk management framework, including the development of appropriate risk appetite metrics. Where climate-related risk is deemed to have a material impact on a particular risk discipline, then changes to policies and procedures will be made accordingly. Availability of data and the robustness of risk measurement methodologies will influence the timing of any proposed changes.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nPlans have been developed to ensure climate-related risks are considered in the tools made available to risk disciplines for risk monitoring and measurement purposes.\n\nIn 2020, NatWest Group became the first major UK bank to join the Partnership for Carbon Accounting (PCAF), underlining its commitment to measuring and reducing its climate impact in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Furthermore, in 2020, NatWest Group also joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), following its launch of guidance to support financial institutions in aligning lending and investment activities with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nTo align NatWest Group's financing activity with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, work focused on formulating estimated emissions intensities that are consistent with limiting global warming to wellbelow 2\u00b0C. Using a sector-based approach, NatWest Group adopted the Global Greenhouse Gas Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry established by PCAF. In 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio and three sectors - agriculture (primary farming), automotive (manufacturers) and oil & gas (extractors) - were assessed with preliminary emissions intensities estimated for each. Work is underway to use this early analysis of the three sectors and NatWest Group's residential mortgage portfolio to develop actions to support the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nAdditional activity in 2020 focused on preparation for the Bank of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario. Scenario analysis allows NatWest Group to test a range of possible future climate pathways and understand the nature and magnitude of the risks they present. The purpose of scenario analysis is not to forecast the future but to understand and prepare to manage risks that could arise. During 2020, NatWest Group developed and tested a methodology to use scenario analysis to quantify the size of a range of climate-related risks and tested this on a cross section of our commercial and retail counterparties.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Climate-related financial risk continued\n\nThree scenarios developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), were used as the starting point for analysing physical and transition-related climaterelated risk over the period 2020-2050. The impacts of these scenarios were applied to a sample of the balance sheet comprising wholesale and retail counterparties. The scenarios were: Hot House World - no new policy action takes place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This leads to more than 3\u00b0C of warming and severe physical risks.\n\n- \uf0b7 Orderly - immediate and global action to reduce emissions in a measured way, at a rate that is fast enough to keep climate change within 2\u00b0C with 67% probability; leading to net zero emissions before 2070.\n- \uf0b7 Disorderly - ambitious new climate policies are introduced, but only in 2030. Like the Orderly scenario, emissions are sufficiently limited to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C, but the transition is faster as a result of delayed action.\n\nNatWest Group continues to participate in several industry-wide initiatives to develop consistent risk measurement methodologies.\n\nNatWest Group is a founding signatory of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Responsible Banking, which aims to promote sustainable finance around the globe. In 2020, NatWest Group also took part in Phase II of the UNEP FI pilot alongside other peer banks. As part of this, an exploratory climate scenario analysis on future flooding impacts on our mortgage portfolio was conducted. NatWest Group is also represented on the Climate Financial Risk Forum established by the PRA and FCA to shape the financial service industry's response to the challenges posed by climate risk.\n\n## Operational risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. It arises from day-to-day operations and is relevant to every aspect of the business.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nOperational risk may arise from a failure to manage operations, systems, transactions and assets appropriately. This can take the form of human error, an inability to deliver change adequately or on time, the non-availability of technology services, or the loss of customer data. Fraud and theft - as well as the threat of cyber attacks - are sources of operational risk, as is the impact of natural and man-made disasters. Operational risk can also arise from a failure to account for changes in law or regulations or to take appropriate measures to protect assets.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 The impact of COVID-19 led to significant disruption and heightened the operational risk profile as NatWest Group adapted to new ways of working as a result of the lockdown protocols. The control environment was continually monitored to ensure the resulting challenges were safely addressed.\n- \uf0b7 A NatWest Group-wide response was mobilised - supported by additional reporting on customer needs, people, processes and systems - to ensure the Board and senior management were regularly updated and to facilitate decision-making as COVID-19 evolved.\n- \uf0b7 The transformation agenda was impacted by COVID-19, with some activities being re-prioritised. A full risk assessment on the impact of the reprioritised activity was completed to ensure the potential impacts were understood and mitigated.\n- \uf0b7 Operational resilience remained a key focus. A series of scenarios - setting out the crystallisation of severe but plausible combinations of significant risks - were developed in order to support planning and appropriate forward-looking risk management strategies.\n- \uf0b7 The security threat and the potential for cyber attacks on NatWest Group's supply chain remains an area for close monitoring. Significant enhancements in managing such incidents and the\n\n- broader security control environment were made. This included completion of work in response to the outcome of the 2019 CBEST test.\n- \uf0b7 NatWest Group's preparations for Brexit and the end of the transition period enabled NatWest Group to ensure that its processes and systems would ensure continuity of service for customers.\n- \uf0b7 The number of critical customer-impacting incidents continued to reduce year-on-year. There were eight Criticality 1 incidents (including COVID-19) in 2020 compared to 14 in 2019.\n\n## Governance\n\nA strong operational risk management function is vital to support NatWest Group's ambitions to serve its customers better. Improved management of operational risk against defined appetite is vital for stability and reputational integrity.\n\nThe first line of defence is responsible for managing operational risks directly while the second line is responsible for proactive oversight and continuous monitoring of operational risk management across NatWest Group. The second line is responsible for reporting and escalating key concerns to Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOperational risk appetite supports effective management of material operational risks. It expresses the level and types of operational risk NatWest Group is willing to accept to achieve its strategic objectives and business plans. NatWest Group's operational risk appetite statement encompasses the full range of operational risks faced by its legal entities, businesses and functions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Control Environment Certification (CEC) process is a half-yearly self-assessment by the CEOs of NatWest Group's principal businesses, functions and legal entities. It provides a consistent and comparable view on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nCEC covers material risks and the underlying key controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, as well as supporting risk management frameworks. The CEC outcomes, including forwardlooking assessments for the next two half-yearly cycles and progress on control environment improvements, are reported to Group Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. They are also shared with external auditors.\n\nThe CEC process helps to ensure compliance with the NatWest Group Policy Framework, Sarbanes-Oxley 404 requirements concerning internal control over financial reporting (as referenced in the compliance report on page 152), and certain requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nRisks are mitigated by applying key preventative and detective controls, an integral step in the risk assessment methodology which determines residual risk exposure. Control owners are accountable for the design, execution, performance and maintenance of key controls. Key controls are regularly assessed for adequacy and tested for effectiveness. The results are monitored and, where a material change in performance is identified, the associated risk is re-evaluated.\n\nIn H1 2020, due to the impacts of COVID-19, the formal certification process was suspended. It resumed again in H2.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRisk and control assessments are used across all business areas and support functions to identify and assess material operational and conduct risks and key controls. All risks and controls are mapped to NatWest Group's Risk Directory.

Controls are tested at the appropriate frequency to verify that they remain fit-for-purpose and operate effectively to reduce identified risks.\n\nNatWest Group uses the standardised approach to calculate its Pillar 1 operational risk capital requirement. This is based on multiplying three years' average historical gross income by coefficients set by the regulator based on business line. As part of the wider Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process an operational risk economic capital model is used to assess Pillar 2A, which is a risk-sensitive add-on to Pillar 1. The model uses historical loss data (internal and external) and forward-looking scenario analysis to provide a risk-sensitive view of NatWest Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement.\n\nScenario analysis is used to assess how severe but plausible operational risks will affect NatWest Group. It provides a forwardlooking basis for evaluating and managing operational risk exposures.\n\nRefer to the Capital, liquidity and funding risk section for operational risk capital requirement figures.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nNatWest Group manages and monitors operational resilience through its risk and control assessment methodology. This is underpinned by setting and monitoring risk indicators and performance metrics for key business services. Progress continues on the response to regulator expectations on operational resilience, with involvement in a number of industry-wide operational resilience forums. This enables a more holistic view of the operational resilience risk profile and the pace of ongoing innovation and change, both internally and externally.\n\n## Event and loss data management\n\nThe operational risk event and loss data management process ensures NatWest Group captures and records operational risk financial and non-financial events that meet defined criteria. Loss data is used for regulatory and industry reporting and is included in capital modelling when calculating economic capital for operational risk. The most serious events are escalated in a simple, standardised process to all senior management, by way of a Group Notifiable Event Process.\n\nAll financial impacts associated with an operational risk event are reported against the date they were recorded in NatWest Group's financial accounts. A single event can result in multiple losses (or recoveries) that may take time to crystallise. Losses and recoveries with a financial accounting date in 2020 may relate to events that occurred, or were identified in, prior years. NatWest Group purchases insurance against specific losses and to comply with statutory or contractual requirements.\n\n## Percentage and value of events\n\nHistorically, events aligned to the Clients, products and business practices event category have accounted for the majority of NatWest Group's operational risk losses. However, during 2020 several large provision releases were recorded (that is, previously recorded provisions were released as they were no longer required). The value of these outweighed the provisions taken for other conduct-related matters, hence a negative movement was recorded in this category.\n\nCOVID-19 associated operational risk costs impacted upon the trend of increased losses recorded against the Business Disruption and System Failures event category. The increase in fraud continues to be primarily the result of NatWest Group having an increased liability for reimbursing customers impacted by authorised push payment scams.\n\n|                                            | Value of events   | Value of events   | Value of events   | Volume of events (1)   | Volume of events (1)   | Volume of events (1)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                            | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m                | Proportion        | Proportion             | Proportion             | Proportion             |\n|                                            | 2020              | 2019 (2)          | 2020              | 2019                   | 2020                   | 2019                   |\n| Fraud                                      | 88                | 57                | 72%               | 6%                     | 94%                    | 91%                    |\n| Clients, products and business practices   | (48)              | 867               | (40%)             | 92%                    | 1%                     | 4%                     |\n| Execution, delivery and process management | 11                | 20                | 9%                | 2%                     | 3%                     | 4%                     |\n| Employment practices and workplace safety  | 2                 | 2                 | 2%                | -                      | 1%                     | 1%                     |\n| Business disruption and system failures    | 69                | -                 | 57%               | -                      | 1%                     | -                      |\n|                                            | 122               | 946               | 100%              | 100%                   | 100%                   | 100%                   |\n\n## Notes:\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Definition\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences arising from decisions based on model results that may be incorrect, misinterpreted, used inappropriately or based on an outdated model. NatWest Group defines a model as a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, accounting, mathematical or data science theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group uses a variety of models in the course of its business activities. Examples include the use of model outputs to support customer decisioning, measuring and assessing risk exposures (including credit, market, and climate risk), as well as calculating regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Model applications may give rise to different risks depending on the franchise in which they are used. Model risk is therefore assessed separately for each franchise in addition to the overall assessment made for NatWest Group.\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 Progress was made in embedding the model risk framework across NatWest Group to ensure all models are identified and managed as per requirements.\n- \uf0b7 Enhanced model risk appetite measures were approved and monitored throughout 2020, with remediation plans under close management.\n- \uf0b7 All NatWest Group models are now recorded within a single model inventory, providing increased transparency.\n- \uf0b7 As a result of COVID-19, there was an increased reliance on model performance monitoring to identify model limitations and qualitative overlays to ensure model outputs were used appropriately.\n- \uf0b7 Initial validations of climate impacting models were conducted to help the bank better understand the risks associated with the use of models for this purpose.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Model risk continued Governance\n\nA governance framework is in place to ensure policies and processes relating to models are appropriate and effective. Two roles are key to this - Model Risk Owners and Model Risk Officers. Model Risk Owners, in the first line, are responsible for model approval and ongoing performance monitoring. Model Risk Officers, in the second line, are responsible for oversight, including ensuring that models are independently validated prior to use and on an ongoing basis aligned to the model's risk rating. Model risk matters are escalated to senior management in several ways. These include model risk oversight committees, as well as the relevant business and function model management committees. The Group Model Risk Oversight Committee provides a direct escalation route to the Group Executive Risk Committee and, where applicable, onwards to the Group Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nModel risk appetite is set in order to limit the level of model risk that NatWest Group is willing to accept in the course of its business activities. It is approved by relevant Executive Risk Committees. Business areas are responsible for monitoring performance against appetite and remediating models outside appetite.\n\n## Risk controls\n\nPolicies and procedures related to the development, validation, approval and ongoing monitoring of models are in place to ensure adequate control across the lifecycle of an individual model. Validation of material models is conducted by an independent risk function comprised of skilled, well-informed subject matter experts. This is completed for new models or amendments to existing models and as part of an ongoing periodic programme to assess model performance. The frequency of periodic validation is aligned to the risk rating of the model. The independent validation focuses on a variety of model features, including modelling approach, the nature of the assumptions used, the model's predictive ability and complexity, the data used in the model, its implementation and its compliance with regulation.\n\n## Risk monitoring and measurement\n\nThe level of risk relating to an individual model is assessed through a model risk rating. A quantitative approach is used to determine the risk rating of each model, based on the model's materiality and validation rating. This approach provides the basis for model risk appetite measures and enables model risk to be robustly monitored and managed across the NatWest Group.\n\nOngoing  performance  monitoring  is  conducted  by  the  first  line  and overseen by the second line to ensure parameter estimates and model constructs remain fit for purpose, model assumptions remain valid and that  models are being used consistently with their intended purpose. This  allows  timely  action  to  be  taken  to  remediate  poor  model performance and/or any control gaps or weaknesses.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nBy their nature - as approximations of reality - model risk is inherent in the use of models. It is managed by refining or redeveloping models where appropriate - either due to changes in market conditions, business assumptions or processes - and by applying adjustments to model outputs (either quantitative or based on expert opinion). Enhancements may also be made to the process within which the model output is used in order to further limit risk levels.\n\n## Reputational risk Definition\n\nReputational Risk is defined as the risk of damage to stakeholder trust due to negative consequences arising from internal actions or external events.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nReputational risks originate from internal actions and external events. The three primary drivers of reputational risk have been identified as: failure in internal execution; a conflict between NatWest Group's values and the public agenda; and contagion (when NatWest Group's reputation is damaged by failures in the wider financial sector).\n\n## Key developments in 2020\n\n- \uf0b7 Reputational risks arising from COVID-19 remained a key focus from Q1 onwards.\n- \uf0b7 A review of the reputational risk framework and policy began in 2020. This was required to reflect the purpose, capture a more complete view of reputation at a strategic level and align with more progressive industry leaders.\n- \uf0b7 The correlation between reputational risk and climate change issues remained a significant area of focus, supported by work to enhance the consideration of such issues within the reputational risk framework. As part of this work, enhancements were made to the Environmental, Social & Ethical risk management framework to mitigate reputational risk from carbon intensive sectors and support the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\n## Governance\n\nA reputational risk policy supports reputational risk management across NatWest Group. Reputational risk committees review relevant issues at an individual business or entity level, while the Reputational Risk Committee - which has delegated authority from the Executive Risk Committee - opines on cases, issues, sectors and themes that represent a material reputational risk. The Board Risk Committee oversees the identification and reporting of reputational risk. The Sustainable Banking Committee has a specific focus on environmental, social and ethical issues.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group manages and articulates its appetite for reputational risk through a qualitative reputational risk appetite statement and quantitative measures. NatWest Group seeks continuous improvement in the identification, assessment and management of customers, transactions, products and issues that present a material reputational risk.\n\nStandards of conduct are in place across NatWest Group requiring strict adherence to policies, procedures and ways of working to ensure business is transacted in a way that meets - or exceeds - stakeholder expectations.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRelevant internal and external factors are monitored through regular reporting to the reputational risk committees at business or entity level and escalated, where appropriate, to the Reputational Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee or the Sustainable Banking Committee.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nReputational risk is mitigated through the policy and governance framework, with ongoing staff training to ensure early identification, assessment and escalation of material issues. External events that could cause reputational damage are identified and mitigated through NatWest Group's top and emerging risks process. The most material threats to NatWest Group's reputation continued to originate from historical and more recent conduct issues. NatWest Group has in recent years been the subject of investigations and reviews by a number of regulators and governmental authorities, some of which have resulted in past fines, settlements and public censure. Refer to the Litigation and regulatory matters section of Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for details of material matters currently impacting NatWest Group.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \uf0b7 In conjunction with our walkthrough of the Group's financial close process, we confirmed our understanding of management's Going Concern assessment process and also engaged with management early to ensure all key factors were considered in their assessment;\n- \uf0b7 We evaluated management's going concern assessment which included reviewing their evaluation of long-term business and strategic plans, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding positions. It also assessed these positions considering internal stress tests which included consideration of principal and emerging risks. The Group's risk profile and risk management practices were considered including credit risk, market risk, compliance and conduct risk, and operational risk;\n- \uf0b7 We evaluated management's assessment by considering viability under different scenarios including the impact of the Group's strategic plans and the economic impact of COVID-19. We used economic specialists in assessing the macroeconomic assumptions in the forecast through benchmarking to institutional forecasts, HMT consensus and peer comparative economic forecasts. We also considered other commitments of the Group including those in respect of its subsidiaries;\n- \uf0b7 We considered the Group's operational resilience and their response to the impact COVID-19 had on its business operations, including the operations of its third party providers; and\n- \uf0b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n\n- \uf0b7 Balance sheet as at 31 December 2020;\n- \uf0b7 Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;\n- \uf0b7 Cash flow statement for the year then ended; and\n- \uf0b7 Related notes 1 to 12 to the financial statements including a summary of critical accounting policies.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of NatWest Group plc\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period up to 19 February 2022 being not less than twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group.  Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account the size and risk profile of the component and its activities, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the five reporting components of the Group, we selected four components based on size and risk, which represent the principal reporting legal entities within the Group.\n\nThe scoping for the current year is as follows:\n\n| Component              | Scope    | Key locations                                  |\n|------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|\n| NatWest Holdings (NWH) | Full     | United Kingdom                                 |\n| NatWest Markets (NWM)  | Full     | United Kingdom, United States, and Netherlands |\n| RBS International      | Specific | Channel Islands                                |\n| RBS AA Holdings        | Specific | United Kingdom                                 |\n\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams. We considered total assets, total equity and total income to verify we had appropriate overall coverage.\n\n|              | Full scope (1)   | Specific scope (2)   | Other procedures (3)   | Total   |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Total assets | 95%              | 5%                   | -                      | 100%    |\n| Total equity | 92%              | 8%                   | -                      | 100%    |\n| Total income | 92%              | 3%                   | 5%                     | 100%    |\n\n## Notes:\n\nThe audit scope of Specific scope components may not have included testing of all significant accounts within the component. However, the testing will have contributed to the total coverage of significant accounts tested for the overall Group.\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown restrictions in all of the countries where full or specific scope audit procedures have been performed, we have modified our audit strategy to allow for the audit to be performed remotely at both the Group and component locations. This approach was supported through remote user access to the Group's financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.\n\nThe primary audit engagement team interacted regularly with the component audit teams where appropriate throughout the course of the audit, which included holding planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status of the audits, reviewing key working papers and taking responsibility for the scope and direction of the audit process. The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of oversight visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor, or another Group audit partner, visits all full scope and specific scope locations. During the current year's audit cycle, due to COVID-19, the visits undertaken by the primary audit team were necessarily virtual visits. These visits involved video call meetings with local management, and discussions on the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams and maintained a continuous and open dialogue with component teams, as well as holding formal closing meetings quarterly, to ensure that the primary team were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. The primary team also reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

We also considered the appropriateness of provisions applied to government supported lending such as bounce back loans and CBILs which included assessing the respective eligibility criteria. We performed peer benchmarking where available to assess overall staging and provision coverage levels. For a sample of industries, we also assessed the ECL against an independently developed methodology estimating unsustainable debt levels.\n\nBased on our assessment of the key judgements we used specialists to support the audit team in the areas of economics, modelling and, collateral and business valuations.\n\nStaging : We evaluated the criteria used to allocate a financial asset to stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9; this included peer benchmarking to assess staging levels. We recalculated the assets in stage 1, 2 and 3 to assess if they were allocated to the appropriate stage and performed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different criteria on the ECL and also considered the impact of performing collective staging downgrades to industries and geographic regions particularly impacted by COVID-19.\n\nTo test credit monitoring which drives the probability of default estimates used in the staging calculation, we recalculated the risk ratings for a sample of performing loans and focused our testing on high risk industries impacted by COVID-19. We also assessed the timing of the annual review performed by management on each wholesale loan exposure to evaluate whether it appropriately considered COVID-19 risk factors by considering independent publicly available information.\n\nModel estimations - We performed a risk assessment on all models involved in the ECL calculation to select a sample of models to test. We involved modelling specialists to assist us to test this sample of ECL models by testing the assumptions, inputs and formulae used. This included a combination of assessing the appropriateness of model design and formulae used, alternative modelling techniques, recalculating the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default, and model implementation. We also considered the results of internal model validation results.\n\nTo evaluate data quality, we agreed a sample of ECL calculation data points to source systems, including balance sheet data used to run the models and historic loss data to monitor models. We also tested the ECL data points from the calculation engine through to the general ledger and disclosures. We included COVID-19 specific data points in this testing.\n\nEconomic scenarios - We involved economic specialists to assist us to evaluate the base case and alternative economic scenarios, including evaluating probability weights and comparing these to other scenarios from a variety of external sources. This assessment included the latest developments related to COVID-19 and Brexit at 31 December 2020, including the announcement of planned vaccines.  We assessed whether forecasted macroeconomic variables were complete and appropriate, such as GDP, unemployment rate, interest rates and the House Price Index. With the support of our modelling specialists we evaluated the correlation and translation of the macroeconomic factors to the ECL.",

The parent company has reported investments in group undertakings of \u00a346.2 billion (2019: \u00a355.8 billion).\n\nThe recognition and carrying value of deferred tax assets, goodwill and, in the parent company accounts, investments in group undertakings are based on estimates of future profitability, which require significant management judgement and include the risk of management bias. The recognition of deferred tax assets considers the future profit forecasts of the legal entities as well as interpretation of recent changes to tax rates and laws.\n\nJudgements and especially challenging, complex and subjective assumptions that are difficult to audit due to the forward-looking nature and inherent uncertainties associated with such assumptions include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Revenue forecasts which are also impacted by delivery of the Group's Strategy\n- \uf0b7 Cost forecasts in particular given the intention to significantly reduce costs over time;\n- \uf0b7 Macroeconomic and model assumptions used in the recoverability and valuation assessments (discount rates, growth rates, macroeconomic assumptions) including assumptions regarding the economic consequences of COVID -19, Brexit and other political developments over an extended period.\n- \uf0b7 Disclosure adequacy including key assumptions, the sensitivity of changes to these assumptions as well as an explanation of the impairment testing performed.\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the preparation and review of the forecasts, the significant assumptions (such as discount rate and long-term growth rate) used in the value in use model, inputs, calculations, methodologies and judgements. This included testing controls over the selection of macroeconomic assumptions in addition to revenue and cost projections, as well as the precision applied to these. In evaluating the governance processes we reviewed the Board meeting materials and minutes where forecasts were discussed and approved, and we observed the committee meetings where the value in use model and outcomes were discussed and approved.\n\nMacroeconomic and model assumptions: With the support of our internal economic specialists, we tested whether macroeconomic assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, the outcome of Brexit and other geopolitical considerations at 31 December 2020, used in the Group's forecasts were reasonable by comparing these to other scenarios from a variety of external sources.  We evaluated how the discount rates and long-term growth rates used by management compared to our ranges which were assessed using peer practice, external market data and calculations performed by our valuation specialists.\n\nRevenue forecasts: We evaluated the underlying business strategies, comparing to expected market trends and considering anticipated balance sheet growth. We obtained an understanding of the Group's strategy and considered its expected impact on the forecasts and the extent to which decisions had been factored into the forecasts, where appropriate, in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. We also inspected the findings from the review performed by management including their own sensitivity analysis of the forecasts.\n\nCost forecasts: We tested how previous management forecasts, including the impact of cost reduction programmes, compared to actual results to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting process. We involved our cost transformation specialists to assist us in assessing the achievability of future cost reduction plans by evaluating the details of the underlying initiatives and how cost ratios compared to peer banks and commentaries from external analysts.\n\nSensitivity analysis: We evaluated how management considered alternative assumptions and performed our own sensitivity and scenario analyses on certain assumptions such as cost and revenue forecasts, discount rate and long-term growth rate on both the detailed forecasts and on a stand back basis.\n\nDisclosure: We evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements including the appropriateness assumptions and sensitivities disclosed. We tested the data and calculations included in the disclosures.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that management methodologies, judgements and assumptions supporting the carrying value of goodwill, deferred tax assets and, in the parent company accounts, investments in group undertakings, were reasonable and in accordance with IFRS. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf0b7 There is inherent uncertainty in predicting revenue and costs over the five-year forecast period, particularly with respect to the impact of COVID-19 and a continuing low interest rate environment, the achievement of new strategic objectives, execution risk in the planned cost reductions, the impact of regulatory and climate change developments, and the impact of competition and disruption in banking business models over an extended period.\n- \uf0b7 Our stress testing on Commercial goodwill indicated that it is the most at risk of impairment based on the level of headroom and the various scenario analyses performed. We are, however, satisfied that management's conclusion that the goodwill is recoverable as at 31 December 2020 is appropriate and that they have adequately disclosed reasonably possible alternative scenarios relating to the key assumptions that could result in an impairment.\n- \uf0b7 The directors' impaired NatWest Group's investment in NWH and NWM, with there being no further headroom available. The sensitivity analyses we reviewed and our independent procedures supported these assessments.\n\nWe are satisfied that the disclosures appropriately reflect the sensitivity of the carrying value of investments in group undertakings and goodwill to certain reasonable alternative outcomes.  As there are a number of other possible outcomes and it would be impracticable to estimate the effect of all of them, the directors have disclosed the uncertainty that other possible outcomes within the next financial year could require an adjustment to the carrying amount of investments in group undertakings and goodwill.\n\nRelevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nAccounting policies\n\nNote 7 and Note 16 on the Group financial statements and Note 9 on the Parent company financial statements",

This included reported level 3 assets of \u00a31.7 billion (2019: \u00a32.5 billion) and level 3 liabilities of \u00a30.9 billion (2019: \u00a31.3 billion) whose value is dependent upon unobservable inputs.\n\nThe valuation of those financial instruments with higher risk characteristics involves both significant judgement and the risk of inappropriate revenue recognition through incorrect pricing as outlined below. The judgement in estimating fair value of these instruments can involve complex valuation models and significant fair value adjustments, both of which may be reliant on data inputs where there is limited market observability.\n\nManagement's estimates which required significant judgement include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Complex models - Complex model-dependent valuations, which include interest rate swaps linked to pre-payment behaviour and interest rate and foreign exchange options with exotic features; such as those having multiple call dates and variable notional amounts;\n- \uf0b7 Illiquid inputs - Pricing inputs and calibrations for illiquid instruments, including rarely traded debt securities. Additionally, derivative instruments whose valuation is dependent upon discount rates associated with complex collateral arrangements; and\n- \uf0b7 Fair value adjustments - The appropriateness and completeness of fair value adjustments made to derivatives including Funding Valuation Adjustments (FVA) and Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) relating to derivative counterparties whose credit spread is not directly market observable, and material product and deal specific adjustments on long dated derivative portfolios.\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to financial instrument valuation and related income statement measurement including independent price verification, model review and approval, collateral management, and income statement analysis. We also observed the NatWest Group Executive Valuation and NWM Valuation Committees where valuation inputs, assumptions and adjustments were discussed and approved.\n\nSubstantive testing: Among other procedures, we involved our financial instrument valuation and modelling specialists to assist us in performing procedures including the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Testing complex model-dependent valuations by performing independent calculations to assess the appropriateness of models and the adequacy of assumptions and inputs used by the Group;\n- \uf0b7 Independently re-pricing instruments that had been valued using illiquid pricing inputs, using alternative pricing sources to evaluate management's valuation;\n- \uf0b7 Comparing fair value adjustment methodologies to current market practice and assessing the appropriateness and adequacy of the valuation adjustment framework in light of emerging market practice; and\n- \uf0b7 Revaluing a sample of counterparty level FVA and CVAs, comparing funding spreads to third party data and independently challenging illiquid CVA inputs.\n\nWe also assessed whether there were any indicators of aggregate bias in financial instrument marking\n\nThroughout the year we considered the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of the different financial instrument portfolios, particularly where markets were affected by heightened volatility. Wherever this resulted in changes in management's marking approach we assessed the reasonableness of these changes as well as the design and operating effectiveness of associated key controls.\n\nComparing against historic and forecast activity: We performed back-testing analysis of recent trade activity to evaluate the drivers of significant differences between book value and trade value and to assess the impact on the fair value of similar instruments within the portfolio. We also obtained and assessed the appropriateness of management's estimate of 2021 budgeted losses in respect of asset disposals and risk reduction transactions and considered any impact on fair values at year-end and relevant disclosures. The assessment included back-testing 2020 budgeted losses against realised asset disposals and risk reduction transactions. We performed an analysis of significant disagreements with counterparty collateral calls to assess the potential impact on the fair value of the underlying (and similar) financial instruments.\n\n- \uf0b7 The impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of different financial instrument portfolios\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the assumptions used by management to reflect the fair value of financial instruments with higher risk characteristics and the recognition of related income is reasonable and in accordance with IFRS. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf0b7 Complex-model dependent valuations were appropriate based on the output of our independent re-valuations, analysis of trade activity and peer benchmarking;\n- \uf0b7 The fair value estimates of hard-to-price portfolios appropriately reflected pricing information available at 31 December 2020; and\n\nValuation adjustments applied on derivative portfolios for credit, funding and other risks were appropriate and complete based on our assessment of trade activity for positions with common risk characteristics, analysis of market data and peer benchmarking.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Accounting policies Note 12 on the financial statements",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of NatWest Group plc\n\n## Risk\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nIT access management\n\nThe IT environment is complex and pervasive to the operations of the Group due to the large volume of transactions processed in numerous locations daily and the reliance on automated and IT dependent manual controls.  Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that applications process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate manner. This risk is also impacted by the greater dependency on third-parties, increasing use of cloud platforms, decommissioning of legacy systems, and migration to new systems.  Such controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data.\n\n## Controls\n\n- \uf0b7 User access management across application, database and operating systems. We have identified user access deficiencies in the past and while the number of deficiencies has reduced year over year, there remains a risk of inappropriate access.\n\nWe evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls over the applications, operating systems and databases that are relevant to financial reporting. During our planning and test of design phases, we performed procedures to determine whether the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic had caused material changes in IT processes or controls and noted no such changes that would result in an increased IT risk.\n\n## Controls testing\n\nWe tested user access by assessing the controls in place for in-scope applications and verifying the addition and periodic recertification of users' access. During 2020, the Group consolidated their access management tools and moved further in-scope application onto a strategic platform (SLX) which will facilitate most of the Group's Manage Access IT General Controls across applications and infrastructure platforms. We performed procedures around the transition process between IT tools, focusing on the completeness of user data and the adequacy of the control environment. A number of systems are outsourced to third party service providers. For these systems, we tested IT general controls through evaluating the relevant Service Organisation Controls reports (where available). This included assessing the timing of the reporting, the controls tested by the service auditor and whether they address relevant IT risks and the impact COVID-19 had on the overall control environment. We also tested required complementary user entity controls performed by management.  Where a SOC report was not available we identified and reviewed compensating business controls to address this risk.\n\nWhere control deficiencies were identified, we tested remediation activities performed by management and compensating controls in place and assessed what additional testing procedures were necessary to mitigate any residual risk.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that IT controls impacting financial reporting are designed and operating effectively.  The following matters were reported to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf0b7 We have seen an overall reduction in the number of discrete IT control deficiencies identified compared to prior year.\n- \uf0b7 Improvements were made to standardise access management processes and controls across the Group. However, particular attention should continue to be paid to controls over user access management including ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the data used to perform access controls. Where issues were noted in relation to access management these were remediated by year end or mitigated by compensating controls. We also performed additional testing in response to deficiencies identified, where required.\n- \uf0b7 For  a  robust  control  environment,  the  Group  should  seek  to  build  and  end-to-end  view  of  controls  across  both  infrastructure  and application layers, including documentation of automated business controls, and IT general controls at the application layer.\n- \uf0b7 A high volume of control deficiencies had been remediated prior to year end, and the remaining compensated for, however, we have seen examples where further diligence could be applied to ensure consistent and continued effective control operation.\n\nIn the prior year, our auditor's report included a key audit matter in relation to Recycling of foreign exchange reserve triggered by Alawwal bank merger and liquidation of RFS Holding BV during 2019. We did not consider this to be a key audit matter in the current year as the materiality of foreign exchange reserves decreased significantly. .\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a3160 million (2019: \u00a3160 million), which is 5% (2019: 5%) of the loss before tax of the Group of \u00a3351 million (2019: profit before tax of the Group of \u00a34,232 million) adjusted for certain loan impairment charges arising from COVID-19, loss on redemption of own debt, non-recurring conduct expenses and strategic costs. The largest impact was an adjustment of \u00a32.5 billion to reflect preCOVID-19 loan impairment charges, using 2019 as a basis. We believe removing items that would otherwise have a disproportionate impact on materiality reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements and is consistent with the prior year. The 5% basis used for Group materiality is consistent with the wider industry, and is the standard for listed and regulated entities.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3160 million (2019: \u00a3160 million) which is 0.4% (2019: 0.3%) of equity of the Parent Company and is consistent with the prior year. We believe this reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements as the Parent Company's primary purpose is to act as a holding company with investments in the Group's subsidiaries, not to generate operating profits and therefore a profit based measure is not relevant.",

It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2019: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a380 million (2019: \u00a380 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage (which is at the lowest end of the range of our audit methodology) based on various considerations including the past history of misstatements, the effectiveness of the control environment and other factors affecting the entity and its financial reporting. Audit work at component teams for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a330 million to \u00a372 million (2019: \u00a330 million to \u00a380 million).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a38 million (2019: \u00a38 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Accounts including the Strategic Report, Business Review, Corporate Governance, Report of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, Report of the Group Audit Committee, Report of the Group Board Risk Committee, Report of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee, Report of the Technology and Innovation Committee, Report of the Directors,  Risk and capital Management, Non-IFRS financial measures, Risk Factors, Material Contracts, Shareholder Information, and Forward Looking Statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \uf0b7 the information given in the Strategic report and the Report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \uf0b7 the Strategic report and the Report of the directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Report of the directors. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our\n\nopinion:\n\n- \uf0b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \uf0b7 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \uf0b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \uf0b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \uf0b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified;\n- \uf0b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate;\n- \uf0b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable;\n- \uf0b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \uf0b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and;\n- \uf0b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of NatWest Group plc\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined below, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and\n\nmanagement.\n\n- \uf0b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are the regulations, licence conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA); Companies Act 2006; and the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX).\n- \uf0b7 We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making inquiries of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and Risk Committees; and gained an understanding of the Group's governance framework.\n- \uf0b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the controls established to address risks identified to prevent or detect fraud. We also identified the risks of fraud in our key audit matters as described above and identified areas that we considered when performing our fraud procedures, such as cybersecurity, the impact of remote working, implementation of new government supported lending products, and the appropriateness of sources used when performing confirmation testing on accounts such as cash, loans and securities.\n- \uf0b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of legal counsel, executive management, and internal audit. We also tested controls and performed procedures to respond to the fraud risks as identified in our key audit matters. These procedures were performed by both the primary team and component teams with oversight from the primary team.\n- \uf0b7 The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, involving specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \uf0b7 Following the recommendation from the Group Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Group at its annual general meeting on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \uf0b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 5 years, covering periods from our appointment through 31 December 2020.\n- \uf0b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n- \uf0b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nJonathan Bourne (Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London, United Kingdom 19 February 2021",

Presentation of accounts\n\nThe accounts, set out on pages 258 to 338, including these accounting policies on pages 264 to 268, and the audited sections of the Business review: Risk and capital management on pages 157 to 245, are prepared on a going concern basis (see the Report of the directors, page 153) and in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The significant accounting policies and related judgments are set out below.\n\nNatWest Group plc is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland. Its accounts are presented in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounts are presented in the functional currency, pounds sterling.\n\nWith the exception of certain financial instruments as described in Accounting policies 12 and 20 and investment property, the accounts are presented on a historical cost basis.\n\n## Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations (IFRS 3) - Changes to the definition of a business\n\nThe IASB amended IFRS 3 to provide additional guidance on the definition of a business. The amendment aims to help entities when determining whether a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition. The amendments are in line with current accounting policy and therefore did not affect the accounts.\n\n## Definition of material - Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1) and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8) The IASB clarified the definition of 'material'\n\nand aligned the definition of material used in the Conceptual Framework and in other IFRS standards. The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information. Under the amended definition of materiality, an entity will need to assess whether the information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the accounts. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users. NatWest Group's definition and application of materiality is in line with the definition in the amendments.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR reform) Phase 1 amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39\n\nThe IASB issued 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and\n\nIFRS 7)' as a first reaction to the potential effects the IBOR reform could have on financial reporting. The amendments focused on hedge accounting and allow hedge relationships affected by the IBOR reform to be accounted for as continuing hedges. Amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 with early application permitted. NatWest Group early adopted these amendments for the annual period ending on 31 December 2019.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR reform) Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16\n\nPhase 2 of the IASB's IBOR project (published in August 2020) addresses the wider accounting issues arising from the IBOR reform. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 with early application permitted. As NatWest Group early adopted these amendments for the annual period ending on 31 December 2020, which have been endorsed by the EU and UK in January 2021, NatWest Group has applied International Accounting Standards, which have been adopted for use within the UK. NatWest Group's IBOR transition program remains on-track and key milestones have been met. Conversion from rates subject to reform to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs) is expected to increase as RFR-based products become more widely available and key market-driven conversion events occur.\n\n## Accounting policy change - balances held with central banks\n\nThe definitions of central banks and the classification of amounts that are held in cash and balances at central banks and loans to banks - amortised cost have been refined. Amounts not subject to mandatory or term deposit restrictions that are held with central banks are now classified as Cash and balances with central banks, irrespective of jurisdiction. Amounts that are subject to mandatory restrictions or time deposit restrictions of more than 24 hours are classified as Loans to banks - amortised cost. Previously, this also included amounts subject to restrictions of less than 24 hours. This change in accounting policy resulted in a \u00a35.0 billion increase in Cash and balances at central banks and a corresponding reduction in Loans to banks - amortised cost at 31 December 2020, and a balance sheet reclassification from Loans to banks amortised cost to Cash and balances at central banks of \u00a33.1 billion at 31 December 2019 (1 January 2019 -  \u00a32.5 billion). These did not impact the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\n## 2. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of NatWest Group plc and entities (including certain structured entities) that give access to variable returns and that are controlled by NatWest Group. Control is assessed by reference to our ability to enforce our will on the other entity, typically through voting rights.\n\nAll intergroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The consolidated accounts are prepared under uniform accounting policies.\n\n## 3. Revenue recognition\n\nInterest income or expense relates to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and debt instruments classified as fair value through OCI using the effective interest rate method, the effective part of any related accounting hedging instruments, and finance lease income recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment on the lease. Negative effective interest accruing to financial assets is presented in interest payable.\n\nOther interest relating to financial instruments measured at fair value is recognised as part of the movement in fair value.\n\nFees in respect of services are recognised as the right to consideration accrues through the performance of each distinct service obligation to the customer. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of providing the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is usually fixed and always determinable.\n\n## 4. Assets held for sale\n\nA non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for sale if NatWest Group will recover its carrying amount principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\n\n## 5. Employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, and other benefits are accounted for on an accruals basis over the period in which the employees provide the related services. Employees may receive variable compensation satisfied by cash, by debt instruments issued by NatWest Group or by NatWest Group plc shares. NatWest Group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes under which it awards NatWest Group plc shares and share options to its employees. Such awards are generally subject to vesting conditions.\n\nVariable compensation that is settled in cash or debt instruments is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of forfeiture and clawback criteria.\n\nContributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in profit or loss as employee service costs accrue.\n\nFor defined benefit pension schemes, the net of the recognisable scheme assets and obligations is reported in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligation is measured on an actuarial basis. The charge to profit or loss for pension costs (mainly the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability) is recognised in operating expenses.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nActuarial gains and losses (i.e. gains and/or losses on re-measuring the net defined benefit asset or liability) are recognised in other comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise. The difference between scheme assets and scheme liabilities, the net defined benefit asset or liability, is recognised in the balance sheet subject to the asset celling test which requires the net defined benefit surplus to be limited to the present value of any economic benefits available to NatWest Group in the form of refunds from the plan or reduced contributions to it.\n\n## 6. Intangible assets and goodwill\n\nIntangible assets acquired by NatWest Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to profit or loss over the assets' estimated useful economic lives using methods that best reflect the pattern of economic benefits and is included in Depreciation and amortisation. These estimated useful economic lives are:\n\nComputer software\n\n3 to 12 years\n\nOther acquired intangibles\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is written-off as incurred. Direct costs relating to the development of internaluse computer software are capitalised once technical feasibility and economic viability have been established. These costs include payroll, the costs of materials and services, and directly attributable overheads. Capitalisation of costs ceases when the software is capable of operating as intended. During and after development, accumulated costs are reviewed for impairment against the benefits that the software is expected to generate. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technical feasibility and economic viability are expensed as incurred, as are all training costs and general overheads. The costs of licences to use computer software that are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year are also capitalised.\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of a subsidiary is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any existing interest in the subsidiary and the amount of any non-controlling interest measured either at fair value or at its share of the subsidiary's net assets over the net fair value of the subsidiary's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.\n\nGoodwill is measured at initial cost less any subsequent impairment losses. The gain or loss on the disposal of a subsidiary includes the carrying value of any related goodwill.\n\n## 7. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each balance sheet date, NatWest Group assesses whether there is any indication that its intangible assets, rights of use or property, plant and equipment are impaired. If any such indication exists, NatWest Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and the\n\nimpairment loss, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset that does not generate cash flows that are independent from those of other assets or groups of assets, is determined as part of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of NatWest Group's cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit discounted at a rate that reflects market interest rates adjusted for risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit that have not been taken into account in estimating future cash flows.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount of an intangible or tangible asset is less than its carrying value. The carrying value of the asset is reduced by the amount of the loss and a charge recognised in profit or loss. A reversal of an impairment loss on intangible assets (excluding goodwill) or property, plant and equipment can be recognised when an increase in service potential arises provided the increased carrying value is not greater than it would have been had no impairment loss been recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.\n\n## 8. Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are reported in income from trading activities except for differences arising on cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations (see Accounting policy 20).\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into the relevant functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the values are determined. Translation differences arising on non-monetary items measured at fair value are recognised in profit or loss except for differences arising on nonmonetary financial assets classified as fair value through OCI, for example equity shares, which are recognised in other comprehensive\n\nincome unless the asset is the hedged item in a fair value hedge.\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income. The amount accumulated in equity is reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of a foreign operation.\n\n## 9. Leases\n\n## As lessor\n\nFinance lease contracts are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to a customer. All other contracts with customers to lease assets are classified as operating leases.\n\nLoans to customers include finance lease receivables measured at the net investment in the lease, comprising the minimum lease payments and any unguaranteed residual value discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Interest receivable includes finance lease income recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment. Unguaranteed residual values are subject to regular review; if there is a reduction in their value, income allocation is revised and any reduction in respect of amounts accrued is recognised immediately.\n\nRental income from operating leases is recognised in other operating income on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis better represents the time pattern of the asset's use. Operating lease assets are included within Property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives.\n\n## As lessee\n\nOn entering a new lease contract, NatWest Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability to pay future rentals. The liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the applicable incremental borrowing rate. The right of use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease and the useful economic life, subject to review for impairment.\n\nShort term and low value leased assets are expensed on a systematic basis.\n\n## 10. Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nNatWest Group recognises a provision for a present obligation resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\nProvision is made for restructuring costs, including the costs of redundancy, when",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nNatWest Group has a constructive obligation to restructure. An obligation exists when NatWest Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features.\n\nNatWest Group recognises any onerous cost of the present obligation under a contract as a provision. An onerous cost is the unavoidable cost of meeting NatWest Group's contractual obligations that exceed the expected economic benefits. When NatWest Group vacates a leasehold property, the right of use asset would be tested for impairment and a provision may be recognised for the ancillary contractual occupancy costs, such as rates.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because either an outflow of economic benefits is not probable or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but information about them is disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow of economic benefits in settlement is remote.\n\n## 11. Tax\n\nIncome tax expense or income, comprising current tax and deferred tax, is recorded in the income statement except income tax on items recognised outside profit or loss which is credited or charged to other comprehensive income. The tax consequences of servicing equity instruments are recognised in the income statement.\n\nCurrent tax is income tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year arising in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity. Provision is made for current tax at rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and the carrying amount for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent their recovery is probable.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences that arise from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction (other than a business combination) that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates expected to apply in the periods when the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where NatWest Group has a legally\n\nenforceable right to offset and where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority either on an individual NatWest Group company or on NatWest Group companies in the same tax group that intend, in future periods, to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or on a gross basis simultaneously.\n\nAccounting for taxes is judgmental and carries a degree of uncertainty because tax law is subject to interpretation, which might be questioned by the relevant tax authority. NatWest Group recognises the most likely current and deferred tax liability or asset, assessed for uncertainty using consistent judgments and estimates. Current and deferred tax assets are only recognised where their recovery is deemed probable, and current and deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the amount that represents the best estimate of the probable outcome having regard to their acceptance by the tax authorities.\n\n## 12. Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are classified either by product, by business model or by reference to the IFRS default classification.\n\nClassification by product relies on specific designation criteria which are applicable to certain classes of financial assets or circumstances where accounting mismatches would otherwise arise. Classification by business model reflects how NatWest Group manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. A business model assessment determines if cash flows result from holding financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows, from selling those financial assets, or both.\n\nThe product classifications apply to financial assets that are either designated at fair value through profit or loss (DFV), or to equity investments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets may also be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates, or significantly reduces, accounting mismatch. In all other instances, fair value through profit or loss (MFVTPL) is the default classification and measurement category for financial assets.\n\nRegular way purchases of financial assets classified as amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date; all other regular way transactions in financial assets are recognised on the trade date.\n\nBusiness model assessment of assets is made at portfolio level, being the level at which they are managed to achieve a predefined business objective. This is expected to result in the most consistent classification of assets because it aligns with the stated objectives of the portfolio, its risk management, manager's remuneration and the ability to monitor sales of assets from a portfolio.\n\nFinancial assets which are managed under a 'held to collect' business model, and have contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost.\n\nOther financial assets which are managed under a business model of both 'held to collect and sell' and have contractual cash flows comprising solely of payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').\n\nThe contractual terms of a facility; any leverage features; prepayment and extension terms; and triggers that might reset the effective rate of interest; are considered in determining whether cash flows comprise solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nAll financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition.\n\nAll liabilities not subsequently measured at fair value are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## 13. Impairment: expected credit losses (ECL)\n\nAt each balance sheet date each financial asset or portfolio of loans measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, issued financial guarantee and loan commitment is assessed for impairment and presented as impairments in the income statement. Loss allowances are forward-looking, based on 12 month ECL where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk rating, otherwise allowances are based on lifetime expected losses.\n\nECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. The probability is determined by the risk of default which is applied to the cash flow estimates. In the absence of a change in credit rating, allowances are recognised when there is a reduction in the net present value of expected cash flows. On a significant increase in credit risk, allowances are recognised without a change in the expected cash flows, although typically expected cash flows do change also; and ECL are adjusted from 12 month to lifetime expectations.\n\nJudgement is exercised as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 Models - in certain low default portfolios, Basel parameter estimates are also applied for IFRS 9.\n- \uf0b7 Non-modelled portfolios, mainly in Private Banking, RBSI and Lombard, use a standardised capital requirement under Basel II. Under IFRS 9, they have bespoke treatments for the identification of significant increase in credit risk. Benchmark PDs, EADs and LGDs are reviewed annually for appropriateness. The ECL calculation is based on expected future cash flows, which is typically applied at a portfolio level.\n- \uf0b7 Multiple economic scenarios (MES) - the central, or base, scenario is most critical to the ECL calculation, independent of the\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the current probability of default over the remaining lifetime) with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nOn restructuring a financial asset without causing derecognition of the original asset, the revised cash flows are used in reestimating the credit loss. Where restructuring causes derecognition of the original financial asset, the fair value of the replacement asset is used as the closing cash flow of the original asset.\n\nWhere, in the course of the orderly realisation of a loan, it is exchanged for equity shares or property, the exchange is accounted for as the sale of the loan and the acquisition of equity securities or investment property. Where NatWest Group's interest in equity shares following the exchange is such that NatWest Group controls an entity, that entity is consolidated.\n\nImpaired loans are written off and therefore derecognised from the balance sheet when NatWest Group concludes that there is no longer any realistic prospect of recovery of part, or all, of the loan. For loans that are individually assessed for impairment, the timing of the write-off is determined on a case by case basis. Such loans are reviewed regularly and write-off will be prompted by bankruptcy, insolvency, renegotiation and similar events.\n\nThe typical time frames from initial impairment to write-off for NatWest Group's collectivelyassessed portfolios are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Retail mortgages: write-off usually occurs within five years, or earlier,  when an account is closed,  but can be longer where the customer engages constructively,\n- \uf0b7 Credit cards: the irrecoverable amount is typically written off after twelve arrears cycles  or at four years post default any remaining amounts outstanding are written off,\n- \uf0b7 Overdrafts and other unsecured loans: write-off occurs within six years,\n- \uf0b7 Commercial loans: write-offs are determined in the light of individual circumstances; and Business loans are generally written off within five years.\n\n## 14. Financial guarantee contracts\n\nUnder a financial guarantee contract, NatWest Group, in return for a fee, undertakes to meet a customer's obligations under the terms of a debt instrument if the customer fails to do so. A financial guarantee is recognised as a liability; initially at fair value and, if not\n\ndesignated as at fair value through profit or loss, subsequently at the higher of its initial value less cumulative amortisation and any provision under the contract measured in accordance with Accounting policy 13. Amortisation is calculated  to recognise fees receivable in profit or loss over the period of the guarantee.\n\n## 15. Loan commitments\n\nProvision is made for ECL on loan commitments, other than those classified as held-for-trading. Syndicated loan commitments in excess of the level of lending under the commitment approved for retention by NatWest Group are classified as held-fortrading and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 16. Derecognition\n\nA financial asset is derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired or when it has been transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. Conversely, an asset is not derecognised by a contract under which NatWest Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred, NatWest Group does not derecognise an asset over which it has retained control but limits its recognition to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\nA financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation is discharged, or is cancelled, or expires.\n\n## 17. Sale and repurchase transactions\n\nSecurities subject to a sale and repurchase agreement under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by NatWest Group continue to be shown on the balance sheet and the sale proceeds recorded as a financial liability. Securities acquired in a reverse sale and repurchase transaction under which NatWest Group is not exposed to substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are not recognised on the balance sheet and the consideration paid is recorded as a financial asset. Sale and repurchase transactions that are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the consideration paid or received and the repurchase or resale price is treated as interest and recognised in interest income or interest expense over the life of the transaction.\n\n## 18. Netting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, NatWest Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. NatWest Group is party to a number of arrangements, including master netting agreements, that give it the right to offset financial assets and financial liabilities, but where it does not intend to settle the\n\namounts net or simultaneously, the assets and liabilities concerned are presented gross.\n\n## 19. Capital instruments\n\nNatWest Group classifies a financial instrument that it issues as a liability if it is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities on potentially unfavourable terms and as equity if it evidences a residual interest in the assets of NatWest Group after the deduction of liabilities. The components of a compound financial instrument issued by NatWest Group are classified and accounted for separately as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity as appropriate. Incremental costs and related tax that are directly attributable to an equity transaction are deducted from equity.\n\nThe consideration for any ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc purchased by NatWest Group (treasury shares) is deducted from equity. On the cancellation of treasury shares their nominal value is removed from equity and any excess of consideration over nominal value is treated in accordance with the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nOn the sale or re-issue of treasury shares the consideration received and related tax are credited to equity, net of any directly attributable incremental costs.\n\n## 20. Derivatives and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. NatWest Group's approach to determining the fair value of financial instruments is set out in the Critical accounting policies section and key sources of estimation uncertainty entitled Fair value financial instruments; further details are given in Notes 10 and 12 to the accounts.\n\nA derivative embedded in a financial liability contract is accounted for as a stand-alone derivative if its economic characteristics are not closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; unless the entire contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not the hedging instrument in a qualifying hedge are recognised as they arise in profit or loss. Gains and losses are recorded in Income from trading activities except for gains and losses on those derivatives that are managed together with financial instruments designated at fair value; these gains and losses are included in Other operating income. NatWest Group enters into three types of hedge relationship: hedges of changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or unrecognised firm commitment (fair value hedges); hedges of the variability in cash flows from a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges); and hedges of the net",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\ninvestment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).\n\nHedge relationships are formally designated\n\nand documented at inception in line with the requirements of IAS 39 Financial instruments - Recognition and measurement . The documentation identifies the hedged item, the hedging instrument and details of the risk that is being hedged and the way in which effectiveness will be assessed at inception and during the period of the hedge. If the hedge is not highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the documented risk management strategy, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge accounting is also discontinued if NatWest Group revokes the designation of a hedge relationship.\n\nFair value hedge in a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in profit or loss and, where the hedged item is measured at amortised cost, adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting; or if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or if hedge designation is revoked. If the hedged item is one for which the effective interest rate method is used, any cumulative adjustment is amortised to profit or loss over the life of the hedged item using a recalculated effective interest rate.\n\nCash flow hedge in a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in profit or loss. When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same periods in which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss at the same time as the hedged transaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting; if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur; or if hedge designation is revoked. On the discontinuation of hedge accounting (except where a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur), the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur or, if the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, when the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. Where a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss immediately.\n\n## Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation\n\n- -In the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of foreign exchange differences arising on the hedging instrument determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Non-derivative financial liabilities as well as derivatives may be the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge. On disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.\n\n## 21. Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which NatWest Group has significant influence. A joint venture is one which it controls jointly with other parties. Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. They are stated initially at cost, including attributable goodwill, and subsequently adjusted for postacquisition changes in NatWest Group's share of net assets.\n\n## 22. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nIn the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash and deposits with banks with an original maturity of less than three months together with short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## 23. Shares in Group entities\n\nNatWest Group plc's investments in its subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment.\n\n## Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe reported results of NatWest Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its accounts. UK company law and IFRS require the directors, in preparing NatWest Group's accounts, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. In the absence of an applicable standard or interpretation, IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors', requires management to develop and apply an accounting policy that results in relevant and reliable information in the light of the requirements and guidance in IFRS dealing with similar and related issues and the IASB's 'Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting'. The judgements and assumptions involved in NatWest Group's accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are discussed below. The use of estimates, assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by NatWest Group would affect its reported results. During 2020, estimation uncertainty has been affected by the COVID19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause significant economic and social disruption during 2020. Key financial estimates are based on management's latest five-year revenue and cost forecasts.\n\nMeasurement of goodwill, deferred tax and expected credit losses are highly sensitive to reasonably possible changes in those anticipated conditions. Other reasonably possible assumptions about the future include a prolonged financial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy of the UK and other countries. Changes in judgements and assumptions could result in a material adjustment to those estimates in the next reporting periods. Consideration of this source of estimation uncertainty has been set out in the notes below (as applicable).\n\n| Critical accounting policy             |   Note |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|\n| Deferred tax                           |      7 |\n| Fair value - financial instruments     |     12 |\n| Loan impairment provisions             |     14 |\n| Goodwill                               |     16 |\n| Provisions for liabilities and charges |     20 |\n\nFuture accounting developments International Financial Reporting Standards\n\n## COVID-19 amendments on lease modifications - Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16)\n\nThe IASB published 'amendments to IFRS 16 covering COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions'. These provide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a COVID19 related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. The effect of the amendment on NatWest Group's accounts is immaterial and will be adopted from 1 January 2021.\n\nOther new standards and amendments that are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022, with earlier application permitted, are set out below.\n\n## Effective 1 January 2022\n\n- \uf0b7 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37).\n- \uf0b7 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16).\n- \uf0b7 Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3).\n- \uf0b7 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1).\n- \uf0b7 Fees in the '10 per cent' test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IFRS 9).\n\n## Effective 1 January 2023\n\n- \uf0b7 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts).\n\nNatWest Group is assessing the effect of adopting these standards and amendments on its financial statements but do not expect the effect to be material.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the instrument's yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instrument are considered when estimating future cash flows. Included in interest receivable is finance lease income which is recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment.\n\n## 2 Non-interest income\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Net fees and commissions (1)                                                                                       | 2,012     | 2,511     | 2,357      |\n| Income from trading activities                                                                                     |           |           |            |\n| Foreign exchange                                                                                                   | 569       | 448       | 643        |\n| Interest rate                                                                                                      | 541       | 532       | 695        |\n| Credit                                                                                                             | 3         | 32        | 45         |\n| Changes in fair value of own debt and derivative liabilities attributable to own credit risk                       |           |           |            |\n| - debt securities in issue                                                                                         | (24)      | (60)      | 72         |\n| - derivative liabilities                                                                                           | -         | (20)      | 20         |\n| Equities, commodities and other                                                                                    | 36        | -         | 32         |\n|                                                                                                                    | 1,125     | 932       | 1,507      |\n| Other operating income                                                                                             |           |           |            |\n| Loss on redemption of own debt                                                                                     | (324)     | -         | -          |\n| Operating lease and other rental income                                                                            | 232       | 250       | 256        |\n| Changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value  through profit or loss (2) | (54)      | (17)      | (26)       |\n| Changes in fair value of other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (3)                           | 2         | 58        | 18         |\n| Hedge ineffectiveness                                                                                              | 24        | 48        | (65)       |\n| (Loss)/profit on disposal of amortised cost assets                                                                 | (18)      | 42        | 44         |\n| Profit/(loss) on disposal of fair value through other comprehensive income assets                                  | 96        | (22)      | 34         |\n| Profit on sale of property, plant and equipment                                                                    | 13        | 58        | 50         |\n| Share of (losses)/profits of associated entities                                                                   | (30)      | (14)      | 83         |\n| (Loss)/profit on disposal of subsidiaries and associates (4)                                                       | (16)      | 2,224     | (72)       |\n| Other income (5, 6)                                                                                                | (15)      | 136       | 560        |\n|                                                                                                                    | (90)      | 2,763     | 882        |\n|                                                                                                                    | 3,047     | 6,206     | 4,746      |\n\n## Notes:",

This includes the review of net interest income for each class of business. Interest receivable and payable for all reportable segments is therefore presented net. Segments charge market prices for services rendered between each other; funding charges between segments are determined by NatWest Group Treasury, having regard to commercial demands. The segment performance measure is operating profit/(loss).\n\nReportable operating segments: The reportable operating segments are as follows:\n\nRetail Banking serves individuals and mass affluent customers in the UK and includes Ulster Bank customers in Northern Ireland.\n\nUlster Bank RoI serves individuals and businesses in the Republic of Ireland (RoI).\n\nCommercial Banking serves start-up, SME, commercial and corporate customers in the UK.\n\nPrivate Banking serves UK connected high net worth individuals and their business interests.\n\nRBS International (RBSI) serves retail, commercial, and corporate customers in the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Gibraltar, and financial institution customers in those same locations in addition to the UK and Luxembourg.\n\nNatWest Markets (NWM) helps NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customers manage their financial risks safely and achieve their short-term and long-term sustainable financial goals.\n\nCentral items & other includes corporate functions, such as NatWest Group Treasury, finance, risk management, compliance, legal, communications and human resources. Central functions manages NatWest Group capital resources and NatWest Group-wide regulatory projects and provides services to the reportable segments. Balances in relation to legacy litigation issues and the international private banking business are included in Central items in the relevant periods.\n\n## Allocation of central balance sheet items\n\nNatWest Group allocates all central costs relating to Services and Functions to the business using appropriate drivers; these are reported as indirect costs in the segmental income statements. Assets and riskweighted assets held centrally, mainly relating to NatWest Group Treasury, are allocated to the business using appropriate drivers.\n\n| 2020                          | Retail Banking \u00a3m   | Ulster Bank RoI \u00a3m   | Commercial Banking \u00a3m   | Private Banking \u00a3m   | RBSI \u00a3m   | NWM \u00a3m   | Central items & other (1) \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|------------|\n| Net interest income           | 3,868               | 395                  | 2,740                   | 489                  | 371       | (57)     | (57)                           | 7,749      |\n| Net fees and commissions      | 379                 | 89                   | 1,110                   | 257                  | 94        | 99       | (16)                           | 2,012      |\n| Other non-interest income     | (66)                | 26                   | 108                     | 17                   | 32        | 1,081    | (163)                          | 1,035      |\n| Total income                  | 4,181               | 510                  | 3,958                   | 763                  | 497       | 1,123    | (236)                          | 10,796     |\n| Operating expenses            | (2,540)             | (486)                | (2,281)                 | (447)                | (274)     | (1,294)  | 322                            | (7,000)    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | -                   | -                    | (149)                   | (8)                  | (17)      | (16)     | (715)                          | (905)      |\n| Impairment losses             | (792)               | (250)                | (1,927)                 | (100)                | (107)     | (40)     | (26)                           | (3,242)    |\n| Operating profit/(loss)       | 849                 | (226)                | (399)                   | 208                  | 99        | (227)    | (655)                          | (351)      |\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

The trustees are the legal owner of a scheme's assets, and have a duty to act in the best interests of all scheme members.\n\nThe schemes generally provide a pension of one-sixtieth of final pensionable salary for each year of service prior to retirement up to a maximum of 40 years and are contributory for current members. These have been closed to new entrants for over ten years, although current members continue to build up additional pension benefits, currently subject to 2% maximum annual salary inflation, while they remain employed by NatWest Group.\n\nThe Main section corporate trustee is NatWest Pension Trustee Limited (the Trustee), a wholly owned subsidiary of NWB Plc, Principal Employer of the Main section. The Board of the Trustee comprises four member trustee directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and pensioner members who apply and six appointed by NatWest Group. Under UK legislation, a defined benefit pension scheme is required to meet the statutory funding objective of having sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its liabilities (the pensions that have been promised to members).\n\nSimilar governance principles apply to NatWest Group's other pension schemes.\n\n## Investment strategy\n\nThe assets of the Main section, which is typical of other group schemes, represent 90% of plan assets at 31 December 2020 (2019 90%) and are invested as shown below.\n\nThe Main section employs derivative instruments to achieve a desired asset class exposure and to reduce the section's interest rate, inflation and currency risk. This means that the net funding position is considerably less sensitive to changes in market conditions than the value of the assets or liabilities in isolation.\n\n| Major classes of plan assets as a percentage of   | 2020     | 2020       | 2020    | 2019     | 2019       | 2019    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|----------|------------|---------|\n| total plan assets of the Main section             | Quoted % | Unquoted % | Total % | Quoted % | Unquoted % | Total % |\n| Equities                                          | 3.9      | 4.6        | 8.5     | 3.9      | 4.8        | 8.7     |\n| Index linked bonds                                | 49.4     | -          | 49.4    | 47.8     | -          | 47.8    |\n| Government bonds                                  | 6.2      | -          | 6.2     | 9.3      | -          | 9.3     |\n| Corporate and other bonds                         | 11.8     | 5.0        | 16.8    | 11.6     | 5.0        | 16.6    |\n| Real estate                                       | -        | 4.2        | 4.2     | -        | 4.8        | 4.8     |\n| Derivatives                                       | -        | 10.0       | 10.0    | -        | 7.8        | 7.8     |\n| Cash and other assets                             | -        | 4.9        | 4.9     | -        | 5.0        | 5.0     |\n|                                                   | 71.3     | 28.7       | 100.0   | 72.6     | 27.4       | 100.0   |\n\nThe Main section's holdings of derivative instruments are summarised in the table below:\n\n|                              | 2020     | 2020       | 2020        | 2019     | 2019       | 2019        |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n|                              | Notional | Fair value | Fair value  | Notional | Fair value | Fair value  |\n|                              | amounts  | Assets     | Liabilities | amounts  | Assets     | Liabilities |\n|                              | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          |\n| Inflation rate swaps         | 18       | 1,390      | 1,716       | 16       | 909        | 1,094       |\n| Interest rate swaps          | 68       | 11,197     | 6,215       | 57       | 6,407      | 2,992       |\n| Currency forwards            | 11       | 334        | 38          | 9        | 215        | 42          |\n| Equity and bond call options | 1        | 169        | 1           | 1        | 122        | -           |\n| Equity and bond put options  | 3        | 1          | 19          | 5        | 3          | 1           |\n| Other                        | 2        | 63         | 17          | 3        | 124        | 13          |\n\nSwaps have been executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads with a number of counterparty banks, including NWB Plc.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the gross notional value of the swaps was \u00a388 billion (2019 - \u00a375 billion) and had a net positive fair value of \u00a34,706 million (2019 - \u00a33,340 million) against which the banks had posted approximately 104% collateral.\n\nThe schemes do not invest directly in NatWest Group but can have exposure to NatWest Group.

The trustees and the sponsor, with the support of the Scheme Actuary, agree the assumptions used to value the liabilities and a Schedule of Contributions required to eliminate any funding deficit. The funding assumptions incorporate a margin for prudence over and above the expected cost of providing the benefits promised to members, taking into account the sponsor's covenant and the investment strategy of the scheme. Similar arrangements apply in the other territories where the NatWest Group sponsors defined benefit pension schemes. The last funding valuation of the Main section was at 31 December 2017. The next funding valuation, as at 31 December 2020, is to be agreed by 31 March 2022.\n\nIn 2018, the Group recognised an updated estimate of the impact of guaranteed minimum pension equalisation (\u00a3102m) following the clarity provided by the October 2018 Court ruling. Discussions around implementing changes to benefits are well advanced, and the estimate has been revised to \u00a3169m (2019: \u00a3141m) to reflect this.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nPlacing a value on NatWest Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires NatWest Group's management to make a number of assumptions, with the support of independent actuaries. The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations depends upon actual future events and the assumptions made are unlikely to be exactly borne out in practice, meaning the final cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\nThe triennial funding valuation of the Main section as at 31 December 2017 determined the funding level to be 96%, pension liabilities to be \u00a347 billion and the deficit to be \u00a32 billion, which was eliminated by a \u00a32 billion cash payment in October 2018. The average cost of the future service of current members is 44% of salary before administrative expenses and contributions from those members.\n\nThe most significant assumptions used for the Main section are shown below:\n\n|                                         | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions   | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions   |                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2020 %                                   | 2019 %                                   | Principal assumptions of Main section 2017 triennial valuation |\n| Discount rate                           | 1.4                                      | 2.1                                      | Fixed interest swap yield curve plus 0.8% per  annum           |\n| Inflation assumption (RPI)              | 2.9                                      | 2.9                                      | RPI swap yield curve                                           |\n| Rate of increase in salaries            | 1.8                                      | 1.8                                      |                                                                |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions   | 3.0                                      | 3.0                                      |                                                                |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment | 2.7                                      | 2.8                                      | Modelled allowance for relevant caps and floors                |\n| Lump sum conversion rate at retirement  | 20                                       | 20                                       | 18%                                                            |\n| Longevity at age 60:                    | years                                    | years                                    |                                                                |\n| Current pensioners                      |                                          |                                          |                                                                |\n| Males                                   | 27.1                                     | 26.9                                     | 28.1                                                           |\n| Females                                 | 29.0                                     | 28.7                                     | 29.7                                                           |\n| Future pensioners, currently aged 40    |                                          |                                          |                                                                |\n| Males                                   | 28.3                                     | 28.2                                     | 29.3                                                           |\n| Females                                 | 30.4                                     | 30.2                                     | 31.5                                                           |\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe IAS 19 valuation uses a single discount rate set by reference to the yield on a basket of 'high quality' sterling corporate bonds. For the triennial valuation discounting is by reference to a yield curve.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the Main section's defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2020 is 22 years (2019 - 21 years).\n\nSignificant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the basket of bonds that is used to determine the discount rate used in the IAS 19 valuations. The criteria include issue size, quality of pricing and the exclusion of outliers. Judgement is also required in determining the shape of the yield curve at long durations; a constant credit spread relative to gilts is assumed. Sensitivity to the main assumptions is presented below.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

NatWest Group's auditors are permitted to tender for such work in competition with other firms where the work is permissible under audit independence rules.\n\n|                                                       | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Fees payable for:                                     |           |           |            |\n| - the audit of NatWest Group's annual accounts (1)    | 4.7       | 3.8       | 3.5        |\n| - the audit of NatWest Group plc's subsidiaries (1)   | 30.6      | 25.7      | 27.5       |\n| - audit-related assurance services (1,2)              | 4.7       | 3.2       | 2.9        |\n| Total audit and audit-related assurance services fees | 40.0      | 32.7      | 33.9       |\n| Other assurance services                              | 0.6       | 1.2       | 1.3        |\n| Corporate finance services (3)                        | 0.4       | 0.6       | 0.2        |\n| Total other services                                  | 1.0       | 1.8       | 1.5        |\n\n## Notes:\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

The tax treatment of some transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax charges in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\n|                        | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax asset     | (901)     | (1,011)   |\n| Deferred tax liability | 291       | 266       |\n| Net deferred tax asset | (610)     | (745)     |",

This includes amounts recognised in respect of UK trading losses of \u00a3862 million (31 December 2019 - \u00a3770 million). Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits to recover them.\n\nJudgment - NatWest Group has considered the carrying value of deferred tax assets and concluded that, based on management's estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover recognised deferred tax assets.\n\nEstimate -These estimates are partly based on forecast performance beyond the horizon for management's detailed plans. They have regard to inherent uncertainties, such as Brexit, climate change, and the impact of COVID. The deferred tax asset in NWM Group is supported by way of future reversing temporary timing differences on which deferred tax liabilities are recognised at 31 December 2020.\n\nUK tax losses - Under UK tax rules, tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. As the recognised tax losses in NatWest Group arose prior to 1 April 2015, credit in future periods is given against 25% of profits at the main rate of UK corporation tax, excluding the Banking Surcharge 8% rate introduced by The Finance (No. 2) Act 2015. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2020 take into account the reduced rates in respect of tax losses and temporary differences and where appropriate, the banking surcharge inclusive rate in respect of other banking temporary differences.\n\nNWM Plc - NWM Plc expects that the balance of recognised deferred tax asset at 31 December 2020 of \u00a362 million (2019 - \u00a375 million) in respect of tax losses amounting to approximately \u00a3325 million will be recovered by the end of 2027. The movement in the current financial year reflects a \u00a322 million decrease in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset, offset by a \u00a39m increase due to the UK tax rate change impact.\n\nNWB Plc - A deferred tax asset of \u00a3592 million has been recognised in respect of total losses of \u00a33,117 million. The losses arose principally as a result of significant impairment and conduct charges between 2009 and 2012 during challenging economic conditions in the UK banking sector. NWB Plc returned to tax profitability during 2015 and expects the deferred tax asset to be utilised against future taxable profits by the end of 2026.\n\nRBS plc - A deferred tax asset of \u00a3200 million has been recognised in respect of losses of \u00a31,053 million of total losses of \u00a34,242 million carried forward at 31 December 2020. The losses were transferred from NatWest Markets Plc as a consequence of the ring fencing regulations. RBS plc expects the deferred tax asset to be utilised against future taxable profits by the end of 2026.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

The losses arose principally as a result of significant impairment charges between 2008 and 2013 during challenging economic conditions in the Republic of Ireland. A deferred tax asset of \u00a343 million has been recognised at 31 December 2020 in respect of \u00a3342 million of those total losses. The movement in the current financial year reflects a \u00a3146 million reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset based on a revised economic outlook, and \u00a3:\u20ac exchange differences. UBIDAC expects the deferred tax asset to be utilised against future taxable profits by the end of 2029.\n\nNatWest Market N.V. (NWM N.V.) -NWM N.V. Group management did not recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of losses carried forward at 31 December 2020 due to the implications from the wider strategic review of the NWM franchise, and the uncertainty around the consequences of Brexit on the volume and pace of transfers of business from NWM Plc and NWB Plc to NWM N.V..\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a34,965 million (2019 - \u00a34,653 million; 2018 \u00a35,118, million) have not been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences carried forward of \u00a325,091 million (2019 \u00a323,555 million; 2018 - \u00a325,597 million) in jurisdictions where doubt exists over the availability of future taxable profits. Of these losses and other temporary differences, \u00a3714 million expire within five years and \u00a34,496 million thereafter. The balance of tax losses and other temporary differences carried forward has no expiry date.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities of \u00a3242 million (2019 - \u00a3262 million; 2018 - \u00a3257 million) have not been recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and held-over gains on the incorporation of certain overseas branches. Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further taxation. No taxation is expected to arise in the foreseeable future in respect of held-over gains on which deferred tax is not recognised. Changes to UK tax legislation largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.\n\n## 8 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Earnings                                                                       |           |           |            |\n| (Loss)/Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders                            | (753)     | 3,133     | 1,622      |\n| Weighted average number of shares (millions)                                   |           |           |            |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year         | 12,095    | 12,067    | 12,009     |\n| Effect of dilutive share options and convertible securities                    | 23        | 35        | 52         |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year | 12,118    | 12,102    | 12,061     |\n\n## 9 Trading assets and liabilities\n\nTrading assets and liabilities comprise assets and liabilities held at fair value in trading portfolios.\n\n| Assets                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans                                |           |           |\n| Reverse repos                        | 19,404    | 24,095    |\n| Collateral given                     | 18,760    | 20,579    |\n| Other loans                          | 1,611     | 1,947     |\n| Total loans                          | 39,775    | 46,621    |\n| Securities                           |           |           |\n| Central and local government         |           |           |\n| - UK                                 | 4,184     | 4,897     |\n| - US                                 | 5,149     | 5,458     |\n| - Other                              | 16,436    | 14,902    |\n| Financial institutions and Corporate | 3,446     | 4,867     |\n| Total securities                     | 29,215    | 30,124    |\n| Total                                | 68,990    | 76,745    |\n| Liabilities                          |           |           |\n| Deposits                             |           |           |\n| Repos                                | 19,036    | 27,885    |\n| Collateral received                  | 23,229    | 21,509    |\n| Other deposits                       | 1,804     | 1,606     |\n| Total deposits                       | 44,069    | 51,000    |\n| Debt securities in issue             | 1,408     | 1,762     |\n| Short positions                      | 26,779    | 21,187    |\n| Total                                | 72,256    | 73,949    |",

NatWest Group manages this risk within approved limits. Residual risk positions are hedged with derivatives, principally interest rate swaps. Suitable larger financial instruments are fair value hedged; the remaining exposure, where possible, is hedged by derivatives documented as cash flow hedges.\n\nCash flow hedges of interest rate risk relates to exposures to the variability in future interest payments and receipts due to the movement of benchmark interest rates on forecast transactions and on recognised financial assets and financial liabilities. This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps, fixing the hedged cash flows. For these cash flow hedge relationships, the hedged items are actual and forecast variable interest rate cash flows arising from financial assets and financial liabilities with interest rates linked to the relevant benchmark rate LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA, the Bank of England Official Bank Rate or the European Central Bank Refinance Rate. The variability in cash flows due to movements in the relevant benchmark rate is hedged; this risk component is identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group. This risk component comprises the majority of cash flow variability risk.\n\nFair value hedges of interest rate risk involve interest rate swaps transforming the fixed interest rate risk in recognised financial assets and financial liabilities to floating. The hedged risk is the risk of changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate embedded in the hedged item. The significant embedded benchmarks are LIBOR, EURIBOR and SONIA. This risk component is identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group. This risk component comprises the majority of the hedged items fair value risk.\n\nNatWest Group hedges the exchange rate risk of its net investment in foreign currency denominated operations with currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts. NatWest Group reviews the value of the investments' net assets, executing hedges where appropriate to reduce the sensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movement. Hedge accounting relationships will be designated where required.\n\nExchange rate risk also arises in NatWest Group where payments are denominated in different currencies than the functional currency. Residual risk positions are hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts. Exposure to the variability in future payments due to the movement of foreign exchange rates is hedged, fixing the exchange rate the payments will be settled in. The derivatives are documented as cash flow hedges.\n\nFor all cash flow hedging and fair value hedge relationships NatWest Group determines that there is an adequate level of offsetting between the hedged item and hedging instrument by assessing the initial and ongoing effectiveness by comparing movements in the fair value of the\n\nexpected highly probable forecast interest cash flows/fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk with movements in the fair value of the expected changes in cash flows from the hedging interest rate swap. Hedge effectiveness is measured on a cumulative basis over a time period management determines to be appropriate. NatWest Group uses either the actual ratio between the hedged item and hedging instrument(s) or one that minimises hedge ineffectiveness to establish the hedge ratio for hedge accounting.\n\nA number of the current cash flow and fair value hedges of interest rate risk that mature post 31 December 2021 will be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. NatWest Group early adopted the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 issued in September 2019 for reporting periods beginning 1 January 2019; these amendments are known as Phase 1 relief. The relief allows, where uncertainty arising from benchmark rate reform exists, the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 When assessing if affected forecasted cash flows are highly probable or still expected to occur; it is assumed the IBOR based forecasted hedged cash flows are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n- \uf0b7 For the purpose of the prospective effectiveness assessment; it is assumed the IBOR based hedged cash flows and/ or hedged risk are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n- \uf0b7 Hedge accounting relationships will not be discontinued if they fall outside the 80 - 125% range when performing a retrospective effectiveness assessment.\n- \uf0b7 The assessment as to whether a non-contractually specified IBOR risk component is separately identifiable, is done only at the inception of the relationship.\n\nThe disclosures made for the notional of hedging instruments and risk exposures affected by interest rate benchmark reform contain information for both the hedging instrument and hedged risks even if only one of these will be directly impacted by the reform.\n\nNatWest Group early adopted the amendments to IAS 39 issued in August 2020 for reporting periods beginning 1 January 2021; these amendments are known as Phase 2 relief and apply at the point where components of a hedge accounting relationships transition to reference an alternative interest rate benchmark. Where relationships have transitioned in the year, the impacted hedge accounting relationships had their designations amended in line with the Phase 2 relief.\n\nThe following phase 2 reliefs have been applied:\n\n- \uf0b7 Where forecasted cash flows in cash flow hedge relationships have transitioned to an alternative benchmark interest rate, the relevant hedge accounting designations have been amended.\n- \uf0b7 As a result of the amended designations the balances in other comprehensive income linked to the transitioned forecasted cash flows are now deemed based on the alternative benchmark interest rate.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes the portfolio's policies and objectives, how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management; and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for sales.\n- \uf0b7 The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. A level of judgement is made in assessing terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including contingent and leverage features,  non-recourse arrangements and features that could modify the time value of money.",

In the UK, regulators, most notably the Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), have issued guidance on how market participants are expected to approach transition as well as the regulatory expectations in relation to the credit adjustment spread calculation methodologies, conversion strategies amongst, existence of products referencing IBOR benchmark rates amongst other items.\n\nThe group-wide programme continued to address the key areas that will be affected by the IBOR reform most notably:\n\n- \uf0b7 Client stratification, engagement and education;\n- \uf0b7 Contract fall-back remediation;\n- \uf0b7 Transition on an economically equivalent basis;\n- \uf0b7 Effect of modifications to existing terms beyond those that are attributable to the IBOR reform;\n- \uf0b7 Funding and liquidity management, planning and forecast;\n- \uf0b7 Risk management;\n- \uf0b7 Financial reporting and valuation; and,\n- \uf0b7 Changes to processes and systems covering front-end, risk and finance systems.\n\n|                                     | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Balances not  subject to   | Expected         |          |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|----------|\n|                                     | GBP LIBOR \u00a3m                   | USD IBOR (1) \u00a3m                | EUR IBOR \u00a3m                    | Other IBOR \u00a3m                  | IBOR reform \u00a3m             | credit losses \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Trading assets                      | 75                             | 60                             | 348                            | 1                              | 68,506                     | -                | 68,990   |\n| Loans to banks - amortised cost     | 23                             | 82                             | 101                            | -                              | 6,751                      | (2)              | 6,955    |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost | 39,858                         | 5,289                          | 4,950                          | 234                            | 316,200                    | (5,987)          | 360,544  |\n| Other financial assets              | 2,847                          | 303                            | 370                            | 71                             | 51,568                     | (11)             | 55,148   |\n| Bank deposits                       | -                              | -                              | -                              | -                              | 20,606                     |                  | 20,606   |\n| Customer deposits                   | -                              | -                              | -                              | 4                              | 431,735                    |                  | 431,739  |\n| Trading liabilities                 | 54                             | 301                            | 269                            | 2                              | 71,630                     |                  | 72,256   |\n| Other financial liabilities         | 1,116                          | 9,792                          | 5,902                          | 146                            | 28,856                     |                  | 45,812   |\n| Subordinated liabilities            | 8                              | 1,286                          | 438                            | -                              | 8,230                      |                  | 9,962    |\n| Loan commitments (2)                | 25,616                         | 9,228                          | 7,176                          | 682                            | 79,220                     |                  | 121,922  |\n| Derivatives notional (\u00a3bn)          | 1,407.5                        | 1,368.8                        | 2,358.8                        | 289.6                          | 8,622.1                    |                  | 14,046.8 |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (1) USD LIBOR is now expected to convert to alternative risk free rates in mid-2023 subject to consultation.\n\nIncluded within the table above for derivatives were currency swaps with corresponding legs also subject to IBOR reform of GBP LIBOR of \u00a35.2 billion with USD IBOR \u00a32.0 billion, EUR IBOR \u00a32.9 billion and Other IBOR \u00a30.3 billion.

Where under the contractual terms of the instrument the coupon resets to a rate which has IBOR as a specified component of its pricing structure, these are subject to IBOR reform and listed below:\n\n|                               | \u00a3m    |\n|-------------------------------|-------|\n| US$ 1.15 billion 8% notes     | 734   |\n| US$ 2.65 billion 8.625% notes | 2,046 |\n\nNatWest Group's non-cumulative preference shares of USD$0.01 Series U (\u00a3494 million) is also subject to IBOR reform.\n\nNatWest Group continued to develop new products across its different segments that reference the new alternative risk-free rates and worked with clients to assess their readiness and ability to adopt new products or transition existing products. A comprehensive review of the effect of IBOR reform on funding, liquidity and risk management has also been conducted. This is expected to be fully implemented over the course of 2021. NatWest Group will continue to adapt its key systems, methodologies and processes to meet the requirements of the new risk-free rates. This is expected to be concluded in advance of the LIBOR cessation date at the end of 2021.\n\nNatWest Group also remained engaged with regulators, standard setters and other market participants on key matters related to the IBOR reform and an open dialogue is expected throughout 2021. It is expected that the programme will meet all timelines set by the regulators.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of IBOR related exposure by currency and nature of financial instruments. Non-derivative financial instruments are presented on the basis of their carrying amounts excluding expected credit losses while derivative financial instruments are presented on the basis of their notional amount.",

All derivatives are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. It also uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In determining fair value, NatWest Group maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nModelled approaches may be used to measure instruments classed as level 2 or 3. Estimation expertise is required in the selection, implementation and calibration of appropriate models. The resulting modelled valuations are considered for accuracy and reliability. Portfolio level adjustments consistent with IFRS 13 are raised to incorporate counterparty credit risk, funding and margining risks. Expert judgement is used in the initial measurement of modelled products by control teams.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\nWhere NatWest Group manages a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, it measures the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that it would receive to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction at the measurement date under current market conditions.\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are made when valuing derivative financial assets to incorporate counterparty credit risk. Adjustments are also made when valuing financial liabilities measured at fair value to reflect the NatWest Group's own credit standing.\n\nWhere the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques involve a degree of estimation, the extent of which depends on the instrument's complexity and the availability of market-based data. Further details about the valuation methodologies and the sensitivity to reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the fair value of financial instruments valued using techniques where at least one significant input is unobservable are given below.\n\n|                                                | Level 3 Total   | Level 3 Total   | Level 3 Total   | Level 3 Total   |            |            |            |          |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                                | Level 1 \u00a3m      | Level 2 \u00a3m      | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m              | Level 1 \u00a3m | Level 2 \u00a3m | Level 3 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Assets                                         |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Trading assets                                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Loans                                          | -               | 39,550          | 225             | 39,775          | -          | 46,172     | 449        | 46,621   |\n| Securities                                     | 21,535          | 7,599           | 81              | 29,215          | 20,865     | 8,704      | 555        | 30,124   |\n| Derivatives                                    | -               | 165,441         | 1,082           | 166,523         | -          | 148,800    | 1,229      | 150,029  |\n| Other financial assets                         |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Loans                                          | -               | 185             | 168             | 353             | -          | 307        | 58         | 365      |\n| Securities                                     | 35,972          | 8,850           | 167             | 44,989          | 41,044     | 8,326      | 263        | 49,633   |\n| Total financial assets held at fair value      | 57,507          | 221,625         | 1,723           | 280,855         | 61,909     | 212,309    | 2,554      | 276,772  |\n| Liabilities                                    |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Trading liabilities                            |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Deposits                                       | -               | 44,062          | 7               | 44,069          | -          | 50,944     | 56         | 51,000   |\n| Debt securities in issue                       | -               | 1,408           | -               | 1,408           | -          | 1,703      | 59         | 1,762    |\n| Short positions                                | 19,045          | 7,734           | -               | 26,779          | 15,565     | 5,622      | -          | 21,187   |\n| Derivatives                                    | -               | 159,818         | 887             | 160,705         | -          | 145,818    | 1,061      | 146,879  |\n| Other financial liabilities                    |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |            |            |          |\n| Debt securities in issue                       | -               | 1,607           | -               | 1,607           | -          | 2,117      | 141        | 2,258    |\n| Other deposits                                 | -               | 796             | -               | 796             | -          | -          | -          | -        |\n| Subordinated liabilities                       | -               | 793             | -               | 793             | -          | 724        | -          | 724      |\n| Total financial liabilities held at fair value | 19,045          | 216,218         | 894             | 236,157         | 15,565     | 206,928    | 1,317      | 223,810  |\n\nNotes:\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 12 Financial instruments - valuation continued Fair value hierarchy\n\nFinancial Instruments carried at fair value have been classified under the IFRS fair value hierarchy as follows.\n\nLevel 1 - instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active and liquid markets, for identical financial instruments. Examples include government bonds, listed equity shares and certain exchangetraded derivatives.\n\nLevel 2 - instruments valued using valuation techniques that have observable inputs. Examples include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, certain money market securities, loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.\n\nLevel 3 - instruments valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation, is not based on observable market data. Examples include cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, certain emerging markets and derivatives with unobservable model inputs.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nNatWest Group derives the fair value of its instruments differently depending on whether the instrument is a non-modelled or a modelled product.\n\nNon-modelled products are valued directly from a price input, typically on a position by position basis, and include cash, equities and most debt securities.\n\nModelled products valued using a pricing model range in complexity from comparatively vanilla products such as interest rate swaps and options (e.g. interest rate caps and floors) through to more complex derivatives. The valuation of modelled products requires an appropriate model and inputs into this model. Sometimes models are also used to derive inputs (e.g. to construct volatility surfaces). NatWest Group uses a number of modelling methodologies.\n\n## Inputs to valuation models\n\nValues between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and extrapolation. When utilising valuation techniques, the fair value can be significantly affected by the choice of valuation model and by underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the amounts and timing of cash flows, discount rates and credit risk. The principal inputs to these valuation techniques are as follows:\n\nBond prices - quoted prices are generally available for government bonds, certain corporate securities and some mortgage-related products.\n\nCredit spreads - where available, these are derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit based instruments, such as debt securities. For others, credit spreads are obtained from third-party benchmarking services. For counterparty credit spreads, adjustments are made to market prices (or parameters) when the creditworthiness of the counterparty differs from that of the assumed counterparty in the market price (or parameters).\n\nInterest rates - these are principally benchmark interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) rate and other quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates - there are observable prices both for spot and forward contracts and futures in the world's major currencies.\n\nEquity and equity index prices - quoted prices are generally readily available for equity shares listed on the world's major stock exchanges and for major indices on such shares.\n\nCommodity prices - many commodities are actively traded in spot and forward contracts and futures on exchanges in London, New York and other commercial centres.\n\nPrice volatilities and correlations - volatility is a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time. Correlation measures the degree which two or more prices or other variables are observed to move together.\n\nPrepayment rates - the fair value of a financial instrument that can be prepaid by the issuer or borrower differs from that of an instrument that cannot be prepaid. In valuing prepayable instruments that are not quoted in active markets, NatWest Group considers the value of the prepayment option.\n\nRecovery rates/loss given default - these are used as an input to valuation models and reserves for asset-backed securities and other credit products as an indicator of severity of losses on default. Recovery rates are primarily sourced from market data providers or inferred from observable credit spreads.\n\n## Valuation control\n\nNatWest Group's control environment for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments includes formalised protocols for the review and validation of fair values independent of the businesses entering into the transactions.\n\nIndependent price verification (IPV) is a key element of the control environment. Valuations are first performed by the business which entered into the transaction. Such valuations may be directly from available prices, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations are reviewed, and if necessary amended, by a team independent of those trading the financial instruments, in the light of available pricing evidence.\n\nWhere measurement differences are identified through the IPV process these are grouped by fair value level and quality of data. If the size of the difference exceeds defined thresholds adjustment to independent levels are made.\n\nIPV takes place at least each monthly, for all fair value positions. The IPV control includes formalised reporting and escalation of any valuation differences in breach of established thresholds.\n\nThe Model Oversight Review Committee sets the policy for model documentation, testing and review, and prioritises models with significant exposure being reviewed by the NatWest Group Model Risk team. Valuation Committees are made up of valuation specialists and senior business representatives from various functions and oversees pricing, reserving and valuations issues. These committees meet monthly to review and ratify any methodology changes. The Executive Valuation Committee meets quarterly to address key material and subjective valuation issues, to review items escalated by Valuation Committees and to discuss other relevant matters, including prudential valuation.\n\nInitial classification of a financial instrument is carried out by the Product Control team following the principles in IFRS 13. They base their judgment on information gathered during the IPV process for instruments which include the sourcing of independent prices and model inputs. The quality and completeness of the information gathered in the IPV process gives an indication as to the liquidity and valuation uncertainty of an instrument. These initial classifications are subject to senior management review. Particular attention is paid to instruments crossing from one level to another, new instrument classes or products, instruments that are generating significant profit and loss and instruments where valuation uncertainty is high.\n\nNatWest Group uses consensus prices for the IPV of some instruments. The consensus service encompasses the equity, interest rate, currency, commodity, credit, property, fund and bond markets, providing comprehensive matrices of vanilla prices and a wide selection of exotic products.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 12 Financial instruments - valuation continued\n\nNatWest Group contributes to consensus pricing services where there is a significant interest either from a positional point of view or to test models for future business use. Data sourced from consensus pricing services are used for a combination of control processes including direct price testing, evidence of observability and model testing. In practice this means that NatWest Group submits prices for all material positions for which a service is available.\n\nData from consensus services are subject to the same level of quality review as other inputs used for IPV process. All sources of independent data are reviewed for quality and are applied in the IPV processes using a formalised input quality hierarchy.\n\nIn order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing information gathered from the above sources. The sources of independent data are reviewed for quality and are applied in the IPV processes using a formalised input quality hierarchy. These adjustments reflect NatWest Group's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting a price.\n\nWhere unobservable inputs are used, NatWest Group may determine a range of possible valuations derived from differing stress scenarios to determine the sensitivity associated with the valuation. When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, NatWest Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument. Such adjustments include the credit quality of the counterparty and adjustments to compensate for model limitations.\n\nWhen valuing financial instruments in the trading book, adjustments are made to mid-market valuations to cover bid-offer spread, funding and credit risk. These adjustments are presented in the table below:\n\n| Adjustment                |   2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Funding - FVA             |       140 | 244       |\n| Credit - CVA              |       390 | 386       |\n| Bid - Offer               |       148 | 165       |\n| Product and deal specific |       172 | 238       |\n|                           |       850 | 1,033     |\n\nThe reduction in valuation reserves was primarily driven by a combination of market moves, trade close-out activity and risk reduction together with a reallocation of product and deal specific reserves that are now included within modelled trade valuations.\n\n## Funding valuation adjustment (FVA)\n\nFVA represents an estimate of the adjustment that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs and benefits that arise in relation to derivative exposures. FVA is calculated as a portfolio level adjustment and can result in either a funding charge or funding benefit.\n\nFunding levels are applied to estimated potential future exposures. For uncollateralised derivatives, the modelling of the exposure is consistent with the approach used in the calculation of CVA, and the counterparty contingent nature of the exposure is reflected in the calculation. For collateralised derivatives, the exposure reflects initial margin posting requirements.\n\n## Credit valuation adjustments (CVA)\n\nCVA represents an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate the counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative exposures. CVA is actively managed by a credit and market risk hedging process, and therefore movements in CVA are partially offset by trading revenue on the hedges.\n\nThe CVA is calculated on a portfolio basis reflecting an estimate of the amount a third party would charge to assume the credit risk.\n\nCollateral held under a credit support agreement is factored into the CVA calculation. In such cases where NatWest Group holds collateral against counterparty exposures, CVA is held to the extent that residual risk remains.\n\n## Bid-offer\n\nFair value positions are adjusted to bid (long positions) or offer (short positions) levels, by marking individual cash positions directly to bid or offer or by taking bid-offer reserves calculated on a portfolio basis for derivatives exposures. The bid-offer approach is based on current market spreads and standard market bucketing of risk.\n\nBid-offer spreads vary by maturity and risk type to reflect different spreads in the market. For positions where there is no observable quote, the bid-offer spreads are widened in comparison to proxies to reflect reduced liquidity or observability. Bid-offer methodologies may also incorporate liquidity triggers whereby wider spreads are applied to risks above pre-defined thresholds.\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 13, netting is applied on a portfolio basis to reflect the value at which NatWest Group believes it could exit the portfolio, rather than the sum of exit costs for each of the portfolio's individual trades. This is applied where the asset and liability positions are managed as a portfolio for risk and reporting purposes.\n\nThe discount rates applied to derivative cash flows in determining fair value reflect any underlying collateral agreements. Collateralised derivatives are generally discounted at the relevant OIS-related rates at an individual trade level. Reserves are held to the extent that the discount rates applied do not reflect all of the terms of the collateral agreements.\n\n## Product and deal specific\n\nOn initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques incorporating information other than observable market data, any difference between the transaction price and that derived from the valuation technique is deferred. Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss over the life of the transaction; when market data becomes observable; or when the transaction matures or is closed out as appropriate. At 31 December 2020, net gains of \u00a363 million (2019 - \u00a388 million) were carried forward. During the year, net gains of \u00a375 million (2019 - \u00a3183 million) were deferred and \u00a3100 million (2019 - \u00a3154 million) were recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere system generated valuations do not accurately recover market prices, manual valuation adjustments are applied either at a position or portfolio level. Manual adjustments are subject to the scrutiny of independent control teams and are subject to monthly review by senior management.\n\n## Own Credit\n\nNatWest Group takes into account the effect of its own credit standing when valuing financial liabilities recorded at fair value in accordance with IFRS. Own credit spread adjustments are made when valuing issued debt held at fair value, including issued structured notes. An own credit adjustment is applied to positions where it is believed that counterparties would consider NWM Group's creditworthiness when pricing trades.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation; if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation. Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket (a group of separate assets), exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.\n\n- (8) Interest rate delta: these ranges represent the low/high marks on the relevant discounting curve.\n\n- (10) Mean reversion: a measure of how much a rate reverts to its mean level.\n- (11) Constant prepayment rate: the rate is used to reflect how fast a pool of assets pay down.\n- (12) Day count: yield analysis on deposits are calculated using day count as an input, referring to the maturity of the deposit.\n- (13) NatWest Group does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.",

Whilst the majority of these instruments naturally fall into a particular level, for some products an element of judgment is required. The majority of NatWest Group financial instruments carried at fair value are classified as level 2. IFRS requires extra disclosures in respect of level 3 instruments.\n\n## Active and inactive markets\n\nA key input in the decision making process for the allocation of assets to a particular level is market activity. In general, the degree of valuation uncertainty depends on the degree of liquidity of an input.\n\nWhere markets are liquid, little judgment is required. However, when the information regarding the liquidity in a particular market is not clear, a judgment may need to be made. This can be more difficult as assessing the liquidity of a market is not always straightforward. For an equity traded on an exchange, daily volumes of trading can be seen, but for an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative assessing the liquidity of the market with no central exchange is more difficult.\n\nA key related matter is where a market moves from liquid to illiquid or vice versa. Where this change is considered to be temporary, the classification is not changed. For example, if there is little market trading in a product on a reporting date but at the previous reporting date and during the intervening period the market has been considered to be liquid, the instrument will continue to be classified in the same level in the hierarchy. This is to provide consistency so that transfers between levels are driven by genuine changes in market liquidity and do not reflect short term or seasonal effects. Material movements between levels are reviewed quarterly.\n\nThe breadth and depth of the IPV data allows for a rules based quality assessment to be made of market activity, liquidity and pricing uncertainty, which assists with the process of allocation to an appropriate level. Where suitable independent pricing information is not readily available, the quality assessment will result in the instrument being assessed as level 3.\n\n## Modelled products\n\nFor modelled products the market convention is to quote these trades through the model inputs or parameters as opposed to a cash price equivalent. A mark-to-market is derived from the use of the independent market inputs calculated using NatWest Group's model.\n\nThe decision to classify a modelled instrument as level 2 or 3 will be dependent upon the product/model combination, the observability and quality of input parameters and other factors. All these must be assessed to classify the asset. If an input fails the observability or quality tests then the instrument is considered to be in level 3 unless the input can be shown to have an insignificant effect on the overall valuation of the product.\n\nThe majority of derivative instruments, for example vanilla interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and liquid single name credit derivatives, are classified as level 2 as they are vanilla products valued using observable inputs. The valuation uncertainty on these is considered to be low and both input and output testing may be available.\n\n## Non-modelled products\n\nNon-modelled products are generally quoted on a price basis and can therefore be considered for each of the three levels. This is determined by the market activity, liquidity and valuation uncertainty of the instruments which is in turn measured from the availability of independent data used by the IPV process to allocate positions to IPV quality levels.\n\nThe availability and quality of independent pricing information are considered during the classification process. An assessment is made regarding the quality of the independent information. For example, where consensus prices are used for non-modelled products, a key assessment of the quality of a price is the depth of the number of prices used to provide the consensus price. If the depth of contributors falls below a set hurdle rate, the instrument is considered to be level 3. This hurdle rate is that used in the IPV process to determine the IPV quality rating. However, where an instrument is generally considered to be illiquid, but regular quotes from market participants exist, these instruments may be classified as level 2 depending on frequency of quotes, other available pricing and whether the quotes are used as part of the IPV process or not.\n\nFor some instruments with a wide number of available price sources, there may be differing quality of available information and there may be a wide range of prices from different sources. In these situations the highest quality source is used to determine the classification of the asset. For example, a tradable quote would be considered a better source than a consensus price.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n|                                                        | Level 3 \u00a3m   | Favourable \u00a3m   | Unfavourable \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   | Favourable \u00a3m   | Unfavourable \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Assets                                                 |              |                 |                   |              |                 |                   |\n| Trading assets                                         |              |                 |                   |              |                 |                   |\n| Loans                                                  | 225          | 10              | -                 | 449          | 10              | (10)              |\n| Securities                                             | 81           | -               | -                 | 555          | -               | -                 |\n| Derivatives                                            | 1,082        | 80              | (80)              | 1,229        | 180             | (180)             |\n| Other financial assets                                 |              |                 |                   |              |                 |                   |\n| Loans                                                  | 168          | 20              | (10)              | 58           | -               | -                 |\n| Securities                                             | 167          | 30              | (20)              | 263          | 80              | (20)              |\n|                                                        | 1,723        | 140             | (110)             | 2,554        | 270             | (210)             |\n| Liabilities                                            |              |                 |                   |              |                 |                   |\n| Trading liabilities                                    |              |                 |                   |              |                 |                   |\n| Deposits                                               | 7            | -               | -                 | 56           | -               | -                 |\n| Debt securities in issue                               | -            | -               | -                 | 59           | -               | -                 |\n| Derivatives                                            | 887          | 50              | (40)              | 1,061        | 100             | (90)              |\n| Other financial liabilities - debt securities in issue | -            | -               | -                 | 141          | 10              | (10)              |\n|                                                        | 894          | 50              | (40)              | 1,317        | 110             | (100)             |\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

They are not calculated on an overall portfolio basis and therefore do not reflect the likely potential uncertainty on the portfolio as a whole. The figures are aggregated and do not reflect the correlated nature of some of the sensitivities. In particular, for some of the portfolios the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downwards movement in one asset would produce an upwards movement in another, but due to the additive presentation of the above figures this correlation cannot be displayed. The actual potential downside sensitivity of the total portfolio may be less than the noncorrelated sum of the additive figures as shown in the above table.\n\nReasonably plausible alternative assumptions of unobservable inputs are determined based on a specified target level of certainty of 90%. The assessments recognise different favourable and unfavourable valuation movements where appropriate. Each unobservable input within a product is considered separately and sensitivity is reported on an additive basis.\n\nAlternative assumptions are determined with reference to all available evidence including consideration of the following: quality of independent pricing information taking into account consistency between different sources, variation over time, perceived tradability or otherwise of available quotes; consensus service dispersion ranges; volume of trading activity and market bias (e.g. one-way inventory); day 1 profit or loss arising on new trades; number and nature of market participants; market conditions; modelling consistency in the market; size and nature of risk; length of holding of position; and market intelligence.\n\n## Other considerations\n\nWhilst certain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA and own credit adjustments are not based on observable market data, the uncertainty of the inputs is not considered to have a significant effect on the net valuation of the related derivative portfolios and issued debt. The classification of the derivative portfolios and issued debt is not determined by the observability of these inputs and any related sensitivity does not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\n## Level 3\n\nThe following table shows the movement in level 3 assets and liabilities in the year.\n\n|                                                                                               | 2020                  | 2020                           | 2020            | 2020                 | 2019                             | 2019                 | 2019            | 2019                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                               | Trading assets (2) \u00a3m | Other  financial assets (3) \u00a3m | Total assets \u00a3m | Total liabilities \u00a3m | Trading assets (2) assets (3) \u00a3m | Other  financial  \u00a3m | Total assets \u00a3m | Total liabilities \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                                                                                  | 2,233                 | 321                            | 2,554           | 1,317                | 2,657                            | 643                  | 3,300           | 1,957                |\n| Amounts recorded in the income statement (1)                                                  | 127                   | (21)                           | 106             | (67)                 | (418)                            | (1)                  | (419)           | 162                  |\n| Amounts recorded in the statement of comprehensive income                                     | -                     | 63                             | 63              | -                    | -                                | 86                   | 86              | -                    |\n| Level 3 transfers in                                                                          | 165                   | 261                            | 426             | 188                  | 492                              | 2                    | 494             | 104                  |\n| Level 3 transfers out                                                                         | (139)                 | -                              | (139)           | (368)                | (857)                            | (59)                 | (916)           | (588)                |\n| Issuances                                                                                     | -                     | -                              | -               | -                    | -                                | -                    | -               | 46                   |\n| Purchases                                                                                     | 441                   | 164                            | 605             | 127                  | 1,121                            | 15                   | 1,136           | 532                  |\n| Settlements                                                                                   | (293)                 | (153)                          | (446)           | (59)                 | (218)                            | (38)                 | (256)           | (429)                |\n| Sales                                                                                         | (1,148)               | (301)                          | (1,449)         | (245)                | (541)                            | (326)                | (867)           | (466)                |\n| Foreign exchange and other adjustments                                                        | 2                     | 1                              | 3               | 1                    | (3)                              | (1)                  | (4)             | (1)                  |\n| At 31 December                                                                                | 1,388                 | 335                            | 1,723           | 894                  | 2,233                            | 321                  | 2,554           | 1,317                |\n| Amounts recorded in the income statement in respect of balances held at year end - unrealised | 129                   | (22)                           | 107             | (68)                 | (421)                            | 8                    | (413)           | 110                  |\n\n## Notes:",

Refer to Accounting policy changes effective 1 January 2020 for further details.\n\nThe fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Quoted market values are used where available; otherwise, fair values have been estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows and other valuation techniques. These techniques involve uncertainties and require assumptions and judgments covering prepayments, credit risk and discount rates. Furthermore there is a wide range of potential valuation techniques. Changes in these assumptions would significantly affect estimated fair values. The fair values reported would not necessarily be realised in an immediate sale or settlement.\n\nThe assumptions and methodologies underlying the calculation of fair values of financial instruments at the balance sheet date are as follows:\n\n## Short-term financial instruments\n\nFor certain short-term financial instruments: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from other banks, settlement balances, items in the course of transmission to other banks, customer demand deposits and notes in circulation, carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\n## Loans to banks and customers\n\nIn estimating the fair value of net loans to customers and banks measured at amortised cost, NatWest Group's loans are segregated into appropriate portfolios reflecting the characteristics of the constituent loans. Two principal methods are used to estimate fair value:\n\n- (a) Contractual cash flows are discounted using a market discount rate that incorporates the current spread for the borrower or where\n\nthis is not observable, the spread for borrowers of a similar credit standing. This method is used for portfolios where counterparties have external ratings: institutional and corporate lending in NatWest Markets.\n\n- (b) Expected cash flows (unadjusted for credit losses) are discounted at the current offer rate for the same or similar products. The current methodology caps all loan values at par rather than modelling clients' option to repay loans early. This approach is adopted for lending portfolios in Retail Banking, Ulster Bank RoI, Commercial Banking (SME loans) and Private Banking in order to reflect the homogeneous nature of these portfolios.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe majority of debt securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets, or using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets. Fair values of the rest are determined using discounted cash flow valuation techniques.\n\n## Deposits by banks and customer accounts\n\nFair values of deposits are estimated using discounted cash flow valuation techniques.\n\n## Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities\n\nFair values are determined using quoted prices for similar liabilities where available or by reference to valuation techniques, adjusting for own credit spreads where appropriate.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

The balances in the following tables do not agree directly with the consolidated balance sheet, as the tables include all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments, presented on an undiscounted basis. The tables have been prepared on the following basis:\n\nFinancial assets have been reflected in the time band of the latest date on which they could be repaid, unless earlier repayment can be demanded by NatWest Group. Financial liabilities are included at the earliest date on which the counterparty can require repayment, regardless of whether or not such early repayment results in a penalty. If the repayment of a financial instrument is triggered by, or is subject to, specific criteria such as market price hurdles being reached, the asset is included in the time band that contains the latest date on which it can be repaid, regardless of early repayment.\n\nThe liability is included in the time band that contains the earliest possible date on which the conditions could be fulfilled, without considering the probability of the conditions being met.\n\nFor example, if a structured note is automatically prepaid when an equity index exceeds a certain level, the cash outflow will be included in the less than three months period, whatever the level of the index at the year end. The settlement date of debt securities in issue, issued by certain securitisation vehicles consolidated by NatWest Group, depends on when cash flows are received from the securitised assets. Where these assets are prepayable, the timing of the cash outflow relating to securities assumes that each asset will be prepaid at the earliest possible date. As the repayments of assets and liabilities are linked, the repayment of assets in securitisations is shown on the earliest date that the asset can be prepaid, as this is the basis used for liabilities.\n\nThe principal amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are repayable after 20 years or where the counterparty has no right to repayment of the principal are excluded from the table, as are interest payments after 20 years.\n\nThe maturity of guarantees and commitments is based on the earliest possible date they would be drawn in order to evaluate NatWest Group's liquidity position.\n\nMFVTPL assets of \u00a3235.9 billion (2019 - \u00a3227.3 billion) and HFT liabilities of \u00a3232.8 billion (2019 - \u00a3220.8 billion) have been excluded from the following tables.",

Accounting policy 13 sets out how the expected loss approach is applied. At 31 December 2020, customer loan impairment provisions amounted to \u00a36,186 million (2019 - \u00a33,792 million). A loan is impaired when there is objective evidence that the cash flows will not occur in the manner expected when the loan was advanced. Such evidence includes, changes in the credit rating of a borrower, the failure to make payments in accordance with the loan agreement, significant reduction in the value of any security, breach of limits or covenants, and observable data about relevant macroeconomic measures.\n\nThe impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of estimated future cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe measurement of credit impairment under the IFRS expected loss model depends on management's assessment of any potential deterioration in the creditworthiness of the borrower, its modelling of expected performance and the application of economic forecasts. All three elements require judgments that are potentially significant to the estimate of impairment losses. For further information and sensitivity analysis, refer to Risk and capital management - Measurement uncertainty and ECL sensitivity analysis section.\n\n## IFRS 9 ECL model design principles\n\nTo meet IFRS 9 requirements, PD, LGD and EAD used in ECL calculations must be:\n\n- \uf0b7 Unbiased - material regulatory conservatism has been removed to produce unbiased model estimates.\n- \uf0b7 Point-in-time - recognise current economic conditions.\n- \uf0b7 Forward-looking - incorporated into PD estimates and, where appropriate, EAD and LGD estimates.\n- \uf0b7 For the life of the loan - all PD, LGD and EAD models produce term structures to allow a lifetime calculation for assets in Stage 2 and Stage 3.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the probability of default over the remaining lifetime at the reporting date) with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nThe general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models is to leverage corresponding Basel LGD models with bespoke adjustments to ensure estimates are unbiased and where relevant forward-looking.\n\nFor wholesale, while conversion ratios in the historical data show temporal variations, these cannot be sufficiently explained by the CCI measure (unlike in the case of PD and some LGD models) and are presumed to be driven to a larger extent by exposure management practices. Therefore point-in-time best estimates measures for EAD are derived by estimating the regulatory model specification on a rolling five-year window.\n\n## Approach for multiple economic scenarios (MES)\n\nThe base scenario plays a greater part in the calculation of ECL than the approach to MES.\n\n## 15 Other financial assets\n\n|                                               | Debt securities              | Debt securities              | Debt securities              | Debt securities   | Debt securities   |        |       |        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|-------|--------|\n|                                               | Central and local government | Central and local government | Central and local government | Other             |                   | Equity | Other |        |\n|                                               | UK                           | US                           | Other                        | debt              | Total             | shares | loans | Total  |\n| 2020                                          | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m    | \u00a3m     |\n| Mandatory fair value through profit or loss   | -                            | -                            | -                            | 88                | 88                | 14     | 338   | 440    |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 17,458                       | 11,742                       | 6,802                        | 8,591             | 44,593            | 294    | 15    | 44,902 |\n| Amortised cost                                | 4,997                        | 235                          | 116                          | 4,458             | 9,806             | -      | -     | 9,806  |\n| Total                                         | 22,455                       | 11,977                       | 6,918                        | 13,137            | 54,487            | 308    | 353   | 55,148 |\n| 2019                                          |                              |                              |                              |                   |                   |        |       |        |\n| Mandatory fair value through profit or loss   | -                            | -                            | -                            | 305               | 305               | 45     | 365   | 715    |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 18,437                       | 13,981                       | 8,786                        | 7,130             | 48,334            | 949    | -     | 49,283 |\n| Amortised cost                                | 5,411                        | 242                          | 120                          | 5,681             | 11,454            | -      | -     | 11,454 |\n| Total                                         | 23,848                       | 14,223                       | 8,906                        | 13,116            | 60,093            | 994    | 365   | 61,452 |\n\nEquity shares disposed during 2020 include SABB (\u00a3383 million), VISA Inc.

In 2020 \u00a39 million (2019 - \u00a344 million) of previously capitalised software was impaired primarily as a result of software which is no longer expected to yield future economic benefit.\n\nNatWest Group's goodwill acquired in business combinations analysed by reportable segment is in Note 4 Segmental analysis. It is reviewed annually at 31 December for impairment. No impairment was indicated at 31 December 2020 or 2019.\n\nImpairment testing involves the comparison of the carrying value of each cash-generating unit (CGU) with its recoverable amount. The carrying values of the segments reflect the equity allocations made by management which are consistent with NatWest Group's capital targets.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the CGU. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants.\n\nThe recoverable amounts for all CGUs at 31 December 2020 were based on value in use, using management's latest five-year revenue and cost forecasts. These are discounted cash flow projections over five years. The forecast is then extrapolated in perpetuity using a longterm growth rate to compute a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the value in use. The long-term growth rates have been based on expected nominal growth of the CGUs. The pre-tax risk discount rates are based on those observed to be applied to businesses regarded as peers of the CGUs.\n\n## Critical accounting policy: Goodwill Critical estimates\n\nImpairment testing involves a number of judgments.  The key judgments are the five-year cash flow forecast, the long-term growth rate used to derive the terminal value, and the discount rate. Future value in use is primarily affected by changes in profitability, and changes in discount rate. Adverse changes could lead to value in use falling below carrying value. The most likely cause for this would be a failure to meet budgets, including cost targets, or external downgrades in the UK economy.\n\nThe recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value for each CGU at 31 December 2020.  Alternative scenarios applied to consider the recoverability of the Commercial Banking goodwill indicated that there were possibilities of partial / full impairment for worse economic outlooks or failure to meet income or cost forecasts. The conclusion that Commercial Banking goodwill was recoverable reflected the current ECL outlook and management plans for costs and revenues. An impairment of Commercial Banking goodwill is possible if there is a further economic deterioration or other negative effects on costs and revenues.\n\nThe impact of reasonably possible changes to the more significant variables in the value in use calculations are presented below. This reflects the sensitivity of the VIU to each key assumption on its own. It is possible that more than one change may occur at the same time.\n\n|                    |                      |                      |                   |                   |                                         |                                         | Consequential impact of                 | Consequential impact of   |                      |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n|                    |                      | Assumptions Cost:    | Assumptions Cost: | Assumptions Cost: | Recoverable 1% adverse  amount movement | Recoverable 1% adverse  amount movement | Recoverable 1% adverse  amount movement | 5% adverse  movement      | 5% adverse  movement |\n|                    |                      | Terminal             | Pre-tax discount  | income            | exceeded                                | Discount                                | Terminal                                | Forecast                  | Forecast             |\n|                    | Goodwill growth rate | Goodwill growth rate | rate              | ratio (1)         | carrying value                          | rate                                    | growth rate                             | Income                    | cost                 |\n| 31 December 2020   | \u00a3bn                  | %                    | %                 | %                 | \u00a3bn                                     | \u00a3bn                                     | \u00a3bn                                     | \u00a3bn                       | \u00a3bn                  |\n| Retail Banking     | 2.7                  | 1.6                  | 13.7              | 48.3              | 5.9                                     | (1.8)                                   | (0.8)                                   | (2.0)                     | (0.9)                |\n| Commercial Banking | 2.6                  | 1.6                  | 13.7              | 53.7              | 1.5                                     | (1.5)                                   | (0.5)                                   | (1.8)                     | (0.9)                |\n| RBS International  | 0.3                  | 1.6                  | 12.1              | 42.7              | 1.1                                     | (0.4)                                   | (0.2)                                   | (0.3)                     | (0.1)                |\n| 31 December 2019   |                      |                      |                   |                   |                                         |                                         |                                         |                           |                      |\n| Retail Banking     | 2.7                  | 1.6                  | 13.3              | 47.9              | 8.7                                     | (2.2)                                   | (1.0)                                   | (2.1)                     | (0.9)                |\n| Commercial Banking | 2.6                  | 1.6                  | 13.4              | 53.8              | 4.1                                     | (1.8)                                   | (0.7)                                   | (2.1)                     | (1.1)                |\n| RBS International  | 0.3                  | 1.6                  | 12.0              | 37.5              | 2.1                                     | (0.5)                                   | (0.3)                                   | (0.4)                     | (0.1)                |\n\nNote:",

There is often a high degree of uncertainty and judgement is based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events in determining whether there is a present obligation. Judgement is also involved in estimation of the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. Where NatWest Group can look to another party such as an insurer to pay some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision, any reimbursement is recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that it will be received.\n\nEstimates -Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, the outflow of economic benefit is probable and the outflow can be estimated reliably. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect the reported results in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n- \uf0b7 PPI: The provision reflects the estimated cost of PPI redress attributable to claims prior to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) complaint deadline of 29 August 2019. All pre-deadline complaints have been processed which removes complaint volume estimation uncertainty from the provision estimate. NatWest Group continues to conclude remaining bank-identified closure work and conclude cases with the Financial Ombudsmen Service.\n- \uf0b7 Other customer redress: Provisions reflect the estimated cost of redress attributable to claims where it is determined that a present obligation exists.\n- \uf0b7 Litigation and other regulatory: NatWest Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and in overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 26.\n- \uf0b7 Other provisions: These materially comprise provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring costs. Onerous contract provisions comprise an estimate of the costs involved with fulfilling the terms and conditions of contracts net of any expected benefits to be received. This includes provision for contractual costs such as rates associated with vacant properties. Redundancy and restructuring provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists.\n\nBackground information for all material provisions is given in Note 26.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

At 31 December 2020, the directors had authority granted at the 2020 Annual General Meeting to issue up to \u00a3604,695,460 million nominal of ordinary shares other than by pre-emption to existing shareholders.\n\nOn 6 February 2019 the company held a General Meeting and shareholders approved a special resolution to give the company authority to make off-market purchases of its ordinary shares from HM Treasury (or its nominee) at such times as the directors may determine is appropriate. Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting in 2020 and shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.\n\nIn the three years to 31 December 2020, the percentage increase in issued share capital due to non pre-emptive issuance (excluding employee share schemes) for cash was 0.43%. In addition, the company issued 35 million ordinary shares of \u00a31 each in connection with employee share plans.\n\nIn 2019 NatWest Group paid an interim dividend of \u00a3241 million, or 2.0p per ordinary share (2018 - \u00a3241 million, or 2.0p per ordinary share) and a special dividend of \u00a31,449 million, or 12.0p per ordinary share (2018 - nil). In addition, the company had announced that the directors had recommended a final dividend of \u00a3364 million, or 3.0p per ordinary share (2018 - \u00a3422 million, or 3.5p per ordinary share), and a further special dividend of \u00a3606 million, or 5.0p per ordinary share (2018 \u00a3904 million, or 7.5p per ordinary share), both of which were subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2020.\n\nIn response to a formal request from the Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Board cancelled the final and special ordinary dividend payments in relation to the 2019 financial year and did not submit them for approval at the AGM held on 29 April 2020.\n\nThe company has announced that the directors have recommended a final dividend of \u00a3364 million, or 3p per ordinary share (2019 - nil) subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021.\n\nIf approved, payment will be made on 4 May 2021 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 March 2021. The exdividend date will be 25 March 2021.\n\n## Non-cumulative preference shares\n\nNon-cumulative preference shares entitle their holders to periodic noncumulative cash dividends at specified fixed rates for each series payable out of distributable profits of the company.\n\nThe company may redeem some or all of the non-cumulative preference shares from time to time at the rates detailed in the table on the next page plus dividends otherwise payable for the then current dividend period to the date of redemption.",

This includes ordinary shares, preference shares and additional Tier 1 Instruments.\n\nMerger reserve the merger reserve comprises the premium on shares issued to acquire NatWest Bank Plc, less goodwill amortisation charged under previous GAAP.\n\nCapital redemption reserve under UK companies legislation, when shares are redeemed or purchased wholly or partly out of the company's profits, the amount by which the company's issued share capital is diminished must be transferred to the capital redemption reserve. The capital maintenance provisions of UK companies legislation apply to the capital redemption reserve as if it were part of the company's paid up share capital. On 15 June 2017, the Court of Session approved a reduction of NatWest plc capital so that the amounts which stood to the credit of the capital redemption reserve were transferred to retained earnings.\n\nOwn shares held at 31 December 2020, 16 million ordinary shares of \u00a31 each of the company (2019 - 15 million) were held by employee share trusts in respect of share awards and options granted to employees. During the year, the employee share trusts purchased 42 million ordinary shares and delivered 41 million ordinary shares in satisfaction of the exercise of options and the vesting of share awards under the employee share plans. The company retains the flexibility to use newly issued shares, shares purchased by the NatWest Group Employee Share Ownership Trust and any available treasury shares to satisfy obligations under its employee share plans.\n\nNatWest Group plc optimises capital efficiency by maintaining reserves in subsidiaries, including regulated entities. Certain preference shares and subordinated debt are also included within regulatory capital. The remittance of reserves to the company or the redemption of shares or subordinated capital by regulated entities may be subject to maintaining the capital resources required by the relevant regulator.\n\nUK law prescribes that only the reserves of the company are taken into account for the purpose of making distributions and in determining permissible applications of the share premium account.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 23 Structured entities\n\nA structured entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, for example, when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. SEs are usually established for a specific, limited purpose. They do not carry out a business or trade and typically have no employees. They take a variety of legal forms trusts, partnerships and companies - and fulfil many different functions. As well as being a key element of securitisations, SEs are also used in fund management activities in order to segregate custodial duties from the provision of fund management advice.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\n## Securitisations\n\nIn a securitisation, assets, or interests in a pool of assets, are transferred generally to an SE which then issues liabilities to third party investors. The majority of securitisations are supported through liquidity facilities or other credit enhancements. NatWest Group arranges securitisations to facilitate client transactions and undertakes own asset securitisations to sell or to fund portfolios of financial assets. NatWest Group also acts as an underwriter and depositor in securitisation transactions in both client and proprietary transactions.\n\nNatWest Group involvement in client securitisations takes a number of forms. It may: sponsor or administer a securitisation programme; provide liquidity facilities or programme-wide credit enhancement; and purchase securities issued by the vehicle.\n\n## Other credit risk transfer securitisations\n\nNatWest Group also transfers credit risk on originated loans and mortgages without the transfer of assets to an SE. As part of this, NatWest Group enters into credit derivative and financial guarantee contracts with consolidated SEs.

Under standard terms in the UK and US markets, the recipient has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge collateral, subject to returning equivalent securities on maturity of the transaction. NatWest Group retains all of the risks and rewards of own issued liabilities lent under such arrangements and does not recognise them. At 31 December 2020, \u00a31,893 million secured and nil unsecured (2019 - \u00a31,704 million secured, \u00a3424 million unsecured) of own issued liabilities have been retained and lent under securities lending arrangements.

In carrying out this policy, NatWest Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the PRA. The PRA uses capital ratios as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets (the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are 'weighted' to reflect the inherent credit and other risks); by international agreement, the Pillar 1 capital ratios should be not less than 8% with a Common Equity Tier 1\n\ncomponent of not less than 4.5%. NatWest Group has complied with the PRA's capital requirements throughout the year.\n\nA number of subsidiaries and sub-groups within NatWest Group, principally banking entities, are subject to various individual regulatory capital requirements in the UK and overseas. Furthermore, the payment of dividends by subsidiaries and the ability of members of NatWest Group to lend money to other members of NatWest Group may be subject to restrictions such as local regulatory or legal requirements, the availability of reserves and financial and operating performance.",

These commitments and contingent obligations are subject to NatWest Group's normal credit approval processes.\n\nGuarantees - NatWest Group gives guarantees on behalf of customers. A financial guarantee represents an irrevocable undertaking that NatWest Group will meet a customer's specified obligations to third party if the customer fails to do so. The maximum amount that NatWest Group could be required to pay under a guarantee is its principal amount as disclosed in the table above. NatWest Group expects most guarantees it provides to expire unused.\n\nStandby facilities and credit lines - under a loan commitment, NatWest Group agrees to make funds available to a customer in the future. Loan commitments, which are usually for a specified term, may be unconditionally cancellable or may persist, provided all conditions in the loan facility are satisfied or waived. Commitments to lend include commercial standby facilities and credit lines, liquidity facilities to commercial paper conduits and unutilised overdraft facilities.\n\nOther commitments - these include documentary credits, which are commercial letters of credit providing for payment by NatWest Group to a named beneficiary against presentation of specified documents, forward asset purchases, forward deposits placed and undrawn note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities, and other short-term trade related transactions.\n\nOther contingent liabilities - these include standby letters of credit, supporting customer debt issues and contingent liabilities relating to customer trading activities such as those arising from performance and customs bonds, warranties and indemnities.\n\n## Contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts\n\nThe following table shows contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts at the year end.\n\n|                                                      |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment |        15 |        20 |\n| Contracts to purchase goods or services (1)          |       729 |       614 |\n|                                                      |       744 |       634 |\n\nNote:\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 26 Memorandum items continued Trustee and other fiduciary activities\n\nIn its capacity as trustee or other fiduciary role, NatWest Group may hold or place assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, companies, pension schemes and others. The assets and their income are not included in NatWest Group's financial statements. NatWest Group earned fee income of \u00a3245 million (2019 - \u00a3250 million; 2018 - \u00a3257 million) from these activities.\n\n## The Financial Services Compensation Scheme\n\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK's statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms, pays compensation if a firm is unable to meet its obligations. The FSCS funds compensation for customers by raising management expenses levies and compensation levies on the industry. In relation to protected deposits, each deposit-taking institution contributes towards these levies in proportion to their share of total protected deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year (which runs from 1 April to 31 March), subject to annual maxima set by the Prudential Regulation Authority. In addition, the FSCS has the power to raise levies on a firm that has ceased to participate in the scheme and is in the process of ceasing to be authorised for the costs that it would have been liable to pay had the FSCS made a levy in the financial year it ceased to be a participant in the scheme.\n\n## Litigation and regulatory matters\n\nNatWest Group plc and certain members of NatWest Group are party to legal proceedings and involved in regulatory matters, including as the subject of investigations and other regulatory and governmental action ('Matters') in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group recognises a provision for a liability in relation to these Matters when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation resulting from past events, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nIn many of these Matters, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable, or to estimate reliably the amount of any loss, either as a direct consequence of the relevant proceedings and regulatory matters or as a result of adverse impacts or restrictions on NatWest Group's reputation, businesses and operations. Numerous legal and factual issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and document production exercises and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before a liability can reasonably be estimated for any claim. NatWest Group cannot predict if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, damages, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages.\n\nThere are situations where NatWest Group may pursue an approach that in some instances leads to a settlement agreement. This may occur in order to avoid the expense, management distraction or reputational implications of continuing to contest liability, or in order to take account of the risks inherent in defending claims or regulatory matters, even for those Matters for which NatWest Group believes it has credible defences and should prevail on the merits. The uncertainties inherent in all such Matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both Matters with respect to which provisions have been established and other contingent liabilities.\n\nThe future outflow of resources in respect of any Matter may ultimately prove to be substantially greater than or less than the aggregate provision that NatWest Group has recognised. Where (and as far as) liability cannot be reasonably estimated, no provision has been recognised. NatWest Group expects that in future periods, additional provisions, settlement amounts and customer redress payments will be necessary, in amounts that are expected to be substantial in some instances.\n\nFor a discussion of certain risks associated with NatWest Group's litigation and regulatory matters (including investigations and customer redress programmes), see the Risk Factor relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on page 360.\n\n## Litigation\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) litigation in the US\n\nNatWest Group companies continue to defend RMBS-related claims in the US in which plaintiffs allege that certain disclosures made in connection with the relevant offerings of RMBS contained materially false or misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the mortgage loans underlying the RMBS were issued. The remaining RMBS lawsuits against NatWest Group companies consist of cases filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the State of New Mexico that together involve the issuance of less than US$400 million of RMBS issued primarily from 2005 to 2007. In addition, NWMSI previously agreed to settle a purported RMBS class action entitled New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v. Novastar Mortgage Inc. et al. for US$55.3 million. This was paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement, which was granted in March 2019, but which is now the subject of an appeal by a class member who does not want to participate in the settlement.\n\n## London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other rates litigation\n\nNWM Plc and certain other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, are defendants in a number of class actions and individual claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) with respect to the setting of LIBOR and certain other benchmark interest rates. The complaints allege that certain members of NatWest Group and other panel banks violated various federal laws, including the US commodities and antitrust laws, and state statutory and common law, as well as contracts, by manipulating LIBOR and prices of LIBOR-based derivatives in various markets through various means.\n\nSeveral class actions relating to USD LIBOR, as well as more than two dozen non-class actions concerning USD LIBOR, are part of a coordinated proceeding in the SDNY. In December 2016, the SDNY held that it lacks personal jurisdiction over NWM Plc with respect to certain claims. As a result of that and other decisions, all NatWest Group companies have been dismissed from each of the USD LIBOR-related class actions (including class actions on behalf of over-the-counter plaintiffs, exchange-based purchaser plaintiffs, bondholder plaintiffs, and lender plaintiffs), but seven non-class cases in the co-ordinated proceeding remain pending against NatWest Group defendants. The dismissal of NatWest Group companies for lack of personal jurisdiction is the subject of a pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In March 2020, NatWest Group companies finalised a settlement resolving the class action on behalf of bondholder plaintiffs (those who held bonds issued by nondefendants on which interest was paid from 2007 to 2010 at a rate expressly tied to USD LIBOR). The amount of the settlement (which was covered by an existing provision) has been paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement.\n\nAmong the non-class claims dismissed by the SDNY in December 2016 were claims that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had asserted on behalf of certain failed US banks. In July 2017, the FDIC, on behalf of 39 failed US banks, commenced substantially similar claims against NatWest Group companies and others in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. The action alleges that the defendants breached English and European competition law, as well as asserting common law claims of fraud under US law.\n\nIn addition, there are two class actions relating to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR. The first class action, which relates to Euroyen TIBOR futures contracts, was dismissed by the SDNY in September 2020 on legal grounds, and the plaintiffs have commenced an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The second class action, which relates to other derivatives allegedly tied to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR, is the subject of a motion to dismiss that remains pending in the SDNY.",

The SDNY dismissed all claims against NWM Plc in the case relating to Euribor for lack of personal jurisdiction in February 2017. The SDNY dismissed, for various reasons, the case relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and Singapore Swap Offer Rate in July 2019, the case relating to Pound Sterling LIBOR in August 2019, and the case relating to Swiss Franc LIBOR in September 2019. Plaintiffs are appealing each of these four dismissals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In the class action relating to Swiss Franc LIBOR, NWM Plc and the plaintiffs reached a settlement in principle in February 2021. The amount of the settlement, which remains subject to final documentation and court approval, is covered by an existing provision. In the fifth class action, which relates to the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, the SDNY in February 2020 declined to dismiss the amended complaint as against NWM Plc and certain other defendants, but dismissed it as to other members of NatWest Group (including NatWest Group plc). The claims against non-dismissed defendants (including NWM Plc) are now proceeding in discovery.\n\nNWM Plc was also named as a defendant in a motion to certify a class action relating to LIBOR in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel. NWM Plc filed a motion for cancellation of service, which was granted in July 2020. The claimants appealed that decision and in November 2020 the appeal was refused and the claim dismissed by the Appellate Court. The claim could in future be recommenced depending on the outcome of a separate case under appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.\n\nIn January 2019, a class action antitrust complaint was filed in the SDNY alleging that the defendants (USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and affiliates) have conspired to suppress USD ICE LIBOR from 2014 to the present by submitting incorrect information to ICE about their borrowing costs. The NatWest Group defendants are NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc. The defendants made a motion to dismiss this case, which was granted by the court in March 2020. Plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nIn August 2020, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several United States consumer borrowers against the USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and their affiliates, alleging that the normal process of setting USD ICE LIBOR amounts to illegal price-fixing, and also that banks in the United States have illegally agreed to use LIBOR as a component of price in variable consumer loans. The NatWest Group defendants are NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc. The plaintiffs seek damages and to prevent the enforcement of LIBOR-based instruments through injunction. Defendants have filed a motion to transfer the matter to federal court in New York and will seek dismissal.\n\n## FX litigation\n\nNWM Plc, NWMSI and / or NatWest Group plc are defendants in several cases relating to NWM Plc's foreign exchange (FX) business, each of which is pending before the same federal judge in the SDNY. In 2015, NWM Plc paid US$255 million to settle the consolidated antitrust class action on behalf of persons who entered into over-thecounter FX transactions with defendants or who traded FX instruments on exchanges. That settlement received final court approval in August 2018. In November 2018, some members of the settlement class who opted out of the settlement filed their own non-class complaint in the SDNY asserting antitrust claims against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks. Those opt-out claims are proceeding in discovery. In December 2018, some of the same claimants, as well as others, filed proceedings in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, asserting competition claims against NWM Plc and several other banks. The claim was served in April 2019.\n\nOne other FX-related class action, on behalf of 'consumers and enduser businesses', is proceeding in the SDNY against NWM Plc and others. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification, which defendants are opposing. The 2020 settlement of another class action, on behalf of 'indirect purchasers' of FX instruments (which plaintiffs define as persons who transacted FX instruments with retail foreign exchange dealers that transacted directly with defendant banks), received final court approval in November 2020. NWM Plc has paid the settlement in that case (which was covered by an existing provision).\n\nIn May 2019, a cartel class action was filed in the Federal Court of Australia against NWM Plc and four other banks on behalf of persons who bought or sold currency through FX spots or forwards between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013 with a total transaction value exceeding AUS $0.5 million. The claimant has alleged that the banks, including NWM Plc, contravened Australian competition law by sharing information, coordinating conduct, widening spreads and manipulating FX rates for certain currency pairs during this period. NatWest Group plc has been named in the action as an 'other cartel participant', but is not a respondent. The claim was served in June 2019. The claimant sought permission to amend its claim to strengthen its claim of alleged breaches of competition law, but this was refused by the court in the form sought by the claimant. The claimant now seeks a further opportunity to amend its claim.\n\nIn July and December 2019, two separate applications seeking opt-out collective proceedings orders were filed in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other banks. Both applications have been brought on behalf of persons who, between 18 December 2007 and 31 January 2013, entered into a relevant FX spot or outright forward transaction in the EEA with a relevant financial institution or on an electronic communications network. A hearing to determine class certification and which of the applications should be permitted to represent the class is scheduled to take place in July 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, proceedings were issued in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales against NWM Plc by a claimant who seeks an account of profits or damages in respect of alleged historic FX trading misconduct. The claimant has also issued similar proceedings against a number of other banks. The claim against NWM Plc makes allegations of fraud, deceit and dishonesty, as well as breaches of contract, fiduciary duties, duties of confidence and other matters, in respect of FX services provided by NWM Plc during the period 2006 to 2010. NWM Plc awaits service of the claim.\n\nTwo motions to certify FX-related class actions were filed in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel in September and October 2018, and were subsequently consolidated into one motion. The consolidated motion, which names The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (now NWM Plc) as the defendant, was served on NWM Plc in May 2020. NWM Plc has filed a motion for cancellation of service.\n\nCertain other foreign exchange transaction related claims have been or may be threatened. NatWest Group cannot predict whether any of these claims will be pursued, but expects that some may.\n\n## Government securities antitrust litigation\n\nNWMSI and certain other US broker-dealers are defendants in a consolidated antitrust class action pending in the SDNY on behalf of persons who transacted in US Treasury securities or derivatives based on such instruments, including futures and options. The plaintiffs allege that defendants rigged the US Treasury securities auction bidding process to deflate prices at which they bought such securities and colluded to increase the prices at which they sold such securities to plaintiffs. The defendants' motion to dismiss this matter remains pending.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 26 Memorandum items continued Litigation and regulatory matters\n\nClass action antitrust claims commenced in March 2019 are pending in the SDNY against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks in respect of Euro-denominated bonds issued by European central banks (EGBs). The complaint alleges a conspiracy among dealers of EGBs to widen the bid-ask spreads they quoted to customers, thereby increasing the prices customers paid for the EGBs or decreasing the prices at which customers sold the bonds. The class consists of those who purchased or sold EGBs in the US between 2007 and 2012. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss this matter, which was granted by the court in respect of NWM Plc and NWMSI in July 2020, subject to plaintiffs attempting to remedy the pleading deficiencies identified by the court through an amended complaint.\n\n## Swaps antitrust litigation\n\nNWM Plc and other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, as well as a number of other interest rate swap dealers, are defendants in several cases pending in the SDNY alleging violations of the US antitrust laws in the market for interest rate swaps. There is a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of persons who entered into interest rate swaps with the defendants, as well as non-class action claims by three swap execution facilities (TeraExchange, Javelin, and trueEx). The plaintiffs allege that the swap execution facilities would have successfully established exchange-like trading of interest rate swaps if the defendants had not unlawfully conspired to prevent that from happening through boycotts and other means. Discovery in these cases is complete, and the plaintiffs' motion for class certification remains pending.\n\nIn addition, in June 2017, TeraExchange filed a complaint against NatWest Group companies, including NatWest Group plc, as well as a number of other credit default swap dealers, in the SDNY. TeraExchange alleges it would have established exchange-like trading of credit default swaps if the defendant dealers had not engaged in an unlawful antitrust conspiracy. In October 2018, the court dismissed all claims against NatWest Group companies.\n\n## Odd lot corporate bond trading antitrust litigation\n\nNWMSI is the subject of a class action antitrust complaint filed in the SDNY against NWMSI and several other securities dealers. The complaint alleges that, from August 2006 to the present, the defendants conspired artificially to widen spreads for odd lots of corporate bonds bought or sold in the United States secondary market and to boycott electronic trading platforms that would have allegedly promoted pricing competition in the market for such bonds. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint in this matter in December 2020.\n\n## Madoff\n\nNWM N.V. is a defendant in two actions filed by Irving Picard, as trustee for the bankruptcy estates of Bernard L. Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in bankruptcy court in New York. In both cases, the trustee alleges that certain transfers received by NWM N.V. amounted to fraudulent conveyances that should be clawed back for the benefit of the Madoff estate.\n\nIn the primary action, filed in December 2010, the trustee is seeking to clawback a total of US$276.3 million in redemptions that NWM N.V. allegedly received from certain Madoff feeder funds and certain swap counterparties. In March 2020, the bankruptcy court denied the trustee's request for leave to amend its complaint to include additional allegations against NWM N.V., holding that, even with the proposed amendments, the complaint would fail as a matter of law to state a valid claim against NWM N.V. The trustee has commenced an appeal of the bankruptcy court's decision, which has been stayed pending the result of appeals in different proceedings, against different defendants, that involve similar issues. In the second action, filed in October 2011, the trustee seeks to recover an additional US$21.8 million. This action has been stayed pending the result of the appeal in the primary action.\n\n## Interest rate hedging products and similar litigation\n\nNatWest Group continues to deal with a small number of active litigation claims in the UK relating to the alleged mis-selling of interest rate hedging products.\n\nSeparately, NWM Plc is defending claims filed in France by two French local authorities relating to structured interest rate swaps. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the swaps are void for being illegal transactions, that they were mis-sold, and that information / advisory duties were breached. One of the claims is being appealed to the Supreme Court and the other has been remitted from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration of one aspect. NWM N.V. was a defendant in the latter case but has been dismissed from the proceedings.\n\n## EUA trading litigation\n\nHMRC issued a tax assessment in 2012 against NatWest Group plc for approximately \u00a386 million regarding a value-added-tax (VAT) matter in relation to the trading of European Union Allowances (EUAs) by a joint venture subsidiary in 2009. NatWest Group plc has lodged an appeal, which is due to be heard in June 2021, before the First-tier Tribunal (Tax), a specialist tax tribunal, challenging the assessment (the 'Tax Dispute'). In the event that the assessment is upheld, interest and costs would be payable, and a penalty of up to 100 per cent of the VAT held to have been legitimately denied by HMRC could also be levied.\n\nSeparately, NWM Plc was a named defendant in civil proceedings before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales brought in 2015 by ten companies (all in liquidation) (the 'Liquidated Companies') and their respective liquidators (together, 'the Claimants'). The Liquidated Companies previously traded in EUAs in 2009 and were alleged to be defaulting traders within (or otherwise connected to) the EUA supply chains forming the subject of the Tax Dispute. The Claimants claimed approximately \u00a371.4 million plus interest and costs and alleged that NWM Plc dishonestly assisted the directors of the Liquidated Companies in the breach of their statutory duties and/or knowingly participated in the carrying on of the business of the Liquidated Companies with intent to defraud creditors. The trial in that matter concluded in July 2018 and judgment was issued in March 2020. The court held that NWM Plc and Mercuria Energy Europe Trading Limited were liable for dishonestly assisting and knowingly being a party to fraudulent trading during a seven business day period in 2009. In October 2020, the High Court quantified damages against NWM Plc at \u00a345 million plus interest and costs, and permitted it to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The appeal hearing is due to take place in March 2021.\n\n## Offshoring VAT assessments\n\nHMRC issued protective tax assessments in 2018 against NatWest Group plc totalling \u00a3143 million relating to unpaid VAT in respect of the UK branches of two NatWest Group companies registered in India. NatWest Group formally requested reconsideration by HMRC of their assessments, and this process was completed in November 2020. HMRC upheld their original decision and, as a result, NatWest Group plc lodged an appeal with the Tax Tribunal and an application for judicial review with the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, both in December 2020. In order to lodge the appeal with the Tax Tribunal, NatWest Group plc was required to pay the \u00a3143 million to HMRC, and payment was made on 16 December 2020.\n\n## US Anti-Terrorism Act litigation\n\nNWB Plc is defending lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by a number of US nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs) who were victims of terrorist attacks in Israel. The plaintiffs allege that NWB Plc is liable for damages arising from those attacks pursuant to the US Anti-Terrorism Act because NWB Plc previously maintained bank accounts and transferred funds for the Palestine Relief & Development Fund, an organisation which plaintiffs allege solicited funds for Hamas, the alleged perpetrator of the attacks.\n\nIn October 2017, the trial court dismissed claims against NWB Plc with respect to two of the 18 terrorist attacks at issue. In March 2018, the trial court granted a request by NWB Plc for leave to file a renewed summary judgment motion in respect of the remaining claims, and in March 2019, the court granted summary judgment in favour of NWB Plc. The plaintiffs' appeal of the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is pending.",

NWM Plc is also a defendant in some of these cases.\n\nThe attacks at issue in the cases were allegedly perpetrated by Hezbollah and certain Iraqi terror cells allegedly funded by the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the plaintiffs' allegations, the defendants are liable for damages arising from the attacks because they allegedly conspired with Iran and certain Iranian banks to assist Iran in transferring money to Hezbollah and the Iraqi terror cells, in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, by agreeing to engage in 'stripping' of transactions initiated by the Iranian banks so that the Iranian nexus to the transactions would not be detected.\n\nThe first of these actions was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in November 2014. In September 2019, the district court dismissed the case, finding that the claims were deficient for several reasons, including lack of sufficient allegations as to the alleged conspiracy and causation. The plaintiffs are appealing the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Another action, filed in the SDNY in 2017, was dismissed in March 2019 on similar grounds, but remains subject to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Other follow-on actions that are substantially similar to the two that have now been dismissed are pending in the same courts.\n\n## Securities underwriting litigation\n\nNWMSI is an underwriter defendant in several securities class actions in the US in which plaintiffs generally allege that an issuer of public debt or equity securities, as well as the underwriters of the securities (including NWMSI), are liable to purchasers for misrepresentations and omissions made in connection with the offering of such securities.\n\n## Regulatory matters (including investigations and customer redress programmes)\n\nNatWest Group's businesses and financial condition can be affected by the actions of various governmental and regulatory authorities in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere. NatWest Group has engaged, and will continue to engage, in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities, including in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere, on an ongoing and regular basis, and in response to informal and formal inquiries or investigations, regarding operational, systems and control evaluations and issues including those related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including consumer protection, investment advice, business conduct, competition/anti-trust, VAT recovery, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and sanctions regimes.\n\nThe NatWest Markets business in particular has been providing, and continues to provide, information regarding a variety of matters, including, for example, offering of securities, the setting of benchmark rates and related derivatives trading, conduct in the foreign exchange market, product mis-selling and various issues relating to the issuance, underwriting, and sales and trading of fixed-income securities, including structured products and government securities, some of which have resulted, and others of which may result, in investigations or proceedings.\n\nAny matters discussed or identified during such discussions and inquiries may result in, among other things, further inquiry or investigation, other action being taken by governmental and regulatory authorities, increased costs being incurred by NatWest Group, remediation of systems and controls, public or private censure, restriction of NatWest Group's business activities and/or fines. Any of the events or circumstances mentioned in this paragraph or below could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group, its business, authorisations and licences, reputation, results of operations or the price of securities issued by it, or lead to material additional provisions being taken.\n\nNatWest Group is co-operating fully with the matters described below.\n\n## Investigations\n\n## US investigations relating to fixed-income securities\n\nIn the US, NatWest Group companies have in recent years been involved in investigations relating to, among other things, issuance, underwriting and trading in RMBS and other mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). Investigations by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and several state attorneys general relating to the issuance and underwriting of RMBS were previously resolved. In December 2020, RBS Financial Products, Inc. agreed to pay US$18.2 million to resolve such an investigation by the State of Maryland. RBS Financial Products, Inc. has paid the settlement amount, which was covered by an existing provision.\n\nIn October 2017, NWMSI entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut (USAO) in connection with alleged misrepresentations to counterparties relating to secondary trading in various forms of assetbacked securities. In the NPA, the USAO agreed not to file criminal charges relating to certain conduct and information described in the NPA, conditioned on NWMSI and affiliated companies complying with the NPA's reporting and conduct requirements during its term, including by not engaging in conduct during the NPA that the USAO determines was a felony under federal or state law or a violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the United States securities law.\n\nThe NatWest Markets business is currently responding to a separate criminal investigation by the USAO and DoJ concerning unrelated trading by certain NatWest Markets former traders involving alleged spoofing. The NPA (referred to above) has been extended as the criminal investigation has progressed and related discussions with the USAO and the DoJ, including relating to the impact of such alleged conduct on the status of the NPA and the potential consequences thereof, have been ongoing. The duration and outcome of these matters remain uncertain, including in respect of whether settlement may be reached. Material adverse collateral consequences, in addition to further substantial costs and the recognition of further provisions, may occur depending on the outcome of the investigations, as further described in the Risk Factor relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on page 360.\n\n## Foreign exchange related investigations\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, NWM Plc paid significant penalties to resolve investigations into its FX business by the FCA, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the DoJ, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In May and June 2019, NatWest Group plc and NWM Plc reached settlements totalling approximately EUR 275 million in connection with the European Commission and certain other related competition law investigations into FX trading. NWM Plc continues to co-operate with ongoing investigations from competition authorities on similar issues relating to past FX trading. The exact timing and amount of future financial penalties, related risks and collateral consequences remain uncertain and may be material.\n\n## FCA investigation into NatWest Group's compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007\n\nIn July 2017, the FCA notified NatWest Group that it was undertaking an investigation into NatWest Group's compliance with the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2007 in relation to certain money service businesses and related parties. The investigation is assessing both criminal and civil culpability. NatWest Group is co-operating with the investigation, including responding to information requests from the FCA.\n\n## Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme assessment\n\nIn December 2018, the FCA commenced a Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme assessment of NatWest Group. The FCA provided its written findings to NatWest Group in June 2019, and NatWest Group responded on 8 August 2019. On 28 August 2019, the FCA instructed NatWest Group to appoint a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to provide assurance on financial crime governance arrangements in relation to two financial crime change programmes. NatWest Group is cooperating with the Skilled Person's review, which is ongoing.\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

In March 2019 the final report was published. This found that competition was working well for many customers but also proposed remedies to help customers shop around more easily for mortgages. A period of consultation is underway and the FCA has indicated that it intends to provide updates on the remedies in due course.\n\n## Customer redress programmes FCA review of NatWest Group's treatment of SMEs\n\nIn 2014, the FCA appointed an independent Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to review NatWest Group's treatment of SME customers whose relationship was managed by NatWest Group's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. In response to the Skilled Person's final report and update in 2016, NatWest Group announced redress steps for SME customers in the UK and the Republic of Ireland that were in GRG between 2008 and 2013. These steps were (i) an automatic refund of certain complex fees; and (ii) a new complaints process, overseen by an independent third party. The complaints process has since closed to new complaints.\n\nNatWest Group's remaining provisions in relation to these matters at 31 December 2020 were \u00a330 million.\n\n## Investment advice review\n\nDuring October 2019, the FCA notified NatWest Group of its intention to appoint a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to conduct a review of whether NatWest Group's past business review of investment advice provided during 2010 to 2015 was subject to appropriate governance and accountability and led to appropriate customer outcomes. NatWest Group is co-operating with the Skilled Person's review and, subject to discussion with the FCA, expects to conduct additional review / remediation work during 2021. Accordingly, NatWest Group recognised an increased provision in relation to these matters at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Review and investigation of treatment of tracker mortgage customers in Ulster Bank Ireland DAC\n\nIn December 2015, correspondence was received from the CBI setting out an industry examination framework in respect of the sale of tracker mortgages from approximately 2001 until the end of 2015. The redress and compensation phase has concluded, although an appeals process is currently anticipated to run until at least the end of 2021. NatWest Group has made provisions totalling \u20ac335 million (\u00a3301 million), of which \u20ac284 million (\u00a3255 million) had been utilised by 31 December 2020 in respect of redress and compensation.\n\nIn April 2016, the CBI commenced an investigation alleging that it suspected UBI DAC of breaching specified provisions of the Consumer Protection Code 2006 in its treatment of certain tracker mortgage customers. This investigation is ongoing.\n\nUBI DAC identified further legacy business issues, as an extension to the tracker mortgage review. These remediation programmes are ongoing. NatWest Group has made provisions of \u20ac164 million (\u00a3147 million), of which \u20ac144 million (\u00a3129 million) had been utilised by 31 December 2020 for these programmes.",

These investments are made in the normal course of business. In some instances, the investment may extend to ownership or control over 20% or more of the voting rights of the investee company.

The potential sale contemplated by the MoU remains subject to due diligence, further negotiation and agreement of final terms and definitive documentation, as well as obtaining regulatory and other approvals and satisfying other conditions. The proposed sale may not be concluded on the terms contemplated in the MoU, or at all.

Presentation of accounts\n\nThe accounts are prepared on a going concern basis (refer to the Report of the directors on page 153) and in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe parent company is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland. The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivatives and certain financial instruments which are stated at fair value. Recognised financial assets and financial liabilities in fair value hedges are adjusted for changes in fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged.\n\nThe accounting policies that are applicable to the parent company are included in NatWest Group plc's accounting policies which are set out on pages 264 to 268 of the consolidated financial statements, except that it has no policy regarding 'Basis of consolidation'.\n\n## 2. Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe reported results of the company are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements. The judgements and assumptions involved in the company's accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are those involved in assessing the impairment, if any, in its investments in subsidiaries. At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that its investment in a subsidiary is impaired. If any such indication exists, the company undertakes an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary with its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgments: the choice of appropriate discount and growth rates; and the estimation of fair value.\n\n## Future accounting developments\n\n## International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nA number of IFRSs and amendments to IFRS were in issue at 31 December 2020. NatWest Group plc is assessing the effect of adopting these standards on its financial statements.\n\n## 3 Derivatives with subsidiaries - designated hedges\n\nFair value hedging is used to hedge loans and other financial liabilities, and cash flow hedging is used to hedge other financial liabilities and subordinated liabilities.\n\nDerivatives held for designated hedging purposes are as follows:\n\n|                                              | 2020         | 2020   | 2020        | 2019     | 2019   | 2019            |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------------|\n|                                              | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets | Liabilities | Notional | Assets | Liabilities  \u00a3m |\n|                                              |              | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m          | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m     |                 |\n| Fair value hedging - interest rate contracts | 25.0         | 1,537  | 359         | 25.2     | 953    | 243             |\n| Cash flow hedging - exchange rate contracts  | 5.8          | 7      | 3           | 8.4      | 23     | -               |\n| Total                                        |              | 1,544  | 362         |          | 976    | 243             |\n\nFinanci\n\na\n\nl\n\ns\n\ntatements",

Movements during the year were as follows:\n\n|                                              | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                 | 55,808    | 56,747    |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments   | -         | (38)      |\n| Additional investments in Group undertakings | 27        | 2,523     |\n| Disposals                                    | -         | (1,973)   |\n| Impairment of investments                    | (9,606)   | (1,451)   |\n| At 31 December                               | 46,229    | 55,808    |\n\nIn 2020 the company invested additional capital in its subsidiaries of \u00a327 million of equity (NWM Plc and RBS AA Holdings). The 2019 additional investments were mainly related to NatWest Markets Plc.\n\nThe key judgement is in determining the recoverable amount. This is the higher of net realisable value and value in use, being an assessment of the discounted future cash flows of the entity. The 2020 charge is mostly related to the company's investment in NatWest Holdings Limited which was impaired by \u00a39 billion at 30 June 2020 and \u00a3320 million at 31 December 2020, primarily due to the decline in net realisable value as a result of challenging market conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's investment in NatWest Markets Plc was impaired by \u00a3286 million at 31 December 2020, due to a decline in net realisable value. Therefore, the carrying value of investments in Group undertakings at the year end is supported by the respective net realisable values of the entities.\n\nThe principal subsidiary undertakings of the company are shown below. Their capital consists of ordinary shares, preference shares and additional Tier 1 notes which are unlisted with the exception of certain preference shares listed by NWB Plc. All of these subsidiaries are included in NatWest Group's consolidated financial statements and have an accounting reference date of 31 December.\n\n|                                                                                                                                    | Nature of business    | Country of incorporation and  principal area of operation   | Group interest   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| National Westminster Bank Plc (1,3)                                                                                                | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (3)                                                                                                 | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| Coutts & Company (2, 3)                                                                                                            | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| Ulster Bank Ireland Designated Activity Company (3)                                                                        Banking |                       | Republic of Ireland                                         | 100%             |\n| NatWest Markets Plc                                                                                                                | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| NatWest Markets N.V.

This document contains a number of adjusted or alternative performance measures, also known as non-GAAP or non-IFRS performance measures. These measures are adjusted for certain items which management believe are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period comparison. The non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include the calculation of metrics that are used throughout the banking industry. These non-IFRS measures are not measures within the scope of IFRS and are not a substitute for IFRS measures.

The data is consolidated for all the subsidiaries and branches allocated to each country.\n\n## Income and profit/(loss) before tax\n\nIncome and profit/(loss) totals are reported on page 275 within the Geographical segments table.\n\n## Tax paid/(received)\n\nTax paid/(received) disclosed under CRD IV relates to corporate tax.\n\nCorporate tax paid represents net cash taxes paid to/(received) from the tax authorities in each jurisdiction.\n\nCorporate tax paid is reported on a cash basis as opposed to an accounting basis and therefore does not necessarily have a direct correlation to the reported profits or losses arising in the year.\n\n## Full time equivalent employees ('FTEs')\n\nFTEs are allocated to the country in which they are primarily based for the performance of their employment duties. The figures disclosed represent the average number of FTEs, including temporary staff, in each country during the period. The FTEs, including temporary staff as at the year end 31 December 2020, have been added for completeness.\n\n## Public subsidies received\n\nNo public subsidies were received during the period.",

These risk factors are broadly categorised and should be read in conjunction with other sections of this annual report, including the forward-looking statements section, the strategic report and the risk and capital management section. They should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties facing NatWest Group. The current COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate any of the risks described below.\n\nRisks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK, global economies and financial markets, and NatWest Group's customers, as well as its competitive environment may continue to have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the COVID-19 virus a pandemic. Since then, many countries, including the UK (NatWest Group's most significant market) have at times imposed strict social distancing measures, restrictions on non-essential activities and travel quarantines, in an attempt to slow the spread and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe UK economy, as well as most countries, went into recession in 2020 as measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. UK economic output fell again in November 2020, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics, as many restrictions were re-introduced towards the end of 2020 and at the start of 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant reductions in levels of personal and commercial activity, reductions in consumer spending, increased levels of corporate debt and, for some customers, personal debt, increased unemployment and significant market volatility in asset prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. It has also caused physical disruption and slow-down to global supply chains and working practices, all of which have affected NatWest Group's customers. NatWest Group has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors economically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure and travel.\n\nFurther waves of infection may result in further restrictions in affected countries and regions. While vaccine treatment is currently being deployed, the pace of deployment and ultimate effectiveness is uncertain, and vaccines may fail to achieve immunisation that is significant within the population. Therefore, significant uncertainties remain as to how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last. Even when restrictions are relaxed, they may be re-imposed, sometimes at short notice if\n\neither immunisation is insufficient or new strains of the COVID-19 virus or other diseases develop into new epidemics or pandemics.\n\nSignificant uncertainties continue as to the extent of the economic contraction and the path and length of time required to achieve economic recovery.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks, governments, regulators and legislatures in the UK and elsewhere have announced historic levels of support and various schemes for impacted businesses and individuals including forms of financial assistance and legal and regulatory initiatives, including further reductions in interest rates. Whether or not these measures effectively mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID19 pandemic on NatWest Group, some of these measures, or further measures, such as negative interest rates, may also have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business and performance. It is uncertain as to how long the above-mentioned financial assistance and legal and regulatory initiatives may last, how they may evolve in the future or how consumers and businesses may react to such initiatives. NatWest Group's consumer customers and corporate clients may be negatively impacted when these support schemes and initiatives are scaled back and ultimately ended, which in turn could expose NatWest Group to increased credit and counterparty risk. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic related uncertainties and the range of prudential regulatory support has made reliance on analytical models and planning and forecasting for NatWest Group more complex, and may result in uncertainty impacting the risk profile of NatWest Group and/or that of the wider banking industry. The medium and long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for NatWest Group customers, the UK housing market, and the UK and global economies and financial markets remain uncertain, and may continue to have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThe adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of NatWest Group's counterparties and the implementation of support schemes in response of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased NatWest Group's exposure to counterparty risk, which may adversely affect its business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected the credit quality of many of NatWest Group's borrowers and other counterparties. As a result, NatWest Group has experienced (and may continue to experience) elevated exposure to credit risk and demands on its funding from, for example, customers and borrowers drawing down upon committed credit facilities. If borrowers or other counterparties default or suffer deterioration in credit, this would increase impairment charges, credit reserves, write-downs and regulatory expected loss. An\n\nincrease in drawings upon committed credit facilities may also increase NatWest Group's RWAs. In addition, the level of household indebtedness in the UK remains high. The ability of households to service their debts could be worsened by a period of high unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if prolonged. NatWest Group's mortgage and wholesale property loans portfolio may also be subject to higher impairment charges as a result of the COVID19 pandemic if volatility in the property market results in weakened property prices, particularly if default rates increase. If NatWest Group experiences losses and a reduction in future profitability, this is likely to affect the recoverable value of fixed assets, including goodwill and deferred taxes, which may lead to further write-downs. See also, 'NatWest Group has significant exposure to counterparty and borrower risk'.\n\nNatWest Group has applied an internal analysis of multiple economic scenarios (MES) together with the determination of specific overlay adjustments to inform its IFRS 9 ECL (Expected Credit Loss). The recognition and measurement of ECL is complex and involves the use of significant judgement and estimation. This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic scenarios into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate. Going forward, NatWest Group anticipates observable credit deterioration of a proportion of assets resulting in a systematic uplift in defaults, which is mitigated by those economic assumption scenarios being reflected in the Stage 2 ECL across portfolios, along with a combination of post model overlays in both wholesale and retail portfolios reflecting the uncertainty of credit outcomes. See also, 'Risk and capital management'. A credit deterioration would also lead to RWA increases. Furthermore, the assumptions and judgments used in the MES and ECL assessment at 31 December 2020 may not prove to be adequate resulting in incremental ECL provisions for NatWest Group. As government support schemes reduce, defaults are expected to rise with more ECLs cases moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3.\n\nIn line with certain mandated COVID-19 pandemic support schemes, NatWest Group has sought to assist affected customers with a number of initiatives including NatWest Group's participation in BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS products. NatWest Group has sought to manage the risks of fraud and money laundering against the need for the fast and efficient release of funds to customers and businesses. NatWest Group may be exposed to fraud, conduct and litigation risks arising from inappropriate approval (or denial) of BBLS or the enforcing or pursuing repayment of CBILS and BBLS (or a failure to exercise forbearance), which may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation and results of operations. The implementation of the initiatives and efforts mentioned above may result in litigation, regulatory and",

Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect NatWest Group's strategy and impair its ability to meet its targets and to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may impact NatWest Group's ability to meet the financial, capital and operational targets which it has set as part of its Purpose-led Strategy, including in relation to capital distributions and dividends to shareholders by NatWest Group plc. It is uncertain as to when NatWest Group plc will be able to resume capital distributions (and any associated distribution-linked contribution to the NatWest Group Pension Fund), including dividends to shareholders or share buybacks. It is also uncertain as to whether the PRA may, in the future, ask banks to reconsider their approaches to dividend payments and share buybacks, as it did in March 2020 in response to the COVID19 pandemic. In addition, impairments or other losses as well as increases to capital deductions may result in a decrease to NatWest Group plc's capital base. The form and timing of any capital distributions therefore remains uncertain, and may depend on a variety of factors, including the interests of various stakeholders (such as UKGI).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant market volatility, which would have increased NatWest Group's market risk RWA significantly in the absence of temporary changes in regulatory treatment. The risk of further RWA inflation remains and the duration of such regulatory relief is uncertain. This may impair NatWest Group's ability to timely deliver on certain aspects of its Purpose-led Strategy, including its plans to repurpose the NatWest Markets franchise (the 'NWM franchise'), which may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook. See also, 'NatWest Group is currently implementing its Purpose-led Strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes'.\n\nIt is uncertain as to how the broader macroeconomic business environment and societal norms may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is already resulting in several significant wider societal changes. For example, one of the most visible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the impact on the most vulnerable groups of society and concerns about systemic racial biases and social inequalities.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing economic trends that may radically change the way businesses are run and people live their lives. These trends include digitalisation, decarbonisation, automation, e-commerce and agile working, each of which has resulted in significant\n\nmarket volatility in asset prices. There is also increasing investor, regulatory and customer scrutiny regarding how businesses address these changes and related climate, environmental, social, governance and other sustainability issues, including workplace health, safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, data privacy, workforce management, human rights and supply chain management. Any failure or delay by NatWest Group to adapt its business strategy and to establish and maintain effective governance, procedures, systems and controls in response to these changes and to manage emerging climate, environmental, social, governance and other sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, business, results of operations and outlook and the value of NatWest Group's securities. See also, 'Any failure by NatWest Group to implement effective and compliant climate change resilient systems, controls and procedures could adversely affect NatWest Group ' s ability to manage climate-related risks' and 'A failure to adapt NatWest Group's business strategy, governance, procedures, systems and controls to manage emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, business, results of operations and outlook'.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also result in unexpected developments or changes in financial markets, the fiscal, tax and regulatory frameworks and consumer customer and corporate client behaviour, which could intensify competition in the financial services industry. If NatWest Group is not able to adapt or compete effectively, it could experience loss of business, which in turn could adversely affect its business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has heightened NatWest Group's operational risks as many of its employees are working remotely which may also adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, as at 31 January 2021, many of NatWest Group's employees continue to work remotely. This has increased reliance on the IT systems that enable remote working and increased exposure to fraud, conduct, operational and other risks and may place additional pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks. The IT systems that enable remote working interface with third-party systems, and NatWest Group could experience service denials or disruptions if such systems exceed capacity or if a thirdparty system fails or experiences any interruptions, all of which could result in business and customer interruption and related reputational damage, significant compensation costs, regulatory sanctions and/or a breach of applicable regulations. See also, 'NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working)\n\nand any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group'.\n\nSustained periods of remote working may also negatively affect workforce morale. While NatWest Group has taken measures seeking to maintain the health, wellbeing and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures may be ineffective and could result in increased expenses and widespread illness could negatively affect staffing within certain functions, businesses or geographies. Certain areas of NatWest Group also continue to experience workloads that are heavier than usual as a result of increased customer requirements, NatWest Group's COVID-19-specific product offerings or other related direct and indirect effects. Resources have been diverted from certain ordinary course activities, and regulatory and other change projects, including the implementation of NatWest Group ' s Purpose-led Strategy, which may have implications for the execution of related deliverables and meeting regulatory and other deadlines. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also necessitate changes in the remuneration of NatWest Group employees, in particular at a senior level. For example, in March 2020 the PRA requested that bank boards in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should consider taking appropriate actions with regard to the accrual, payment and vesting of variable remuneration. Any of the above could impair NatWest Group's ability to hire, retain and engage well-qualified employees, especially at a senior level, which in turn may adversely impact NatWest Group's ability to serve its customers efficiently and impact productivity across NatWest Group. This could also adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, and competitive position and its ability to grow its business.\n\nAny of the above could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could affect NatWest Group's ability to access sources of liquidity and funding, which may result in higher funding costs and failure to comply with regulatory capital, funding and leverage requirements.\n\nDepending on the severity and duration of market volatility resulting from COVID-19 pandemic related uncertainties and the impact on capital and RWAs, NatWest Group and its subsidiaries may be required to adapt their funding plans in order to satisfy their respective capital and funding requirements, which may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group. NatWest Group plc may also receive less in dividends than expected from its subsidiaries. Furthermore, significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, may affect capital deployed in NatWest Group's foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint arrangements, securities issued by NatWest Group in foreign currencies or the value of assets, liabilities, income, RWAs, capital base and expenses and the reported earnings of NatWest Group's UK and non-UK\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been relaxations on certain countercyclical buffer requirements and stress tests as well as the calculation of RWAs and leverage, which may be reinstated in the future. Any downgrading to the credit ratings and/or outlooks assigned to NatWest Group plc, its subsidiaries and their respective debt securities as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate funding and liquidity risk, which could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## NatWest Group's results could be COVID-19 pandemic or other events trigger\n\nadversely affected if the effects of the the recognition of a goodwill impairment. NatWest Group capitalises goodwill, which is calculated as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Acquired goodwill is recognised at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. As required by IFRS, NatWest Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment test compares the recoverable amount (the higher of the value in use and fair value less cost to sell) of an individual cash generating unit with its carrying value. At 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc carried goodwill of \u00a35.6 billion on its balance sheet. The value in use and fair value of NatWest Group's cash-generating units are affected by market conditions, the economies in which NatWest Group operates and by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe goodwill held by NatWest Group plc relies on management's assumptions on future profitability. Goodwill is particularly sensitive to changes in assumed future profitability, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If actual performance were to fall below management's forecasts, then there is a risk that an impairment of goodwill would become necessary.\n\nWhere NatWest Group is required to recognise a goodwill impairment, it is recorded in NatWest Group's income statement, but it has no effect on NatWest Group's regulatory capital position. Changes in such assumptions may result in the carrying balance being impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## Economic and political risk\n\nContinuing uncertainty regarding the effects of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union may continue to adversely affect NatWest Group and its operating environment.\n\nAfter the 2016 EU Referendum, the UK ceased to be a member of the EU and the European Economic Area ('EEA') on 31 January 2020 ('Brexit'). The 2020 EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement ('TCA')\n\nended the transition period on 31 December 2020 and provides for free trade between the UK and EU with zero tariffs and quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, with minimal coverage, however, for financial services; UK-incorporated financial services providers no longer have EU passporting rights and there is no mutual recognition regime. Financial services may largely be subject to individual equivalence decisions by relevant regulators. A number of temporary equivalence decisions have been made that cover all services offered by NatWest Group. The EU's equivalence regime does not cover most lending and deposit taking, and determinations in respect of third countries have not, to date, covered the provision of investment services. In addition, equivalence determinations do not guarantee permanent access rights and can be withdrawn with short notice. The TCA is accompanied by a Joint Declaration on financial services which sets out an intention for the EU and UK to cooperate on matters of financial regulation and to agree a Memorandum of Understanding by March 2021. There is no certainty, however, as to the form, scope and timing of any such Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nNatWest Group has engaged in significant and costly Brexit planning and contingency planning. NatWest Group continues to monitor regulatory developments, and NatWest Group continues to seek advice on any transitional regimes being introduced by individual EU countries. It is updating its operating model accordingly. NatWest Group also continues to assess where NatWest Group companies can obtain bilateral regulatory permissions to permit business to continue from its UK entities, transferring what cannot be continued to be rendered from the UK to an EEA subsidiary. Where such regulatory permissions are temporary or are withdrawn, a different approach may need to be taken or may result in a change in operating model or some business being ceased. Not all NatWest Group entities have applied for bilateral regulatory permissions and instead intend to move EEA business to an EEA licenced subsidiary. There is a risk that such EEA licences may not be granted, and where these permissions are not obtained, further changes to NatWest Group ' s operating model may be required or some business may need to be ceased. In addition, failure to obtain regulatory permissions in one part of NatWest Group may impact other parts of NatWest Group adversely. Certain permissions are required in order to maintain the ability to clear euro payments and others will allow NatWest Group to continue to serve non-UK EEA customers. Furthermore, transferring business to an EEA based subsidiary is a complex exercise and involves legal, regulatory and executional risks, and could result in a loss of business, customers or greater than expected costs. The changes to NatWest Group ' s operating model have been costly and further\n\nchanges to its business operations, product offering and customer engagement could result in further costs.\n\nThe effects of the UK's exit from the EU and the EEA are expected to continue to affect many aspects of NatWest Group ' s business and operating environment, including as described elsewhere in these risk factors, and may be material and/or cause a near-term impact on impairments.\n\nThe long-term effects of Brexit on NatWest Group's operating environment are difficult to predict. They may be impacted by wider global macro-economic trends and events, particularly COVID-19 pandemic related uncertainties, which may significantly impact NatWest Group and its customers and counterparties who are themselves dependent on trading with the EU or personnel from the EU. They may exacerbate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK, the Republic of Ireland ('ROI') and the rest of EU/EEA.\n\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the extent to which EU/EEA laws will diverge from UK law (including bank regulation), whether and what equivalence determinations will be made by the various regulators and therefore what the respective legal and regulatory arrangements will be, under which NatWest Group and its subsidiaries will operate. The legal and political uncertainty and any actions taken as a result of this uncertainty, as well as new or amended rules, could have a significant adverse impact on NatWest Group's businesses and non-UK operations and/or legal entity structure, including attendant operating, compliance and restructuring costs, level of impairments, capital requirements, regulatory environment and tax implications and as a result may adversely impact NatWest Group's profitability, competitive position, business model and product offering.\n\n## NatWest Group faces increased political and economic risks and uncertainty in the UK and global markets.\n\nNatWest Group faces political uncertainty in Scotland, as a result of a possible second Scottish independence referendum. Independence may adversely impact NatWest Group with NatWest Group plc and other NatWest Group entities (including NWM Plc) being incorporated and/or headquartered in Scotland. Any changes to Scotland's relationship with the UK or the EU (as an indirect result of Brexit or other developments) would impact the environment in which NatWest Group and its subsidiaries operate, and may require further changes to NatWest Group's structure, independently or in conjunction with other mandatory or strategic structural and organisational changes which could adversely impact NatWest Group.\n\nThe outlook for the global economy over the medium-term remains uncertain due to a number of factors including: the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting societal inequalities and changes, trade barriers and the increased",

These conditions could be worsened by a number of factors including macro-economic deterioration, increased instability in the global financial system and concerns relating to further financial shocks or contagion (for example, due to economic concerns in emerging markets), market volatility or fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling, new or extended economic sanctions, volatility in commodity prices or concerns regarding sovereign debt. This may be compounded by the ageing demographics of the populations in the markets that NatWest Group serves, increasing inequalities, or rapid change to the economic environment due to the adoption of technology and artificial intelligence. Any of the above developments could adversely impact NatWest Group directly (for example, as a result of credit losses) or indirectly (for example, by impacting global economic growth and financial markets and NatWest Group's customers and their banking needs).\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group is exposed to risks arising out of geopolitical events or political developments, such as, exchange controls and other measures taken by sovereign governments that may hinder economic or financial activity levels. Furthermore, unfavourable political, military or diplomatic events, including secession movements or the exit of other member states from the EU, armed conflict, pandemics and widespread public health crises (including the current COVID-19 pandemic and any future epidemics or pandemics), state and privately sponsored cyber and terrorist acts or threats, and the responses to them by governments and markets, could negatively affect the business and performance of NatWest Group, including as a result of the indirect effect on regional or global trade and/or NatWest Group's customers.\n\nThe value of NatWest Group's financial instruments may be materially affected by market risk, including as a result of market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain of NatWest Group's financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. This could cause a decline in the value of NatWest Group's financial instruments, which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's results of operations in future periods, or inaccurate carrying values for certain financial instruments.\n\nUnder these conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, increasing NatWest Group's counterparty risk. NatWest Group's risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate NatWest Group's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and NatWest Group could realise significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.\n\n## Changes in interest rates have significantly affected and will continue to affect NatWest Group's business and results.\n\nInterest rate risk is significant for NatWest Group. Monetary policy has been accommodative in recent years including initiatives implemented by the Bank of England and HM Treasury, such as the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs ('TFSME'), which have helped to support demand at a time of pronounced fiscal tightening and balance sheet repair. However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the future direction of interest rates and pace of change (as set by the Bank of England), including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the UK economy as well as the general UK political or economic climate. Further decreases in interest rates and/or continued sustained low or negative interest rates would be expected to continue to put further pressure on NatWest Group's interest income and profitability. Zero or negative interest rates will require investment spend to implement a strategic solution to allow a potential pass-through of those interest rates in certain systems to relevant customer segments.  A lower or negative interest rate environment is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of NatWest Group.\n\nConversely, while increases in interest rates may support NatWest Group's interest income, sharp increases in interest rates could have macroeconomic effects that lead to adverse outcomes for the business. For example, they could lead to generally weaker than expected growth, or even contracting GDP, reduced business confidence, higher default rates on customer loans, higher levels of unemployment or underemployment, and falling property prices in the markets in which NatWest Group operates, all of which could adversely affect the business and performance of NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values, which may be accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity.\n\n## HM Treasury (or UKGI on its behalf) could exercise a significant degree of influence over NatWest Group and further offers or sales of NatWest Group's shares held by HM Treasury may affect the price of securities issued by NatWest Group.\n\nIn its March 2020 Budget, the UK Government announced its intention to continue the process of privatisation of NatWest Group plc and to carry out a programme of sales of NatWest Group plc ordinary shares with the objective of selling all of its remaining shares in NatWest Group plc by 2025. On 6 February 2019, NatWest Group plc obtained shareholder authority to make off-market purchases of its ordinary shares from HM Treasury under the terms of a directed buyback contract. The authority provided by this contract was renewed at NatWest Group's Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2020. As at 31 December 2020, the UK Government held 61.9% of the issued ordinary share capital of NatWest Group plc. There can be no certainty as to the continuation of the sell-down process or the timing or extent of such sell-downs, which could result in a prolonged period of increased price volatility on NatWest Group's ordinary shares.\n\nAny offers or sales of a substantial number of ordinary shares by HM Treasury, expectations relating to the timing thereof, or any associated directed buyback activity by NatWest Group, could affect the prevailing market price for the outstanding ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc.\n\nHM Treasury has indicated that it intends to respect the commercial decisions of NatWest Group and that NatWest Group will continue to have its own independent board of directors and management team determining its own strategy. However, HM Treasury, as majority shareholder, and UK Government Investments Limited ('UKGI'), as manager of HM Treasury ' s shareholding, could exercise a significant degree of influence over the election of directors and appointment of senior management, NatWest Group ' s capital strategy, dividend policy, remuneration policy or the conduct of NatWest Group ' s operations, and other things. HM Treasury or UKGI's approach depends on government policy, which could change, including as a result of a general election. The manner in which HM Treasury or UKGI exercises HM Treasury ' s rights as majority shareholder could give rise to conflicts between the interests of HM Treasury and the interests of other shareholders, including as a result of a change in government policy.\n\n## Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect NatWest Group's results and financial position.\n\nDecisions of major central banks (including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve) and political or market events, which are outside NatWest Group's control, may lead to sharp and sudden variations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nAlthough NatWest Group is now principally a UK and ROI-focused banking group, it is subject to foreign exchange risk from capital deployed in NatWest Group's foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint arrangements and customer transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of NatWest Group. NatWest Group also relies on issuing securities in foreign currencies that assist in meeting NatWest Group's minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL') and NWM Plc deals foreign exchange instruments. NatWest Group maintains policies and procedures designed to manage the impact of exposures to fluctuations in currency rates. Nevertheless, changes in currency rates, particularly in the sterling-US dollar and euro-sterling rates, can adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities (including the total amount MREL eligible instruments), foreign exchange dealing activity, income and expenses, RWAs and hence the reported earnings and financial condition of NatWest Group.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nNatWest Group is currently implementing its Purpose-led Strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes.\n\nIn February 2020, NatWest Group announced a new strategy, focused on becoming a Purpose-led business, designed to champion potential and to help individuals, families and businesses to thrive. This strategy is intended to reflect the rapidly shifting environment and backdrop of unprecedented disruption in society driven by technology and changing customer expectations, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. NatWest Group aims to deliver this strategy, referred to as its 'Purpose-led Strategy', through: (i) four strategic priorities: 'supporting customers at every stage of their lives;' 'powered by innovation and partnerships;' 'simple to deal with'; and 'sharpened capital allocation;' and (ii) three areas of focus: climate change, enterprise and learning.  This strategy requires an internal cultural shift across NatWest Group as to how performance is perceived and how NatWest Group conducts its business. These changes are substantial and will take many years to fully embed. These changes may not result in the expected outcome within the timeline and in the manner currently contemplated.\n\nTo deliver against this purpose and deliver sustainable returns, NatWest Group has been: focusing on the lifecycles of its customers using insights about customers to evolve product and service offerings; reengineering and simplifying NatWest Group by updating operational and technological capabilities and strengthening governance and control frameworks to reduce costs and improve customer journeys; focusing on innovation and partnership to drive change and achieve growth in new product areas and customer segments; and having a sharper focus on capital allocation and deploying it more effectively for customers, in particular by\n\nrefocusing its NWM franchise and through its phased withdrawal from ROI.\n\nAs part of its Purpose-led Strategy, NatWest Group has set a number of financial, capital and operational targets and expectations, both for the short term and throughout the implementation period.  These include targets, amongst others, for: return on tangible equity, CET1 ratio and dividend pay-out ratio. Achieving these targets requires further significant reductions to NatWest Group's cost base. Realising these cost reductions will result in material strategic costs, which may be more than currently expected. The continued focus on meeting cost reduction targets may also mean limited investment in other areas, which could affect NatWest Group's long-term prospects, product offering or competitive position and its ability to meet its other targets and commitments, including those related to customer satisfaction and its capacity to respond to climate -related risks and opportunities in line with its ambition. Any of the factors above, could jeopardise NatWest Group's ability to achieve its associated financial targets and generate sustainable returns.\n\nImplementing the Purpose-led Strategy is highly complex as discussed above. More generally, NatWest Group may seek to adapt its strategy, including in respect of acquisitions, divestments, restructurings, reorganisations or partnerships. There remains uncertainty as to consolidation within the financial industry and the scale and timing of any further NatWest Group strategic initiatives or participation in any such consolidation.\n\nNatWest Group may not be able to successfully (i) implement all aspects of its strategy; (ii) reach any or all of the related targets or expectations of its Purpose-led Strategy; (iii) realise the intended strategic objectives of any other future strategic initiative, in the time frames contemplated or at all, which may require additional management actions by NatWest Group. In addition, NatWest Group's ability to serve its target customers, scale certain ventures, deliver growth in new markets, refocus the NWM franchise and implement a phased withdrawal from ROI may be impacted and the anticipated revenue, profitability and cost reduction levels may not be achieved in the timescale envisaged or at all. Moreover, NatWest Group's strategy involves a large number of concurrent and strategic actions and initiatives, including refocusing of the NWM franchise and the phased withdrawal from ROI, any of which could fail to be implemented in the manner and to the extent currently contemplated, including as a result of operational, legal, execution or other issues.\n\nThe refocusing of the NWM franchise and NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI are two strategic initiatives that may entail significant commercial, operational, legal and execution risks. For the risks relating to the refocusing of the NWM franchise, see\n\n'NatWest Group is in the process of refocusing its NWM franchise, which entails significant commercial, operational and execution risks and the intended benefits for NatWest Group may not be realised within the timeline and in the manner currently contemplated'. NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI, which may involve transfers of business, assets and liabilities to third parties, entails many risks, the most significant of which include: (i) anticipated reductions in net income, total lending and RWAs; (ii) potential trapped or stranded capital; (iii) the diversion of management resources and attention away from day-to-day management; (iv) the recognition of disposal losses as part of the orderly run-down of certain loan portfolios which may be higher than anticipated; (v) execution risks arising from the significant uncertainties of a phased withdrawal, including the additional IT and operational expense and resource required to mitigate manual and limited customer switching and handling processes of Ulster Bank, potential counterparties and other banks; (vi) customer action or inaction, or the inability to obtain necessary approvals and/or support from governmental authorities, regulators, trade unions and/or other stakeholders resulting in additional cost, resource and delays; (vii) potential loss of customers, resulting in retail and commercial deposit outflows (or a failure to attract deposit inflows) and reduced revenues and liquidity; (viii) increased people risk through the potential loss of key colleagues and institutional knowledge and increased challenges of attracting and retaining colleagues; (ix) regulatory risk, including in relation to prudential, conduct and other regulatory requirements; (x) the potential early repayment of ECB funding and no or limited access to other Euro system funding arrangements; (xi) brand and reputational risks due to press speculation and stakeholder scrutiny about the future of the ROI business. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cost more, be more complex or worse than currently estimated and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to execute a phased withdrawal from ROI.\n\nIn addition, successful implementation of NatWest Group's strategy in part depends on initiatives and growth in ventures that are new to NatWest Group or to the market. There is a risk, therefore, that some or all these initiatives will not succeed, or may be limited in scope or scale, including due to its current ownership structure.\n\nThe scale and scope of the intended changes present material business, operational, IT system, internal culture, conduct and people risks to NatWest Group as the planning and implementation of the transformation programme are resource-intensive and disruptive, and will divert management resources. In addition, implementing many changes concurrently, in particular with respect to any strategic partnerships, acquisitions or divestments, will require application of robust governance and controls frameworks and robust IT systems.

The implementation of the Purpose-led Strategy and any other strategic initiatives could result in materially higher costs than initially contemplated (including due to material uncertainties and factors outside of NatWest Group's control) and may not be completed when planned, or at all, or could be phased or could progress in a manner other than currently expected.\n\nChanges in the economic, political and regulatory environment in which NatWest Group operates or regulatory uncertainty and changes, strong market competition and industry disruption or economic volatility, including as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's future trading arrangements with the EU or changes in the scale and timing of policy responses on climate change, may require NatWest Group to adjust aspects of its strategy or the timeframe for its implementation including in relation to its financial, capital and operational targets and expectations. Because certain initiatives depend on achieving growth in new ventures and opportunities for NatWest Group, its strategy is vulnerable to an economic downturn. NatWest Group's strategy also requires ongoing confidence from customers and the wider market, without which customer activity and related income levels may fall or NatWest Group's reputation may be adversely affected.\n\nEach of these risks, and others identified in these Risk Factors, individually or collectively could jeopardise the implementation and delivery of the Purpose-led Strategy and other strategic initiatives, result in higher than expected restructuring costs, impact NatWest Group's products and services offering, its reputation with customers or business model and adversely impact NatWest Group's ability to deliver its strategy and meet its targets and guidance, each of which could have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nNatWest Group is in the process of refocusing its NWM franchise, which entails significant commercial, operational and execution risks and the intended benefits for NatWest Group may not be realised within the timeline and in the manner currently contemplated.\n\nAs part of its Purpose-led Strategy, NatWest Group has been seeking to implement a more strategically congruent and economically sustainable model for its NWM franchise. As part of this, NatWest Group has been refocusing the NWM franchise to principally serve NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customer base. This requires NWM Group to simplify its operating model and technology platform, as well as reduce its cost base and capital requirements. A focus of the NWM franchise refocusing is the intended reduction in its level of RWAs. This is intended to be achieved by exiting certain exposures and optimising inefficient capital\n\nacross the NWM Group, especially in relation to its Rates products.\n\nThe refocusing of the NWM franchise entails significant execution risks and is based on management plans, projections and models and is subject to certain material assumptions and judgments which may prove to be incorrect such that the go-forward strategy is re-assessed (for example, if revenues reduce relatively faster than costs; material execution issues arise or market distress occurs; RWAs take longer to exit or are more costly to reduce than anticipated; or the key franchise legal entities, NWM Plc and NWM N.V., have difficulties accessing the funding market on acceptable terms or at all).\n\nImplementing these changes to the NWM franchise entails significant commercial and operational and risks. These include risks around how it is perceived by its customers and stakeholders and the ability for NWM to retain employees required to deliver the transition and whom are key for its go-forward strategic priorities. Revenues and costs may be negatively impacted (revenues, for example, may decrease significantly more quickly than associated costs) and the implementation may be more difficult or expensive than expected, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's exit from the EU and regulatory requirements. The orderly run-down of certain of its portfolios and the reduction of its RWAs may be accompanied by the recognition of disposal losses which may be higher than anticipated, including due to a degraded economic environment (in particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), and may not lead to a concurrent and proportionate reduction in required capital. The NWM Plc and NWM N.V. boards support the financial plans and budgets, but continued successful implementation of this strategy within the NWM franchise will require their continued support, as well as the support of NWM Plc and NWM N.V. management.\n\n## Financial resilience risk\n\nNatWest Group may not meet targets and be in a position to continue to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs part of NatWest Group's strategy, NatWest Group has become a UK and ROI-focused banking group and as part of its Purpose-led Strategy has set a number of financial, capital and operational targets for NatWest Group including in respect of: CET1 ratio targets, return on tangible equity ('ROTE'), leverage ratio targets, funding plans and requirements, reductions in RWAs and the timing thereof, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion as well as environmental, social and customer satisfaction targets and discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders). See also, 'NatWest Group is currently implementing its Purpose-led Strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes'.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its targets and to successfully meet its strategy is subject to various internal and external factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market, regulatory, macroeconomic and political uncertainties, operational risks and risks relating to NatWest Group's business model and strategy (including risks associated with climate, environmental, governance and other sustainability-related issues) and litigation, governmental actions, investigations and regulatory matters.\n\nA number of factors, including the economic and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact NatWest Group's ability to maintain its CET1 ratio target and make discretionary capital distributions. See also, 'NatWest Group may not meet the prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL, or manage its capital effectively, which could trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options'.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its planned reductions in its annual underlying costs may vary considerably from year to year. Furthermore, the focus on meeting cost reduction targets may result in limited investment in other areas, which could affect NatWest Group's long-term product offering or competitive position and its ability to meet its other targets, including those related to customer satisfaction.\n\nThere is a risk that NatWest Group may not meet its targets and expectations or be in a position to continue to distribute capital when regulatory distribution restrictions are eased, or that NatWest Group will be a viable, competitive or profitable banking business.\n\n## NatWest Group operates in markets that are highly competitive, with increasing competitive pressures and technology disruption.\n\nThe markets within which NatWest Group operates are highly competitive. NatWest Group expects such competition to continue and intensify in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other changes. These include evolving customer behaviour, technological changes (including digital currencies and the growth of digital banking, including from fintech entrants), competitor behaviour, new entrants to the market (including non-traditional financial services providers such as large retail or technology conglomerates, who may have competitive advantages in scale, technology and customer engagement), competitive foreign-exchange offerings, industry trends resulting in increased disaggregation or unbundling of financial services or conversely the re-intermediation of traditional banking services, and the impact of regulatory actions and other factors. In particular, developments in the financial sector resulting from new banking, lending and payment solutions offered by rapidly evolving incumbents, challengers and new entrants, notably with respect to payment services and products, and the introduction of disruptive technology may impede NatWest Group's ability to grow\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

Moreover, innovations such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, the cloud, blockchain, and quantum computing may rapidly facilitate industry transformation. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be catalysed by various regulatory and competition policy interventions, including the UK initiative on Open Banking (PSD2), Open Finance and other remedies imposed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which are designed to further promote competition within retail banking, as well as the competitionenhancing measures under NatWest Group's Alternative Remedies Package. See also, 'The cost of implementing the Alternative Remedies Package ('ARP') could be more onerous than anticipated'.\n\nIncreasingly many of the products and services offered by NatWest Group are, and will become, more technology intensive. For example, NatWest Group recently invested in a number of fintech ventures, including Mettle, FreeAgent, Tyl, Mentor Digital and Rapid Cash. NatWest Group's ability to develop such digital solutions (which also need to comply with applicable and evolving regulations) has become increasingly important to retaining and growing NatWest Group's customer business in the UK. There can be no certainty that NatWest Group's innovation strategy (which includes investment in its IT capability intended to address the material increase in customer use of online and mobile technology for banking as well as selective acquisitions, which carry associated risks) will be successful or that it will allow NatWest Group to continue to grow such services in the future. Certain of NatWest Group's current or future competitors may be more successful in implementing innovative technologies for delivering products or services to their customers. NatWest Group may also fail to identify future opportunities or derive benefits from disruptive technologies in the context of rapid technological innovation, changing customer behaviour and growing regulatory demands, resulting in increased competition from traditional banking businesses as well as new providers of financial services, including technology companies with strong brand recognition, that may be able to develop financial services at a lower cost base.\n\nNatWest Group's competitors may also be better able to attract and retain customers and key employees, may have better IT systems, and may have access to lower cost funding and/or be able to attract deposits on more favourable terms than NatWest Group. Although NatWest Group invests in new technologies and participates in industry and research led initiatives aimed at developing new technologies, such investments may be insufficient or ineffective, especially given NatWest Group's focus on its cost savings targets. This may limit additional investment in areas such as financial innovation and could therefore affect NatWest Group's offering of innovative products or technologies for\n\ndelivering products or services to customers and its competitive position. Furthermore, the development of innovative products depends on NatWest Group's ability to produce underlying high-quality data, failing which its ability to offer innovative products may be compromised.\n\nIf NatWest Group is unable to offer competitive, attractive and innovative products that are also profitable and timely, it will lose share, incur losses on some or all of its activities and lose opportunities for growth. In this context, NatWest Group is investing in the automation of certain solutions and interactions within its customer-facing businesses, including through artificial intelligence. Such initiatives may result in operational, reputational and conduct risks if the technology used is defective, or is not fully integrated into NatWest Group's current solutions. There can be no certainty that such initiatives will deliver the expected cost savings and investment in automated processes will likely also result in increased short-term costs for NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of its Purposeled Strategy, including the refocusing of its NWM franchise, NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI, acquisitions, divestments, reorganisations and restructurings and partnerships, and delivery on its climate ambition, cost-reduction measures, as well as employee remuneration constraints, may also have an impact on its ability to compete effectively and intensified competition from incumbents, challengers and new entrants could affect NatWest Group's ability to maintain satisfactory returns. Moreover, activist investors have increasingly become engaged and interventionist in recent years, which may pose a threat to NatWest Group's strategic initiatives. Furthermore, continued consolidation or technological or other developments in certain sectors of the financial services industry could result in NatWest Group's remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, including the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or the emergence of new competitors, each of which may adversely affect NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## NatWest Group has significant exposure to counterparty and borrower risk.\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to many different industries, customers and counterparties, and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and the recoverability of monies due from borrowers and other counterparties are inherent in a wide range of NatWest Group's businesses. NatWest Group is exposed to credit risk if a customer, borrower or counterparty defaults, or under IFRS 9, suffers a sufficiently significant deterioration of credit quality such that, under SICR ('significant increases in credit risk') rules, it moves to Stage 2 for impairment calculation purposes. NatWest Group's lending strategy and associated processes may fail to identify or anticipate weaknesses or risks in a particular sector,\n\nmarket or borrower, or fail to adequately value physical or financial collateral. This may result in increased default rates or a higher loss given default for loans, which may, in turn, impact NatWest Group's profitability. See also, 'Risk and capital management - Credit Risk'.\n\nThe credit quality of NatWest Group's borrowers and other counterparties is impacted by prevailing economic and market conditions (including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) and by the legal and regulatory landscape in the UK and any deterioration in such conditions or changes to legal or regulatory landscapes could worsen borrower and counterparty credit quality and consequently impact NatWest Group's ability to enforce contractual security rights.\n\nNatWest Group may be affected by volatility in property prices (including as a result of Brexit, the general UK political or economic climate or the COVID-19 pandemic) given that NatWest Group's mortgage loan and wholesale property loan portfolios as at 31 December 2020, amounted to \u00a3228.6 billion, representing 61.4% of NatWest Group's total customer loan exposure. If property prices were to weaken this could lead to higher impairment charges, particularly if default rates also increase. In addition, NatWest Group's credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral that it holds cannot be realised as a result of market conditions or regulatory intervention or if it is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the net amount after accounting for any IFRS provisions already made. This is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity or depressed asset valuations.\n\nConcerns about, or a default by, a financial institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related and interdependent as a result of credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Any perceived lack of creditworthiness of a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses for NatWest Group. This systemic risk may also adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which NatWest Group interacts on a daily basis. See also, 'NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding'.\n\nAs a result, changes in borrower and counterparty credit quality may cause accelerated impairment charges under IFRS 9, increased repurchase demands, higher costs, additional write-downs and losses for NatWest Group and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions.\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to the financial industry, including sovereign debt securities, banks, financial intermediation providers (including providing facilities to financial sponsors and funds, backed by assets or",

Due to NatWest Group's exposure to the financial industry, it also has exposure to shadow banking entities (i.e. entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework). Recently, there has been increasing regulatory focus on shadow banking. In particular, the European Banking Authority (EBA/GL/2015/20) require NatWest Group to identify and monitor its exposure to shadow banking entities, implement and maintain an internal framework for the identification, management, control and mitigation of the risks associated with exposure to shadow banking entities, and ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of such exposure. If NatWest Group is unable to properly identify and monitor its shadow banking exposure, maintain an adequate framework, or ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of shadow banking exposure, this may adversely affect the business, results of operations and outlook of NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group may not meet the prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL, or manage its capital effectively, which could trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options.\n\nNatWest Group is required by regulators in the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which it undertakes regulated activities to maintain adequate financial resources. Adequate capital also gives NatWest Group financial flexibility in the face of turbulence and uncertainty in the global economy and specifically in its core UK and European operations, as well as permitting NatWest Group plc to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio was 18.5% and NatWest Group plc currently maintains a CET1 ratio target. NatWest Group plc's target capital ratio is based on a combination of its expected regulatory requirements and internal modelling, including stress scenarios and management's and/or the PRA's views on appropriate buffers above minimum operating levels.\n\nNatWest Group plc's current capital strategy is based on the expected accumulation of additional capital through the accrual of profits over time, planned capital actions (including issuances, redemptions, and discretionary capital distributions), RWA growth in the form of regulatory uplifts and lending growth and other capital management initiatives which focus on improving capital efficiency.\n\nA number of factors may impact NatWest Group plc's ability to maintain its current CET1 ratio target and achieve its capital strategy. These include, amongst other things:\n\n- \u00b7 a depletion of its capital resources through increased costs or liabilities or reduced profits;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the quantum of RWAs in excess of that expected, including due to regulatory changes;\n- \u00b7 changes in prudential regulatory requirements including NatWest Group plc's Total Capital Requirement set by the PRA, including Pillar 2 requirements and regulatory buffers as well as any applicable scalars;\n- \u00b7 reduced dividends from NatWest Group's subsidiaries because of changes in their financial performance and/or the extent to which local capital requirements exceed NatWest Group plc's target ratio; and\n- \u00b7 limitations on the use of double leverage, i.e. NatWest Group plc's use of debt to invest in the equity of its subsidiaries, as a result of the Bank of England's and/or NatWest Group's evolving views on distribution of capital within groups.\n\nA shortage of capital could in turn affect NatWest Group plc's capital ratio, and/or ability to make capital distributions.\n\nA minimum level of capital adequacy is required to be met by NatWest Group plc for it to be entitled to make certain discretionary payments, and institutions which fail to meet the combined buffer requirement are subject to restricted discretionary payments. The resulting restrictions are scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or discretionary payment which gives rise to a maximum distributable amount (MDA) (if any) that the financial institution can distribute through discretionary payments. In the event of a breach of the combined buffer requirement, it may be necessary for NatWest Group plc to reduce or cease discretionary payments (including payments of dividends to shareholders) to the extent of the breach.\n\nNatWest Group is required to maintain a set quantum of MREL set as the higher of its RWAs or leverage requirement. The Bank of England has identified single point-of-entry as the preferred resolution strategy for NatWest Group. As a result, NatWest Group plc is the only entity that can externally issue securities that count towards its MREL requirements, the proceeds of which can then be downstreamed to meet the internal MREL issuance requirements of its operating entities and intermediate holding companies.\n\nIf NatWest Group plc is unable to raise the requisite amount of regulatory capital or MREL, downstream the proceeds of MREL to subsidiaries as required, or to otherwise meet its regulatory capital, MREL and leverage requirements, it may be exposed to increased regulatory supervision or sanctions, loss of investor confidence, constrained or more expensive funding and be unable to make dividend payments on its ordinary shares or maintain discretionary payments on capital instruments.\n\nIf, under a stress scenario, the level of capital or MREL falls outside of risk appetite, there are a range of recovery management actions\n\n(focused on risk reduction and mitigation) that NatWest Group could take to manage its capital levels, but any such actions may not be sufficient to restore adequate capital levels. Under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directives I and II ('BRRD'), as implemented in the UK, NatWest Group must maintain a recovery plan acceptable to its regulator, such that a breach of NatWest Group's applicable capital or leverage requirements may trigger the application of NatWest Group's recovery plan to remediate a deficient capital position. NatWest Group's regulator may request that NatWest Group carry out certain capital management actions or, if NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio falls below 7%, certain regulatory capital instruments issued by NatWest Group will be written-down or converted into equity and there may be an issue of additional equity by NatWest Group plc, which could result in the dilution of NatWest Group plc's existing shareholders. The success of such issuances will also be dependent on favourable market conditions and NatWest Group may not be able to raise the amount of capital required on acceptable terms or at all. Separately, NatWest Group may address a shortage of capital by taking action to reduce leverage exposure and/or RWAs via asset or business disposals. These actions may, in turn, affect, among other things, NatWest Group's product offering, credit ratings, ability to operate its businesses, pursue its current strategies and pursue strategic opportunities, any of which may affect the underlying profitability of NatWest Group and future growth potential. See also, 'NatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, among other actions, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities'.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to Bank of England oversight in respect of resolution, and NatWest Group could be adversely affected should the Bank of England deem NatWest Group's preparations to be inadequate.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to regulatory oversight by the Bank of England, and is required (under the PRA rulebook) to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA, and disclose a summary of this report. The initial report is due to be submitted to the PRA on 1 October 2021 and the Bank of England's assessment of NatWest Group's preparations is scheduled to be released on 10 June 2022. The form and substance of the June publication is yet to be established.\n\nNatWest Group has dedicated significant resources towards the preparation of NatWest Group for a potential resolution scenario. However, if the assessment reveals that NatWest Group is not adequately prepared to be resolved, or does not have adequate plans in place to meet resolvability requirements by 1 January 2022, NatWest Group may be required to take action to enhance its preparations to be resolvable, resulting in\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

Such a scenario may result in restrictions on NatWest Group's maximum individual and aggregate exposures, a requirement to dispose of specified assets, a requirement to cease carrying out certain activities and/or maintaining a specified amount of MREL, consequently having an adverse effect on the financial position and/or reputation of NatWest Group or a loss of investor confidence.\n\n## NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding.\n\nNatWest Group is required to access sources of liquidity and funding through retail and wholesale deposits, as well as through the debt capital markets. As at 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc held \u00a3452.3 billion in deposits. The level of deposits may fluctuate due to factors outside NatWest Group's control, such as a loss of investor confidence (including in individual NatWest Group entities), sustained low or negative interest rates, increasing competitive pressures for retail and corporate customer deposits or the reduction or cessation of deposits by wholesale depositors, which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time. An inability to grow or any material decrease in NatWest Group's deposits could, particularly if accompanied by one of the other factors described above, materially affect NatWest Group's ability to satisfy its liquidity or funding needs. In turn, this could require NatWest Group to adapt its funding plans.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, NatWest Group plc's liquidity coverage ratio was 165%. If its liquidity position were to come under stress, and if NatWest Group plc were unable to raise funds through deposits or in the debt capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, its liquidity position could be adversely affected and it might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to meet its obligations under committed financing facilities, to comply with regulatory funding requirements, to undertake certain capital and/or debt management activities, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. NatWest Group may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet its liabilities, including disposals of assets not previously identified for disposal to reduce its funding commitments or trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options. In a time of reduced liquidity, NatWest Group may be unable to sell some of its assets, or may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case could negatively affect NatWest Group's results.\n\nAny reduction in the credit rating and/or outlooks assigned to NatWest Group plc, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective debt securities could adversely affect the availability of funding for NatWest Group, reduce NatWest Group's liquidity position and increase the cost of funding.\n\nRating agencies regularly review NatWest Group plc and other NatWest Group entity credit ratings and outlooks, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors that can change over time, including: the credit rating agency's assessment of NatWest Group's strategy and management's capability; its financial condition including in respect of profitability, asset quality, capital, funding and liquidity; the level of political support for the industries in which NatWest Group operates; the implementation of structural reform; the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to NatWest Group's legal structure; business activities and the rights of its creditors; changes in rating methodologies; changes in the relative size of the loss-absorbing buffers protecting bondholders and depositors; the competitive environment, political and economic conditions in NatWest Group's key markets (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit and any further Scottish independence referendum); any reduction of the UK's sovereign credit rating and market uncertainty.\n\nIn addition, credit ratings agencies are increasingly taking into account sustainabilityrelated factors, including climate, environmental, social and governance related risk, as part of the credit ratings analysis, as are investors in their investment decisions.\n\nAny reductions in the credit ratings of NatWest Group plc or of certain other NatWest Group entities, including, in particular, downgrades below investment grade, or a deterioration in the capital markets' perception of NatWest Group's financial resilience could significantly affect NatWest Group's access to money markets, reduce the size of its deposit base and trigger additional collateral or other requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements or the need to amend such arrangements, which could adversely affect NatWest Group's (and, in particular, NatWest Group plc's) cost of funding and its access to capital markets and could limit the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with NatWest Group (and, in particular, with NatWest Group plc). This could in turn adversely impact NatWest Group's competitive position and threaten its prospects in the short to medium-term.\n\n## NatWest Group may be adversely affected if it fails to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to annual stress tests by its regulator in the UK and is also subject to stress tests by European regulators with respect to NatWest Group plc, NWM N.V. and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC. Stress tests are designed to assess the resilience of banks to potential adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. If the stress tests reveal that a bank's existing regulatory capital buffers are not sufficient to absorb the impact of the stress, then it is\n\npossible that the bank will need to take action to strengthen its capital position.\n\nFailure by NatWest Group to meet the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the stress tests as set forth by its UK regulator or those elsewhere may result in: NatWest Group's regulators requiring NatWest Group to generate additional capital, reputational damage, increased supervision and/or regulatory sanctions, restrictions on capital distributions and loss of investor confidence.\n\n## NatWest Group could incur losses or be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of limitations or failure of various models.\n\nGiven the complexity of NatWest Group's business, strategy and capital requirements, NatWest Group relies on analytical models for a wide range of purposes, including to manage its business, assess the value of its assets and its risk exposure, as well as to anticipate capital and funding requirements (including to facilitate NatWest Group's mandated stress testing). In addition, NatWest Group utilises models for valuations, credit approvals, calculation of loan impairment charges on an IFRS 9 basis, financial reporting and for financial crime and fraud risk management. NatWest Group's models, and the parameters and assumptions on which they are based, are periodically reviewed and updated to maximise their accuracy.\n\nAs models analyse scenarios based on assumed inputs and a conceptual approach, model outputs therefore remain uncertain and should not be relied on. Failure of models (including due to errors in model design) or new data inputs, including to accurately reflect changes in the micro and macroeconomic environment in which NatWest Group operates (for example to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), to capture risks and exposures at the subsidiary level and to update for changes to NatWest Group's current business model or operations, or for findings of deficiencies by NatWest Group's regulators (including as part of NatWest Group's mandated stress testing), may result in increased capital requirements or require management action. NatWest Group may also face adverse consequences as a result of actions based on models that are poorly developed, implemented or used, models that are based on inaccurate or compromised data or as a result of the modelled outcome being misunderstood, or by such information being used for purposes for which it was not designed.\n\n## NatWest Group's financial statements are sensitive to the underlying accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, exposures and RWAs. While estimates, judgments and assumptions take into account historical experience and other factors, (including market practice and expectations of future events that are believed",

See also, 'NatWest Group's results could be adversely affected if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other events trigger the recognition of a goodwill impairment'.\n\nThe accounting policies deemed critical to NatWest Group's results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, which include loan impairment provisions, are set out in ' Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty' on page 269. New accounting standards and interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but which have not yet been adopted by NatWest Group are discussed in 'Accounting developments' on page 269.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards may materially impact NatWest Group's financial results.\n\nChanges in accounting standards or guidance by accounting bodies or in the timing of their implementation, whether immediate or foreseeable, could result in NatWest Group having to recognise additional liabilities on its balance sheet, or in further write-downs or impairments to its assets and could also significantly impact the financial results, condition and prospects of NatWest Group.\n\nThe valuation of financial instruments, including derivatives, measured at fair value can be subjective, in particular where models are used which include unobservable inputs. Generally, to establish the fair value of these instruments, NatWest Group relies on quoted market prices or, where the market for a financial instrument is not sufficiently credible, internal valuation models that utilise observable market data. In certain circumstances, the data for individual financial instruments or classes of financial instruments utilised by such valuation models may not be available or may become unavailable due to prevailing market conditions. In these circumstances, NatWest Group's internal valuation models require NatWest Group to make assumptions, judgments and estimates to establish fair value, which are complex and often relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\nThe value or effectiveness of any credit protection that NatWest Group has purchased depends on the value of the underlying assets and the financial condition of the insurers and counterparties.\n\nNatWest Group has some remaining credit exposure arising from over-the-counter derivative contracts, mainly credit default swaps (CDSs), and other credit derivatives, each of which are carried at fair value. The fair value of these CDSs, as well as NatWest Group's exposure to the risk of default by the underlying counterparties, depends on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the\n\ninstrument against which protection has been bought. Many market counterparties have been adversely affected by their exposure to residential mortgage-linked and corporate credit products, whether synthetic or otherwise, and their actual and perceived creditworthiness may deteriorate rapidly. If the financial condition of these counterparties or their actual or perceived creditworthiness deteriorates, NatWest Group may record further credit valuation adjustments on the credit protection bought from these counterparties under the CDSs. NatWest Group also recognises any fluctuations in the fair value of other credit derivatives. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a negative impact on NatWest Group's results.\n\nNatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, among other actions, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities. HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the PRA and FCA (together, the 'Authorities') are granted substantial powers to resolve and stabilise UK-incorporated financial institutions. Five stabilisation options exist: (i) transfer of all of the business of a relevant entity or the shares of the relevant entity to a private sector purchaser; (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' wholly-owned by the Bank of England; (iii) transfer of part of the assets, rights or liabilities of the relevant entity to one or more asset management vehicles for management of the transferor's assets, rights or liabilities; (iv) the write-down, conversion, transfer, modification, or suspension of the relevant entity's equity, capital instruments and liabilities; and (v) temporary public ownership of the relevant entity. These tools may be applied to NatWest Group plc as the parent company or an affiliate where certain conditions are met (such as, whether the firm is failing or likely to fail, or whether it is reasonably likely that action will be taken (outside of resolution) that will result in the firm no longer failing or being likely to fail). Moreover, there are modified insolvency and administration procedures for relevant entities, and the Authorities have the power to modify or override certain contractual arrangements in certain circumstances and amend the law for the purpose of enabling their powers to be used effectively and may promulgate provisions with retrospective applicability.\n\nUnder the UK Banking Act, the Authorities are generally required to have regard to specified objectives in exercising the powers provided for by the Banking Act. One of the objectives (which is required to be balanced as appropriate with the other specified objectives) refers to the protection and enhancement of the stability of the financial system of the UK. Moreover, the 'no creditor worse off' safeguard contained in the Banking Act may not apply in relation to an application of the separate write-down and conversion power relating to capital instruments under the Banking Act, in circumstances where a\n\nstabilisation power is not also used. Holders of debt instruments which are subject to the power may, however, have ordinary shares transferred to or issued to them by way of compensation.\n\nUncertainty exists as to how the Authorities may exercise their powers including the determination of actions undertaken in relation to the ordinary shares and other securities of NatWest Group, which may depend on factors outside of NatWest Group's control. Moreover, the Banking Act provisions remain untested in practice.\n\nIf NatWest Group is at or is approaching the point of non-viability such that regulatory intervention is required, any exercise of the resolution regime powers by the Authorities may adversely affect holders of NatWest Group plc's ordinary shares or other NatWest Group securities. This may result in various actions being undertaken in relation to NatWest Group and any securities of NatWest Group, including cancellation, transfer, dilution, write-down or conversion (as applicable). There may also be a corresponding adverse effect on the market price of such securities.\n\nClimate and sustainability-related risks NatWest Group and its customers may face significant climate-related risks, including in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, which may adversely impact NatWest Group.\n\nClimate-related risks and uncertainties are receiving increasing prudential and regulatory, political and societal scrutiny, both in the UK and internationally.\n\nFinancial risks from climate change arise through two primary channels, or 'risk factors': physical and transition.\n\nThere are significant uncertainties as to the extent and timing of the manifestation of the physical risks of climate change, such as more extreme and frequent weather events, rising sea levels, flooding, and subsidence, heat waves and long-lasting wildfires, reductions in biodiversity and resource scarcity. Damage to the properties and operations of borrowers could impair asset values, business activities and the creditworthiness of customers leading to increased default rates, delinquencies, writeoffs and impairment charges in NatWest Group's portfolios. In addition, NatWest Group's premises and resilience may also suffer physical damage due to weather events leading to increased costs and disruption of activity and business continuity for NatWest Group.\n\nThere are also significant uncertainties regarding the timing and speed of the transition to a low-carbon economy occurs and whether it occurs in an earlier, gradual, orderly manner or a delayed, rapid, disorderly manner. Widespread levels of adjustment to a low-carbon economy across all sectors of the economy and markets in which NatWest Group operates will be required by several multilateral agreements, in particular the 2015\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

Some sectors such as property, energy (including oil and gas), mining, infrastructure, transport (including automotive and aviation) and agriculture are expected to be particularly impacted. The nature and timing of the farreaching commercial, technological, policy and regulatory changes that this transition will entail remain uncertain but their impact is expected to be highly significant and may be disruptive, especially if these changes do not occur in an orderly or timely manner or are not effective in reducing emissions sufficiently.\n\nFurthermore, public and private sector institutions may also face a variety of climaterelated legal risks, both physical and transition, from potential litigation and contract liability. See also, 'NatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk'.\n\nIf NatWest Group fails, either to take the extent of action required or in the timeliness of the action taken, to adapt its business and operating model to the climate-related risks and opportunities and changing market expectations, or to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate climate change related physical and transition risks and opportunities that NatWest Group and its customers face, NatWest Group's reputation, business, results of operations and outlook may be impacted adversely.\n\nNatWest Group's Purpose-led Strategy includes one area of focus on climate change that is likely to require material changes to the business of NatWest Group which entails significant execution risk. In February 2020, NatWest Group announced climate in the UK and ROI, helping to address\n\nits ambition to become the leading bank on the climate challenge by setting itself the challenge to at least halve the climate impact of its financing activity by 2030 and by intending to do what is necessary to achieve alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nNatWest Group's commitment to reduce the climate impact of its financing activities  may materially affect NatWest Group's business and operations and will require significant reductions to its financed emissions and to its exposure to customers that do not align with a transition to a low-carbon economy or do not have a credible transition plan. It is anticipated that, these reductions, together with the active management of climate-related risks and other regulatory, policy and market changes, are likely to necessitate material and accelerated changes to NatWest Group's business and existing exposures (potentially on timescales outside of risk appetite) which may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to achieve its associated financial targets and generate sustainable returns.\n\nincreasingly requiring significant resource and capacity to collect third party, customer and other data and to develop and apply methodologies to understand and measure the climate impact of the emissions related to its financing activities. There is currently no single standard approach or methodology to measure such emissions and to provide a scenario-based model for alignment with the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the data, methodologies and assumptions on which emissions estimates and targets are based are also subject to change. Accordingly, NatWest Group must continue to identify, define and develop its approach to setting and publishing sector-specific targets and its goal of setting comprehensive climate impact scenario-based reduction targets and plans by 2022. It must also be able to adequately define and benchmark current climate impact from its financing activities to demonstrate its progress against its ambition\n\nto halve this impact by 2030.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its climaterelated targets and commitments - including to at least halve the climate impact of its financing activity - will depend greatly on many factors beyond NatWest Group's control.  These include the macroeconomic environment, the extent and pace of climate change, including the timing and manifestation of physical and transition risks and the effectiveness of actions of governments, legislators, regulators, businesses, investors, customers and other stakeholders to adapt and/or mitigate the impact of climate-related risks. See also, 'NatWest Group is currently implementing its Purpose-led Strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes'.\n\nAny delay or failure in setting, making progress against or meeting NatWest Group's climate-related targets and commitments may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group, its reputation, business, results of operations, outlook, market and competition position and may increase the climate-related risks NatWest Group faces.\n\nAny failure by NatWest Group to implement effective and compliant climate change resilient systems, controls and procedures could adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to manage climate-related risks.\n\nThe prudential regulation of climate-related risks is an important driver in how NatWest Group develops its risk appetite for financing activities or engaging with counterparties that do not align with a transition to a low-carbon economy or do not have a credible transition plan.\n\nLegislative and regulatory authorities in the UK and in the European Union are publishing expectations as to how banks should prudently manage and transparently disclose climate-related and environmental risks under prudential rules. In November 2020, the European Central Bank published its 'Guide\n\non climate-related and environmental risks' and in April 2019, the PRA published a supervisory statement 'Enhancing banks' and insurers' approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change' (the 'SS 3/19').\n\nIn the SS 3/19 the PRA states that regulated entities must:\n\n- \u00b7 fully embed the consideration of the financial risks from climate change in their governance arrangements;\n- \u00b7 incorporate the financial risks from climate change into existing financial risk management practice;\n- \u00b7 use (long term) scenario analysis to inform strategy setting and risk assessment and identification; and\n- \u00b7 develop an approach to disclosure on the financial risks from climate change.\n\nFollowing the submission of initial plans by UK banks, in July 2020 the PRA issued a 'Dear CEO' letter requiring firms to embed fully their approaches to managing climate-related financial risks by the end of 2021. In response, NatWest Group provided the PRA on 8 October 2020 with an update to its original plan submitted in October 2019. The updated plan stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted some elements of NatWest Group's original plan and, as a result, some near term activities have been delayed to 2021; this delay could potentially result in increased execution risk. Further, the updated plan advised that it will require additional operating cycles reaching into 2022 and beyond to prove embedding.\n\nIn December 2019 the Bank of England announced that it will use the 2021 biennial exploratory scenario to stress test the resilience of the current business models of the largest banks, insurers and the financial system to the physical and transition risks from climate change under a number of climate scenarios (the 'Climate Biennial Explanatory Scenario' or 'CBES'). Further, in December 2020 the Bank of England published an update on its approach to the CBES in selected areas and confirmed that the CBES, which will be exploratory in nature (i.e. not intended to be used to set capital requirements), will be launched in early June 2021. There is a risk, however, that in the future years once the climate analytics have been embedded via the CBES, it may be concluded by the regulator that financial institutions, including NatWest Group, may be required to hold additional capital to enhance their resilience against systemic and/or institution specific vulnerabilities to climaterelated risks,  including potential asset devaluation shocks.\n\nAny failure of NatWest Group to fully and timely embed climate-related risks into its risk management practices and framework to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate the various climate-related physical and transition risks in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and expectations, may have a material and",

These include data quality gaps and limitations, the pace at which climate science, greenhouse gas accounting standards and carbon capture and other emissions reduction solutions develop. In addition, multiple climate change scenarios dependent on a range of variable factors could unfold over the coming two or three decades, which timeframes are considerably longer than NatWest Group's historical strategic, financial, resilience and investment planning horizons and which will affect how and when climate-related risks manifest.\n\nAs a result, it is very difficult to predict and model the impact of climate-related risks into precise financial and economic outcomes and impacts. Climate-related risks present significant methodological challenges due to their forward-looking nature, the lack of historical testing capabilities, the quality, lack of standardisation and incompleteness of emissions and other climate and sub-sector related data and the immature nature of risk measurement and modelling methodologies. The evaluation of climate-related risk exposure and the development of associated potential risk mitigation techniques largely depend on the choice of climate scenario modelling methodology and the assumptions made.\n\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties involved in climate scenario modelling, including that:\n\n- \u00b7 it requires a special skill set that banks traditionally do not have and therefore NatWest Group needs to rely on third party advice, modelling, and data which is also subject to many limitations and uncertainties;\n- \u00b7 modelling of and data on climaterelated risks on financial assets is immature in nature and it is expected that techniques and understanding will evolve rapidly in the coming years;\n- \u00b7 it is challenging to benchmark or back test the climate scenarios given their forward-looking nature and the multiple possible outcomes;\n- \u00b7 there is significant uncertainty as to how the climate will evolve over the coming decades, how and when governments, regulators, businesses, investors and customers respond and how those responses impact the economy, asset valuations, land systems, energy systems, technology, policy and wider society.\n\nAccordingly, these risks and uncertainties coupled with significantly longer timeframes\n\nmake the outputs of climate-related risk modelling, including emissions reductions targets and pathways, inherently more unreliable than outputs modelled for traditional financial planning cycles based on historical financial information.\n\nCapabilities within NatWest Group to assess the suitability of the assumptions required to model and manage climate-related risks appropriately are developing. Even when those capabilities are developed, the high level of uncertainty regarding any assumptions modelled, the highly subjective nature of risk measurement and mitigation techniques, incorrect or inadequate assumptions and judgments and data quality gaps and limitations may lead to inadequate risk management information and frameworks, or ineffective business adaptation or mitigation strategies, which may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nA failure to adapt NatWest Group's business strategy, governance, procedures, systems and controls to manage emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nInvestors, customers, international organisations, regulators and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on and encouraging businesses to (i) identify, measure, manage and mitigate environmental (biodiversity and loss of natural capital); social (such as tackling inequality, inclusion, human rights and working conditions); and governance (such as board diversity, ethics, executive compensation and management structure) related risks and opportunities which together are commonly referred to as 'sustainability-related' related risks and opportunities; and (ii) focus on long term sustainable value creation rather than shortterm financial value.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, sustainability-related risks such as environmental degradation may also adversely affect economic activity, asset pricing and valuations of issuers' securities and, in turn, the wider financial system. There is also evidence of an interconnection between climate-related and sustainabilityrelated risks resulting in combined effects capable of potentially generating even greater adverse effects.  Sustainability-related risks may impact economic activities directly (for example through lower corporate profitability or the devaluation of assets) or indirectly (for example through macro-financial changes). They may also affect the viability or resilience of business models over the medium to longer term, particularly those business models most vulnerable to sustainability-related risks. In addition, sustainability-related risks can trigger further losses stemming directly or indirectly from legal claims (liability risks) and reputational damage as a result of the public, customers, counterparties and/or investors\n\nassociating NatWest Group or its customers with adverse sustainability-related issues.\n\nFurthermore, sustainability-related risks may be drivers of several different risk categories simultaneously and may exacerbate existing risks, including credit risk, operational risk (business continuity), market risk (both current market risk positions and future investments) and liquidity risk (for example, net cash outflows or depletion of liquidity buffers), as well as migration risk, credit spread risk in the banking book, real estate risks and strategic risk.\n\nAccordingly, any failure to adapt NatWest Group's business strategy and to establish and maintain effective governance, procedures, systems and controls to manage emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, liquidity position, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## Any reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and on investors' risk appetite.\n\nRatings from ESG rating agencies and data providers that rate on an unsolicited basis as to how NatWest Group manages environmental, social and governance risks are increasingly influencing investment decisions. Any change in such ESG ratings depends on many factors some of which are beyond NatWest Group's control (e.g. any change in rating methodology). Any reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and could influence investors' risk appetite for NatWest Group's and/or its subsidiaries' securities, particularly ESG securities.\n\nIncreasing levels of climate, environmental and sustainability-related laws, regulation and oversight may adversely affect NatWest Group's business and expose NatWest Group to increased costs of compliance, regulatory sanction and reputational damage.\n\nGovernments, legislative and regulatory authorities in the UK, EU and elsewhere are increasingly prioritising a wide range of new climate, environmental and sustainabilityrelated laws and regulations to address the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and sustainability and to promote the transition to a more sustainable low-carbon economy. As a result, an increasing number of laws, regulations, legislative actions are likely to affect the financial sector and the real economy, including proposals, guidance, policy and regulatory initiatives many of which have been introduced or amended recently and are subject to further changes.\n\nMany of these initiatives are focused on disclosure, developing standardised definitions for green and sustainable criteria of assets and liabilities, integrating climate change and sustainability into decisionmaking and customers access to green and\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

They could also impact NatWest Group's recognition of its climate financing activity and may adversely affect NatWest Group's achieving its climate strategy and sustainable financing ambitions.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group's EU subsidiaries will continue to be subject to an increasing array of the EU/EEA climate and sustainability-related legal and regulatory requirements, such as the EU Taxonomy and EU Green Bond Standards. These requirements may be used as the basis for UK laws and regulations (such as the recently announced UK Green Taxonomy) or regarded by investors and regulators as best practice standards whether or not they apply to UK businesses. Any divergence between EU/EEA and UK requirements may result in NatWest Group not meeting investors' expectations, may increase the cost of doing business and may restrict access of NatWest Group's UK business to the EU/EEA market.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group and its subsidiaries will be subject to increasing entity wide climate and other non-financial disclosures requirements. From February 2022, NatWest Group will be required to provide enhanced climate-related disclosures consistent with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure ('TCFD') recommendations to comply with the FCA's proposed new stock exchange listing rules for premium listed companies. The FCA will consult on expanding this requirement to a wider scope of listed issuers in NatWest Group as it moves towards mandatory TCFD reporting across the UK economy by 2025. NatWest Group is also participating in various voluntary carbon reporting and other standard setting initiatives for disclosing climate and sustainability-related information, many of which have differing objectives and methodologies and are at different stages of development in terms of how they apply to financial institutions.\n\nThese developing and evolving climate and sustainability-related requirements are likely to require NatWest Group to implement significant changes to its business models, product and other governance, internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, modelling capability and risk management systems, which may increase the cost of doing business, entail additional change risk and compliance costs.\n\nFailure to implement and comply with these requirements or adopt regulatory or other best practice expectations may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance and may result in regulatory sanction and investor disapproval.\n\n## NatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk.\n\nDue the increasing number of new climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations, growing demand from investors and customers for environmentally sustainable products and services, and regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions, including NatWest Group, may through their business activities face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation and other social, governance and sustainability-related issues.\n\nFurthermore, there is a risk that shareholders, campaign groups, customers and special interest groups could seek to take legal action against NatWest Group for financing or contributing to climate change and environmental degradation.\n\nThese potential litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to achieve its strategy, including its climate ambition, as well as its reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## Operational and IT resilience risk Operational risks (including reliance on third party suppliers and outsourcing of certain activities) are inherent in NatWest Group's businesses.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, procedures, people or systems, or from external events, including legal risks. It has come under increasing regulatory focus in recent years. NatWest Group operates in many countries, offering a diverse range of products and services supported by 59,900 employees as at 31 December 2020; it therefore has complex and diverse operations. As a result, operational risks or losses can arise from a number of internal or external factors (including financial crime). These risks are also present when NatWest Group relies on third-party suppliers or vendors to provide services to it or its customers, as is increasingly the case as NatWest Group outsources certain activities, including with respect to the implementation of new technologies, innovation and responding to regulatory and market changes.\n\nOperational risks continue to be heightened as a result of the implementation of NatWest Group's Purpose-led Strategy, including the refocusing of its NWM franchise, NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI, NatWest Group's current cost-reduction measures and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally (including the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit and other geo-political developments) as well as the legal and regulatory uncertainty resulting therefrom. It is unclear as to how the future ways of working may evolve, including in respect of how working practices may develop, or how NatWest Group will evolve to\n\nbest serve its customers. Any of the above may place significant pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks.\n\nThe effective management of operational risks is critical to meeting customer service expectations and retaining and attracting customer business. Although NatWest Group has implemented risk controls and mitigation actions, with resources and planning having been devoted to mitigate operational risk, such measures may not be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by NatWest Group. Ineffective management of such risks could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\n## NatWest Group is subject to increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyberattacks.\n\nNatWest Group experiences a constant threat from cyberattacks across the entire NatWest Group and against NatWest Group's supply chain, re-enforcing the importance of due diligence of and close working relationship with the third parties on which NatWest Group relies. NatWest Group is reliant on technology, against which there is a constantly evolving series of attacks that are increasing in terms of frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. As cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group is required to continue to invest in additional capability designed to defend against the emerging threats. In 2020, NatWest Group was subjected to a small number of Distributed Denial of Service ('DDOS') attacks, which are a pervasive and significant threat to the global financial services industry. The focus is to manage the impact of the attacks and sustain availability of services for NatWest Group's customers. NatWest Group continues to invest significant resources in the development and evolution of cyber security controls that are designed to minimise the potential effect of such attacks.\n\nHostile attempts are made by third parties to gain access to, introduce malware (including ransomware) into and exploit vulnerabilities of, NatWest Group's IT systems. NatWest Group has information and cyber security controls in place to minimise the impact of any attack, which are subject to review on a continuing basis but given the nature of the threat, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent all attacks in the future. See also, 'NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working) and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group'.\n\nAny failure in NatWest Group's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, may result in significant financial losses, major business disruption, inability to deliver customer services, or loss of data or other sensitive information (including as a result of an outage) and may cause associated reputational damage.

Regulators in the UK, US, Europe and Asia continue to recognise cybersecurity as an increasing systemic risk to the financial sector and have highlighted the need for financial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience (particularly of critical services) to cyberattacks, and to provide timely notification of them, as appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, third parties may also fraudulently attempt to induce employees, customers, third party providers or other users who have access to NatWest Group's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to NatWest Group's data or that of NatWest Group's customers or employees. Cyber security and information security events can derive from groups or factors such as: internal or external threat actors, human error, fraud or malice on the part of NatWest Group's employees or third parties, including third party providers, or may result from accidental technological failure.\n\nNatWest Group expects greater regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement to continue at a high level in relation to its overall resilience to withstand IT and related disruption, either through a cyberattack or some other disruptive event. Such increased regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement is uncertain in relation to scope, consequence and pace of change, which could negatively impact NatWest Group. Due to NatWest Group's reliance on technology and the increasing sophistication, frequency and impact of cyberattacks, it is likely that such attacks could have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group.\n\nIn accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and European Banking Authority ('EBA') Guidelines on ICT and Security Risk Management, NatWest Group is required to ensure it implements timely, appropriate and effective organisational and technological safeguards against unauthorised or unlawful access to the data of NatWest Group, its customers and its employees. In order to meet this requirement, NatWest Group relies on the effectiveness of its internal policies, controls and procedures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information held on its IT systems, networks and devices as well as with third parties with whom NatWest Group interacts. A failure to monitor and manage data in accordance with the GDPR and EBA requirements of the applicable legislation may result in financial losses, regulatory fines and investigations and associated reputational damage.\n\n## NatWest Group operations and strategy are highly dependent on the accuracy and effective use of data.\n\nNatWest Group relies on the effective use of accurate data to support, monitor, evaluate, manage and enhance its operations and deliver its strategy. The availability of current,\n\ndetailed, accurate and, wherever possible, machine-readable customer segment and sub-sector data is fast becoming a critical strategic asset.  Failure to have current, highquality data and/or the ineffective use of such data could result in a failure to manage and report important risks and opportunities or satisfy customers' expectations including the inability to deliver innovative products and services. This could also result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy and could place the NatWest Group at a competitive disadvantage by increasing its costs, inhibiting its efforts to reduce costs or its ability to improve its systems, controls and processes, which could result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy.  These data limitations or the unethical or inappropriate use of data and/or non-compliance with customer data and privacy protection laws could give rise to conduct and litigation risks and may increase the risk of operational events, losses or other adverse consequences due to inappropriate models, systems, processes, decisions or other actions.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working) and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on the ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations. The proper functioning of NatWest Group's payment systems, financial crime and sanctions controls, risk management, credit analysis and reporting, accounting, customer service and other IT systems, as well as the communication networks between its branches and main data processing centres, is critical to NatWest Group's operations.\n\nIndividually or collectively, any critical system failure, material loss of service availability or material breach of data security could cause serious damage to NatWest Group's ability to provide services to its customers, which could result in reputational damage, significant compensation costs or regulatory sanctions (including fines resulting from regulatory investigations) or a breach of applicable regulations. In particular, such issues could cause long-term damage to NatWest Group's reputation and could affect its regulatory approvals, competitive position, business and brands, which could undermine its ability to attract and retain customers. This risk is heightened as most of NatWest Group's employees are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it outsources certain functions and as it continues to innovate and offer new digital solutions to its customers as a result of the trend towards online and mobile banking.\n\nIn 2020, NatWest Group continued to make considerable investments to further simplify, upgrade and improve its IT and technology capabilities (including migration of certain services to cloud platforms). NatWest Group also continues to develop and enhance digital\n\nservices for its customers and seeks to improve its competitive position through enhancing controls and procedures and strengthening the resilience of services including cyber security. Any failure of these investment and rationalisation initiatives to achieve the expected results, due to costchallenges or otherwise, could negatively affect NatWest Group's operations, its reputation and ability to retain or grow its customer business or adversely impact its competitive position, thereby negatively impacting NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## NatWest Group relies on attracting, retaining and developing senior management and skilled personnel, and is required to maintain good employee relations.\n\nNatWest Group's success depends on its ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled and qualified personnel, including senior management, directors and key employees especially for technology-focused roles, in a highly competitive market and under internal cost reduction pressures. NatWest Group's ability to do this may be more difficult due to the cost reduction pressures, including the refocusing of its NWM franchise and the phased withdrawal from ROI, heightened regulatory oversight of banks and the increasing scrutiny of, and (in some cases) restrictions placed upon, employee compensation arrangements, in particular those of banks in receipt of government support such as NatWest Group. This increases the cost of hiring, training and retaining skilled personnel. In addition, certain economic, market and regulatory conditions and political developments (including Brexit) may reduce the pool of candidates for key management and non-executive roles, including non-executive directors with the right skills, knowledge and experience, or increase the number of departures of existing employees.\n\nAny reduction of compensation, as a result of the PRA's request that bank boards consider taking further appropriate action regarding variable compensation, or negative economic developments, could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to hire, retain and engage well qualified employees, especially at a senior level, which may have a material adverse impact on the financial position and prospects of NatWest Group.\n\nMany of NatWest Group's employees in the UK, the ROI and continental Europe are represented by employee representative bodies, including trade unions. Engagement with its employees and such bodies is important to NatWest Group in maintaining good employee relations. Any failure to do so could impact NatWest Group's ability to operate its business effectively.\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\n## A failure in NatWest Group's risk management framework could adversely affect NatWest Group, including its ability to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all of NatWest Group's activities and includes the definition and monitoring of NatWest Group's risk appetite and reporting on NatWest Group's risk exposure and the potential impact thereof on NatWest Group's financial condition. Financial risk management is highly dependent on the use and effectiveness of internal stress tests and models and ineffective risk management may arise from a wide variety of factors, including lack of transparency or incomplete risk reporting, unidentified conflicts or misaligned incentives, lack of accountability control and governance, lack of consistency in risk monitoring and management or insufficient challenges or assurance processes. Failure to manage risks effectively could adversely impact NatWest Group's reputation or its relationship with its regulators, customers, shareholders or other stakeholders.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are inherently exposed to conduct risks, which include business decisions, actions or reward mechanisms that are not responsive to or aligned with NatWest Group's regulatory obligations, customers' needs or do not reflect NatWest Group's customer-focused strategy, ineffective product management, unethical or inappropriate use of data, information asymmetry, implementation and utilisation of new technologies, outsourcing of customer service and product delivery, the possibility of mis-selling of financial products and mishandling of customer complaints. Some of these risks have materialised in the past and ineffective management and oversight of conduct risks may lead to further remediation and regulatory intervention or enforcement. NatWest Group's businesses are also exposed to risks from employee misconduct including non-compliance with policies and regulations, negligence or fraud (including financial crimes), any of which could result in regulatory fines or sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm to NatWest Group. These risks may be exacerbated when most of NatWest Group ' s employees work remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which places additional pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks.\n\nNatWest Group has been seeking to embed a strong risk culture across the organisation and has implemented policies and allocated new resources across all levels of the organisation to manage and mitigate conduct risk and expects to continue to invest in its risk management framework. However, such efforts may not insulate NatWest Group from future instances of misconduct and no assurance can be given that NatWest Group's strategy and control framework will be effective. Any failure in NatWest Group's risk management framework could negatively affect NatWest Group and its financial condition through reputational and financial\n\nharm and may result in the inability to achieve its strategic objectives for its customers, employees and wider stakeholders.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are subject to inherent reputational risk.\n\nReputational risk relates to stakeholder and public perceptions of NatWest Group arising from an actual or perceived failure to meet stakeholder expectations, including with respect to NatWest Group's Purpose-led Strategy and related targets, due to any events, behaviour, action or inaction by NatWest Group, its employees or those with whom NatWest Group is associated. This includes brand damage, which may be detrimental to NatWest Group's business, including its ability to build or sustain business relationships with customers, and may cause low employee morale, regulatory censure or reduced access to, or an increase in the cost of, funding. Reputational risk may arise whenever there is a material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer or operating efficiency and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to attract and retain customers. In particular, NatWest Group's ability to attract and retain customers (particularly, corporate and retail depositors) may be adversely affected by, amongst others: negative public opinion resulting from the actual or perceived manner in which NatWest Group conducts or modifies its business activities and operations, media coverage (whether accurate or otherwise), employee misconduct, NatWest Group's financial performance, IT systems failures or cyberattacks, data breaches, financial crime, the level of direct and indirect government support, or the actual or perceived practices in the banking and financial industry in general, or a wide variety of other factors.\n\nModern technologies, in particular online social networks and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short time frames and with minimal costs, may also significantly increase and accelerate the impact of damaging information and allegations.\n\nAlthough NatWest Group has implemented a Reputational Risk Policy to improve the identification, assessment and management of customers, transactions, products and issues, which represent a reputational risk, NatWest Group cannot be certain that it will be successful in avoiding damage to its business from reputational risk.\n\nLegal, regulatory and conduct risk NatWest Group's businesses are subject to substantial regulation and oversight, which are constantly evolving and may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to extensive laws, regulations, corporate governance practice and disclosure requirements, administrative actions and policies in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Many of these have been introduced or amended recently and are subject to further material changes, which may increase compliance and conduct risks, particularly if EU/EEA and UK laws diverge\n\nnow that the Brexit transition period has ended. NatWest Group expects government and regulatory intervention in the financial services industry to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn recent years, regulators and governments have focused on reforming the prudential regulation of the financial services industry and the manner in which the business of financial services is conducted. Amongst others, measures have included: enhanced capital, liquidity and funding requirements, implementation of the UK ring-fencing regime, implementation and strengthening of the recovery and resolution framework applicable to financial institutions in the UK, the EU and the US, financial industry reforms (including in respect of MiFID II), corporate governance requirements, restrictions on the compensation of senior management and other employees, enhanced data privacy and IT resilience requirements, financial market infrastructure reforms (including enhanced data privacy and IT resilience requirements, enhanced regulations in respect of the provision of 'investment services and activities'), and increased regulatory focus in certain areas, including conduct, consumer protection and disputes regimes, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, antitax evasion, payment systems, sanctions and anti-terrorism laws and regulations.\n\nOther areas in which, and examples of where, governmental policies, regulatory and accounting changes, and increased public and regulatory scrutiny could have an adverse impact (some of which could be material) on NatWest Group include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 general changes in government, central bank, regulatory or competition policy, or changes in regulatory regimes that may influence investor decisions in the jurisdictions in which NatWest Group operates;\n- \u00b7 rules relating to foreign ownership, expropriation, nationalisation and confiscation of assets;\n- \u00b7 increased attention to the protection and resilience of, and competition and innovation in, UK payment systems and retail banking developments relating to the UK initiative on Open Banking, Open Finance and the European directive on payment services;\n- \u00b7 new or increased regulations relating to customer data and privacy protection as well as IT controls and resilience, including the GDPR and the impact of the recent Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) decision (known as Schrems II), in which the CJEU ruled that Privacy Shield (an EU/US data transfer mechanism) is now invalid, leading to more onerous due diligence requirements for the Group prior to sending personal data of its EU customers and employees to non-EEA countries, including the UK and the US; and",

Any of these developments (including any failure to comply with new rules and regulations) could also have a significant impact on NatWest Group's authorisations and licences, the products and services that NatWest Group may offer, its reputation and the value of its assets, NatWest Group's operations or legal entity structure, and the manner in which NatWest Group conducts its business, Material consequences could arise should NatWest Group be found to be noncompliant with these regulatory requirements. Regulatory developments may also result in an increased number of regulatory investigations and proceedings and have increased the risks relating to NatWest Group's ability to comply with the applicable body of rules and regulations in the manner and within the time frames required.\n\nIn 2019, the PRA published an industry-wide 'Dear CEO' letter which confirmed the regulator's ongoing focus on the integrity of regulatory reporting and its intention to ask a selection of UK banks to commission reports from Skilled Persons under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to review the governance, controls and processes around the preparation of Common Reporting ('COREP') regulatory returns and to provide reasonable assurance opinions on whether the returns reviewed were properly prepared. NatWest Group was selected to participate in this review. The PRA delayed the start of this review in light of the COVID19 pandemic and the Skilled Persons are now expected to complete their work in H1 2021.\n\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement, or the implementation of new laws, rules or regulations, including contradictory or conflicting laws, rules or regulations by key regulators or policymakers in different jurisdictions, or failure by NatWest Group to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, may adversely affect NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook. In addition, uncertainty and insufficient\n\ninternational regulatory coordination as enhanced supervisory standards are developed and implemented may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to engage in effective business, risk and capital management planning.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to various litigation matters, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations as well as remedial undertakings, including conduct-related reviews, antimoney laundering and redress projects, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, and which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group. NatWest Group's operations are diverse and complex and it operates in legal and regulatory environments that expose it to potentially significant legal proceedings, and civil and criminal regulatory and governmental actions. NatWest Group has settled a number of legal and regulatory actions over the past several years but continues to be, and may in the future be, involved in such actions in the US, the UK, Europe and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group is currently involved in a number of significant legal and regulatory actions, including criminal and civil investigations, proceedings and ongoing reviews (both formal and informal) by governmental law enforcement and other agencies and litigation proceedings, relating to, among other matters, the offering of securities, conduct in the foreign exchange market, the setting of benchmark rates such as LIBOR and related derivatives trading, the issuance, underwriting, and sales and trading of fixed-income securities (including government securities), product mis-selling, investment advice, customer mistreatment, anti-money laundering, antitrust, VAT recovery and various other compliance issues. Legal and regulatory actions are subject to many uncertainties, and their outcomes, including the timing, amount of fines or settlements or the form of any settlements, which may be material and in excess of any related provisions, are often difficult to predict, particularly in the early stages of a case or investigation. NatWest Group's expectation for resolution may change and substantial additional provisions and costs may be recognised in respect of any matter.\n\nSignificant legal and regulatory actions to which NatWest Group is currently exposed include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 An FCA investigation into the potential criminal and civil culpability of NatWest Group under the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2007 in relation to certain money service businesses and related parties.\n- \u00b7 Two Skilled Person reviews under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 in relation to (i) the governance arrangements with respect to two financial crime change programmes and (ii) a past business review of investment advice provided during 2010 to 2015.\n\n- \u00b7 A review in the ROI involving Ulster Bank Ireland DAC in relation to the treatment of customers who were sold mortgages with a tracker interest rate or with a tracker interest rate entitlement.\n- \u00b7 A criminal investigation by the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut (USAO) and the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) concerning trading by certain NWM Plc former traders involving alleged spoofing, which activity occurred during the term of a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that NWMSI entered into in connection with secondary trading in various forms of asset-backed securities, under which non-prosecution was conditioned on NWMSI and affiliated companies not engaging in conduct during the NPA that the USAO determines was a felony under federal or state law or a violation of the antifraud provisions of the United States securities law. The duration and outcome of this criminal investigation, which may include the extension, modification, or deemed violation of the NPA, remain uncertain.\n\nFor additional information relating to these and other legal and regulatory proceedings and matters to which NatWest Group is currently exposed, see 'Litigation and regulatory matters' of Note 26 to the consolidated accounts.\n\nAdverse outcomes or resolution of current or future legal or regulatory actions (in particular, any finding of criminal liability by US authorities (including as a result of pleading guilty), as to the alleged spoofing or the conduct underlying the NPA) could have material collateral consequences for NatWest Group's business and result in restrictions or limitations on NatWest Group's operations. These may include consequences resulting from the need to reapply for various important licenses or obtain waivers to conduct certain existing activities of NatWest Group, particularly but not solely in the US, which may take a significant period of time and the results of which are uncertain. Failure to obtain such licenses or waivers could adversely impact NatWest Group's business, in particular in the US, including if it results in NatWest Group being precluded from carrying out certain activities. This in turn and/or the fines, settlement payments or penalties could adversely impact NatWest Group's capital position or its ability to meet regulatory capital adequacy requirements.\n\nFailure to comply with undertakings made by NatWest Group to its regulators may result in additional measures or penalties being taken against NatWest Group. In addition, any failure to administer conduct redress processes adequately, or to handle individual complaints fairly or appropriately, could result in further claims as well as the imposition of additional measures or limitations on NatWest Group's operations, additional supervision by NatWest Group's regulators, and loss of investor confidence.\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nti\n\no\n\nn\n\nal\n\ni\n\nn\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nmat\n\ni\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\n## NatWest Group may not effectively manage the transition of LIBOR and other IBOR rates to alternative risk free rates.\n\nUK and international regulators are driving the transition from the use of interbank offer rates (IBORs), including LIBOR, to alternative risk free rates (RFRs). Interest rate benchmark reform is a key priority of the Financial Stability Board, and working groups have been established in a number of jurisdictions to support the transition. Major central banks and regulators including the FCA, the Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve, have strongly urged market participants to transition to RFRs, given the FCA have indicated that the availability of LIBOR beyond the end of 2021 cannot be guaranteed. NatWest Group has a significant exposure to IBORs, and continues to reference it in certain products, primarily derivatives and cash products. NatWest Group has started to phase out its use of IBOR in line with the Bank of England transition roadmap, and has embedded appropriate fall-back mechanisms in most new IBOR activities, either through bilateral contract documentation, or under the ISDA fall-backs protocol. Major NWG entities including NWB and NWM, along with many group counterparties, have already adhered to the ISDA IBOR fall-backs supplement and protocol which establishes a clear, industry accepted, contractual process to manage the transition from IBORs to RFRs for derivative products.\n\nNatWest Group is actively engaged with customers and industry working groups to manage the risks relating to this exposure, and explore ways to transition IBOR exposures to RFRs to the extent possible. Any economic impacts will be dependent on, inter alia, the establishment of deep and liquid RFR markets, the establishment of clear and consistent market conventions for all replacement products, as well as counterparties' willingness to accept, and transition to, these conventions. Furthermore, certain IBOR obligations may not be able to be changed thus resulting in fundamentally different economic outcomes than originally intended. The uncertainties around the timing and manner of transition to RFRs expose NatWest Group, its clients and the financial services industry more widely to risk.\n\nExamples of these risks may include (i) legal risks relating to documentation for new and the majority of existing transactions (including, but not limited to, changes, lack of changes, or unclear contractual provisions); (ii) financial risks from any changes in valuation of financial instruments linked to impacted IBORs that may impact NatWest Group's performance, including its cost of funds, and its risk management related financial models; (iii) pricing, interest rate or settlement risks such as changes to benchmark rates that could impact pricing, interest rate or settlement mechanisms in or on certain instruments; (iv) operational risks due to the requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; and (v) conduct and litigation risks arising from communication regarding the\n\npotential impact on customers, and engagement with customers during the transition period, or non-acceptance by customers of replacement rates.\n\nIt is therefore difficult to determine to what extent the changes will affect NatWest Group, or the costs of implementing any relevant remedial action. Uncertainty as to the nature and extent of such potential changes, the take up of alternative reference rates, or other reforms including the potential continuation of the publication of LIBOR, may adversely affect financial instruments using LIBOR as benchmarks. The implementation of any alternative RFRs may be impossible or impracticable under the existing terms of certain financial instruments and could have an adverse effect on the value of, return on, and trading market for, certain financial instruments and on NatWest Group's profitability. There is also the risk of an adverse effect to reported performance arising from the transition rules established by accounting bodies, as the outcome of certain rules (as approved by the IASB) are still dependent on how the actual transition process is implemented.\n\n## NatWest Group operates in jurisdictions that are subject to intense scrutiny by the competition authorities.\n\nThere is significant oversight by competition authorities of the jurisdictions, which NatWest Group operates in. The competitive landscape for banks and other financial institutions in the UK, the EU/EEA and the US is rapidly changing. Recent regulatory and legal changes have and may continue to result in new market participants and changed competitive dynamics in certain key areas, such as in retail and SME banking in the UK where the introduction of new entrants is being actively encouraged by the government. Competition authorities, including the CMA, are currently also looking at and focusing more on how they can support competition and innovation in digital markets.\n\nThe UK retail banking sector has been, and remains, subjected to intense scrutiny by the UK competition authorities, government and by other bodies, including the FCA and the Financial Ombudsman Service, in recent years, including with a number of reviews/inquiries being carried out, including market reviews conducted by the CMA and its predecessor the Office of Fair Trading regarding SME banking and personal banking products and services, the Independent Commission on Banking and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.\n\nThese reviews raised significant concerns about the effectiveness of competition in the retail banking sector. The CMA's Retail Banking Market Order 2017 imposes remedies primarily intended to make it easier for consumers and businesses to compare personal current account ('PCA') and SME bank products, increase the transparency of price comparison between banks and amend PCA overdraft charging. These remedies impose additional compliance requirements\n\non NatWest Group and could, in aggregate, adversely impact NatWest Group's competitive position, product offering and revenues.\n\nAdverse findings resulting from current or future competition investigations may result in the imposition of reforms or remedies, which may impact the competitive landscape in which NatWest Group operates or result in restrictions on mergers and consolidations within the financial sector.\n\n## The cost of implementing the Alternative Remedies Package ('ARP') could be more onerous than anticipated.\n\nImplementing the ARP (initially in relation to the business previously described as Williams & Glyn, since supplemented by an additional perimeter of 200,000 customers since 25 August 2020) has involved costs for NatWest Group, including but not limited to funding commitments of \u00a3425 million for the Capability and Innovation Fund and \u00a3350 million for the Incentivised Switching Scheme, both being administered by the Independent Body. Implementing the ARP may:\n\n- \u00b7 involve additional costs for NatWest Group;\n- \u00b7 divert resources from NatWest Group ' s operations;\n- \u00b7 cause business disruption and jeopardise the delivery of other significant plans and initiatives;\n- \u00b7 require NatWest Group to modify certain aspects of its execution of the Incentivised Switching Scheme, which could increase implementation costs; and\n- \u00b7 subject NatWest Group to penalties of up to \u00a3 50 million if uptake within the scheme is insufficient.\n\nAs a direct consequence of the ARP, NatWest Group will lose existing customers and deposits, which in turn will have adverse impacts on its business and associated revenues and margins. The ARP could also result in adverse customer engagement and adverse reputational implications for NatWest Group.\n\nThe ARP is intended to benefit eligible competitors and negatively impact NatWest Group's competitive position.\n\nUpon request by an eligible bank NatWest Group has agreed to grant customers which have switched to eligible banks under the scheme access to its branch network for cash and cheque handling services. This may impact customer service for NatWest Group's own customers with consequent competitive, financial and reputational implications.\n\nImplementation of the scheme is also dependent on the engagement of eligible banks and administration by the Independent Body.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect customer switching. The incentivised transfer of SME customers to third party banks places reliance on those third parties to achieve satisfactory customer outcomes,",

The deferred tax assets are quantified on the basis of current tax legislation and accounting standards and are subject to change in respect of the future rates of tax or the rules for computing taxable profits and offsetting allowable losses.\n\nFailure to generate sufficient future taxable profits or further changes in tax legislation (including with respect to rates of tax) or accounting standards may reduce the recoverable amount of the recognised tax loss deferred tax assets, amounting to \u00a30.9 billion as at 31 December 2020. Changes to the treatment of certain deferred tax assets may impact NatWest Group's capital position. In addition, NatWest Group's interpretation or application of relevant tax laws may differ from those of the relevant tax authorities and provisions are made for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.

Material contracts include the following:\n\n## B Share Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement\n\nOn 26 November 2009, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement pursuant to which HM Treasury subscribed for the initial B shares and the Dividend Access Share (the Acquisitions) and agreed the terms of HM Treasury's contingent subscription (the Contingent Subscription) for an additional \u00a38 billion in aggregate in the form of further B shares (the Contingent B shares), to be issued on the same terms as the initial B shares. The Acquisitions were subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the company having obtained the approval of its shareholders in relation to the Acquisitions.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the company announced that, having received approval from the PRA, it had terminated the \u00a38 billion Contingent Subscription. The company was able to cancel the Contingent Subscription as a result of the actions announced in the second half of 2013 to further strengthen its capital position.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the company announced that on 8 October 2015, it had received a valid conversion notice from HM Treasury in respect of all outstanding B shares held by HM Treasury. The new ordinary shares issued on conversion of the B shares were admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority (UKLA), and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc, on 14 October 2015. Following such conversion, HM Treasury no longer holds any B shares.\n\nThe company gave certain representations and warranties to HM Treasury on the date of the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement, on the date the circular was posted to shareholders, on the first date on which all of the conditions precedent were satisfied, or waived, and on the date of the Acquisitions. The company also agreed to a number of undertakings.\n\nThe company agreed to reimburse HM Treasury for its expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions.\n\nFor as long as it is a substantial shareholder of the company (within the meaning of the UKLA's Listing Rules), HM Treasury has undertaken not to vote on related party transaction resolutions at general meetings and to direct that its affiliates do not so vote.\n\n## Directed Buyback Contract\n\nOn 7 February 2019, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Directed Buyback Contract to help facilitate the return of the company to full private ownership through the use of any excess capital to buy back the company's ordinary shares held by HM Treasury.\n\nUnder the terms of the Directed Buyback Contract, the company may agree with HM Treasury to make off-market purchases from time to time of its ordinary shares held by HM Treasury, including by way of one or more standalone purchases, through a nondiscretionary, broker-managed directed trading programme, or in conjunction with any offer or sale by HM Treasury by way of an institutional placing. Neither the company nor HM Treasury would be under an obligation to agree to make such off-market purchases and would only do so subject to regulatory approval at the time.\n\nThe aggregate number of ordinary shares which the company may purchase from HM Treasury under the Directed Buyback Contract will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's issued share capital and the aggregate consideration to be paid will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's market capitalisation. The price to be paid for each ordinary share will be the market price at the time of purchase or, if the directed buyback is in conjunction with an institutional placing, the placing price.\n\n## Framework and State Aid Deed\n\nAs a result of the State Aid granted to the company, it was required to work with HM Treasury to submit a State Aid restructuring plan to the European Commission (EC), which was then approved by the EC under the State Aid rules on 14 December 2009. The company agreed a series of measures which supplemented the measures in the company's strategic plan.\n\nThe company entered into a State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury at the time of the initial EC decision and, following the EC's approval of amendments to the restructuring plan in April 2014, the company entered into a revised State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury. In September 2017, the revised State Aid Commitment Deed was amended by a Deed of Variation (as so amended, the 'Revised State Aid Commitment Deed') following the EC's approval of an alternative remedies package (the 'Alternative Remedies Package') to replace the company's final outstanding commitment under its State Aid obligations (to divest the business previously known as Williams & Glyn).\n\nOn 25 April 2018, the Revised State Aid Commitment Deed was replaced by the Framework and State Aid Deed between the company, HM Treasury and an independent body established to facilitate and oversee the delivery of the Alternative Remedies Package (the 'Independent Body'). Under the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company agrees to do all acts and things necessary to ensure that HM Treasury is able to comply with its obligations under any EC decision approving State Aid to the company, including under the Alternative Remedies Package.\n\nPursuant to the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company has committed: (i) \u00a3425 million into a fund for eligible bodies in the UK banking and financial technology sectors to develop and improve their capability to compete with the company in the provision of banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and develop and improve the financial products and services available to SMEs (the 'Capability and Innovation Fund'); and (ii) \u00a3275 million to eligible bodies to help them incentivise SME banking customers within the division of the company previously known as Williams & Glyn to switch their business current accounts and loans to the eligible bodies (the 'Incentivised Switching Scheme'). The company has also agreed to set aside up to a further \u00a375 million in funding to cover certain costs customers may incur as a result of switching under the Incentivised Switching Scheme. In addition, under the terms of the Alternative Remedies Package, should the uptake within the Incentivised Switching Scheme not be sufficient, the company may be required to make a further contribution, capped at \u00a350 million. The Independent Body will distribute funds from the Capability and Innovation Fund and implement the Incentivised Switching Scheme.\n\nUnder the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company also agreed to indemnify the Independent Body and HM Treasury, up to an amount of \u00a3320 million collectively to cover liabilities that may be incurred in implementing the Alternative Remedies Package. The provisions of the indemnity to the Independent Body are set out in the Framework and State Aid Deed and the provisions of the indemnity to HM Treasury are set out in a separate agreement between the company and HM Treasury, described under ' Deed of Indemnity ' below.\n\nThe Framework and State Aid Deed also provides that if the EC adopts a decision that the UK Government must recover any State Aid (a \"Repayment Decision\") and the recovery order of the Repayment Decision has not been annulled or suspended by the General Court or the European Court of Justice, then the company must repay HM Treasury any aid ordered to be recovered under the Repayment Decision.\n\n## Deed of Indemnity\n\nIn the context of the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company entered into a Deed of Indemnity with HM Treasury on 25 April 2018, pursuant to which the company agreed to indemnify HM Treasury to cover liabilities that may be incurred in implementing the Alternative Remedies Package, as described under ' Framework and State Aid Deed ' above.\n\n## Trust Deed\n\nIn the context of the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company entered into a Trust Deed with the Independent Body on 25 April 2018, to set up a trust to administer the funds committed by the company under the",

The Relationship Deed covers the three independence provisions mandated by the Listing Rules: (i) that contracts between the company and HM Treasury (or any of its subsidiaries) will be arm's length and normal\n\ncommercial arrangements, (ii) that neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect of preventing the company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and (iii) neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Memorandum of Understanding Relating to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund\n\nOn 16 April 2018 the company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the 'MoU') with the trustee of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund (the 'Group Fund'), which aimed to facilitate both the necessary changes to the Main Section of the Group Fund to align the employing entity structure with the requirements of the UK ringfencing legislation and acceleration of the settlement framework for the 31 December 2017 triennial valuation of the Main\n\nSection of the Group Fund (brought forward from 31 December 2018).\n\nIn addition, the MoU also provided clarity on the additional related funding contributions required to be made by the company to the Main Section of the Group Fund as follows: (i) a pre-tax payment of \u00a32 billion that was made in the second half of 2018 and (ii) from 1 January 2020, further pre-tax contributions of up to \u00a31.5 billion in aggregate linked to the making of future distributions to RBS shareholders including ordinary and special dividends and/or share buy backs (subject to an annual cap on contributions of \u00a3500 million before tax).\n\nOn 28 September 2018, the implementation of the MoU was documented through a Framework Agreement entered into between the company and the trustee of the Group Fund.\n\nAdditio\n\nnal information",

Contact can also be in the form of email, post or word of mouth. Scams are sometimes advertised in newspapers, magazines or online as genuine investment opportunities and may offer free gifts or discounts on dealing charges.\n\nScammers will request money upfront, as a bond or other form of security, but victims are often left out of pocket, sometimes losing their savings or even their family home. Even seasoned investors have been caught out by scams.\n\n## Clone firms\n\nA 'clone firm' uses the name, firm registration number (FRN) and address of a firm or individual who is FCA authorised. The scammer may claim that the genuine firm's contact details on the FCA Register (Register) are out of date and then use their own details, or copy the website of an authorised firm, making subtle changes such as the phone number. They may claim to be an overseas firm, which won't always have full contact and website details listed on the Register.\n\n## How to protect yourself\n\nAlways be wary if you're contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly, or promised returns that sound too good to be true. FCA authorised firms are unlikely to contact you unexpectedly with an offer to buy or sell shares or bonds.\n\nPlease do not give any personal details to any caller unless you are certain that they are genuine. Check the Register to ensure the firm contacting you is authorised and also check the FCA's Warning List of firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart.\n\nAsk for their (FRN) and contact details and then contact them using the telephone number on the Register. Never use a link in an email or website from the firm offering you an investment.\n\nIt is strongly advised that you seek independent professional advice before making any investment.\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, or have any concerns about a potential scam, report this to the FCA by contacting their Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or by using their reporting form which can be found on their website.\n\nIf you have already invested in a scam, fraudsters are likely to target you again or sell your details to other criminals. The follow-up scam may be completely separate, or may be related to the previous scam in the form of an offer to get your money back or buy back the investment on payment of a fee.\n\nFind out more at www.fca.org.uk/consumers",
