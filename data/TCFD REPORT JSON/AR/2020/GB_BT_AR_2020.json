Competitive pressures across all of BT's business areas have intensified, the pace of technological change has accelerated further and dependency on the connectivity we provide our customers has become absolute. To keep pace with this changing landscape, business transformation at BT has become a constant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pandemic has been gruelling for everybody and BT has more than played its part in the national and international effort to deal with its consequences.\n\nThe vital services we provide helped to improve things for those in their time of greatest need, keeping friends, families, businesses and crucial Government services - including the NHS - connected. We also undoubtedly played a role in helping the online retailers who have become so important to many of us.\n\nThe way BT has managed through the pandemic whilst progressing its business modernisation programme is a significant achievement. It is the commitment of the whole BT team that made this possible, best illustrated by the award of no fewer than eight MBEs to colleagues in recognition of their efforts during the pandemic.\n\nDespite the resilience of our colleagues and our networks, and the dependency of our customers on the service we provide, our financial performance during the year has been impacted by the pandemic. Although in line with expectations, adjusted revenue and EBITDA were both down 6% compared to last year and normalised free cash flow was 27% lower than the previous year.\n\nWe know our investors and our customers understand that BT must modernise to maintain its leadership position and return to financial strength. Doing so will improve our offer to customers and in turn we will generate value for our shareholders. Modernising BT is a core part of the company's revised strategic framework which was launched this year - and on which you will find more detail in Philip Jansen's message on page 6.\n\n## Building our networks\n\nAt the heart of BT lie its networks. Investing in our broadband and mobile networks is investing in the future of BT. The 2020/21 financial year was of vital importance in this regard: we committed to make investments that will be the foundation of BT's success over the longterm and which will in turn underpin much of the UK's future economic prosperity.\n\nIn May 2020 we set out our target, subject to the right conditions - and critically the outcome of Ofcom's Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review (WFTMR) - to build full fibre broadband to 20m premises across the UK by the mid- to late-2020s.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo facilitate this significant investment and to help us navigate the uncertainties caused by the pandemic without compromising our credit rating - we took the tough but necessary decision last year to suspend the 2019/20 final dividend and all dividends for this year and rebase it. The Board expects to resume dividend payments in 2021/22 at 7.7 pence per share, with 30% payable at the interim stage later this year.\n\nIn March 2021, Ofcom published the outcome of the WFTMR. With it came the regulatory certainty we required on behalf of our shareholders to confirm our FTTP a build investment and we have since further increased and accelerated our target from 20m to 25m premises by December 2026. This will be the single largest investment in the country's digital infrastructure for a generation and it will support the UK's transition to a gigabit economy.\n\nOfcom has clearly moved to a regulatory regime that encourages network builders to invest in the UK's digital infrastructure. This should be welcomed by everybody, including investors, given the importance of outstanding connectivity to the UK's future prosperity.\n\n## Climate pledge and digital skills\n\nInvesting for the future must also include the collective and individual steps we take on climate change and in supporting our society and communities. As we build back better from this awful pandemic, progress against both these imperatives couldn't be more important.\n\nBT has pledged to be a net zero business by 2045 and we're working with our suppliers to help them reduce their carbon emissions by 42% by March 2031. In November, we reached the milestone of sourcing 100% of electricity, worldwide, from renewables. At the same time, we announced our ambition to move nearly all of BT Group's vehicles - the UK's second largest commercial fleet at almost 33,000 in total, including 28,000 Openreach vehicles - to electric and alternative fuels by 2030.\n\nWhile climate change has been high on the agenda for many years, 2020 put digital inclusion at the heart of UK politics. Our Lockdown Learning and Standout Skills campaigns are examples of the support we provided customers on digital inclusion and skills training during the year.\n\nThese initiatives have been a success. This year - five years ahead of target - we hit our goal of reaching 10m people with help to improve their digital skills by 2026. We have now extended that target to a more stretching ambition to reach 25m people by the end of March 2026.",

Our thanks go to Mike for his six years of service and as a highly active member of the Board, sitting at various times as a member of virtually all our committees - the Audit & Risk , Nominations , Remuneration , BT Compliance and Digital Impact & Sustainability Committees .\n\nAs announced on 1 March 2021, I will be retiring as chairman of the company later in the year. Chairing the Board of BT has been a tremendous privilege. Although it's a much over-used word, it really is true that BT is a unique business. With it come a unique set of challenges but navigating the complexity is as rewarding as it is demanding, because what this great company does, really matters to so many people. However, having served as chairman of significant FTSE companies for 17 years, I know that personally the time is now right for me to focus on other interests.\n\nThe search for my successor is being led by Iain Conn, the senior independent director, and shareholders should know that I have assured the Board that I am fully committed to serve as chairman as part of an orderly transition process until my successor is in place.\n\n## Prospects\n\nIf, in my fourth and final letter to shareholders, I wanted to reflect on events since I stepped up as chairman, there can be no denying the overall decline in our share price - a decline which in fact stretches back a full five years. I know shareholders will derive little comfort from the knowledge that much of this decline reflects trends seen across our sector, but I am pleased that our share price has performed much better over the last year, increasing by about 50% from the depressed levels at which we traded for much of last year.\n\nMuch of that recovery reflects the tremendous dedication and hard work of the management team in recent years, together with some real improvements in the fundamental prospects of our business.\n\nOur relationship with Ofcom has improved significantly since 2017 and the business case for FTTP is now clearly positive. In a few short years, the number of premises passed by Openreach has increased more than tenfold from 420,000 premises to 4.6m. And Openreach is now building at pace - aiming to ramp up its build rate to 4m homes and businesses a year.\n\nOur Global business has fully recovered from its significant problems some years ago. A new leadership team with a new strategy has worked tirelessly to divest networks and operations in around 20 countries globally and are successfully executing their strategy to focus capabilities on today's software-defined world. Global is now fully stabilised and making a positive and valuable contribution to the group.\n\nIn our Consumer business we are seeing the benefits of some significant longterm investments aimed at improving customer experience. We have onshored our customer service teams; we are levelling up the gap between new and existing customer pricing; and we are now starting to see the first wave of truly converged products that use the combined power of BT's fixed and mobile networks coming to market. We have now seen almost five years of consecutive improvements in our quarterly customer satisfaction surveys and, most recently, record Net Promoter Scores for both the BT and EE brands.\n\nLooking to the future, the Board and management do not for a moment underestimate the scale of the challenge we face in further modernising BT to ensure that we can provide brilliant service to our customers in a highly competitive industry. At the same time, we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us.\n\nBT has a strong and diverse Board at the helm, an outstanding leadership team under our chief executive, Philip Jansen, and a clear strategic purpose and vision that is being well executed. I am proud to have played a part in helping to achieve these strong building blocks and I have every confidence that BT is well placed for the next stage in its development towards consistent and sustainable growth over the long term.\n\nJan du Plessis Chairman 12 May 2021",

Globally, our colleagues have gone the extra mile for our customers this year, keeping them, their families, friends and businesses connected.\n\nWe launched a range of customer initiatives to help people during the pandemic, including our digital skills and inclusion campaigns, Top Tips on Tech and our Lockdown Learning support package; our free unlimited data offer for EE customers working in the NHS; the launch of our Small Business Support Scheme; and we provided high-speed fibre and wi-fi connectivity to over 200 vaccination centres, connecting mass testing centres and 17 temporary NHS hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We've still got progress to make but these are good signs, demonstrating the value our customers place on the critical connectivity we provide them.\n\nOur record high customer service ratings reflect the outstanding efforts of all our colleagues. We've still got progress to make but these are good signs, demonstrating the value our customers place on the critical connectivity - as well as the improvements in experience and service - we've provided them this year. Customer ratings are positive across virtually all parameters and BT's customer satisfaction is the highest it's ever been.\n\nThat doesn't mask the fact that the pandemic has been hard for our colleagues. At the start of the year we gave our frontline key workers a 1.5% pay rise and froze pay for managers; we guaranteed no job losses directly resulting from the pandemic in the first three months of the year; and we took the decision not to use the Government's furlough scheme. For the current financial year we have frozen pay for all colleagues but plan to pay a special bonus for our frontline colleagues of \u00a31,000 in cash and \u00a3500 in shares to recognise and thank them for their efforts.\n\nWe also supported colleagues around the world by setting up a dedicated wellbeing portal, providing weekly updates from our chief medical officer, listening and responding to colleagues' concerns and massively ramping up our internal communications to ensure they felt supported wherever they are.\n\nDespite the outstanding operational performance of our colleagues in the face of the pandemic, our financial performance during the year was significantly impacted by Covid-19. Revenue alone was around \u00a31.6bn lower than the previous year and this had a knock-on effect on our EBITDA and normalised free cash flow.\n\n## Importance of our networks\n\nWithout connectivity as we know it today, the global impact of Covid-19 would have been unthinkable. BT's leading networks have been a lifeline throughout the pandemic for our customers. Daytime data traffic over our broadband network doubled from an average of five terabits per second (Tbps) to around 10 Tbps with more people at home during the day.\n\n2020 will be the year we look back on as the moment society truly understood the value of good connectivity. In 2021, we're stepping up to deliver the next generation of infrastructure and we will be increasing and accelerating our FTTP build plan by an additional 5m premises, from 20m to 25m by December 2026. We\n\nhave the capacity to fund this additional build from internal resources. However, we believe we can deliver further value to shareholders by funding the additional 5m premises through a joint venture with external parties and we will begin exploring options.\n\nIn mobile, we have extended our 4G coverage, and hit our target of doubling our 5G network which now reaches 160 towns and cities with broader and more highly rated coverage than any other operator. Following the conclusion of Ofcom's 5G spectrum auction in March 2021 - securing the spectrum we need at a lower than expected cost - we will be able to continue growing our position as the UK's number one 5G network.\n\nThe investments we make in these two leading networks over the next decade or so mean we'll be able to combine them to create the UK's leading smart converged network, the power of which will deliver economic prosperity for decades to come.\n\n## Improved investment case\n\nThe confirmation of our FTTP investment, based on our confidence of being able to achieve a fair return; the completion of the 5G spectrum auction; and the successful conclusion of the 2020 triennial BT Pension Scheme valuation have cleared up some significant uncertainties for our shareholders. This clarity now allows us to focus on executing our strategy and returning BT to growth.\n\n## Refreshed strategic direction\n\nIn July 2020, we introduced BT's new strategic framework. It comprises three pillars which support our ambition to be the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines: build the strongest foundations; create standout customer experiences; and lead the way to a bright sustainable future.\n\nOur network investments form a key part of our work to build the strongest foundations for the company. During the year, I also made changes to the Executive Committee and to the way we operate across the organisation to ensure we are best placed to continue delivering for our customers.",

Rob Shuter joined as CEO of Enterprise in February 2021 from MTN, replacing Gerry McQuade who retired from BT. In March we announced that Sabine Chalmers will become general counsel and director of regulatory affairs, following the departure of Cathryn Ross who will leave BT in June 2021 for a new role outside our sector.\n\nWith this much strengthened executive team now in place, we are set to accelerate our progress to modernise BT and return this business to topline, profitable growth. Last year we set our target of \u00a31bn annualised cost savings by 2023, rising to \u00a32bn by 2025. We've made very good progress in the first year, achieving \u00a3764m of gross annualised savings in 2020/21.\n\nDuring the year we also broke new ground with the introduction of exciting products that will provide customers with the seamless connectivity they need: we launched Halo 3+, the UK's first unbreakable broadband connection; EE had a great launch of the Apple iPhone 12 in the autumn; and Global launched Eagle-i, our new security platform that will transform our managed services through proactive, predictive cyber security protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo see Philip in conversation visit our online annual review.\n\n## bt.com/annualreview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn March 2021, our chairman, Jan du Plessis, announced his intention to retire from the Board.

This additional investment reflects the scale of our ambition to reinforce the foundations for growth, both for the company and the nation.\n\nDuring this financial year we'll start our pivot to growth in revenue and EBITDA. We'll continue to grow both metrics predictably and consistently into the future, underpinning the reintroduction of our progressive dividend this year.\n\nAlthough the scale of the investments we are making will inevitably press on cash flow over the next few years, they will not impact our ability to pay a dividend and they are designed to deliver enduring success for all BT stakeholders. Furthermore, once we are through the peak investment phase, we will see a very material increase in cash flow creating further options for BT in the future.\n\nWe've achieved a huge amount this year, and while there's still a lot more to do, BT is now on the front foot and driving growth and value for all our investors and stakeholders.\n\n## Philip Jansen\n\nChief Executive 12 May 2021",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory update\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UK Government and Ofcom's investment focus\n\nThe Government recognises how important it is to invest in gigabitcapable networks, with their potential to deliver big economic and societal benefits. In line with the Government's strategic priorities, Ofcom has continued working to create a regulatory framework for fixed communications that encourages investment.\n\n## Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review (WFTMR)\n\nOfcom's WFTMR sets out a clear and long-term framework that promotes and rewards network investment by everyone. It also ensures that consumers will continue to have access to affordable broadband as new networks and services become available. This is positive for BT and our customers. It supports our target to deliver 25m full fibre homes by December 2026 - meaning our customers will get the faster and more reliable services they need.\n\nOfcom's investment support comes in a number of forms. The new regulatory framework provides greater stability by virtue of having five-year market review periods instead of three and looking across all of the wholesale fixed telecoms markets instead of considering business and residential connectivity separately.\n\nTo support competitive investment, wholesale access prices for fixed final mile legacy services will remain stable in real terms across the country until at least 2031. Similarly, Ofcom does not expect to regulate wholesale prices of full fibre final mile services until at least 2031 - depending on prevailing customer outcomes, investment levels and competition. Any regulation beyond that point won't strip away any upside we have earned up to then, and won't cap our investment returns below what is needed to compensate for the downside risk our investors are taking when they decide to invest in fibre today. This is otherwise known as Ofcom's 'fair bet' commitment.\n\nWe'll keep working constructively with Ofcom to implement the new regulatory framework. At the same time we'll make sure we can compete fairly so that Openreach can offer attractive terms to all its downstream communications providers, helping them quickly deliver new services to customers. Implementing the framework will need further work with industry to make duct and pole use simpler, complying with new rules on quality of service, and delivering on our commitment to a 'balanced build' across the UK.\n\n## Government support for fibre\n\nWe continue to believe there is more the Government could do to reduce the cost of building full fibre networks, for us and other providers. That would speed up\n\nfull fibre rollout and catalyse economic and social benefits. Cumulo rate relief (relief on the rates charged against our network assets such as ducts and poles) and 'barrier busting measures' to make wayleaves and planning easier would help fibre investment go faster.\n\nThe Government says it will provide at least \u00a31.2bn to support full fibre rollout. This may potentially increase to \u00a35bn if our industry can build gigabit-capable networks to the UK's 'final 20%' of premises over the next five to ten years to support its target. We expect this money to be available through Government procurement, helping us invest in places that wouldn't normally be commercially viable. When we have more details, we'll decide whether to bid for funds in line with our business investment criteria.\n\n## Shared Rural Network\n\nWe're making great progress extending our rural 4G coverage as part of the Shared Rural Network initiative. We're upgrading hundreds of existing sites to meet the new coverage obligations in our spectrum licence - including reaching 88% UK geographic coverage by 2024. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport should announce grant funding soon which will enable new, shared infrastructure in areas where today there's no 4G on any network making sure 95% of the UK will be able to get 4G from at least one provider.\n\n## All-IP\n\nUK phone services will move from our legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN) to IP-based services by the end of 2025. This is a key enabler for the wider move to full fibre in the UK.\n\nWe've started moving customers off the PSTN and we're working with Government, Ofcom and industry to minimise any disruption. It's a sensitive project because of the need to look after vulnerable customers and the UK's Critical National Infrastructure.\n\n## Broadband Universal Service Obligation\n\nLaunched in March 2020, the broadband Universal Service Obligation gives individuals the right to a decent broadband connection, where connection costs do not exceed \u00a33,400 or where the end customer agrees to pay any excess costs. That means at least a 10Mbps download speed and 1Mbps upload speed. As designated universal service provider (alongside KCom in Hull), we're upgrading the network to reach more than 5,500 homes and businesses. On top of that, another 400,000 premises can now get better broadband via a 4G wireless hub.",

        "page_content": "Getting decent broadband to hard-toreach homes and businesses can be expensive. So we've introduced a costsharing scheme that lets customers close to other premises club together and save money on getting connected.\n\nHowever, it's true that getting a good connection is prohibitively costly for some homes and businesses, and we don't believe this will be fixed by the broadband Universal Service Obligation scheme. We're committed to playing our part, alongside others in industry, Ofcom and Government, to finding new ways to get decent broadband to those hardest to reach.\n\nIn October 2020, Ofcom opened an investigation into the way BT quotes excess costs to individual premises on a shared infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing.\n\n## Consumer fairness\n\nUK regulators rightly prioritise consumers' interests. We support that. We want regulation which delivers better outcomes for all customers, while providing support for those who are vulnerable. We've continued to work with Ofcom to show how we're sticking to their Fairness for Customers commitments we signed up to in June 2019. That includes:\n\n- -  supporting customers and helping them engage with the market\n- -  making sure services work like they should\n- -  making it quick and easy for customers to switch communications providers\n- -  ensuring everyone gets fair treatment.\n\nWe've brought in protections voluntarily for customers who don't take up a new deal at the end of their contract. BT broadband customers get a capped price increase, and BT Halo customers keep paying the same.\n\nEE mobile handset customers who've been out of contract for more than three months get a price discount from then on. And when their broadband or mobile contract is ending, we offer existing BT, EE and Plusnet customers equivalentlypriced deals to new customers if they choose to re-contract.\n\nFor customers we know are vulnerable, we've committed to regular account reviews to help them get the best deal for what they need. And we're soon launching a new, easier to access tariff for financially vulnerable customers with wider eligibility.\n\nIn 2020 we also completed upgrading around 700,000 customers from copper to superfast broadband at no extra cost.\n\nWe're faithful to Ofcom's Fairness for Customers commitments, and therefore, from 1 April 2021, this will receive Boardlevel oversight from the BT Compliance Committee .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can find more about the BT Compliance Committee on page 86 .\n\n## European Electronic Communications Code\n\nIn October 2020, Ofcom confirmed a package of new customer protections based on new European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) rule changes. Ofcom and Government have given us until December 2021 to follow most of the rules, and until June and December 2022 for the remainder. This phased approach is mainly because of the impact of Covid-19 combined with the implementation efforts required.\n\nThe rules should give customers enhanced rights. For example, from December 2021, all mobile devices must be sold unlocked. And from June 2022, before they order something, customers will be able to get an easily readable contract summary that allows comparison to other providers and services. On top of that, from December 2021, vulnerable customers with a specific need will get better access to the relevant information in a format they choose.\n\nWe're implementing these rules and have responded to Ofcom's further consultation on making it easier for home customers to switch providers. We support Ofcom's proposals, which will benefit our home and business customers.\n\nWe agree with the EECC rules and what they're trying to achieve. But some of the rules are really complicated. An example of this is the rule on the customer's ability to end any or all elements of bundled services contracts for any non-beneficial change made to any element of that bundle. Our systems need to be able to recognise Ofcom's broad definition of 'linked contract' across any combination of our fixed and mobile services, and sometimes across brands, in order to offer customers this right. We'll keep working through business and systems requirements to comply with this, while simultaneously planning how to minimise unintended consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spectrum auction\n\nIn March 2021, we bid successfully for extra 5G mobile spectrum in Ofcom's auction in the 700MHz and 3.6GHz bands, securing a total of 80MHz for \u00a3475m. Following the assignment phase of the auction we secured our preferred positions within the 700MHz and 3.6GHz bands and will rapidly bring the spectrum into use for provision of additional coverage and capacity of 5G services.\n\nOfcom has now consulted on its 2020s spectrum management strategy. We've supported a number of its proposals, including the development of a spectrum roadmap. We expect Ofcom will issue a number of consultations relating to spectrum in the coming year, including future annual fees for 2100MHz licences and the award of 26GHz spectrum.\n\n## Northern Ireland Public Sector Shared Network contract\n\nIn December 2020, Ofcom found that we failed to provide information to telecommunications company eir, related to Fibre on Demand on an 'equivalence of inputs' basis, compared with BT's own downstream Enterprise business unit. This related to the bidding process for a public sector fibre contract in Northern Ireland in 2018. We cooperated with and accepted Ofcom's findings, settling with them to pay a fine of \u00a36.3m. We have put measures in place to prevent this happening again. Ofcom recognised that these errors weren't deliberate and that we took a number of steps to comply with the regulatory obligations. Based on Ofcom's decision, we don't believe this impacted the tender outcome of the contract in question.\n\n## Brexit\n\nBrexit has changed the UK's relationship with the EU. We have been planning for Brexit for a number of years and there has been no immediate impact from the Brexit trade deal on our operations and service offerings to our customers. We continue to monitor the evolution of the Brexit trade deal. We have teams working on implementing changes needed to work seamlessly for our customers and with our partners in the EU to ensure our services operate as normal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There will always be more work to do, but this year we've made excellent progress against our strategic priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Build the strongest foundations\n\n## The best converged network\n\nFor us, building the strongest foundations starts with the network. The need for people and businesses to connect has never been greater. As the number of connected devices keeps growing, we need a converged network that uses the best of our mobile and fixed networks to seamlessly support our customers' needs.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we continue to invest in existing and new technologies. This year we have made progress against four key priorities:\n\n## 5G by default\n\nEE is the UK's best mobile network. In 2020, RootMetrics awarded EE UK Best Mobile Network for the seventh consecutive year, including for 5G. So far, we've launched 5G in 160 towns and cities. It's giving our customers faster speeds, a more reliable service and nearinstant connections to content. We've also further improved our backhaul links by building almost 3,000 10G links to support enhanced peak speeds for 4G and 5G customers.\n\nTo support our business customers we're building and managing 5G private networks, as we have done with Belfast Harbour where we will help accelerate their digital transformation and smart port ambitions with a state-of-the-art 5G ecosystem.\n\n160\n\ntowns and cities with 5G\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fibre by default\n\nOur total full fibre footprint now reaches 4.6m premises, over 2m of which were passed in the last 12 months. That's an average of almost 40,000 a week, and in the final week of March 2021 Openreach's build rate surpassed 100,000.\n\nGiven Openreach's build confidence, regulatory clarity, the Government's recent tax super-deduction and a positive 5G spectrum auction outcome, we have decided that the conditions are right to increase and accelerate our full fibre build. We have increased our target from 20m to 25m premises, and will accelerate rollout to deliver this by December 2026.\n\nOur accelerated build has three massive benefits: it allows us to go faster, beefing up our capacity to build fibre to households and businesses; it will allow us to go further, getting fibre to more people including in rural communities; and it will help fuel UK economic recovery, delivering better connectivity and creating new jobs.\n\n4.6m\n\ntotal full fibre footprint (premises)\n\n25m\n\nwe've increased our full fibre build target from 20m to 25m premises and will accelerate rollout to deliver this by December 2026",

But we're also investing in extending our reach further, growing our access network so customers get a brilliant experience in buildings, on the go and in remote places. This investment is focused on:\n\n- -  expanding our public wi-fi network to reach 5.8m active hotspots, up from 5.6m\n- -  rolling out 58 new sites in rural and remote locations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  acquiring new spectrum. The results of the recent spectrum auction mean that we will get 700MHz spectrum, which will further boost indoor coverage in buildings and venues, and increase our coverage overall\n- -  deploying a fixed wireless network for new fixed wireless and hybrid broadband propositions. In February 2021, we launched our first hybrid broadband device. It uses fixed and mobile networks, giving our customers a more reliable service and an instant connection when setting up their broadband for the first time.\n\n5.8m\n\nactive public wi-fi hotspots\n\n99%\n\nof the UK population covered by our mobile network\n\n## Network capabilities\n\nOur focus remains on building secure, flexible and robust core capabilities that ultimately let our customers do more. We're continuing to evolve our core network towards a common cloud-based solution that can manage 4G and 5G. We're running pilot 'use cases' to explore edge-enabled services. We worked with Worcester Bosch to enable smart manufacturing via a private 5G network and a BT-managed edge computing infrastructure. For consumers, we're testing edge-based solutions to enable low latency, real-time uses such as the augmented reality experiences we are exploring as part of the 'Green Planet 5G AR' consortium. The lower latency of these new network capabilities means virtually no waiting.

To do that, we're focusing on four key missions:\n\n## Mission 1. Transforming our customer journeys\n\nAt the core of our transformation is building simpler and more automated processes so we can deliver more quickly and efficiently for our customers. So, we're investing in speeding up customer journeys and reducing the number of failures and manual interventions. This will make our operations more productive and radically improve our customer experience. We have launched the first digital journeys for our SME customers, who can now order many of our Halo for Business packages online. This means less effort for our customers, and for our SME sales advisers. We have also built new full fibre journeys, supported by components of our new strategic IT architecture, which will go live early in 2021/22. Most importantly, customers are telling us they're getting a better experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy reducing the complexity of our product portfolio - particularly products with outdated features, slow speeds, or data caps - we will be able to deliver a better customer experience.",

Simplifying our product portfolio\n\nReducing the complexity of our product portfolio - particularly products with outdated features, slow speeds, or data caps - is better for us and our customers. It makes offers simpler for us to manage and easier for customers to understand. In the past year, we've removed over half of our older consumer broadband products. We also reduced the number of Global product variants we sell by 34%.\n\n## 50%+\n\n## Mission 3. Migrating our customers onto our strategic networks\n\nOur new strategic networks are more capable and reliable, with lower running costs than our legacy infrastructure. Moving customers to new, converged propositions helps us gradually retire these legacy networks. This year, we have launched a number of strategic propositions; for example our consumer customers can now get our IP-based Digital Voice service. We now have 1.5m IP voice connections (mainly businesses), a nearly 40% increase this year.\n\n## c.40%\n\nincrease in IP voice connections during 2020/21\n\nreduction in our older consumer broadband products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mission 4. Moving to a modern, modular IT architecture\n\nWe want to launch market-leading products and features to our customers faster. To do that, we're radically simplifying our IT estate, embracing cloud solutions and common components. Over the last year we've been building the foundations of our new IT architecture, based on modern, modularised software components deployed on industry standard platforms. We've now deployed a number of major software platforms such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Vlocity. And we've started building new, highly automated customer journeys on these platforms, for example to support our Halo for Business and full fibre products.\n\nOn top of the progress across these four missions, we've also delivered productivity improvements and managed costs through initiatives like:\n\n- -  new operating models for our Consumer call centres and Enterprise regional sales teams\n- -  improved use of data insights and advanced analytics to identify the most challenging customer order and fault journeys to proactively respond to potential issues\n- -  operational productivity improvement programmes\n- -  enhanced procurement supported by digital tools\n- -  rigorous functional cost control and Covid-19 mitigating actions.\n\nOur modernisation programme is a key driver for delivering annualised gross cost savings. Last year we announced a target of \u00a31bn in gross cost savings by March 2023, increasing to \u00a32bn by March 2025. We anticipated each target would cost \u00a3900m and \u00a31.3bn to deliver, respectively. We're already ahead of schedule, having delivered gross annualised savings of \u00a3764m with an associated cost of \u00a3438m.\n\n## \u00a3764m\n\ngross annualised savings delivered during 2020/21",

We continue to invest in skills development for all colleagues, including technical skills, agile ways of working, resilience and adaptability.\n\nAs part of our commitment to unlimited learning, this year we deployed a new digital learning management system. Since launch, there have been more than 1.5m video views. And more than 20,000 colleagues have attended masterclasses led by learning and business experts.\n\nWe want to understand and match skill supply to future demand. So we're integrating workforce and skills planning capabilities, and using AI tools, to include data-driven external benchmarks in our skills development. This will help us find opportunities to reskill colleagues to areas of demand.\n\nWe also launched a programme to support frontline colleagues who want to transfer into other areas of BT and continued to host and expand networks like TechWomen.\n\nDespite the pandemic, we continued to attract fresh talent - with our graduate and apprentice programmes playing a big part. This year, we hired over 8,700 colleagues. 6,700 of them are in the UK, including more than 1,800 new apprentices and over 200 graduates. At the same time c.14,200 colleagues left BT - c.7,900 through natural attrition, c.4,200 through paid leaver programmes and c.2,100 through divestments.\n\nvideo views on our new digital learning management system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe believe that diversity, inclusion, accessibility and equality is everyone's business. And they are core elements of our people strategy. During the year, we updated our UK people data by encouraging colleagues to amend their diversity records on our systems. Now we have a far better understanding of our workforce demographics, which in turn is helping us identify and tackle bias and discrimination.\n\nThis year, we increased our focus on race equality, particularly around addressing issues of systemic racism and instances of prejudice across our business. We launched our Ethnicity Rapid Action Plan, and made significant progress in the areas where we could make the biggest immediate differences. We're proud to be a Lifetime Visionary Partner of Race Equality Matters. As at 31 March 2021, nearly 10% of our UK employees\u00aa declared they were from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.\n\nAs part of our Valuable 500 commitments on disability inclusion, we've established a Disability Rapid Action Plan across our business to help us make faster progress. The plan is amplifying colleagues' voices through our Able2 People Network and helping us embed disability inclusion right across our business.\n\n- Further information on our approach to diversity on our Board as well as our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found in the Corporate governance report on page 81 .\n- You can find more about our diversity and inclusion strategy at bt.com/ diversity-and-inclusion\n\n## Health, safety and wellbeing\n\nCovid-19 presented new and far greater day-to-day challenges to customers' and colleagues' health, safety and wellbeing. We're offering a lot more support to our colleagues, to promote their ongoing health and resilience.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we have delivered preventative wellbeing services, supported shielding workers with a bespoke rehabilitation service and launched an online medical support programme. Our chief medical officer has provided regular updates, with content on topics like remote working, emotional resilience and communication.\n\nPutting effective Covid-19 management measures in place helped our operational, customer and field teams keep working\n\n- a  UK employees include, amongst others, those who had not disclosed, or had responded 'prefer not to say' in respect of their ethnicity pursuant to our selfdeclaration campaign.

Our solution portfolio has been enhanced by over 30 product launches this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsecurity solution product launches this year\n\n30+\n\n## Zoom Meetings\n\nThis year, we were the first international service provider to offer a fully managed Zoom Meetings service. We provide a managed service on top of the core solution. It includes service management, monitoring and user adoption - all critical for multinational companies. In addition, we integrate our world-leading voice networks to provide extended reach for customers and ensure that security is embedded into the core solution. Our unique resources help us combine exceptional customer experiences with flexibility and security in one easy-touse platform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Halo for Business\n\nFor business customers we launched Halo for Business, with three services in one - full fibre broadband with a 4G backup service (4G Assure), a digital phone line and unlimited mobile data. Since its launch, almost 70% of customers are taking enhanced broadband bundles with features like 4G Assure and enhanced IT support.\n\n## c.70%\n\nbusiness customers taking enhanced broadband bundles\n\n## Intelligent Connectivity\n\nOur Intelligent Connectivity solution helps enterprise customers achieve smarter, digital futures by offering a suite of products from SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide Area Network), SD-LAN (Software Defined Local Area Network), cloud, security and managed services. We've seen an encouraging level of interest in our SD-WAN solutions which offer secure, flexible, high-bandwidth connections across multiple sites using both fixed and mobile technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Network solutions\n\nIn Global, we launched a new generation of software-defined managed network solutions that will provide customers with increased choice and flexibility as they optimise their networks for cloud services.

Our group Net Promoter Score (NPS) has improved for 19 consecutive quarters. It continues to be an area of focus, and is a group KPI (page 46).\n\n## Customer experience\n\nOver the last year, Global's NPS rose almost 20 points. In Consumer, NPS for the BT brand is at an all-time high. The latest figures published by Ofcom show sustained falling complaint levels over the last four years with a 50% drop in Ofcom complaints for EE mobile and BT fixed products, and an 80% drop in complaints in EE fixed. EE leads the way, with the industry's fewest landline and broadband complaints of all major providers and the equal lowest complaints rate of any major mobile network operator. BT landline and broadband complaints are now lower than the industry average.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Covid-19, we've paid even closer attention to creating outstanding customer experiences.\n\n## Lockdown Learning\n\nWith UK schools closed due to lockdown restrictions during the year we introduced our Lockdown Learning support package. It's a free scheme for families, carers and children to help them join virtual classrooms and stay connected to their teachers, classmates and schoolwork. It gives those most in need unlimited mobile data, BT Wi-Fi vouchers and free mobile access to BBC Bitesize and Oak National Academy educational content without using up data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has allowed clinicians to easily access and update patient records via secure mobile devices.\n\nFrom April 2020, we provided NHS workers and vulnerable customers with free unlimited mobile data on pay monthly plans. Today more than 300,000 NHS staff are benefiting from unlimited data on our EE network. And EE customers can now access NHS online services without using any mobile data even if they've run out.\n\n## 300,000+\n\nNHS staff are now benefiting from unlimited data on our EE network\n\n## Life Lines\n\nWe've also worked with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust on their Life Lines Project enabling families to reach patients at their bedsides virtually. So far, it's allowed more than 100,000 virtual NHS hospital visits - almost 700,000 minutes of much-needed video conversation in 180 hospitals.\n\n## Small Business Support Scheme\n\nTo support business customers during the pandemic, we launched the Small Business Support Scheme to help them boost their connectivity, cash flow and confidence. Since launch, we've helped more than 2,000 small businesses fund the cost of high-speed business or Ethernet lines. With the shift to digital ways of working we've supported almost 250 small businesses with a free oneto-one coaching session and more than 270,000 people in businesses with free digital skills training.\n\n## 270,000+\n\npeople in small businesses supported through digital skills training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Openreach\n\nCovid-19 had a major impact on Openreach, with customer expectations higher than ever due to an increasing reliance on broadband with the move to working and schooling from home. Through the year, Openreach supported millions of customers working from home by increasing capacity to deliver record repair completions and get homes and businesses back up and running quickly and safely.\n\nOpenreach repaired copper and fibre faults on time 84% of the time - unchanged on last year. Missed appointments (where Openreach was responsible) happened just 3% of the time. 93% of customers got a first provision appointment within 10 days, up 10% compared to last year. This performance was recognised in best-ever NPS results for copper, fibre and Ethernet access.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncopper and fibre faults repaired on time\n\n## 84%\n\n## 93%\n\ncustomers offered a first appointment for provision within 10 days",

For us, this is captured in our digital impact and sustainability strategy: helping people build better digital lives, championing responsible tech and human rights, and tackling climate change and environmental challenges.\n\n## Building better digital lives\n\nWe want to empower people to make the most of the digital world by supporting their daily lives, families, careers and businesses, and to help bridge the digital divide. Our programmes and campaigns enable customers to get the most from our products and services and strengthen relationships with all our stakeholders. At the same time, we're helping to create a techsavvy workforce for the country and develop the talent we need for the future.\n\n## 10m+\n\npeople reached with help to improve their digital skills since 2014/15 (a group KPI)\n\n## Skills for Tomorrow\n\nLaunched in 2019, our Skills for Tomorrow programme aims to help give people the skills and confidence they need to get the most from the digital world. The original aim was to help 10m people by the end of March 2026. We've made strong progress this year, and have already achieved that goal, reaching over 10m people since 2014/15. The pandemic led us to adapt our programmes to have a greater online focus, and consequently we've been able to reach many more people than we had originally anticipated. As a result of meeting our original goal, we've now extended the target, aiming to reach 25m people by the end of March 2026.\n\n## Work Ready\n\nTo boost social mobility and economic productivity, our Work Ready programme is helping jobseekers succeed in an increasingly digital world of work.\n\nWe reached over 10,300 people this year through webinars and events. Overall we've supported more than 13,700 people with employability skills since 2014. This year we also launched our Stand Out Skills campaign, reaching over 468,000 people - giving free support to job hunters to help build their confidence.\n\n## 468,000+\n\npeople reached through our Stand Out Skills campaign\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Small businesses\n\nAs part of our 25m Skills for Tomorrow target, we want to offer help to one million people working in small businesses to improve their digital skills.

These included making a WhatsApp video call, keeping children safe online, getting a business online, and finding physical and mental wellbeing services on the web. As a direct result of the campaign, more than 5.7m people learnt or did something new. And 2.1m of them continued to put what they learned into practice afterwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Families\n\nBarefoot, our partnership with Computing at School, is equipping children with key computing and problem-solving skills to help them thrive, through free resources and training provided to teachers. Barefoot has reached more than 3m children and teachers since 2014/15. This year, we extended Barefoot's scope to support children in their early years. And in response to the pandemic, we've introduced new home learning resources, including interactive learning games and activities, and expanded the free online resources for families available on our Skills for Tomorrow portal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## bt.com/skillsfortomorrow\n\nWe're helping older, more vulnerable, and digitally excluded people build confidence and skills too. Our partnership with Good Things Foundation (GTF) sponsored more than 80 online centres, providing skills training within local communities.\n\nIn order to focus our impact, we are scaling down our involvement in Barefoot and the online centres. We will continue to support the work of Computing at School and GTF, and help children and older and vulnerable groups in other ways.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nPartnerships are central to our digital inclusion approach. We're a founding member of FutureDotNow, a coalition of leading companies and nongovernmental organisations that aims to empower everyone to thrive in a digital UK.\n\nWith Microsoft and Cambridge University, we helped UNICEF scale up its pilot Digital Learning Passport campaign. It helped schoolchildren in need across five countries by providing free access to e-books, learning videos, recorded lessons and resources for teachers and children.\n\nIn India, we partner with the British Asian Trust to help boost youth skills, empowering more than 100,000 teenage girls through digital learning. And we continue to support the Quality Education India Development Impact Bond, which is boosting literacy and maths learning outcomes. Over 250 BT volunteers have supported these programmes.",

We want to make sure we develop, use, buy and sell technology in a way that consistently benefits society and minimises harm.\n\nWe aim to use responsible tech to differentiate existing products and propositions, and to help us grow in areas like health, connected homes and security. Responsible tech directly supports our ambition to be the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines. And it will differentiate us as customers seek to make ever more ethical buying decisions.\n\nWe base our responsible tech approach on these key principles:\n\n## For Good\n\nWe design and deliver tech to empower people and improve their lives.\n\n## Accountable\n\nWe're accountable for our actions and take care to avoid and protect against tech misuse.\n\n## Fair\n\nWe work hard to ensure everyone is treated fairly and with respect.\n\n## Open\n\nWe listen, collaborate and are transparent about our actions.\n\nWe follow all Modern Slavery Act requirements and international standards on human rights that apply to our business. These include the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nWe continue to champion human rights through partnerships and collaborations, including our work with the Global Network Initiative, Tech Against Trafficking, the Marie Collins Foundation, the Centre for Sport and Human Rights and UK charity Unseen.\n\nOur processes and procedures identify and address potential and actual human rights impacts throughout our business. We have embedded checks in our sales processes to help us find and address potential risks. In our supply chain, we have mandatory contractual standards on working conditions - and we check that our suppliers stick to them.\n\n- For more information, take a look at our modern slavery statement at bt.com/ modernslavery\n\n## Tackling climate change and environmental challenges\n\nWe've led on climate action for almost three decades. In 2016, we hit our first science-based target of cutting our carbon emissions intensity by 80% - four years early.\n\nWe've since set a target to reduce our carbon emissions intensity by 87%, by the end of March 2031 (compared to 2016/17 levels) and have pledged to be a net zero carbon emissions business by 2045. Furthermore, this year we've extended the scope of our net zero pledge to include our supply chain, as well as increasing our target of reducing supplier carbon emissions by 42% by the end of March 2031 (previously 29%).\n\nOverall, we've cut total carbon emissions\u00aa from our global operations by a further 29% over the last year, largely as a result of completing the switch to 100% renewable electricity globally and, to a much lesser extent, as the impact of Covid-19 led to lower in-year emissions from travel and heating. Since 2016/17, we've cut our carbon emissions intensity by 57% to 13.7 tonnes of CO2e per \u00a3m value added.\n\nWe're focusing on a number of things to support our ambitions:\n\n- -Switching to renewable electricity 100% of what we consume worldwide in our networks, exchanges, offices and shops is renewably sourced b . We purchased over 2.5TWh of electricity this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Moving to a low carbon fleet BT and Openreach together operate the UK's second largest commercial fleet. Our almost 33,000 vehicles make up more than two thirds of our direct emissions (greenhouse gas scope 1). We're committed to switching nearly all our fleet to run on electric and alternative fuels by 2030. Joining forces with The Climate Group, we've launched a partnership (the UK Electric Fleets Coalition) to push for fleet decarbonisation and help develop policy measures that support electric vehicle uptake. We advocated for and supported the UK Government's ban on new petrol and diesel cars and light vehicles from 2030.\n- -Decarbonising our buildings This year, our global energy consumption reduced by 123 GWh. This was mainly as a result of energy efficiency measures, including the reduction of our legacy network and our investments of nearly \u00a321m in cooling projects, but also to a lesser extent due to the impact of Covid-19. Overall, our investments have helped us save \u00a3358m since 2009/10.\n- Last year we took action to increase energy efficiency through decarbonising our buildings. For more information, please see page 39 of the Annual Report 2020. bt.com/about\n- -Cutting supply chain emissions More than two thirds of our end-toend carbon emissions come from our supply chain. We've cut our supply chain emissions by 19% since 2016/17, and are on track to meet our target of a 42% reduction by 2030/31. We're encouraging key suppliers to set their own net zero targets, buy renewable energy and talk to their own suppliers about climate action. We also have market-leading carbon emission reduction clauses into our key supplier contracts.",

Using its Internet of Things platform to enable smart buildings, iOpt provides real-time information and alerts on the status of properties, with a focus on social housing. Everimpact is developing environmental monitoring for its smart streets proposition - air quality and CO2 sensors will be integrated into street hub units to help monitor, report and verify climate actions, and in turn, sales of carbon offsets to finance climate action.

We connect with them at all levels of our business. That includes frontline operations, customer-facing and corporate units, our senior leadership team, the Executive Committee and the Board and its committees.\n\nWe engage with stakeholders in lots of different ways - from virtual meetings and conferences to reviews, forums and webcasts.\n\nTo understand how well we're engaging with different groups, the Board and its committees receive regular updates and use them to make better decisions, and provide feedback and constructive challenge on activities, programmes and initiatives being considered.\n\nThis year we introduced a new stakeholder management risk category, recognising just how important they are to our business. You can read more on page 59.\n\nOur Section 172 statement on pages 42 to 43 includes examples of how the Board and its committees had regard for stakeholder interests through its discussions and decision-making during the year.\n\n## Colleagues\n\n## Our ambition is only as strong as the foundations we're built on, and our colleagues are absolutely central to this.\n\nEngaging with them is critical to achieving a culture where they can be their best and fully contribute towards realising our purpose, ambition, strategy and BT's long-term success.\n\nWe employ approximately 99,700 full-time equivalent colleagues in 44 countries. 80,400 are in the UK. We also engage with 1,700 colleagues through agencies and nearly 68,600 other nonregular staff.\n\nOur colleagues want us to:\n\n- -  share their personal values\n- -  provide flexible and agile ways of working\n- -  provide great career opportunities, development and training\n- -  reward performance with fair and competitive pay and benefits.\n\n## How we engage with colleagues, and the result\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from the chief executive and the HR director (as appropriate) on our colleagues, progress against key people strategy initiatives, culture and overall sentiment within the organisation. The Covid-19 pandemic, combined with our cultural transformation programme, meant that wellbeing was a priority at the Board's discussions about colleagues this year. Given the focus in the organisation on diversity and inclusion, the Board also spent time discussing the diversity and inclusion strategy, how it supports\n\nthe group's strategy, external targets, commitments and progress.\n\nThe Board uses the Colleague Board as its chosen method of engagement with the workforce under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code). Isabel Hudson, as our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, is the primary liaison and she has discussions with Colleague Board members both through the formal meetings and informal discussions. You can find more information on the work of the Colleague Board on the next few pages.\n\nOnce a year our colleagues tell us how it feels to work here through our Your Say engagement survey. With around 85% of colleagues taking part this year, this survey gives us a clear idea how they're feeling and helps us understand what more we can do to make BT a brilliant place to work. This year, we also wanted to know how colleagues were feeling as a result of the pandemic. Given the impact of Covid-19, we ran monthly 'pulse surveys' throughout the first four months of the year. This allowed us to review and adjust our approach to ensure it was effective in supporting our colleagues. Regular updates from the chief medical officer were a key part of the support provided.\n\nOur People Networks are colleague-led groups that feed back thoughts, opinions and opportunities to our leadership team so we can make BT a properly diverse and inclusive place to work. Our People Networks are sponsored by one of our Executive Committee members or the CEO, Openreach.\n\nCombined with listening directly to our colleagues, we also hear concerns through more formal engagement channels. They include our European Consultative Council, the Communications Workers Union, Prospect and EE employee representatives in the UK. These were shared and discussed with the Board via the chief executive and the HR director.\n\nWhen we respond to feedback from colleagues, we first pick areas and initiatives that will make the biggest impact. Longer term, we continually shape and inform our overall people strategy to create a culture where colleagues can be their best - with a focus on skills development, diversity and inclusion, and health, safety and wellbeing. More on what we have done during the year as a result of engaging with our colleagues can be found on pages 24 to 25.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The Colleague Board\n\n## Who is the Colleague Board\n\nLast year's Annual Report explained the Board's decision to create a Colleague Board as its chosen workforce engagement mechanism under the Code. The Board felt this was the right option for BT as it would allow for meaningful input from (and change for) colleagues across the group and give them a louder voice at the table. It also best represented our intent to bring our colleagues closer to decision-making and to engage with them to explore initiatives and proposals.\n\nThe Colleague Board comprises ten members representing all our business units, two Openreach invitees, Isabel Hudson, our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, and the chief executive (the chair). Isabel was selected for this role due to her breadth of understanding and interest in employee and wider stakeholder matters. The chairman, HR director and general counsel are also invited and attend all formal meetings. The company secretary is secretary to the Colleague Board and she or her delegate attends all meetings. The HR, internal communications and company secretarial teams support Isabel Hudson and the Colleague Board . As part of engagement by other non-executive directors with our colleagues, Sara Weller has also decided to attend all meetings for the rest of 2021.\n\nColleague Board members have a twoyear tenure. There will be an application process this year for new Colleague Board members from January 2022. For continuity, current members will be offered the opportunity to apply to remain on the Colleague Board for a further year.\n\n## Communication with the Board\n\nAs the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, Isabel Hudson is the formal link between the Colleague Board and the Board, openly reporting back on key discussions and feedback to the Board and management, as appropriate. Outside of formal meetings, Isabel liaises with Colleague Board members, including attending their team meetings where appropriate. The minutes of each Colleague Board meeting are also shared with the Board and Isabel also reports back on Colleague Board feedback on any initiatives that the Board or its committees are considering, to allow the Board and management to use it to shape thinking.\n\n## Communications with our colleagues\n\nThroughout the year, Colleague Board members gave feedback on their discussions and activities, and received input from colleagues across the business, in a number of ways:\n\n- -  all colleagues are provided with the opportunity to feed into future Colleague Board agenda items and raise 'hot topics' via Colleague Board members for discussion at meetings\n- -  summaries are posted on the intranet after each formal meeting and Colleague Board members also publish video messages on Workplace from Facebook (our internal communication platform) updating colleagues on proposals and initiatives and the Colleague Board's views and contributions\n- -  Colleague Board members use a number of internal channels to exchange views and feedback. In addition to a Workplace group, which they manage themselves and use to talk directly and openly with other colleagues, Colleague Board members also hold group-wide all-hands calls\n- -  colleagues also connect with BT's People Networks and forums to understand internal trends and priorities.\n\nThe chief executive also invites Colleague Board members to his regular leadership calls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are fortunate to have established the Colleague Board at a time when, given the tremendous challenges being faced as a result of the pandemic, hearing the views and experiences of colleagues is paramount. I have particularly enjoyed the 'hot topic' sessions at meetings, where there have been no holds barred!\n\nIsabel Hudson, our designated nonexecutive director for workforce engagement and a member of the Colleague Board\n\nIt is inspiring to be able to share the positive feedback and concerns of our colleagues so that they genuinely feel heard.\n\nTom Hannibal, site support lead analyst, Consumer and Colleague Board member\n\n<!-- image -->",

I'm delighted with their engagement and involvement in a number of initiatives. It's exceeded my expectations in many ways!\n\nPhilip Jansen, chief executive and chair of the Colleague Board\n\nWe have been constantly involved in the plans for the Better Workplace Programme this year. Everything from the design of colleague surveys and discussing workplace habits, spaces and the technology we will use, through to Covid-19 measures and our wellbeing. I am really proud to have played a part in shaping BT's future workplaces for our colleagues to love.\n\nKate MacNicol, Senior service desk analyst, Enterprise and Colleague Board member\n\n## Activities in 2020/21\n\nThe Colleague Board held four formal meetings this year. It also held a number of informal meetings and briefings with relevant internal teams. In its first 15 months, the Colleague Board has successfully contributed to, and shaped, some of our key initiatives by sharing views and different perspectives. Through both formal meetings and informal sessions, our senior leaders seek the Colleague Board's views on business-wide programmes (including how they align with our values and culture), how we communicate with our colleagues and the effectiveness of wider colleague engagement mechanisms (like the Your Say employee engagement survey). The meeting agendas are primarily driven by the Colleague Board members, working with the company secretarial team.\n\n## The Colleague Board's main highlights to date are:\n\n- -  helping the Board understand employee sentiment through the pandemic, including the importance to colleagues of receiving regular communications. It also shaped the content, approach and communication of wellbeing campaigns to support our colleagues through the pandemic\n- -  giving advice to the chief executive and Executive Committee on our new purpose and reaffirmed values and taking an active role in the subsequent communications to colleagues\n- -  discussing the need to simplify and improve our systems, and accelerate our transformation programme and digitalisation agenda\n- -  assisting the development and shaping of the Better Workplace Programme (see page 25). That included giving feedback on key design principles to reflect different colleagues' needs, shaping our communications and engagement and helping to design success measures for the programme\n- -  helping expand our Ethnic Diversity Network and create a new Americas arm to support our diversity and inclusion strategy and giving feedback on our Ethnicity Rapid Action Plan (see page 24). The Colleague Board was also one of the key internal promoters to encourage our colleagues to complete the UK-wide self-declaration campaign on the diversity of our UK colleagues. The composition of our UK colleagues from a diversity perspective has been invaluable in helping the Board and management shape our diversity and inclusion strategy\n- -  highlighting key issues and colleagues' concerns as part of 'hot topics' open discussion sessions at meetings during the year. This has included insights into the importance of timely and regular communications from senior management on key business developments and the impact of restructuring plans on colleagues, as well as the need for communications and initiatives to better reflect the perspectives of our global colleagues, and to ensure our sales teams have better insight into the product and services roadmaps for different customers\n- -  launching the Colleague Board's ambition with a focus on:\n- - diversity and inclusion bringing an equilibrium\n- - being your best self\n- - being proud to be at BT\n- - making wellbeing part of our DNA\n- -  discussing BT's role and plans as a sustainable and responsible business, and how to increase colleague involvement, as well as sharing feedback on our digital impact and sustainability strategy\n- -  providing feedback on how to better communicate career and reskilling opportunities for our colleagues in line with the shifting focus of the business over the medium to long term and the need to have clearer development programmes for mid-level managers\n- -  suggesting improvements to our communication methods across the business, particularly in relation to changes in areas such as policies, share plans and recognition.",

At the early stage of developing new solutions, we work with them to understand their needs and make sure what we sell - and their overall buying-to-billing experience - is the best it can be.\n\nOur insight centre of excellence serves all parts of BT and gives us a strong analytical capability that delivers a deeper understanding of what customers want and need. We use a number of different methodologies and data sources to understand what customers expect, and how they act, across different channels. This insight helps shape our strategy, position our solutions, design customer-driven improvements and develop our brand and communications.\n\nSee pages 26 to 29 for things we have done during the year to create standout experiences for our customers.\n\nOur Global Advisory Board enables us to talk directly with senior leaders at our major global customers.

Regular reviews with Executive Committee members - led by the chief executive and chief financial officer focus on how to continually improve performance.\n\nThis year we built stronger, more trusting relationships with customers with a range of initiatives to support them through the Covid-19 pandemic. They included a Lockdown Learning support package for consumers and our Small Business Support Scheme for business customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere's more information on these initiatives and others on pages 28 to 29 .\n\nOpenreach continues to make sure all its customers get equal access to our fixed network. It does this by ensuring that its industry consultation process is straightforward and compliant, with strong governance controls. All communications providers have the opportunity to engage with Openreach confidentially during an initial consultation stage.\n\nThe chief executive, Executive Committee and senior BT leaders regularly review and discuss complaints directly with customers. It keeps them connected to issues on the ground, allows them to have a better understanding of how to fix common problems and helps us improve the way we respond to complaints.\n\nOur customers and the impact on them are always considered by the Board and the chief executive (with input from the Executive Committee ) as part of decision-making - whether on strategic direction, investments or the solutions we develop. The Board regularly receives updates on, and discusses, customer experience and the NPS for the group as a whole, customer-facing units and underlying customer segments. The\n\nBoard also discusses initiatives having a positive impact on our customers, key focus areas and areas for improvement.\n\nThis year, as part of her Board induction, Sara Weller joined two customer inclusion panel sessions. These are BT forums where groups representing vulnerable customers and people with disabilities help improve our products and services. Sara has also observed a number of customer research panels with Consumer and SME customers to hear their views on current service and future priorities. This type of engagement gives us valuable insights for Board and committee discussions and decision-making.\n\nThe Board understands how important it is to act proactively to protect consumers' interests and meet the expectations of the regulator and Government for greater commitment to a culture of consumer fairness at all levels within communications providers, including at Board-level.\n\nTo enhance our commitment to protecting consumers' interests, the Board approved proposals to enhance our consumer fairness governance framework with Board-level oversight provided by the BT Compliance Committee on consumer fairness matters (see page 86 for more details).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7. 8 p p\n\nThere's more information on consumer fairness within our Section 172 statement on page 43 .\n\npercentage points improvement in group NPS (a KPI)",

As owners of the business, engagement with them is important.\n\nBecause of our privatisation in 1984, a lot of our c.783,000 shareholders are individuals, although institutional investors hold the biggest volume of shares. We also have debt investors.\n\n## Our shareholders want us to:\n\n- -  deliver a return on their investment through dividends or capital growth\n- -  perform well against our outlook and long-term strategy.\n\n## How we engage with shareholders, and the result\n\nWe communicate regularly with shareholders through our website, the Annual Report and our quarterly financial results and trading statements.\n\nThe AGM is normally a chance for the Board to meet and engage with shareholders in person. However, as a result of the pandemic, the 2020 AGM had to be held as a closed meeting in line with Government restrictions on public gatherings. We gave shareholders the opportunity to ask questions in advance and the responses were made available on our website via an audio recording alongside video messages from the chairman and the chief executive and an audio recording of the meeting itself. For the 2021 AGM, we continue to monitor the situation and we will publish the arrangements in the Notice of meeting (see page 77).\n\nThe company secretary communicates with individual investors, making sure we respond properly to questions in relation to their shareholding.

It includes one-to-one conversations, roadshows, group meetings, conferences and industry events. The chairman, senior independent director and other directors also spend time with investors.\n\nThe pandemic has meant significant changes to the way we interact with institutional shareholders. All our meetings were virtual, and this meant that it was easier for more investors to attend each group meeting, leading to fewer meetings over the course of the year.\n\nDuring 2020/21, the Board, the chief executive, chief financial officer, other executives and the investor relations team held 262 meetings with investors. Conversation topics included financial and operational performance, capital investment, pension deficit funding plans, capital allocation policy and prospective governmental and regulatory policy decisions.\n\nDuring the year, the chairman also met investors to discuss any governance related matters. The senior independent director also engaged with investors in relation to the ongoing search for the new chairman.\n\n## Ahead of the 2020 AGM, the\n\nRemuneration Committee chair consulted extensively with our largest shareholders and their representative bodies and their feedback was used to help shape the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Board receives regular reports on shares being bought and sold, share price performance and how we're engaging with institutional investors and analysts. The Board also discusses any shareholder issues with management.\n\nWe maintain a strong relationship with debt investors (mainly financial institutions who invest in our publiclytraded bonds) and meet with them regularly as part of our investor relations programme. They're crucial to making sure we have access to debt capital to finance our business.\n\nWe have an investment-grade credit rating based on the strength of our balance sheet.\n\n262\n\nmeetings with investors during the year",

It's also key to the way we operate as a responsible and sustainable business and supports our purpose of connecting for good.\n\n## Communities rely on us to:\n\n- -  give them reliable and secure connections\n- -  help local people and enterprises get more from the digital world\n- -  protect the environment, help tackle issues like climate change and do business ethically and responsibly.\n\n## How we engage with communities, and the result\n\nWe reach communities in all aspects of day-to-day life, such as conversations with customers in EE/BT retail stores and when visiting individuals in their homes to set up their broadband service. We engage with charities, non-governmental organisations and partners on digital skills programmes. We also undertake research to understand the topics that are most important to communities when they think of BT.\n\nThe insights we get inform the strategies and programmes we develop, from digital skills to climate change action. On behalf of our Board, the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee approves our strategy and monitors our progress as a responsible and sustainable business. It also makes sure we're contributing positively to the communities we live, work, and operate in.\n\nThis year, the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee approved a change in approach to our Skills for Tomorrow programme, and its pivot to become 'digital-first' as a direct result of Covid-19, to make sure we could still reach all those who needed help most with digital skills. This also led to a bigger focus on supporting job seekers and SMEs - both groups severely affected by the pandemic.\n\nOn top of what we invest through our dayto-day business, we aim to invest 1% of profit before tax, as a mixture of cash and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin-kind investments, in our sustainability activities and communities. This year, we invested \u00a318m or 0.63% of adjusted profit before tax - below our 1% target. That was because of our 'in-kind contributions' falling, with Covid-19 severely restricting volunteering activity. We remain committed to the target - having invested \u00a3147m into our sustainability activities and communities, at an average of 0.89% of profit before tax over the last five years.\n\nDuring the year, we worked with the UK National Emergencies Trust to support many communities through the Covid-19 pandemic. We helped fund its operations and gave other digital skills support to help people harness technology to stay safe, healthy, connected and resilient. We've supported communities through the pandemic in many other ways too, such as launching our Lockdown Learning support package for families and children most in need of help to continue learning at home.\n\nTo track how we're doing, we measure reputational performance and trust, as well as our progress on the group KPI to reach 25m people in the UK with help to improve their digital skills by the end of March 2026. You can find out more about what we've done this year in the strategic progress section. Page 31 explains the contributions we've made to building better digital lives, and pages 32 to 33 set out how we're tackling climate change and environmental challenges for the benefit of the communities we operate in.\n\n## 10m+\n\npeople reached with help to improve their digital skills since 2014/15\n\n## \u00a3147m\n\ninvested in communities and our sustainability activities over last five years\n\n## Suppliers\n\nOur relationships with suppliers are instrumental to our success. They help us deliver the solutions and propositions we use to create standout customer experiences.\n\nWe source from across the world, with suppliers in nearly 100 countries.\n\n## Our suppliers want us to:\n\n- -  pay them in line with our agreed terms\n- -  act ethically and transparently\n- -  help them optimise their own supply chains.\n\n## How we engage with suppliers, and the result\n\nWe need to know who we're doing business with, and who's acting on our behalf. So we:\n\n- -  choose suppliers based on principles that make sure we act ethically and responsibly\n- -  undertake due diligence on them before and after we sign a contract - covering financial health, anticorruption and bribery, and whether they meet our standards on areas such as quality management, security and data privacy\n- -  check the things we buy are made, delivered and disposed of in a socially and environmentally responsible way\n- -  measure suppliers' energy use, environmental impact and labour standards, and work with them to improve these.",

The new company will improve our already strong relationships with suppliers by making it easier for them to do business with us and creating more chances to innovate. It will also challenge some traditional ways of buying goods and services through simplifying processes, bringing in new technology and encouraging more collaboration.\n\nIn order to get new suppliers on board faster, we're moving a lot of our processes from manual to digital, whilst still maintaining the existing rigour in our due diligence and assurance.\n\nThis year the Audit & Risk Committee discussed our supply chain landscape, performance across the sourcing and supplier payment process, and the key risks and assurance activities in this area.\n\nThe committee was also updated on our progress against the Government's Prompt Payment Code (PPC) programme in the UK and our consistent improvements in payment performance. This year, we paid 95% of supplier invoices in line with the terms we'd agreed with them. Recent reforms to the PPC require us to pay 95% of invoices from smaller suppliers in 30 days, and we're on target to do this by the 1 July 2021 deadline.\n\nDuring the year, the Board discussed the Government's evolving advice on high-risk vendors (including Huawei) and the development of both the Telecommunications (Security) Bill in the UK and US government restrictions, and the potential procurement and commercial implications for BT. The Board reviewed and approved the entering into of contracts with Nokia and Ericsson and the split of the services provided by these two vendors across our UK sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee considers and approves our modern slavery initiatives on behalf of the Board, which we subsequently disclose in our annual modern slavery statement.\n\nWe engage with suppliers on a range of proactive initiatives - for example progress towards net zero carbon emissions, including the increased uptake in renewable energy, and cutting plastic packaging and waste. This is a key part of our digital impact and sustainability strategy (see page 30) and therefore initiatives are regularly discussed by the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee with feedback shared to continue to test and enhance our approach.\n\nOn diversity and inclusion, we've developed a plan to encourage and help our suppliers to meet and match our own commitments. We've also taken more diversity-led steps in our dealings with suppliers. They include participating in SME events like 'meet the buyer' and benchmarking ourselves via external organisations.\n\nWe're keen to make sure we engage with as broad a range of suppliers as we can. We're discussing how we create a more diverse supplier selection process with software suppliers, and next year we'll increase the purpose/diversity weighting we use in the procurement adjudication process.\n\nA clear framework monitors Covid-19 risks for 430 critical suppliers. It:\n\n- -  assesses the potential effects of transport logistics disruption and manufacturing slowdowns\n- -  monitors suppliers' financial viability and tracks incremental costs due to disruption\n- -  continuously monitors their business continuity plans to make sure they can keep delivering services.\n\n## \u00a313.1bn\n\nspent with suppliers, more than two thirds of our total costs\n\n71% spent with top 100 suppliers",

Our relationship with Government bodies underpins our three strategic pillars and lets us contribute to policies and initiatives that promote the best stakeholder outcomes.\n\n## Government stakeholders want us to:\n\n- -  keep investing in our network infrastructure\n- -  provide the fastest, most reliable and secure connection possible, to the widest possible range of communities\n- -  invest in the best products and services, at fair prices, with high levels of customer service.\n\n## How we engage with the Government, and the result\n\nWe operate the UK's Critical National Infrastructure and support national security. Our priority is fulfilling our responsibilities and obligations for the country and our customers.\n\nOur policy and public affairs team manages our relationships with Government and other politicians.\n\nOur Enterprise team delivers and looks after public sector contracts and services such as the Emergency Services Network.\n\nUnder the Communications Act 2003, the Government can ask us (and others) to run or restore services during disasters. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 also says that the Government can impose obligations on us (and others) in emergencies, or in connection with civil contingency planning.\n\nWe keep an open dialogue with Government through our chairman, chief executive and senior leaders - as well as through consultation responses and cross-industry initiatives. Through those conversations we build support for policies that will deliver good results for the UK and our shareholders.\n\nOur public policy work with Government covers a wide territory, from infrastructure investment to national\n\nsecurity, from regulating online harms to trade and economic policy. For example, this year we launched a programme with the Department for Education to give free BT Wi-Fi vouchers to disadvantaged families to make sure their children could continue to learn at home while schools were closed during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nWe also helped the wider Government response through text message alerts sent on behalf of GOV.UK to around 43m devices connected to our mobile network, and gave tailored support to NHS staff and vulnerable customers.\n\nWe'll continue offering as much support as possible to Government and NHS teams to help them during the pandemic. That includes providing connectivity to hospitals and vaccination centres.\n\nThe Board is updated on discussions with Government through the chairman, chief executive and Executive Committee members, with the Board providing views and comments.\n\n## Regulators\n\nCommunications and TV services are regulated. This ensures consistent rules and standards within each jurisdiction, protecting consumers and promoting competition.\n\nIf we don't engage effectively with our regulators we risk unnecessary regulatory intervention that could stand in the way of us achieving our strategy.\n\nOur main regulatory relationship is with Ofcom in the UK. The main source of Ofcom's powers and duties is the Communications Act 2003, which gives it general competition powers for the sector and helps it enforce consumer law.\n\nWe also engage with other regulatory bodies like the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\n## Ofcom wants to:\n\n- -  advance citizens' and consumers' interests, often by promoting competition\n- -  encourage investment and innovation\n- -  support investment in the UK's critical digital infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we engage with Ofcom, and the result\n\nWe have a positive and open dialogue with Ofcom through our chairman, chief executive and senior leaders.\n\nOur conversations focus on how regulation can support its ambition for a world-class UK digital infrastructure and allow efficient investment, while keeping the market fair and competitive.\n\n- There are more details of the main regulatory topics we cover with Ofcom on pages 16 to 17 .\n\nWe're briefing Ofcom regularly on our Covid-19 response. It has welcomed our efforts to support customers and work with industry to help UK people and businesses stay connected during the pandemic.\n\nFollowing Ofcom's 2017 Digital Communications Review, we implemented a set of Commitments and the supporting Governance Protocol. These provide Openreach with more strategic and operational independence, while allowing us to exercise the right level of parent company control.\n\nThe BT Compliance Committee monitors BT's compliance with the Commitments. It also reviews the progress being made in areas of greatest importance to consumers, communications providers and other stakeholders. The committee seeks views on the Commitments from stakeholders, and keeps Ofcom updated including through the annual review of the BT Compliance Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BT Compliance Committee's annual review can be found at bt.com/btcc\n\nOfcom says that BT and Openreach are still making good progress to safeguard Openreach's independence.

That includes:\n\n## The likely consequence of any decision in the long term:\n\nThe directors recognise that the decisions they make today will affect BT's longterm success. During the year, the Board had particular regard to the long-term success of the company in its discussions on the evolution of the company's purpose and strategic framework, as set out in the Board activities section on pages 74 to 77. Our purpose and strategy demonstrate how we will realise our ambition and grow value for all our stakeholders. This in turn guides the Board's decisions, specifically the balance between short- and long-term investments (more details on page 43). The third pillar of our strategy (lead the way to a bright, sustainable future) incorporates our aim to identify and develop new business opportunities that will help us grow sustainably in the future. More information on our strategy can be found from page 19.\n\n## The impact of BT's operations on the community and environment:\n\nThe Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee monitors progress on the digital impact and sustainability strategy and supporting goals for digital skills, responsible tech and human rights, and climate change and the environment. During the year, the committee reviewed and endorsed the Skills for Tomorrow programme and its pivot to become 'digital-first' during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our digital impact and sustainability strategy incorporates responsible tech and human rights, and our sector-leading approach to climate action, with a target to become a net zero carbon emissions business by 2045, as well as our two related group KPIs (see pages 30 to 33).\n\nWe are also committed to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). See page 67 for our response to TCFD.\n\n## The desirability to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct:\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for setting and monitoring the culture, values and reputation of the company. Our colleagues are central to us achieving our ambition and we are building a culture where our colleagues can be their best. During the year, the Board considered BT's culture in its decision-making and discussions; further details on this can be found on page 76. The Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee reviewed and endorsed BT's new responsible tech and human rights approach which aims to develop, use, buy and sell technology in a way that benefits people and minimises harms (see page 87 for more details on the activities of the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee and page 30 for our digital impact and sustainability strategy).\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also received and considered regular reports from the group ethics and compliance director on BT's ethics and compliance priorities, including Speak Up, our confidential, whistleblowing hotline (see page 85).\n\n- We set out our commitment to high standards of business conduct in The BT Way (our Ethics Code), see bt.com/ethics\n\n## The interests of our colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with our key stakeholders:\n\nThe Board and its committees understand the strategic importance of stakeholders to BT's business. When making decisions, the directors have regard to the interests of colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with other key stakeholders. We acknowledge that not every decision we make will\n\nnecessarily result in a positive outcome for all our stakeholders; the Board therefore has to balance competing interests in reaching its decisions.\n\nWhile the Board engages directly with stakeholders on some issues, the size and distribution of BT and our stakeholder groups means that stakeholder engagement often happens below Board level. However, the Board considers information from across the organisation to help it understand how our operations affect our stakeholders' interests and views. There are more details on how we engage with key stakeholders (including customers and suppliers) on pages 34 to 41 and on the chief executive's role in reporting engagement feedback to the Board through his chief executive's report on page 75. For further details on how the Board operates and makes decisions, and its activities this year, see pages 71 to 77.\n\nOur colleagues are key to our success and they are always considered as part of the Board's discussions and decision-making. Their wellbeing, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as diversity and inclusion, our culture, transformation programme and employee relations, have been a prominent focus of Board discussions this year (see page 76 for more details). The Board engages with colleagues primarily through the Colleague Board and via Isabel Hudson, our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement (see pages 35 to 36 for more details on the Colleague Board ). Isabel provides feedback after each formal Colleague Board meeting and also discusses any topics raised by members at relevant Board and committee meetings.\n\nOur other employee communication channels are set out on page 34. As explained on page 76, the Board also discussed with HR and the chief executive the findings from other colleague engagement mechanisms during the year.\n\n## The need to act fairly as between BT's shareholders\n\nDuring 2020/21, the Board, the chief executive and chief financial officer, other executives and the investor relations team held various meetings with investors (see page 38 for more detail on our engagement with shareholders). These meetings gave investors the opportunity to discuss views on financial and operational performance, capital investment, pensions, capital allocation policy, as well as prospective governmental and regulatory policy decisions.",

This was due primarily to the impact of Covid-19 on Consumer and our enterprise units, ongoing legacy product declines and divestments, but was partially offset by higher equipment revenue and Openreach bases in fibre and Ethernet.\n\nReported profit before tax was \u00a31,804m, down 23% primarily reflecting the decline in adjusted a EBITDA.\n\nAdjusted a EBITDA of \u00a37,415m was down 6%. This was primarily due to the fall in revenue, special frontline bonus, increased service costs and continued investment in copperto-fibre migrations and our full fibre base, partly offset by sports rights rebates and cost savings including our modernisation programme, tight cost control and Covid-19 mitigation actions.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe continue to expect adjusted\u00aa EBITDA of at least \u00a37.9bn in 2022/23, with sustainable growth from this point forward.\n\nFor 2021/22 we expect adjusted b revenue to be broadly flat year on year, dependent on the speed of Covid-19 recovery. We expect to deliver adjusted\u00aa EBITDA between \u00a37.5bn and \u00a37.7bn, benefiting from a Covid-19 recovery, price indexation in Openreach and our retail businesses, and continued cost transformation, more than offsetting legacy declines and normal inflation in our cost base.\n\nWe intend to capitalise on Openreach's build capability, a positive spectrum auction outcome and the expected\n\nbenefit from the Government's tax super-deduction which is likely to reduce our UK tax payable to zero over the next two years. We are therefore utilising this to accelerate immediately our FTTP investment. As such we expect capital expenditure c to increase to around \u00a34.9bn in 2021/22. We expect normalised free cash flow d to be between \u00a31.1bn-\u00a31.3bn with the increase in capital expenditure c relative to 2020/21 only partially offset by the increase in adjusted\u00aa EBITDA and the impact of the Government's tax super-deduction.\n\n## Dividend\n\nAs communicated in May 2020, the Board decided that it was appropriate to suspend all dividends for 2020/21 reflecting the need to create capacity for BT's value-enhancing investment opportunities, including our strategic intent for an accelerated FTTP build and our extensive transformation and modernisation programme, coupled with the shorter-term impact of Covid-19. The Board expects to resume dividend payments in 2021/22 at 7.7 pence per share with 30% payable at the interim stage.\n\nThe Board expects to continue with a progressive dividend policy from this re-based level for future years, and to declare two dividends per year with the interim dividend being fixed at 30% of the prior year's full year dividend. The Board believes that suspending and re-basing the dividend and then maintaining a progressive dividend policy is the right thing to do for the long-term future of BT and that the headroom generated by this decision is prudent given the Covid-19 pandemic, while the investments will create significant additional value for shareholders.\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief Financial Officer 12 May 2021\n\n- a  Adjusted EBITDA is stated before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures. and net non-interest related finance expense, as explained on page 198.\n- b  Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 197.\n- c  Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the period.\n- d  Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 199.\n- e  Outlook originally provided in July 2020 was updated in September 2020 to raise the lower end of the adjusted a EBITDA range from \u00a37.2bn to \u00a37.3bn, and again in February 2021 to raise the lower end of the normalised free cash flow range from \u00a31.2bn to \u00a31.3bn.\n- f   Net debt as defined on page 197.

The decline in revenue was also driven by ongoing legacy product declines and divestments in our enterprise businesses, but was partly offset by higher equipment revenue in Consumer and higher rental bases of fibre-enabled products and Ethernet in Openreach.\n\nYou can find details of revenue by customer-facing unit on pages 54 and 55. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements shows a full breakdown of revenue by all our major product and service categories.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nReported operating costs were down 4%, mainly driven by sports rights rebates and savings including our modernisation programme, tight cost control and Covid-19 mitigation actions. This was partly offset by increased service costs in Openreach,\n\na special bonus for frontline colleagues, and continued investment in copper-to-fibre migrations and our full fibre base in Consumer.\n\nIn May 2020 we announced the next phase of our transformation focused on simplifying our product portfolio, simplifying and automating our customer journeys, moving to a modern, modular IT architecture, and migrating customers from our legacy networks to our modern FTTP and 5G networks.\n\nWe delivered gross annualised savings of \u00a3764m in the first year of the modernisation programme with an associated cost of \u00a3438m, against the three-year target of \u00a31bn savings at a \u00a3900m cost and a five-year target of \u00a32bn savings at a \u00a31.3bn cost. The cost savings were delivered through simplification and automation of processes, operational productivity improvement programmes, enhanced procurement supported by digital tools, rigorous functional cost control, and Covid-19 mitigating actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- You can read more about how we're modernising our business on pages 22 and 23 .\n\nNote 6 to the consolidated financial statements shows a detailed breakdown of our operating costs.\n\n## Adjusted c EBITDA\n\nAdjusted c EBITDA of \u00a37,415m was down 6%, mainly driven by the fall in revenue and increased costs as described above. You can find details of adjusted c EBITDA by customer-facing unit on pages 54 and 55.\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nReported profit before tax of \u00a31,804m was down 23%, primarily reflecting the decline in adjusted c EBITDA.\n\n## Specific items\n\nAs we explain on page 197, we separately identify and disclose those items that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. We call these specific items. Specific items are used to derive the adjusted results as presented in the consolidated income statement.

The components are regulatory charges of \u00a335m (2019/20: release of \u00a372m), restructuring costs of \u00a3421m (2019/20: \u00a3322m), the settlement with Dixons Carphone of \u00a3149m (2019/20: \u00a3nil), property rationalisation costs of \u00a319m (2019/20: gains of \u00a3131m reflecting the gain on sale of BT Centre) and interest expense on pensions of \u00a318m (2019/20: \u00a3145m); offset by sale of spectrum of \u00a366m (2019/20: \u00a3nil), a net divestment-related items credit of \u00a360m (2019/20: loss of \u00a3199m), Covid-19-related items credit of \u00a317m (2019/20: charge of \u00a395m) and a tax credit on specific items of \u00a396m (2019/20: charge of \u00a383m).\n\nNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements shows the details of all revenues and costs that we have treated as specific items.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur effective tax rate was 18.4% (2019/20: 26.3%) on reported profit and 18.6% (2019/20: 18.7%) on profit before specific items. We paid income taxes globally of \u00a3288m (2019/20: \u00a3210m).\n\nWe paid UK corporation tax of \u00a3229m (2019/20: \u00a3147m). We benefited \u00a3181m from tax deductions on employees' pension schemes (2019/20: \u00a3434m).\n\nOur tax expense recognised in the income statement before specific items was \u00a3428m (2019/20: \u00a3536m). We also recognised a \u00a31,051m tax credit (2019/20: \u00a3892m tax charge) in the statement of comprehensive income, mainly relating to our pension scheme.\n\nWe expect our sustainable income statement effective tax rate before specific items to be around the UK rate of corporation tax, as we do most of our business in the UK.\n\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements shows further details of our tax expense, along with our key tax risks.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nReported earnings per share was 14.8p, down 2.7p, while adjusted a earnings per share fell 4.6p to 18.9p.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nWe continue to invest in existing and new technologies to underpin our strategy of building the strongest foundations with the best converged network.\n\nCapital expenditure was \u00a34,216m (2019/20: \u00a33,960m). Network investment was \u00a32,318m, up 12%. This was driven by higher fixed network, mobile network and equipment spend, reflecting continued investment in FTTP deployment and the mobile network. Other capital expenditure components were largely flat with \u00a3984m spent on customer-driven investments, \u00a3765m on systems and IT, and \u00a3149m spent on non-network infrastructure.\n\nCapital expenditure contracted but not yet spent was \u00a31,365m at 31 March 2021 (2019/20: \u00a31,234m).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash inflow from operating activities was down 5% to \u00a35,963m, mainly driven by reduced operating profit partly offset by a reduction in pension deficit payments. Normalised free cash flow d was down 27% to \u00a31,459m due to reduced EBITDA, higher lease payments, cash capital expenditure and adverse working capital; offset by a cash receipt from the monetisation of a non-strategic revenue stream generated from our building infrastructure and the timing of tax payments.\n\nThe net cash cost of specific items adjusted from normalised free cash flow d was \u00a3390m (2019/20: \u00a3112m), primarily relating to restructuring payments of \u00a3428m (2019/20: \u00a3350m) and regulatory payments of \u00a311m (2019/20: \u00a339m). The prior year benefited from one-off cash inflows relating to \u00a3210m income on disposal of BT Centre and \u00a387m annual licence fee refund from Ofcom.

Net of deferred tax, the deficit has increased from \u00a31.0bn to \u00a34.2bn.\n\nThe increase in the gross deficit of \u00a34.0bn since 31 March 2020 mainly reflects a fall in the real discount rate, partly offset by \u00a31bn of deficit contributions paid over the period, lower assumed future life expectancies and positive asset returns.\n\nThe movements in the deficit for the group's defined benefit plans are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) funding valuation and future funding obligations\n\nBT and the Trustee of the BTPS have reached agreement on the 2020 triennial funding valuation and recovery plan. The funding deficit at 30 June 2020 is \u00a37.98bn, compared to a deficit of \u00a311.30bn at 30 June 2017. The key drivers for the reduction are \u00a34.5bn of deficit contributions and lower assumed future life expectancies, partly offset by an initial allowance for the impact of the reform of RPI. Due to hedging implemented by the Scheme in recent years, the fall in real interest rates over the period had limited impact on the deficit.\n\nThe deficit will be met as follows:\n\n- -  \u00a32bn of deficit met through an asset backed funding arrangement over 13 years with annual cash payments of \u00a3180m pa, secured against the EE business\n- -  The balance being met over the existing 10 year period with annual cash contributions reducing from \u00a3900m initially to \u00a3600m from 1 July 2024.\n\nA new 'stabiliser' mechanism has been agreed that reduces the risk of future trapped surplus and provides more certainty that the BTPS will achieve its path to full funding by clarifying how future increased deficits would be funded.\n\nNote 20 to the consolidated financial statements gives more information on our pension arrangements.\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt a\n\nNet financial debt\u00aa (which excludes lease liabilities) at 31 March 2021 was \u00a311.7bn, \u00a30.3bn higher than at 31 March 2020, with net capital expenditure, net interest payments and payment of lease liabilities offsetting net cash inflow from operating activities and net proceeds from disposal of subsidiaries.\n\nNet debt a (which includes lease liabilities) was \u00a317.8bn at 31 March 2021, \u00a30.2bn lower than at 31 March 2020 (\u00a318.0bn).

There has been pressure on mobile revenue through reduced roaming and out of bundle usage, reduced prepaid activity and increased SIM-only mix diluting postpaid ARPC; which were partially offset by higher equipment revenue driven by increased direct volumes and a higher mix of premium handsets. Fixed revenue declined due to lower out of contract price rises and copper price reductions to address back book pricing, combined with a continued decline of our voice only customer base and call volumes.\n\nEBITDA b declined due to lower revenue, continued customer investment in both copper-to-fibre migrations and the growth of our full fibre base, along with the bonus provided to our frontline staff. This has been partially offset by sports rights rebates, improved mobile margin with lower indirect commissions, increased equipment margin and tight cost management throughout the year.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation was flat year on year. Capital expenditure was up due to higher network and equipment investment.\n\nNormalised free cash flow c declined due to lower EBITDA b and higher capital expenditure.\n\nBroadband churn has improved year on year by 0.1ppts to 1.1% due to significant investment in customer experience. Postpaid churn has improved year on year by 0.2ppts to 1.0%.\n\nOur full fibre and 5G bases, award-winning mobile network, low churn, growing customer base on index-linked contracts, strong NPS and continued converged growth with Halo 3+, provide us with strong foundations for the future. This is further strengthened by the Government's roadmap to lift Covid-19 restrictions, the re-opening of our retail stores, the planned full re-opening of pubs & clubs and the possibility of a return to foreign travel.\n\n## Enterprise\n\n| Year ended 31 March          | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020 d \u00a3m   | Change   \u00a3m   | Change   %   |\n|------------------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Adjusted a  revenue          | 5,449      | 5,952       | (503)         | (8)          |\n| Adjusted a  operating costs  | 3,745      | 4,017       | (272)         | (7)          |\n| Adjusted b  EBITDA           | 1,704      | 1,935       | (231)         | (12)         |\n| Depreciation & amortisation  | 740        | 712         | 28            | 4            |\n| Adjusted a  operating profit | 964        | 1,223       | (259)         | (21)         |\n| Capital expenditure          | 492        | 496         | (4)           | (1)          |\n| Normalised free cash flow c  | 1,352      | 1,363       | (11)          | (1)          |\n\nAdjusted a revenue\n\n\u00a35,449m (8)%\n\nAdjusted a operating profit\n\n\u00a3964m (21)%\n\nRevenue a declined due to continued declines in legacy products, in particular traditional fixed voice volumes and usage, the ongoing impact of Covid-19 and divestments. Fixed voice revenue declined by 13% with a decline in traditional voice lines partly offset by continued growth in VoIP seats.\n\nMobile revenue declined primarily due to lower roaming and out of bundle usage in retail mobile, offsetting a 4% increase in our retail customer base. The fall in retail revenue was partly offset by an increase in wholesale mobile revenue reflecting a higher average MVNO base. Excluding divestments in the prior year, revenue was down 7%.\n\nOperating costs a declined by 7%, primarily reflecting the decline in revenue and our cost transformation programmes, partially offset by investment to support our growth areas. The decline in EBITDA b was mainly a result of the declines in legacy products and Covid-19, partly offset by cost savings from our transformation programme. Excluding divestments in the prior year, EBITDA b was down 11%.\n\nCapital expenditure decreased by 1%. Normalised free cash flow c decreased 1%, with the fall in EBITDA b partially offset by the benefit generated from the monetisation of a non-strategic revenue stream generated from our buildings infrastructure.\n\nRetail order intake fell 27% to \u00a32.6bn and wholesale order intake fell 27% to \u00a30.9bn for the year. The declines in both retail and wholesale orders are largely due to major contract extensions in the prior year.\n\nDespite extension of financial support for businesses in the latest Government budget, we expect Covid-19 to continue to have an impact going into 2021/22, particularly on our direct and indirect SME customers.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## A letter from the Chair of Openreach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo say this has been a challenging year would be an understatement. The pandemic has dominated the last 12 months. We've all learned more than we ever expected about viruses, vaccines, social distancing and how best to wash our hands.\n\nUnsurprisingly Covid-19 affected our working lives too, and we certainly saw that here at Openreach.\n\n## Keeping the UK connected\n\nIn March 2020, millions of us switched to working and schooling from home and our engineers were given key worker status, meaning they could keep building and maintaining our network.\n\nFrom connecting the health service, to schools and critical infrastructure, we also maintained links between loved ones and made sure people could continue to work from home and keep the country going.\n\nUK broadband use more than doubled from 22,000 petabytes in 2019 to 50,000 petabytes in 2020 as people relied on digital connections more than ever.\n\nOur priority was keeping our colleagues and customers safe and we swiftly reengineered processes so we could work safely and keep the country connected.\n\nAnd of course, we can't ignore the impact of Brexit. In any other year, such a seismic shift would've dominated our thoughts and actions, but we didn't let it derail progress. And now our focus shifts to the future.\n\n## Building back better\n\nDespite everything, we sped up our full fibre build this year, reaching one million homes and businesses in just over six months. This was - and will continue to be - instrumental in maintaining a strong and sustainable business for our shareholder BT, Openreach colleagues and customers. Even in a year like no other.\n\nWe're now making our fastest, most reliable broadband technology available to another home or business every 14 seconds and recently reached 4.6m premises.\n\nOur build includes millions of homes in the country's toughest-to-reach areas as we do everything we can to connect rural communities.\n\nWe're in a strong position to build back better, supporting the wider economy as well as our shareholder, customers and the UK, to help the nation recover.\n\n## Supercharging the recovery\n\n'Building back better' sounds good. But as we take stock of what the UK needs to bounce back strongly, we have to deliver substance.\n\nAt Openreach, we know that full fibre broadband has a huge role to play in the recovery, and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) has reinforced that.\n\nIn its recent updated study, Cebr highlights how better broadband can be a massive platform for economic growth, social cohesion and positive environmental change. It could deliver a \u00a359bn boost to UK productivity by 2025 and help an extra 400,000 people live and work where they choose, stimulating regional and rural economic growth.\n\nThe Government wants at least 85% of the UK to have gigabit capable broadband in the same timeframe. But getting as close to 100% as possible has to be the aim - and we're passionate about doing our bit.\n\n## Building back greener\n\nBased on Cebr's research, nationwide full fibre broadband could save 300m commuting trips each year, with three billion fewer kilometres travelled by car and 360,000 fewer tonnes of carbon emissions. That's a terrific dividend. But our focus on sustainability doesn't end with the network.\n\nWith more than 28,000 vehicles, Openreach operates the UK's second largest commercial van fleet. Our engineers travel more than 220m miles a year - producing more than 95,000 tonnes of CO2.\n\nWe have to tackle this. So we're aiming to switch a third of the fleet to electric or zero emissions by the middle of this decade and want to be all-electric or zero emissions by 2030.\n\n## Continued progress on service\n\nOver the last four years we've been recognised for making huge strides in delivering a better customer experience, but 2020 was an unusual year. Despite completing record volumes of provisions and fixes, we couldn't maintain every Minimum Service Level set for us by Ofcom.\n\nHowever, the regulator has recognised the impact of the pandemic and it won't be taking enforcement action as long as we keep doing the right thing for our customers.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe're a \u00a35bn revenue business, employing more than 35,000 colleagues across the UK, and I'm proud to say this year we bucked the economic trend by creating 5,300 new engineering jobs across Openreach and our supply chain.\n\nI am encouraged by Ofcom's final statement in its WFTMR, which establishes the regulatory framework for the next five years. The regulator's emphasis on investment and its recognition of the need to create a regulatory environment encouraging the renewal of our country's access network across all four nations is very welcome.\n\nAs we work to speed up adoption, we know that educating people about the benefits of full fibre will be key to the success of this new network. We're working closely with communications providers to raise awareness, stimulate demand and make sure upgrades are smooth and affordable.\n\nWe're pressing on with building full fibre at pace. We're increasing and accelerating our build from 20m to 25m homes and businesses by December 2026. We believe we can ramp our build up to 4m premises a year - going harder and faster than previously thought possible, whilst doing everything we can to build fairly across the whole of the UK. It's the right thing for our business, our shareholder, our colleagues, and our customers.\n\n## Mike McTighe\n\nChair, Openreach 12 May 2021",

It also lets us think smarter about risk while running our business with operational discipline.\n\n## Our risk management framework\n\nThis year, we operated an enhanced risk management framework to support us on our journey to be the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.\n\nThe framework gives us extra confidence to tackle risks and uncertainties that crop up - as we execute our strategy, transforming and modernising the business to deliver on our ambition.\n\n## How the framework helps us achieve our ambition\n\nThe framework strengthens our foundations and helps our leaders make smarter choices. Both things are vital to help building trust among colleagues, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Being smart with risk\n\nThe framework identifies key attributes of a 'risk-smart' culture: individual mindset, attitude to risk and the right behaviours.\n\nThese attributes, in combination with having a robust risk process, help us make the right risk decisions, knowing which risks to take and having the courage to take them.\n\n## Operational discipline\n\nThe framework helps us set simple and clear requirements through our policy landscape, key controls and assurance activities which result in smoother operations through an enhanced control environment.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how our framework supports us in delivering our strategy and achieving our ambition by putting these elements into action.\n\n## How we identify and assess risks\n\n## Group risk categories\n\nWe define our risk landscape through areas of enduring risk called group risk categories. They are not intended to contain the whole risk universe, just the parts we think are most relevant to BT.\n\nFor each category, we define the level of risk we're willing to take (our risk appetite) through a number of metrics; and we describe the rules we've set to manage it (policies, standards and controls).\n\nWe apply our framework to constantly reassess, monitor, manage and report on the main risks to our strategy.\n\n## Risk and discipline underpin the key parts of our strategy allowing us to achieve our ambition to become the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Point risks\n\nSome risks aren't always adequately covered by the set of rules in place; or by the ways we normally set our risk appetite.\n\nThey might need extra focus at the moment because they're unusual, changing rapidly, or currently have a potentially significant impact.\n\nWe call these point risks and we put extra management focus on them.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nOther risks might be more like uncertainties - not yet fully formed into specific risks. That makes them particularly difficult to quantify or make specific plans for.\n\nThese are emerging risks. We use ongoing monitoring to spot the triggers that could crystallise these uncertainties and turn them into specific risks.\n\nThe diagram on the next page illustrates how the different components of our framework come together.",

They set out how we measure our exposure to that risk, how we manage it (including setting the right policies and controls) and ensure that we take the actions necessary to achieve and maintain our target risk appetite and level of control. Point and emerging risks relating to each category are continuously reviewed and managed.\n\nEach of our business units also reviews, on a periodic basis, its exposure in all these categories and the point and emerging risks that might affect its performance.\n\nOur governance structures ensure that different oversight bodies and leadership teams get the right level of information on our risk exposures and how we're managing them. This promotes robust discussion and prioritisation, the right monitoring, and better decision-making.\n\n## How risk links to strategy\n\nOn the previous page we show how risk and discipline underpin our strategy, which includes building the strongest foundations, creating standout customer experiences and leading the way to a bright sustainable future.\n\nTo achieve each of the 'pillars', we need to manage risks, operate with discipline and make smart choices in all of our group risk categories. Some categories contribute more strongly to particular pillars than others.\n\nFor example, we need to manage cyber security and service interruption risks in building the strongest foundations; we need to manage risks related to customer service and major contracts in delivering standout customer experiences; and we need to manage risks associated with strategy, technology and competition to lead the way to a bright sustainable future.\n\nWe cover our full risk landscape in detail over the next pages, including how each group risk category could affect our strategy and/or business model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- You can find out more about our strategy on page 19 , and our business model on pages 12 to 13 .\n\n## Our framework explained\n\nWe classify our group risk categories in four ways according to the type of risk they represent: strategic, financial, compliance and operational.\n\nWe also identify and manage point and emerging risks within each of these categories and across categories.\n\nSome risks or risk themes are high-profile topics that cut across different categories and warrant central coordination and oversight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo of our risk themes are currently widely represented across the group risk categories:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe pandemic is having, and will continue to have, a big impact across our entire risk landscape. Responding to the effects of Covid-19 has become part of our day-to-day operations and that response is overseen by an Executive Committee level steering group. However, there's still huge uncertainty in terms of the timing, extent and length of national or regional lockdowns and their impact on our operations, colleagues and customers.\n\nCovid-19 has reinforced how critical our networks are. They supported large-scale switches to home working. And they've allowed us to give extra communications support to UK central government and the devolved administrations in their pandemic response activities.\n\n## Brexit\n\nThe UK and EU agreed a trade deal which came into force on 1 January 2021 and established a new trading relationship. We've been planning for Brexit for four years and the outcome of the trade deal negotiations hasn't had any operational impact on BT services. Our movement of goods, people, data and services are operating normally.\n\nWe're monitoring developments on both sides to measure any potential impacts.",

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nWe're committed to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). They're a big step towards a net zero carbon economy and will help manage the future impact of climate change on BT. This is our second year of disclosure aligned to TCFD recommendations.\n\n## Climate change governance\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for how we identify and manage climate-related risks, delegated to the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee which oversees our climate change strategy, programme and goals, chaired by non-executive director Leena Nair.\n\nThe Executive Committee sets operational strategy on climate change and sustainability and monitors the associated risks, supported by our digital impact and sustainability team.\n\nOur Environmental Management Governance Group manages day-today climate-related compliance and risk issues on behalf of the Executive Committee , reporting back regularly.\n\nThis year, we commissioned an independent review based on the World Economic Forum's Principles for effective climate governance on corporate boards. We got high 'maturity ratings' across four of the eight principles, with useful improvement plans laid out for the other four (which got moderate to good ratings). The review helped us set our internal governance priorities, including integrating climate change better within our risk management framework.\n\nFive percent of the annual bonus available to eligible managers, including executive directors, is linked to our target of cutting the carbon emissions intensity of our operations by 87% by the end of March 2031.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more on our climate strategy, see pages 32 to 33 .\n\n## Climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## Identifying the risks\n\nWe identify all risks, including those around climate change, within our risk management framework. Last year\n\nwe reviewed the climate-related risks around transitioning to a lower-carbon economy, and the physical impacts of climate change by using TCFD's different reference scenarios.\n\nWe've taken steps to consider climate change risks and opportunities across the whole group and reflect them in our group risk categories. Risk owners are getting training to improve their awareness of the issues. We're also developing a process to review climate change risks as a whole across all risk categories as we continue to implement the TCFD recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more on our risk management framework on pages 57 to 58 .\n\n## Analysing scenarios\n\nThis year, we continued analysing scenarios to understand the potential financial impact of climate change to BT in 2030 and 2050. Impacts were considered under a range of scenarios reflecting different rises in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's shared socioeconomic pathways (which look at how various climate policies influence greenhouse gas emissions) and transition scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System, also helped inform our analyses.\n\nWe've used a core scenario (2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C) that we think is most likely, and then reviewed more extreme 'what if?' transition and physical scenarios (1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C).\n\n## Responding to our main physical risks\n\nFlooding: Longer term, our full fibre rollout will mean fewer physical network sites, cutting our overall exposure to physical climate change risks. We've analysed possible risks from large-scale flooding at 150 business critical sites. In the scenarios we explored, the potential financial impacts aren't material - partly because of the flood defence work we've already done in 19 high-risk locations. We expect our flood defence programme to cost around \u00a36m once we complete it next year. In 2021 we'll continue our flood analysis and consider the potential effects of weatherrelated repairs across our UK estate.\n\nHeat: In most scenarios in 2030 and 2050, the UK will see a rise in extreme heat days. The risk of these days damaging our network sites is very low - largely because of cooling system upgrades in our metronode sites which are effective up to a 45\u00b0C external temperature. Once complete, we expect the upgrades program to cost us \u00a3119m. So higher temperatures should not have a material impact on repair or cooling costs.\n\nOutside the UK, extreme weather could affect our customers and disrupt service, as well as affecting colleagues in key operational sites. In particular, our India sites are already being affected by extreme heat, set to increase in future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur supply chain reaches nearly 100 different countries. But a significant proportion of raw materials for our products are concentrated in China where flood risks are predicted to increase under future warming scenarios. This is a shared concern across our sector - however we'll keep monitoring our supply chain risks and work to minimise them.\n\n## Managing transition risks and reaching net zero\n\nWe've promised to become a net zero carbon emissions business a by 2045. This year, we extended the scope to include our supply chain as well as our operations. This reduces the potential impact of transition risks. There are details of our strategy for achieving that target on pages 32 to 33. This section focuses on how the different elements of that strategy affect transition risks.\n\n100% renewable electricity: All the electricity we use worldwide is renewable b . Under the scenarios we've considered, we know there are risks from potential gaps in UK renewable electricity supply. We'll keep monitoring this.\n\nMoving to a low carbon fleet: We're committed to switching as much of our fleet as we can to run on electric and alternative fuels by 2030. This largely cuts any risks around policies designed to reduce vehicle carbon emissions.\n\nDecarbonising our buildings: This year, we invested nearly \u00a321m in energy efficiency projects, contributing to a global energy reduction of 123 GWh. This, together with our commitment to renewables, minimises any transition risks around carbon pricing.\n\nHelping suppliers cut carbon: If our suppliers fail to cut their emissions, it could lead to carbon costs being passed on by 2030 under a 2\u00b0C scenario. That risk applies to our whole sector. To respond, we want to cut supply chain emissions by 42% by the end of March 2031 (compared to 2016/17 levels) and to reach net zero by 2045. We'll keep monitoring possible carbon pricing risks, tracking how they might be affected by the growing number of net zero commitments and China's plans for carbon neutrality (where many of our raw material suppliers are based).\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Performance on our climate targets and emissions reporting can be found in our tackling climate change and environmental challenges section on pages 32 to 33 .\n- a  Measures for scopes 1, 2 and supply chain greenhouse gas emissions.\n- b  99.9% is renewable - the remaining 0.1% represents markets where renewable electricity isn't available (eight countries).",

The Board has chosen to conduct its review for a period of three years to 31 March 2024. It believes this is an appropriate timeframe as it aligns with the primary focus of our business planning and the time cycles shared by some of our major internal and external risks and uncertainties, for example the pension scheme funding valuation and the interval between significant sports rights auctions. We are reviewing the focus of our planning period to determine if we are able to make this statement over a longer five year period in future years, as our business and financial planning already takes into account our longerterm obligations.\n\nThe assessment of viability is based on our medium term plan which forecasts the group's profitability, cash flows and funding requirements, and is approved by the Board at the end of each year. The medium term plan is built from bottom-up forecasts of each of our customer-facing units, supplemented by items managed at a group level and assumptions such as macroeconomic activity and exchange rates. The performance of the group and our customer-facing units against these forecasts is monitored monthly and this is supplemented each quarter through a series of quarterly business reviews of each business unit conducted by the chief executive and chief financial officer.\n\nBeyond our medium term plan horizon, the group also makes investments that have business cases covering a longer time period, such as our network investments. Significant capital expenditure investment cases are approved by the chief executive and, where appropriate, the Board, after taking into account longer-term risks and opportunities such as the economy, technology and regulation.\n\nIn support of our viability statement we've stress tested our forecast cash flows by assessing the impacts our principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 59 to 66, could have on our forecasts. In this assessment we've adopted a number of assumptions designed to stress test our resilience, in particular, we have not automatically assumed that, should the need arise, we would be able to raise new debt; we have instead considered this as part of any mitigating action.\n\n## Our assessment considered the following:\n\n## Individual risks\n\nWhat: the potential financial impact of severe but plausible scenarios quantified for each of our principal risks and uncertainties\n\nWhy: to test viability under any individual risk and uncertainty\n\nHow: we produced a scenario for each of our principle risks and uncertainties, including a Covid-19 scenario assuming another nationwide lockdown\n\nOutcome: our stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with a buffer against the impact of any individual risk\n\n## Combined risks\n\nWhat: a combination of the full financial impact of individual scenarios materialising simultaneously\n\nWhy: to test viability should a combination of multiple risks materialise in parallel\n\nHow: we have combined a number of risks including another lockdown due to Covid-19, a revaluation of the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) and enforcement action from Ofcom. We have also assumed that industrial action takes place and a scenario where we are unable to prevent a cyber attack which leads to a class action due to loss of customer data\n\nOutcome: in this most extreme combined scenario we would need to take further action to mitigate the negative cash flow impact and ensure additional liquidity\n\nMitigations: should we be able to raise new debt in line with our normal treasury\n\nfunding policies we would fully mitigate any downside. If this was not possible other actions management could take include limiting or delaying discretionary capital expenditure and marketing activities, and/or not reintroducing dividend payments. A reasonable combination of these actions would also fully mitigate any downside\n\n## Probabilistic risk modelling\n\nWhat: a model estimating the impacts of the individual severe but plausible scenarios\n\nWhy: a test of viability under multiple occurrences of severe scenarios\n\nHow: we have modelled a probabilistic analysis of the potential financial impact of each individual risk if they materialise together with their likelihood of occurrence using a Monte Carlo simulation\n\nOutcome: in extreme probabilistic modelled scenarios we would need to take further action to mitigate the negative cash flow impact and ensure additional liquidity\n\nMitigations: should we be able to raise new debt in line with our normal treasury funding policies we would fully mitigate any downside. If this was not possible other actions management could take include limiting or delaying discretionary capital expenditure and marketing activities, and/or not reintroducing dividend payments. A reasonable combination of these actions would also fully mitigate any downside\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.",

Central to this is ensuring that the various services BT provides continue to keep everyone connected. We also considered the macroeconomic environment and related uncertainties.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I took the decision to retire as chairman from the BT Board in March. After 17 years of demanding roles as chairman of significant FTSE companies, I know the time is now right for me to step down and focus on other interests. Until I hand over to my successor, I remain fully committed to BT and helping Philip continue to deliver for all our stakeholders.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to lead a Board that believes that strong corporate governance is critical to how we make decisions and providing oversight in order to generate long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders, including investors, colleagues, customers, the regulators, the Government and the communities in which we operate. Central to the delivery of our strategy is the group's culture, underpinned by the values and behaviours expected of our colleagues. This corporate governance report for the year ended 31 March 2021 sets out our approach to governance and how it supports our strategy, the Board and its committees' key focus areas during the year and the decisions we have made in line with the group's new purpose, we connect for good, whilst considering the interests of our stakeholders as well as our contribution to society as a national champion.\n\n## Changes to the leadership\n\nThe Board welcomed two new nonexecutive directors during the year, Adel Al-Saleh and Sara Weller, with Sir Ian Cheshire joining the Board in March 2020. All three directors have added\n\nto the breadth of experience, skills and diversity of the Board. Together, they bring knowledge and experience in retail, fast moving consumer goods, financial services and eCommerce both in the UK and internationally, as well as within the telecommunications sector.\n\nAs recently announced, Mike Inglis will cease being a non-executive director at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. I'd like to thank Mike for his contribution to BT and the Board. As stated in last year's Annual Report, Tim H\u00f6ttges stepped down from the Board on 15 May 2020 and Nick Rose stepped down at the conclusion of the 2020 AGM. There were also a number of changes to the membership and chairmanships of each of the committees and to the role of senior independent director. Through the Nominations Committee, we have continued to review the composition of the Board to ensure we have the right balance of skills, independence, experience and diversity in line with the current and future needs of the group.\n\nThe search for my successor, led by Iain Conn as the senior independent director, is underway. Further to the announcement that Mike Inglis will step down and the external Board evaluation, we believe the Board requires more technology expertise. We have decided to wait until a successor is identified before making any future non-executive director appointments to ensure the Board's skills as a whole are reviewed with the new chairman in role. As part of reviewing the leadership of the business, the Nominations Committee considered a number of changes to the Executive Committee (see page 80). These changes have sought to further strengthen our senior leadership, bringing the fresh perspective required for the future longterm growth of our business.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Board continues to recognise the importance of diversity within our organisation. I am pleased to report that female directors continue to make up 33% of our Board with Isabel Hudson and Leena Nair chairing two of our committees, and Isabel acting as our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement. We have two directors from an ethnic minority background on our Board exceeding the Parker Review recommendation. I am pleased that our Executive Committee also currently comprises 33% female\n\nmembers and one member from an ethnic minority background.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nEngagement with our key stakeholders was vital this year given the pandemic. The existing mechanisms for feedback to the Board concerning engagement both within the group and between the group and its stakeholders have proved effective, ensuring the continuous flow of information between the Board, senior management and the wider workforce throughout the pandemic, despite much of this taking place virtually. Details of the engagement undertaken during the year and its impact on the Board's decisionmaking can be found on pages 34 and 76 and in our Section 172 statement on pages 42 to 43.\n\nThe Colleague Board , established at the start of 2020, has strengthened the voice of our colleagues at board-level and given the Board valuable insights into colleague sentiment, with Isabel Hudson reporting back to the Board on key discussions and feedback from the members (see pages 35 to 36). Reflecting on its first year, we continue to believe that this is the right mechanism for BT.\n\nDuring the year, in order to enhance BT's commitment to protecting the interests of consumers and promoting a culture of consumer fairness, the Board decided to delegate board-level oversight of consumer fairness to the BT Compliance Committee from 1 April 2021 (see page 86).\n\n## Evaluation\n\nClare Chalmers Limited undertook our externally facilitated Board and committee evaluation this year. Overall, the evaluation acknowledged the benefit of the Board comprising a highly experienced group of non-executive directors with a strong skillset, a diverse range of viewpoints, an environment of healthy challenge and an appreciation of the stakeholder context in which BT sits. Further details about the process and the proposed focus areas for 2021/22 can be found on page 79.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Board members and the executive team for their ongoing support and the commitment of our entire workforce during this exceptional year.\n\nJan du Plessis Chairman 12 May 2021",

These are set out in the matters reserved to the Board and available on our website bt.com/governance\n\n## Board activities in 2020/21\n\nBelow are some of the matters that the Board focused on during the year, which should be read in conjunction with our Section 172 statement on pages 42 to 43\n\n## Strategy and operations\n\n## Purpose and strategy\n\nThe Board and management discussed the new corporate narrative, which comprises our new purpose (we connect for good), our new ambition (to be the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines), our reaffirmed values (personal, simple, brilliant) and the refreshed three strategic pillars of our strategy, and related KPIs. These were also discussed with senior colleagues and the Colleague Board for their feedback. The Board also considered how to embed the new corporate narrative into the organisation's culture and into our decision-making. Our new corporate narrative and strategy is used by the Board and management to align our actions and priorities and consider the interests of all our stakeholders. This year, in particular, we brought our purpose to life for the benefit of our stakeholders with the support we offered during the pandemic (see pages 28 to 29). BT continued to invest in our networks, our modernisation programme and our portfolio of solutions to deliver for our customers, in recognition of the ever increasing need for improved connectivity.\n\nThe Board discussed the group's strategy in detail with the customer-facing unit CEOs and chief technology officer at two full-day strategy meetings. These sessions considered longterm growth opportunities, strategic priorities and how these are built into the group's medium term plan, progress on key initiatives, the key challenges to achieving our priorities and the material risks to delivering them and plans to address or mitigate these. The Board also spent time considering Covid-19 as part of updates at Board meetings including the group's operational resilience given the impact of the pandemic on the different parts of the group, as well as discussing the strategic implications and potential value creation opportunities.\n\n## Transformation and modernisation\n\nThe Board received regular updates on the progress of BT's transformation and simplification programme particularly in the context of Covid-19 to drive pan-BT efficiencies, opportunities, continued cost reduction and consideration of reskilling our colleagues and new skills needed in line with the future needs of the business. There was a specific focus on BT's IT strategy and the need to drive digital transformation through the creation of the new Digital unit.",

Updates from the chief executive on key business operations through the year have focused on a range of stakeholder interests, including matters which are key to the group's reputation and being a national champion, as well as colleague considerations and support for our customers, suppliers and communities.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nThe Board and each of its committees always have regard to wider stakeholder interests beyond those of our shareholders as part of discussions and decision-making. Details of our engagement with our key stakeholders is set out from page 34.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the Audit & Risk Committee discussed our key stakeholder groups including their expectations, our engagement and the risks associated with managing these relationships as part of reviewing the group risk category report for this area. The committee considered engagement with our key stakeholder groups, in light of broader developments including in relation to Brexit, FTTP, rural connectivity and the growing consumer fairness agenda.\n\n## 5G spectrum auction\n\nThe Board was kept updated on the timing of Ofcom's recent spectrum auction. Further to the approval of the maximum spend, the Board discussed balancing the capex investment with the long-term benefits of securing additional spectrum. These benefits include boosting BT's 5G network leadership position and enabling BT to deliver improved customer experience, particularly indoor coverage in buildings and venues, and increasing our coverage overall. More details on the outcome of the spectrum auction can be found on page 17.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nThe Board received updates on customer experience throughout the year focusing on the improvements in Net Promoter Score (NPS), a KPI, against our overall ambition for customer experience. There were detailed discussions on the NPS of each customer-facing unit, customer segment and brand, as well as on the initiatives and customer insights which are being used to drive improvement for our customers. Further details on customer experience can be found on pages 26 to 29 and on how BT is living up to Ofcom's Fairness for Customers commitments on page 17.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nThe Board received updates regarding key suppliers from the chief executive. During the year, the Board discussed the Government's evolving advice on high-risk vendors (including\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuawei) and the development of both the Telecommunications (Security) Bill in the UK and US government restrictions, and the potential procurement and commercial implications for BT. The Board reviewed and approved the entering into of contracts with Nokia and Ericsson and the split of the services provided by these two vendors across our UK sites.\n\nResponsible procurement and technology were also examined by the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee with specific discussions with the procurement team on how we embed this into our processes and procedures as part of helping us to meet our ambition in this area.\n\n## Investigations and potential claims\n\nThe Board discussed any regulatory/competition investigations and litigation claims, including BT's response and the stakeholder and reputational impact of these. This included the challenges with the delivery of the broadband Universal Service Obligation and the class action in relation to standalone fixed voice services. More details on the broadband Universal Service Obligation can be found on page 16.\n\n## Finance and risk\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nAs set out in last year's report, in May 2020, having considered the various stakeholder interests, in particular the long-term interests of our shareholders and their likely reaction, the Board took the difficult but prudent decision to suspend the final dividend for 2019/20 and all dividends for 2020/21, and to re-base future dividends to a more sustainable level in 2021/22. This decision was made to create capacity for BT to invest in long-term, value-enhancing opportunities (see both our Section 172 statement on page 43 and Dividend (including our dividend policy) on page 49 for more details).\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe chief financial officer discussed with the Board at each scheduled meeting BT's financial and trading performance for the period against budget and consensus, and the full year outlook for the group as a whole and for each business unit, in particular focusing on the impact of Covid-19 and the actions being taken to mitigate its impact. The Board reviewed and approved the financial statements and trading updates at yearend, half year and at each quarter. It also discussed the feedback from investors further to the publication of each set of results.\n\nThe Board considered and approved the going concern and viability statements and reviewed and approved the group's tax strategy.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Board was updated throughout the year on ongoing discussions with the BT Pension Scheme Trustee on the triennial valuation as at 30 June 2020. The Board considered the possible range of valuation outcomes and different approaches to future contribution and investment strategy. The Board reviewed these outcomes in the context of our overall business objectives and both the current and expected future regulatory and legislative environment.\n\nIn May 2021, the Board provided its agreement to an overall valuation package including an asset backed funding arrangement based on EE Limited shares, arrangements giving potential for some return of any future surplus to BT with downside protection for the BT Pension Scheme and the extension of existing legal protections.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board discussed the new group risk management framework, which had been implemented during the year and comprises 15 group risk categories, and includes the point and emerging risks and uncertainties facing the group (including in",

The Board and the Audit & Risk Committee continued to deepen its understanding of the group's business and the risks and opportunities it faces with detailed reviews into the different group risk categories with the Board focusing on cyber, financing and people and also biannual reviews of the entire risk landscape. On behalf of the Board, the Audit & Risk Committee also undertook detailed reviews of BT's risk management and internal control systems and provided regular updates to the Board on these discussions (see page 82 onwards).\n\n## Medium term plan\n\nIn May 2021, the Board approved the medium term plan 2021. It discussed the current market position of BT and the main opportunities and challenges, as well as considering how the medium term plan aligns to our strategy and group KPIs. The Board also reviewed progress against our EBITDA guidance for 2023.\n\n## Investor perceptions, shareholder relations and consideration of analysts' reports\n\nThe Board received regular reports outlining share register movement, our share price performance relative to the market, investor relations activities and engagement with shareholders. The Board also discussed investor feedback from the meetings following our full and half year financial results and quarterly trading updates.\n\n## Brexit\n\nThe Board received updates on BT's readiness and the actions being taken to mitigate the impact of Brexit on our operations.\n\n## Colleagues\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board discussed the progress made against our people and cultural strategy in the context of a challenging year and any resulting changes to our ways of working in the short, medium and long term given the pandemic. We continue to believe that our offices will be critical to the way we work, and therefore have continued with progressing with our Better Workplace Programme but will maximise the lessons learned from remote working.\n\nAs discussed in the Purpose and strategy section above, the Board was updated on the launch of our new purpose and the reaffirmation of our values. The Board also looked at the communication of these and how these are being embedded in our culture through workforce policies and practices, for instance in relation to recruitment, reward and incentives and the performance of our colleagues. Our ambition remains to build a progressive and engaging culture, with the wellbeing of our colleagues at its centre. The Board monitored progress against this ambition throughout the year with detailed discussions on our people strategy with the HR director and her team. Further details on our culture, purpose and values can be found in the Strategic report on pages 10 and 18 to 33. The Board and its committees (as relevant) also continued to monitor key areas that we consider important indicators of BT's culture, such as health, safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, customer experience, employee relations and whistleblowing.\n\n## Health, safety and wellbeing\n\nThe Board was regularly updated on, and discussed, the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues across the business, including those in Openreach. Given the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board has been focused on the measures taken to support our colleagues and customers, including ensuring our workplaces and BT/EE retail shops are Covid-19 secure, that we have the necessary protection measures and PPE for our frontline colleagues and key workers, that wellbeing support is provided for all colleagues throughout these challenging times, with a particular focus on mental wellbeing, as well as the return to the workplace plans for those who have been able to work from home.\n\nTragically we suffered one fatality in 2020 involving one of our Openreach field engineers (see page 25). The Board continues to focus all its efforts on reducing the risks to our workforce and others affected by our activities.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nOur goal is to have a diverse workforce where inclusivity is valued and prioritised. The Board discussed with management the launch and progress of our Ethnicity Rapid Action Plan and the related commitments and the progress being made in this area as a whole. As described in our Section 172 statement on page 43, the Board discussed and was supportive of the proposed publication of diversity and inclusion targets and commitments, and the voluntary publication of our ethnicity pay gap, in our inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Report (which we expect to publish in early summer 2021). For more detail on our culture and our diversity and inclusion approach, see page 24.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nAs discussed on pages 35 to 36, the Colleague Board is the chosen method of engagement with the workforce under the Code and the Board is updated on the discussions from the formal Colleague Board meetings and any informal check-ins, by Isabel Hudson as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement and a Colleague Board member. The Board continues to feel that this is the right method for BT to obtain invaluable direct insight into the views of colleagues across the business.\n\nDirectors liaise with colleagues outside of Board and committee meetings to provide their own insights and perspectives on matters or to learn more about our colleagues' sentiments. The Board also discussed with HR and the chief executive other mechanisms and initiatives used to engage with our colleagues and feedback on these, including our Your Say colleague engagement survey and regular Covid-19 pulse surveys. See page 34 for more details on our colleague engagement mechanisms.\n\n## Employee relations\n\nThe Board and the Remuneration Committee discussed the updates on employee relations matters including aligning and simplifying BT's paid leaver and redundancy arrangements across the UK workforce and the impact of our transformation programmes on colleagues. The Board discussed the rationale for the changes, alongside the associated risks, and management's engagement with colleagues and the unions in relation to the proposals, including possible strike action.",

Shareholders were able to pre-register their questions ahead of the meeting, which were then answered by the chairman and chief executive. An audio recording of the questions and answers, together with that of the AGM itself and video messages from our chairman and chief executive, were all made available on our website.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor developments in UK Government guidance relating to the Covid-19 situation in planning the approach for the 2021 AGM, ensuring we balance the need to engage with our shareholders, investor expectations and guidance, with their health and safety and that of our colleagues, the Board and the communities in which we operate. Information on the arrangements for the 2021 AGM will be published in our Notice of meeting 2021.\n\n## Annual Report\n\nIn May 2021, the Board reviewed and approved the Annual Report on the recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee (see page 84), having considered that taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Board, committee and directors' evaluations\n\nDuring the year, we carried out an externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its committees. The details of this external evaluation can be found on page 79. The chairman also held individual discussions with each director to make sure they continue to contribute effectively and are committed to their roles. The senior independent director led the evaluation of the chairman's performance through individual discussions with each of the directors and sharing feedback at a meeting without the chairman. The non-executive directors reviewed the performance of the chief executive during the year. The Board also reviewed progress against the actions agreed as part of last year's internal Board and committee evaluation.\n\n## Committee terms of reference\n\nThe Board and each of its committees carried out an annual review of the terms of reference of each committee to ensure they continue to be fit for purpose and reflect best practice. Changes were made as appropriate and these can be found on our website bt.com/governance\n\n## Board composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## Board induction\n\nOn appointment, directors take part in a comprehensive, induction programme designed to give them a thorough overview and understanding of the business. This is tailored to take into account the director's previous experience, their responsibilities and, for each non-executive director, specific responsibilities relevant to their committee memberships. The programme includes meetings with the chairman, the chief executive, the senior independent director and the company secretary (or her delegate), as well as other members of the Board, Executive Committee and senior management. Directors also receive key information on our governance framework,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecent financial data and the policies supporting our business practices, including our Ethics Code. Directors are encouraged to visit our offices, contact centres and BT/EE retail shops, as well as spending a day with an Openreach engineer. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, we modified our induction meetings to be by video conference and non-executive directors appointed during 2020 were unable to visit any sites or offices. Once the restrictions ease in line with the Government roadmap, we will look to recommence these.\n\nIan Cheshire, Adel Al-Saleh and Sara Weller joined the Board as non-executive directors on 16 March 2020, 15 May 2020 and 16 July 2020 respectively. The details of Sara Weller's Board induction programme are set out on page 78.\n\n## Training and development\n\nThe chairman and the company secretary keep under review the training and development needs of directors. Non-executive directors meet with management, enhancing their understanding of the business through briefing sessions. We encourage all directors to keep their skills and knowledge up-to-date and to ask for any support they need. As part of ongoing development, the company secretary (or her delegate) briefs the Board at each meeting, and its committees as relevant, on any key legal, regulatory and corporate governance developments. During the year, these briefings included updates on the institutional investor guidelines, corporate reporting in relation to Covid-19 and environmental, social and governance considerations, the FRC's Company Reporting Expectations for 2020/21, the Hampton-Alexander Review 2021 and the guidance in relation to AGMs. Directors are updated as required on developments in the environment in which the business operates and internal and external advisers are invited to meetings to provide updates and discuss these as necessary. Each director may obtain independent professional advice at the company's expense as required. The Board and each committee are supported by the company secretary and her team and they are available to all directors to provide advice and support.\n\nWe encourage all directors to visit our sites and offices to meet our colleagues and broaden their understanding of the business and we usually also aim to have one Board offsite visit annually. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, this has not been possible in the last year.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOn accepting their appointment, directors must confirm they are able to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively.\n\nDirectors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and any committees of which they are members, as well as the AGM, and any Board offsites or away days. Directors are also expected to devote sufficient time to prepare for each meeting and to take part in at least one visit to one of our offices or other sites annually. Before accepting new external appointments, directors are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board.\n\nIan Cheshire's proposed appointment as chair of Spire Healthcare was considered by the Board in April 2021 in light of his other appointments and his role on the BT Board. Given that Ian would be stepping down as a non-executive director of Barclays in May 2021, it was concluded that becoming chair of Spire Healthcare would not be detrimental to his ability to perform his duties as a non-executive director of BT, and accordingly the Board gave its prior approval of Ian's appointment in line with the Code.",

Colleagues throughout BT have been both welcoming and generous in sharing their time and expertise with me so I can contribute to the Board across the full range of a very diverse agenda. I am, though, looking forward very much to the day when I can meet people face-to-face, and visit some of the locations where BT colleagues are based, to see first-hand their work to build out our network and to support our customers.\n\nSara joined the Board immediately before the AGM on 16 July 2020. Ahead of her appointment, Sara received an induction pack with key reference materials that provided a thorough understanding of BT, including our most recent financial results, and information on our business units, governance framework, director responsibilities, the Code, our ethical policies including our Ethics Code, and our Commitments. Sara met with the chairman, senior independent director and the chief executive in person in early 2020, before joining the Board. All other meetings to date have been held by video conference due to the Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nto their role. The Board also considered the continued independence of non-executive directors and the chairman as part of its consideration of the re-election of directors. The Board continues to consider all non-executive directors as being independent in line with the Code, with the exception of Deutsche Telekom's nominated representative. The chairman was judged to be independent at the time of his appointment.\n\n- Details of all directors' contracts or letters of appointment are in the Report on directors' remuneration on page 102 .\n\nSara also had a number of induction meetings before joining the Board, and received briefings from each Executive Committee member and had introductory meetings with each of the other non-executive directors.\n\nGiven Sara's membership on the Digital Impact & Sustainability and Audit & Risk Committees on her appointment to the Board, she attended other briefings with the key attendees including the director of digital impact & sustainability; KPMG, our external auditor; the director, group finance; and the director of risk, compliance & assurance.\n\nSara also identified key members of senior management to meet with, including the managing director BT security; our chief medical officer; managing director applied research and Adastral Park; and the director of quality & customer resolutions, Consumer.\n\nIn addition, during Sara's first year on the Board, she has:\n\n- -  joined a Colleague Board meeting to help understand the culture of the group and our colleagues' views. She will attend all Colleague Board meetings throughout the coming year (see pages 35 to 36 for information on the Colleague Board )\n- -  attended a BT Compliance Committee meeting (ahead of becoming a member) for a better understanding of the Commitments and our relationship with Ofcom and other communications providers\n- -  taken part in two BT customer inclusion panel sessions, where groups representing vulnerable customers and people with disabilities provide feedback to help us improve our products and services\n- -  observed a number of customer research panels with Enterprise's SME customers and Consumer's customers, to hear their perspectives on service and future priorities\n- -  attended a virtual tour of Adastral Park to gain an insight into BT's research and development focus.\n\nSara will continue to join future customer inclusion panels where possible and, as the Covid-19 restrictions ease, she plans to visit Adastral Park, a BT/EE retail shop and a customer contact centre, and to shadow an Openreach field visit to gain a broader insight into the work of our frontline colleagues.",

In 2020/21 we undertook an external evaluation (given the last external evaluation was completed in 2017/18).\n\nAppointment of the external evaluator: The chairman, supported by the company secretarial team, led a tender process, which resulted in Clare Chalmers Limited being appointed to undertake the evaluation, based on style and the best fit for the Board. Clare Chalmers Limited is considered to be independent, having no other connection (including any past business relationship) to BT or any of the individual directors. A brief and the key areas of focus were discussed and agreed by Clare, the chairman and the company secretarial team.\n\nAgreed areas of focus and actions: There were certain areas of focus which the Board felt would continue to improve its performance and effectiveness. Accordingly, the directors agreed the areas of focus and suggested actions for 2021/22, as set out below. Progress against these will be reviewed by the Board and/or its committees as appropriate during the year, with any ongoing areas feeding into next year's internal evaluation process.\n\nProcess: Clare observed a meeting of the Board and each of the committees, and received the papers in advance. She also reviewed a selection of Board and committee papers from meetings during the year. Confidential one-to-one meetings were conducted with each director, certain senior management attendees and external advisers. The evaluation focused on composition, succession and chairmanship and how well placed the Board is to add value to the business, in terms of how it oversees strategy, risk management, people, culture and performance. Focus was also given to the Board's decision-making processes, as well as how it considers stakeholders as part of its decisions and discussions.\n\nFinal Report: Clare discussed the draft report, which included proposed recommendations and actions, with the chairman, and then with the whole Board at its March 2021 meeting. Clare felt that the Board comprises a highly experienced group of non-executive directors with a strong skillset and a diverse range of viewpoints and perspectives. There is healthy challenge and a good appreciation of the stakeholder context in which BT sits.\n\n| Areas of focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Suggested actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In reviewing Board composition, size and succession planning  in light of potential Board changes and the future of the  business, the  Nominations Committee  should consider the  need for a new non-executive director with an understanding  of technology trends and cyber.                                                   | The current focus of the  Nominations Committee  is on  the search for a new chairman.

The committee's current priority is the search for a new chairman.\n\n## Membership and attendance\n\nAll non-executive directors are members of the committee. The chief executive attends meetings where appropriate. The company secretary or her appointed delegate acts as secretary to the committee, and they attend all meetings and provide advice and support as required. Committee members and attendees do not attend committee discussions where a conflict exists.

After each meeting, I report back to the Board on the committee's activities.\n\n- The committee's key responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference available at bt.com/governance\n\n## Committee activities in 2020/21\n\nThe committee held five scheduled meetings during the year and six ad hoc meetings. The ad hoc meetings have predominantly been focused on Executive Committee changes and the search for my successor.\n\nDuring the year, the committee considered and, as appropriate, made recommendations to the Board regarding:\n\n## Board composition and succession planning\n\n- -  Board composition and succession planning for directors with a focus on the skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity requirements in line with the current and future needs of the business. The committee continually keeps succession planning under review, particularly for our longer serving directors. Given the Board appointments during 2020, it is felt that there is a good balance of newer and longer serving directors who provide consistency of BT knowledge and experience. Given the focus of the committee is currently on the search for a new chairman, the committee has decided to undertake a comprehensive review of the skills, experience and diversity on the Board as a whole once a successor is in role. We recognise that both the Board evaluation and the recent announcement that Mike Inglis will cease being a non-executive director at the 2021 AGM, reiterate the need for us to appoint a director with technology experience.\n- -  changes to the membership of the committees, the committee chairs and the senior independent director as a result of changes to the Board which took effect from the conclusion of the 2020 AGM.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\n- -  a number of changes to the Executive Committee structure and roles and responsibilities of members, as recommended by the chief executive, in light of the continuing transformation of BT. These included the appointment of Rob Shuter, CEO, Enterprise, and Harmeen Mehta, chief digital and innovation officer (see page 8), the restructuring of the Technology unit into a Networks unit and a newly created Digital unit in line with our digital transformation and growth programme, the removal of a standalone Strategy & Transformation unit and the amalgamation of the regulatory affairs and legal and company secretarial functions under a combined role of general counsel and director of regulatory affairs. Recent appointments have sought to further strengthen the senior management of the group bringing fresh perspectives, experiences and skills required for the future long-term growth of our business.\n- -  the performance and succession planning of Executive Committee members (including executive directors). The committee undertook a detailed review of succession planning, reviewing key talent at senior leadership level with the chief executive and the HR director. The committee reflected on the importance of identifying critical roles and building stronger diversity of experience, gender and ethnicity, as well as commercial, technology and transformation capabilities, both through potential external candidates and our internal talent pipeline.",

I am not present for these discussions. As Ian Cheshire has expressed an interest in being considered as a potential candidate for the role of chairman, he is also not present for these discussions. After a formal tender process, MWM Consulting, an independent external search agency, who has no other connection to BT, or any of the directors, was appointed to facilitate the process. MWM Consulting is a signatory of the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms (in line with our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy).\n\nFurther to a committee discussion on the capabilities, skills and experience required, and having considered the future needs of the business, a search brief was agreed. In line with that brief, MWM Consulting prepared a longlist of candidates and was specifically requested by the committee to ensure that it comprised a diverse range of candidates including female candidates and those from ethnic minority backgrounds. The committee has agreed a shortlist of candidates to be formally approached by MWM Consulting for the purpose of further interviews and assessment. Feedback will be discussed by the committee to consider the relative merits of the candidates based on the criteria and brief for this appointment. Once the committee has identified a preferred candidate, the committee shall recommend that candidate to the Board for approval.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our approach to Board diversity and our aim to have a well-balanced Board with the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to meet our business needs and in support of our strategic aim of building the strongest foundations (see bt.com/governance ). It reflects the recommendations of the Code, the HamptonAlexander Review on gender diversity and the Parker Review of ethnicity for FTSE 100 companies. Diversity is considered in the broadest sense and all forms of difference are considered, including age, gender, nationality, independence, professional background, social and ethnic backgrounds, business and geographic experience, as well as cognitive and personal strengths. These are considered in reviewing the composition of the Board, and where possible, these should be appropriately balanced. Under the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the Nominations Committee reviews progress against the policy's targets and objectives. As at 31 March 2021, four of our 12 Board directors were female (33%), in line with our target, and two directors were from an ethnic minority background (17%), exceeding the Parker Review recommendation. We continue to challenge our external search consultants to ensure that all forms of diversity, in particular ethnicity and gender, are considered when drawing up candidate shortlists.\n\nThis year, the Board prioritised diversity matters, discussing with management BT's proposed publication of diversity and inclusion targets and commitments, our Ethnicity Rapid Action Plan and the related commitments and the progress being made in this area as a whole (see page 24). The Remuneration Committee discussed our planned communications in relation to the ethnicity and gender pay gap reporting.\n\nDetails of our group-wide Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, including its objectives, link to strategy, implementation and progress can be found on pages 24, 25 and 44.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chairman and non-executive directors' tenure As at 31 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity and independence\n\n## Board\n\nAs at 31 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman*: 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-independent, non-executive director: 1 *  Independent on appointment to role.\n\n## Post 2021 AGM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman*: 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-independent, non-executive director: 1\n\nExecutive directors: 2\n\nIndependent non-executive directors: 7\n\n- *  Independent on appointment to role.\n\nExecutive Committee (including CEO, Openreach) As at 31 March 2021\n\n8 (67%)\n\n4 (33%)\n\nExecutive Committee, company secretary and direct reports (including CEO, Openreach and excluding executive directors on the Board) As at 31 March 2021\n\n81 (69%)\n\n37 (31%)\n\nExecutive directors: 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndependent non-executive directors: 8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMale\n\nFemale",

After each meeting, I report back to the Board on the committee's activities, the main issues discussed and matters of particular relevance, with the Board receiving copies of the committee's minutes.\n\n## Committee activities in 2020/21\n\n## Internal controls and finance transformation\n\nAs a result of BT's deregistration from the US SEC, BT is no longer required to provide formal certification regarding the effectiveness of its controls over financial reporting, or make any corresponding public disclosures, to comply with SarbanesOxley regulations. Notwithstanding this, management's financial controls objective continues to be to ensure that our overall controls framework is effective, and therefore management has followed a financial controls assurance approach this year similar to that adopted in previous years under Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. On behalf of the Board, and in line with the Code, the committee monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of our systems of risk management and internal control during the year.\n\nManagement has undertaken testing of the design and implementation of all key financial controls. Effective reliance on the systems tested was confirmed. A limited number of these controls are also within the scope of KPMG's audit work to support the current year audit. At the request of the committee, and in addition to external audit activities, KPMG also tested the design and operation of all IT general controls relevant to IT applications in-scope for management's internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nThe committee continued to monitor the implementation of the end-to-end finance transformation programme, which will enhance, automate and rationalise our financial controls landscape, key reporting and transactional processes and systems. The finance transformation programme supports the ongoing improvement of controls identified through",

When complete, the transformation programme will reduce the need for the existing mitigating manual controls including management review controls and data analytics. The committee received updates on the progress of the programme throughout the year, including the benefits, who is accountable, and the potential risks and mitigations, and continued to provide feedback in order to support the success and timeliness of the programme's conclusion. Progress during the year included golives of our management reporting and planning and forecasting tools for most of the business, including the deployment of our new information model and additional reporting capabilities. This has resulted in significant progress in terms of enhancing both our controls and quality of data.\n\nUsing the capabilities delivered through the finance transformation programme, management continues to build a more robust controls landscape. As reported last year, management implemented the SAP Governance, Risk and Compliance module to support the end-to-end monitoring of our financial controls. This reinforces access controls within SAP and the controls framework, and allows for the timely detection of access violations together with greater assurance over appropriate access in line with user roles and responsibilities.\n\n## BT Integrity and Compliance (BTIC) programme\n\nAs mentioned in last year's report, BTIC is a multi-year programme which aims to ensure that we have in place an enhanced framework of risk management, controls and assurance for dealing with our landscape of risks, and the right mindset to support it, in order to deliver our strategic outcomes. The programme is delivering the tools to enable BT to be smart with risk and improve operational and ethical discipline.\n\nThe two key areas of the BTIC programme are 'Wiring' and 'Mindset'.

Mindset refers to the capabilities and culture required to achieve our risk management goals, including how we measure and achieve them and how we can intervene throughout colleague lifecycle, from recruitment to development to reward, to deliver the improvements we need to take on risk with confidence.\n\nThe committee reviewed how the programme has improved risk management and assurance activities and reporting, specifically in relation to:\n\n- -  a new risk management framework (see more details in the Risk management section below)\n- -  a simplified policy, standards and key controls structure\n- -  a common enhanced three lines of defence model clarifying accountabilities\n- -  an improved governance framework including business unit audit and risk committees that bring the right discussions and decisions to the appropriate audiences\n- -  the wider promotion of risk awareness, operational discipline and improved decision-making.\n\n## Risk management\n\nA key focus this year has been to implement and enhance our new risk management framework and embed the output from this work into the day-to-day management, operations and culture of BT. Our risk management processes identify and monitor the risks facing the group. The Executive Committee , the Board and this committee regularly review the risks BT considers to be material.\n\nWe define our risk landscape in areas of enduring risk called group risk categories, covering strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks.

Much of this work was undertaken by this committee on the Board's behalf and the committee considers progress made and where we need to develop. In these sessions, the committee held open and honest discussions with the Executive Committee risk owners to understand current and anticipated risk developments, including any impacts of Covid-19, and reviewed how effectively the risks are being managed. The committee used these discussions to assess both current specific concerns (point risks) and uncertainties that might become significant (emerging risks) and agree on actions required to manage the risks effectively. The committee also reviewed the definition of risk appetite and supporting metrics within each of the categories, the effectiveness of our controls, mitigation activities and any areas for improvement.\n\nAs chair, I subsequently reported the key points from each of these risk sessions to the Board, given that the Board is ultimately responsible for the group's systems of risk management and internal control. The above activities, including those described in the Internal controls and finance transformation section above, and consideration of the key matters reviewed by the committee, collectively enable the committee to confirm that the systems of risk management and internal control have been appropriately reviewed. Where required, improvements have been agreed and put into action.\n\n- Further information on risk management and our principal risks can be found in the How we manage risk section from page 57 and the Our principal risks and uncertainties section from page 59 .\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe committee monitors the financial reporting process and oversees its integrity. During the year, the committee considered:\n\n- -  the full year and half year results, and quarterly trading updates, and subsequently recommended these to the Board for approval\n- -  the quality of accounting policies and practices, as well as critical accounting estimates and key judgements for results and considered these to be appropriate.\n\nIn May 2021, the committee carried out a detailed assessment of the Annual Report, having previously provided comments and feedback throughout the drafting process. As part of this assessment, the committee reviewed the material matters reported, ensured that the report accurately reflected the company's performance and that it was consistent in its messaging throughout. The committee also considered whether the information was presented in a clear and concise manner.\n\nThe committee considered that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy. This assessment formed the basis of the committee's recommendation on its advice to the Board in respect of this.\n\nBT's significant accounting policies are set out on pages 124 and 125. The consistent application of these policies is subject to ongoing verification through management review and independent review by the internal and external auditors.\n\nThe processes supporting the preparation and consolidation of the financial statements have been documented and are subject to annual verification through the programme of testing completed by our internal auditor. This serves to confirm the operation of internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n## Significant issues considered relating to the financial statements\n\n## Group accounting policies, critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe committee considered the accounting policies and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that relate to critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements, including the critical estimates and judgements relating to the valuation of our pensions assets and obligations, those relating to taxation, and contingent liabilities associated with litigation; along with other key estimates and judgements relating to provisions and our goodwill impairment model; and significant judgements around lease term.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe committee considered management's forecasts of group cash flows and net debt, as well as our liquidity requirements and borrowing facilities, including downside scenarios from our viability model as discussed below. Following this review and a discussion of the sensitivities, we confirmed that the going concern basis of accounting continues to be an appropriate basis of preparation for the financial statements. Further detail on the basis of our going concern assessment is set out on page 106.\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe committee assessed the process and assessment of the group's prospects, the time horizon and how this aligned with the group's long-term forecasts, taking into account the company's current position and principal risks. The committee also considered the group risks in management's stress testing model, including the review of combined downside scenarios. We have combined a number of risks including another lockdown due to Covid-19, a revaluation of the BT Pension Scheme and enforcement action from Ofcom. We have also assumed that industrial action takes place and a scenario where we are unable to prevent a cyber attack which leads to a class action due to loss of customer data. The committee was satisfied that the viability statement could be provided and endorsed the continued selection of a three-year time horizon as a basis for the statement and the approach to its development. Further detail on the assessment of viability and the viability statement are set out on page 68.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe committee considered the impact of Covid-19 on the financial statements, including the adequacy of the provisions booked as a specific item in 2019/20 and their subsequent utilisation and release in 2020/21.\n\n## Regulatory reporting\n\nThe committee supported the continued changes across our colleagues, processes and systems that were put in place to ensure that we met our 2020/21 regulatory financial reporting obligations.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe committee considered the assumptions underlying the valuation of the pension assets and liabilities in the financial statements, as summarised in note 20 to the financial statements, the sensitivities around the assumptions and the impact of the assumptions on the balance sheet, income statement and related disclosures. The committee was updated on the triennial funding valuation for the BT Pension Scheme, the possible range of valuation outcomes and our funding position.",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill impairment\n\nThe committee considered and was satisfied with the key assumptions, including operating cash flow forecasts, resulting headroom and the sensitivity analysis performed by management and agreed that no goodwill impairment charges were required this year.\n\n## Major contracts\n\nThe performance of major contracts in Enterprise and Global were considered, including accounting judgements, assessments of the recoverability of dedicated contract assets, and any requirement for loss provisions.\n\n## Asset verification and asset lives\n\nThe committee assessed the results of management's annual asset life review, asset verification exercise and review of fully depreciated assets and the committee was satisfied that the judgements made, and the methodology applied, were appropriate.\n\n## Divestments\n\nThe committee reviewed the judgements made in relation to the group's divestments, including on whether the held for sale criteria had been satisfied and how goodwill should be allocated to divested or held for sale entities.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe committee reviewed specific items quarterly, and considered and agreed that they were appropriately categorised. We also considered management's view of the quality of earnings and of the effective tax rate. At the half year and the full year, we considered a detailed assessment of provisions and the committee was satisfied with the analysis provided in relation to the results.\n\n## External audit\n\nKPMG has been our external auditor since the conclusion of the 2018 AGM, following an audit tender process that took place in 2016 and 2017. John Luke was appointed as the lead audit partner for KPMG during the year, having been the audit partner for Openreach since 2018/19 (the date of his appointment as Openreach audit partner being the effective date for the purpose of determining his length of tenure to date). The company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority's Statutory Audit Services Order for the financial year under review. During the year, the committee reviewed, with the external auditor, the scope of work and the risk informing this, external audit findings and their letter of engagement. The committee approved KPMG's audit plan and management's letter of representation. The committee also considered and subsequently approved the proposed external audit fees for the year ended 31 March 2021, as well as the recurring audit fee for the regulatory financial statements and the interim review fee (see the Independent auditor's report on pages 112 to 117 for more details).\n\n## External auditor independence, objectivity and effectiveness\n\nThe committee discussed the external auditor's independence and potential areas that could give rise to a conflict of interest, and considered the safeguards in place to prevent compromising their independence and objectivity. Our nonaudit services policy sets out the non-audit services that can be provided by the external auditor, in line with the latest ethical standards. The external auditor is not permitted to perform any work which they may later be required to audit, or which might affect their objectivity and independence, or create a conflict of interest. Internal procedures describe the approval process for work performed by the external auditor. This applied to KPMG throughout the year. The committee monitored compliance with the policies and procedures and considered business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelationships with the external auditor, and the level and appropriateness of non-audit services and fees. Our non-audit services policy can be found at bt.com/governance\n\nThe nature of the non-audit services carried out by the external auditor during the year, including to review our in-scope IT general controls, are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page 134. These were carried out due to legal or regulatory obligations, contractual requirements, or represented areas of assurance work where it was materially more efficient for the external auditor to be engaged, as opposed to another third party, due to the work completed in relation to the audit, and which were permitted to be performed by an auditor under the Revised Ethical Standard 2019.\n\nAudit-related assurance services, including the audit of the regulatory financial statements, as well as non-audit services performed by KPMG, are considered a low threat to auditor independence. The proportion of other non-audit services to total services carried out by the external auditor is therefore considered the most suitable measure of the non-audit services provided. These represented 0.8% of the total fees (2019/20: 2%).\n\nThe committee assessed the quality of the audit and the performance of the external auditor throughout the year and concluded that the audit contributed to the integrity of the group's financial reporting. The committee agreed that the external auditor continues to be independent and recommended to the Board (which was subsequently approved) that the reappointment of KPMG be put to our shareholders for approval at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nDuring the year, the committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the internal audit charter, establishing group internal audit's independence, authority, remit and reporting lines to conduct its work\n- -  reviewed and approved the annual group internal audit plan (at the start of the year) and received regular updates on internal audit activities, progress against the plan, details of unsatisfactory audit findings and action plans to address these and progress\n- -  discussed with executive management all internal audit reports where controls were assessed as 'inadequate'\n- -  reviewed the performance and effectiveness of the internal audit function, including consideration of whether the quality, experience and expertise of the function were appropriate for the business. An external effectiveness review of internal audit was previously conducted in 2018/19 by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors in accordance with our five-year cycle of such reviews\n- -  reviewed the status of management actions arising from internal audits, including those that became overdue and ensured that these were tracked through to completion and subject to close monitoring by management.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nThe committee considered reports from the group ethics and compliance director on BT's ethics and compliance priorities, including Speak Up, our confidential, whistleblowing hotline. As part of this, there was a focus on communications regulation in line with our group risk category, anti-bribery and corruption, international trade, compliance learning programmes and how these are embedded in our culture and financial services compliance. The committee ensures that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of these and other matters, including data privacy and governance.",

Good progress continues to be made in delivering on the Commitments' objectives and as BT progresses with its transformation agenda, we will continue to monitor the arrangements with vigilance to ensure they continue to operate as intended.\n\n## Membership and attendance\n\nThe committee comprises independent non-executive directors only. The company secretary or her appointed delegate acts as secretary to the committee, and they attend all meetings and provide advice and support as required. The chairman, regulatory affairs director, general counsel, commitments assurance office (CAO) director and Openreach's commitments monitoring office director also attend all meetings as invitees.\n\n| Member                |   Attended |   Eligible to attend |\n|-----------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Isabel Hudson (chair) |          4 |                    4 |\n| Ian Cheshire a        |          3 |                    3 |\n| Mike Inglis           |          4 |                    4 |\n| Allison Kirkby b      |          3 |                    4 |\n\n- a  Ian joined the committee on 16 July 2020.\n- b  Allison was unable to join one committee meeting during the year due to other business commitments and provided her comments to the chair ahead of the meeting.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThis committee is responsible for monitoring whether Openreach's governance model is working as expected and achieving appropriate outcomes for consumers and industry. It ensures that Openreach is able to act with appropriate independence while BT is properly able to fulfil its parent company duties.\n\nThe committee reviews BT's compliance with the letter and spirit of the Commitments made as part of Ofcom's 2017 Digital Communications Review and reviews the culture and behaviours of colleagues. The committee continues to be supported by the CAO.\n\nHaving regard to the importance BT places on consumer fairness for our customers, the Board approved proposals to enhance BT's consumer fairness governance framework,\n\nwidening the committee's remit to include oversight of consumer fairness matters on behalf of the Board. From 1 April 2021, the committee monitors whether BT is living up to Ofcom's Fairness for Customers commitments (see page 17 for more detail on consumer fairness).\n\nThe Board receives copies of the committee's minutes and I report to the Board after each committee meeting. Ofcom receives copies of minutes and each year we publish an annual review (available at bt.com/btcc ). Further details on how we engage with Ofcom can be found on page 41.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee's key responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference available at bt.com/governance\n\n## Committee activities in 2020/21\n\nThe committee met four times during the year and has continued to focus on the letter and the spirit of the Commitments and how they are working in practice. The committee has focused on processes that may affect the balance of Openreach's independence and BT's oversight. I am pleased to note that the Commitments proved resilient in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe committee reviewed and discussed:\n\n- -  BT's second independent cultural maturity survey which reported significant improvements and that Openreach has become culturally more independent since 2018. While the Openreach/BT parent company relationship has improved, there needs to be continued focus on the Openreach/ customer-facing units' dynamic. The committee has sought updates on the actions and has engaged with industry stakeholders on their perspectives on the Commitments.\n- -  the outputs of an independent assessment on the effectiveness of BT's monitoring framework, tools and capabilities, which were generally found to be robust. The committee discussed recommendations to enhance these, including the effectiveness and proportionality of information sharing controls.\n- -  how intended outcomes are being delivered including on BT's investment in fibre and the delivery of the broadband Universal Service Obligation. The regulatory affairs and CAO directors reported on key activities and priorities at each meeting. The CAO reviewed whether BT's responses to Covid-19 aligned with expectations. The committee was pleased to note that as BT adapted ways of working to safeguard colleagues and customers, and respond to operational and financial challenges, colleagues continued to adhere to the letter and spirit of the Commitments. As BT progresses its strategic initiatives and makes new senior appointments, the committee will continue to monitor the alignment of BT's leadership with the Commitments. The committee also considered the CAO's reviews of financial planning, strategy development and commercial processes, and the outcomes of its compliance 'quick checks'. The committee decided on all the potential Commitments breaches reported to the CAO by BT and where appropriate discussed remedial actions. Breaches and process nonconformances remain at a low level in nature and number.\n- -  how Openreach and BT share commercial information and support management in improving the quality of the reporting on this. The committee invited BT and Openreach to brief it on the lessons learned and remedial actions in train following Ofcom's finding that Openreach had not given a competing company the same information as BT's own bid team during the tender for a public sector telecoms contract in Northern Ireland in 2017/18 (see page 17). The committee also considered reports from group internal audit focusing on Commitments focused audits.",

During what has been a difficult year for so many, it's been encouraging to see BT step up to the challenge to help our colleagues, our communities and the country. This includes its support for critical health services, key workers and building digital skills for school children, small businesses and jobseekers. BT has continued to focus on tackling climate change, championing human rights and keeping people safe online through its responsible tech approach. As a core part of the strategy, with the outcome of related KPIs being annual bonus measures, progress in this area helps to build trust and create value for all stakeholders.\n\nThe committee is responsible for agreeing the digital impact and sustainability strategy for the group.

The committee considered BT's role as a national enabler in helping people improve their digital skills, including our targeted programmes for school children, families, jobseekers, SMEs and vulnerable customers, and how the programme is helping to drive positive societal outcomes, as well as strengthening relationships with our customers and supporting their priorities.\n\n## Responsible tech and human rights\n\nThe progress on BT's human rights programme, how human rights are respected across the group's operations and supply chain, as well as efforts to tackle modern slavery, and the introduction of a forward-looking and principles-based approach to responsible tech. The committee endorsed BT's commitment to consistently develop, use, buy and sell technology in a way that benefits people and minimises harm.\n\n## Climate and the environment\n\nThe progress on BT's climate strategy and efforts to meet our decarbonisation target of an 87% reduction in carbon emissions intensity by the end of March 2031, Openreach's decarbonisation targets and the progress made in transitioning its commercial vehicle fleet to run on electric or alternative fuels (see pages 32, 33 and 47). The committee was also updated on the launch of the UK Electric Fleets Coalition, which has been co-founded by BT (including Openreach) and The Climate Group with the aim of influencing policy and to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThe committee also discussed the approach to the 2021 COP26 climate summit and BT's plans, including a presentation and discussion with an external expert. During the year, the committee also monitored BT's efforts to address the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Further details on how BT is implementing this can be found on page 67.\n\n## Vulnerable customers\n\nThe accessibility, inclusion and vulnerability programme within Consumer and the ongoing focus in this area. Further details on how BT supports our customers can be found on pages 26 to 29.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nBT's approach to understanding the interests of our key stakeholders and how this is reflected in the digital impact and sustainability strategy, our external reporting, and our engagement with stakeholders going forward in a landscape of increasing focus on environmental, social and governance factors.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nProgrammes and initiatives that are in place across the group to manage risks within our supply chain.

        "page_content": "This is my first letter since becoming the remuneration committee chair and I would like to start by thanking Nick Rose, the former committee chair, for his seamless handover and for securing strong shareholder support for BT's new Directors' Remuneration Policy (Policy) at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM). I must admit that I had envisaged a relatively quiet year implementing the new Policy across the business. However, it has been an extraordinary year, and the committee has spent much of its time focused on five key areas: purpose, people, the pandemic, performance and Policy.\n\n## Purpose, people, and the pandemic\n\n'We connect for good', BT's purpose, has really been brought to life during the pandemic. Despite the surge in demand on our fixed-line, broadband, and mobile networks, BT kept our customers and the country connected. BT also played a vital role in supporting the NHS by connecting the Nightingale hospitals and testing centres, rolling out our high-speed network to vaccination centres, keeping the Emergency Services Network working 24/7, and gifting unlimited data to NHS workers to show our appreciation of their valiant work.\n\nAchieving this required an enormous amount of effort and commitment from our entire workforce. A special mention must be made of our frontline colleagues and key workers such as the Openreach engineers, who have worked around the clock to install services and repair technical faults, our call centre colleagues who assisted our customers, and the retail teams that kept our EE/BT retail shops running where possible.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, the chief executive made a commitment that BT would support the wellbeing of our colleagues as best it could, and that no colleague would lose their job as a direct result of changing trading conditions brought about by Covid-19. I am pleased to say that we delivered on this promise. Despite the challenges we have faced, we have continued to invest in our network, we have not needed to make use of the Government's furlough scheme, and we have created new jobs in Openreach at a time when many companies have cut employees' pay, cut working hours and made redundancies. Like many other companies, we did expect our profits to be lower than last year given the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy, however the committee and the Executive Committee felt it was important to reward our colleagues and to recognise their commitment and contribution during an extraordinarily challenging year. All frontline colleagues and key workers will receive a special one-off cash bonus of \u00a31,000, and all eligible colleagues will receive \u00a3500 worth of shares that vest after three years.\n\nWe took the difficult decision to freeze executive salaries for a second consecutive year and, despite the higher formulaic outturn of 129% of target, the committee exercised its discretion to cap executive bonuses at 100% of target in line with the chief executive's recommendation. In addition, all members of the Executive Committee have for a second year voluntarily agreed to defer all of their annual bonus into shares for three years. This means that executives have not received cash bonuses for the last two years. As announced in April 2020, the chief executive also donated six months of his salary to health charities and small businesses in his local community.\n\nDuring the year, there were a few changes to the Executive Committee as mentioned by Philip Jansen in his introduction on page 7. The committee considered and approved competitive remuneration packages for the new joiners and the treatment to be applied for leavers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance and executive remuneration outcomes for 2020/21\n\nAnnual bonus performance was based on a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures that align to our strategic priorities. All targets were set at the start of the financial year based on a forecast impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic at the time the targets were set, the committee reviewed the measures and targets in the middle of the year. No adjustments to the targets were made as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFinancial performance accounts for 70% of the bonus scorecard:\n\n- -EBITDA (35%) - the outcome was in line with our expectations at \u00a37,415m and came in between target and stretch. Despite pressures on our revenue, we continued to see benefits from our simplification and transformation programme.\n- -Normalised free cash flow (35%) - the outcome was \u00a31,459m which was also between target and stretch.\n\nOur non-financial measures account for 30% of the bonus scorecard and comprise the following:\n\n- -Customer (10%) - our colleagues have worked hard to deliver standout customer experience during the year, and the overall group Net Promoter Score (NPS) saw its 19th consecutive quarterly improvement, with Consumer and Global results at an all-time high.\n- -Converged networks (10%) - Openreach worked hard to maintain FTTP connection rates despite multiple lockdowns and delivered performance between target and stretch. We took advantage of new product launches to drive sales of our 5G tariffs and handsets and significantly exceeded our 5G customers stretch target.\n- -Digital impact (5%) - as Covid-19 hit, we successfully pivoted to a digital-first model for Skills for Tomorrow, delivering campaigns designed to help small businesses and families, as well as Stand Out Skills, focusing on providing support to jobseekers. We also launched our Top Tips on Tech TV campaign, which reached an incredible 5.7m people. As this campaign was not foreseen at the time the target was set, we removed it from our scorecard results - however the number of people reached through our other delivery channels still exceeded our stretch goal for the year.\n- -Sustainability (5%) - significant progress has been made towards reducing our carbon emissions intensity; putting in the foundations for accelerated fleet electrification and switching to purchasing 100% renewable electricity globally. While Covid-19 has had a positive impact on our emissions during the year due to factors such as increased homeworking and reduced vehicle usage, our underlying performance for the year excluding the impact of Covid-19 was still between target and stretch. We are on-track to meet our KPI of an 87% reduction in carbon emissions intensity by the end of March 2031.\n\nWhen determining overall performance and bonus pay-outs, the committee also considers a number of other factors including share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. Given ongoing cost constraints, pay freezes across the organisation and continued economic uncertainty, despite the formulaic outturn of the final bonus scorecard being 129% of target, the committee exercised its discretion to cap executive bonuses at 100% of target in line with the chief executive's recommendation. The committee also believes this is a fair outturn given the overall performance of the business under challenging conditions.",

As was the case last year, both executive directors have volunteered to defer their annual bonuses in full into shares for three years.\n\nThe 2018 Incentive Share Plan (ISP) award will lapse in full in May 2021 as we did not meet the threshold performance target in respect of each measure over the last three years.\n\n## Policy implementation in 2021/22\n\n## a) Salary\n\nAs outlined above, we have made the decision this year to not increase base salaries for the management population. Accordingly, the chief executive and the chief financial officer will not receive a salary increase in June 2021.\n\n## b) Pension\n\nAs set out in our Policy last year, Simon Lowth's pension allowance was reduced to 15% of salary from 1 April 2021 and will further reduce to 10% of salary from 1 April 2022, which will fully align him with the rate offered to the majority of our UK workforce. Philip Jansen's pension allowance remains at 10% of salary.\n\n## c) Annual bonus\n\nWe have reviewed the bonus scorecard measures and weightings and determined that they remain well-aligned to our strategic priorities for the coming year. The committee is satisfied that they represent a meaningful balance of financial performance measures and our broader strategic priorities, including the impact we make for our customers and society. The same group bonus scorecard applies to all eligible managers, so everyone is focused on and aligned to the same goals. Openreach managers have a similar bonus scorecard but it is based on Openreach performance to maintain independence and to reflect our Commitments.\n\nNo changes are proposed to the structure of the annual bonus plan: the on-target and maximum opportunity will remain at 120% and 200% of salary for both executive directors, with half deferred for a period of three years.\n\n## d) Long-term incentives\n\nAwards will be made to both the chief executive and chief financial officer in June 2021 under our Restricted Share Plan (RSP). The committee considers the level of such awards each year, taking into consideration several factors, including the share price performance over the preceding year. In 2020, the level of awards granted was reduced from the normal Policy level of 200% of salary to 160% of salary due to share price performance and the decision to suspend the dividend until 2021/22. Since then, our share price has recovered, with performance above that of the FTSE 100 index, and the committee has therefore agreed that awards would be granted to both executive directors this year at the normal Policy level of 200% of salary.\n\nAwards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, and no tranche may be sold until year five. As per last year, awards are subject to both return on capital employed (ROCE) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) underpins (see page 96), and the committee retains ultimate discretion to adjust the vesting outcome if considered appropriate.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations. The committee takes account of these factors when making decisions relating to executive remuneration.\n\nDuring the year, Isabel Hudson, as the designated nonexecutive director for workforce engagement, also fed back any comments to the committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions at their meetings.\n\nWe increased our focus on race equality and launched our Ethnicity Rapid Action Plan, which was set up to help improve diversity and inclusion across BT. As part of this plan we have elected to voluntarily undertake our first ethnicity pay gap, in addition to the mandatory gender pay gap. The result of the ethnicity pay gap will be included in our inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Report, which is to be published in early summer 2021.\n\nFollowing the Policy review, the change in the committee chair during the year and as agreed by the committee as part of last year's internal committee evaluation, we decided that it was timely and in good order to run a competitive tender for the appointment of advisers to the committee. Further to this, Deloitte were successful in retaining their appointment and the committee is satisfied that Deloitte continues to provide independent and objective advice.\n\nAs always, the committee and I wish to maintain an open dialogue on remuneration matters with our investors and I would welcome their comments or feedback and support at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Sir Ian Cheshire\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 12 May 2021",

However, the maximum total compensation levels are set lower than typical market practice to reflect the narrower and more predictable range of performance outcomes for BT\n- -  Formulaic incentive outcomes are reviewed by the committee and may be adjusted having consideration to overall group performance and wider workforce remuneration policies and practices.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- -  When considering performance, the committee takes account of BT's values\n- -  The committee receives regular updates on pay conditions across the company, and colleagues may provide feedback to the Board via the Colleague Board and the designated nonexecutive director for workforce engagement\n- -  All-employee share plans help encourage our colleagues to become shareholders in the business.\n- the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the company (or taking on such other applicable position). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the directors as described in the Policy, for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation.",

Philip Jansen's salary of \u00a31,100,000 was fixed for five years at the time of his appointment in January 2019.\n\nThe fees for non-executive directors reflect committee-related or other additional responsibilities, including on a pro-rated basis for any appointments during the year. The chairman and executive directors reviewed the fees for non-executive directors during the year and agreed that there would be no fee increases for the non-executive directors. The chairman's fees were agreed to be fixed for five years on appointment as chairman in November 2017. A full breakdown of non-executive director fees is set out on page 100.",

None of the executive directors participate in future service accrual in the BTPS.\n\nNew UK employees are eligible to join a defined contribution scheme, typically a personal pension plan. For executive directors, the company agrees to pay a fixed percentage of their salary each year which can be put towards the provision of retirement benefits.\n\nDuring the year, Philip Jansen received an annual allowance equal to 10% of salary in lieu of pension provision as set out in the table on page 94. BT also provides death in service cover consisting of a lump sum equal to four times his salary.\n\nDuring the year, Simon Lowth received an annual allowance equal to 20% of salary in lieu of pension provision as set out in the table on page 94. This will further reduce to 15% of salary in 2021/22 and 10% of salary in 2022/23. BT also provides death in service cover consisting of a lump sum equal to four times his salary plus a dependants pension equal to 30% of his capped salary.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nBoth executive directors were eligible for an on-target bonus in respect of 2020/21 of 120% of salary with a maximum opportunity of 200% of salary. The annual bonus is based on performance against a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures.\n\n| Category                         | Measure                        | Weighting   | Threshold   | Target   | Stretch   | Actual   | Payout (% of max)   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n| Financial                        | Adjusted EBITDA (\u00a3m)           | 35%         | 6,936       | 7,301    | 7,849     | 7,415    |                     |\n|                                  | Normalised free cash flow (\u00a3m) | 35%         | 1,352       | 1,423    | 1,566     | 1,459    |                     |\n| Customer                         | NPS                            | 10%         | 50          | 100      | 200       | 199      |                     |\n| Converged  networks              | 5G customers (000s)            | 5%          | 587         | 664      | 730       | 1,403    |                     |\n| Converged  networks              | FTTP connections (000s)        | 5%          | 720         | 861      | 927       | 905      |                     |\n| Digital impact  & sustainability | Carbon emissions               | 5%          | (50)%       | (52)%    | (54)%     | (53)%    |                     |\n| Digital impact  & sustainability | Skills for Tomorrow (people)   | 5%          | 2.9m        | 3.0m     | 3.1m      | 4.3m     |                     |\n\nAll targets were set at the start of the financial year based on a forecast impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The committee reviewed the measures and targets in the middle of the year to ensure they remained appropriate. No adjustments to the targets were made as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPerformance under both financial measures was between target and stretch despite challenging circumstances. Likewise, performance against the non-financial measures was strong, with all measures coming either close to or above our stretch targets.\n\nSignificant progress was made towards reducing our carbon emissions intensity; putting in the foundations for accelerated fleet electrification and switching to purchasing 100% renewable electricity globally. The final outcome on our carbon emissions measure was a 57% reduction on our baseline. However, this included the positive impact of Covid-19 as a result of increased homeworking and reduced vehicle usage. For scorecard purposes we used the underlying figure of 53%, which was between target and stretch.\n\nIn addition to the 4.3m people reached through our Skills for Tomorrow programme, our successful Top Tips on Tech TV campaign also reached 5.7m people. This was not included in the scorecard results as it was not envisaged at the time the targets were set.\n\nThis resulted in a formulaic outcome of 129% of target. When considering bonus outcomes each year, the committee takes account of a number of factors including share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. Given ongoing cost constraints, pay freezes across the organisation and continued economic uncertainty, the committee exercised its discretion to cap executive bonuses at 100% of target in line with the chief executive's\n\nrecommendation. The committee also believes this is a fair outturn given the overall performance of the business under challenging conditions.\n\nThe final bonus outturns for the executive directors are set out in the table below:\n\n|               | Formulaic  outcome   | Following  discretion   | % of   max   | Value      |\n|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 129% of  target      | 100% of  target         | 60%          | \u00a31,320,000 |\n| Simon Lowth   | 129% of  target      | 100% of  target         | 60%          | \u00a3882,526   |\n\nAs previously agreed, the chief executive's and chief financial officer's bonus for 2020/21 will be deferred in full into shares for three years. This means that the executive directors have not taken any cash bonuses for two consecutive years. Other members of the Executive Committee have also voluntarily agreed to defer all of their annual bonus into shares for a second consecutive year.",

As set out in the table below, the threshold performance target in respect of each measure was not met and therefore the awards lapsed in full and no payment was made.\n\n| Measure                                              | Weighting   | Threshold   | Maximum   | Actual   | Payout  (% of  max)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|\n| TSR (rank)                                           | 40%         | 9th         | 5th       | 14th     | 0%                    |\n| Normalised free  cash flow (\u00a3bn)                     | 40%         | \u00a36.4        | \u00a37.4      | \u00a35.9     | 0%                    |\n| Underlying  revenue growth  (excluding transit)  (%) | 20%         | 0.2         | 1.9       | (7.1)    | 0%                    |\n\n## Awards granted during the year (audited)\n\n## 2020 RSP\n\nThe 2020 RSP awards were made in August 2020 as set out below and on page 98. An award of 160% of salary was made to both executive directors, which represented a 20% discount to the normal level permitted under the Policy. The face value is based on the BT share price at the date of grant of 106.11p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of   award   | RSP award  (shares)   | Face value   of award   |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 3 August 2020     | 1,658,656             | \u00a31,760,000              |\n| Simon Lowth   | 3 August 2020     | 1,108,944             | \u00a31,176,700              |\n\nThese awards are conditional share awards without any performance targets. Two underpins will apply over the initial three-year vesting period, as follows:\n\n- -  ROCE is equal to or exceeds WACC over the same period\n- -  there must have been no ESG issues which have resulted in material reputational damage for the company.\n\nShould one or both underpins not be met, the committee may at its discretion reduce the number of shares vesting, including to nil.\n\nThe RSP awards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years. A holding period will apply such that no shares may be sold until year five. When RSP awards vest, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nRSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions as set out in the Policy, and the committee retains the ultimate discretion to adjust vesting levels in exceptional circumstances, should they not reflect the overall performance.\n\nDetails of all interests under the RSP are set out on page 98.\n\n## 2020 deferred shares\n\nThe full bonus awarded for 2019/20 was deferred into shares. The awards were made in June 2020 as set out below and on page 98. The face value is based on the BT share price at the date of grant of 119.27p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of   award   | Number of  deferred  shares   | Face value   of award   |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 25 June 2020      | 1,106,763                     | \u00a31,320,000              |\n| Simon Lowth   | 25 June 2020      | 754,759                       | \u00a3900,176                |\n\nDeferred shares are not subject to performance conditions and have a three-year vesting period. Details of all interests in deferred shares are set out on page 98.\n\nWhen deferred share awards vest, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to directors during the year for loss of office.\n\n## Former directors (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to former directors during the year.\n\n## Directors' share ownership (audited)\n\nThe committee believes that the interests of the executive directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The aim is to encourage the build-up of a meaningful shareholding in the company over time by retaining shares received through the executive share plans (other than shares sold to meet tax and other statutory deductions) or from purchases in the market.\n\nThe shareholding requirement for both executive directors increased to 500% of salary under the new Policy.\n\nExecutive directors must achieve the increased shareholding guideline within five years of the approval of the Policy or, in the case of any new executive directors appointed, within five years of their date of appointment.\n\nThe shareholding requirement will continue to apply for a period of two years post-cessation of employment, to the same value as in employment (or the total number of shares held immediately prior to cessation of employment, if lower). The post-cessation shareholding requirement will be calculated and expressed as a fixed number of shares by reference to the closing BT share price on the day immediately prior to the cessation date. The requirement is fixed as this number of shares for a period of two years and compliance will be measured at cessation and annually thereafter. In enforcing continued compliance post-cessation, the committee may request that the executive director transfers any shares subject to the shareholding requirement to be held in trust by the company until such time that they no longer need to be retained.\n\nThe company encourages the chairman and independent non-executive directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis, BT shares with an aggregate value of \u00a35,000 on average each year (based on acquisition price) to further align the interests of nonexecutive directors with those of our shareholders.

This policy is not mandatory.\n\nThis policy does not apply to the Deutsche Telekom nominated representative director appointed to the Board as a nonindependent, non-executive director under the terms of the EE acquisition in January 2016. This helps avoid any conflict of interest.\n\n## Directors' interests at 31 March 2021 or on cessation (audited)\n\nThe following table shows the beneficial interests in the company's shares of directors and persons closely associated as at 31 March 2021 (or at the point of leaving for directors who left during the year).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table includes interests held by the executive directors under the company's share plans. The numbers represent the maximum possible vesting levels. The ISP awards will only vest to the extent the performance conditions are met over the three-year period. Full details of all DBP, RSP and ISP awards, including performance periods and vesting conditions, are set out on page 98.\n\nFor executive directors we use the average BT share price over the preceding 12 months (or the share price at acquisition/ vesting date if higher) to determine whether the minimum shareholding requirement has been reached.\n\nDuring the period 1 April 2021 to 12 May 2021, there were no movements in directors' beneficial holdings or other interests in shares. The directors, as a group, beneficially own less than 1% of the company's shares.\n\n|                         | Beneficial                                    | Beneficial  holding  owned   | Unvested interests in share plans   | Unvested interests in share plans   | Unvested interests in share plans   | Unvested interests in share plans   |                                            |                              |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                         | holding  owned   outright at   1 April   2020 | outright at  31 March  2021  | DBP a                               | RSP a                               | ISP b                               | Other c                             | Total   shareholding   at 31 March  2021 d | Percentage  of salary held e |\n| Chairman                |                                               |                              |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                            |                              |\n| Jan du Plessis          | 502,475                                       | 1,004,138                    | -

Awards of deferred shares in respect of 2021 will be calculated using the average middle market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n- b  Award granted on 1 February 2019. The number of shares subject to award was calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant of 233.56p. 40% of each award is linked to TSR compared with a group of 17 companies, 40% is linked to a three-year normalised free cash flow measure and 20% to a measure of underlying revenue growth (excluding transit) over three years. Performance against the TSR, normalised free cash flow and revenue targets was below threshold so the award will lapse in full in May 2021.\n- c Awards granted on 19 June 2019. The number of shares subject to award was calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant of 207.45p. 40% of each award is linked to TSR compared with a group of 16 companies, 40% is linked to a three-year normalised free cash flow measure and 20% to a measure of underlying revenue growth (including transit) over three years.\n- d  Awards granted on 3 August 2020. The number of shares subject to award was calculated using the average middle market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant of 106.11p. Awards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years. A holding period will apply such that no shares may be sold until year five. Two underpins will apply over the initial three-year vesting period as set out on page 96.\n- e  Award granted on 22 June 2017. The number of shares subject to award was calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant of 286.40p. 40% of each award is linked to TSR compared with a group of 21 companies, 40% is linked to a three-year normalised free cash flow measure and 20% to a measure of underlying revenue growth (excluding transit) over three years. Performance against the TSR, normalised free cash flow and revenue targets resulted in the threshold targets not being met and none of the shares vesting under the 2017 ISP. The award lapsed in full in May 2020.\n- f  Award granted on 19 June 2018. The number of shares subject to award was calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT share for the three dealing days prior to grant of 211.01p. 40% of each award is linked to TSR compared with a group of 17 companies, 40% is linked to a three-year normalised free cash flow measure and 20% to a measure of underlying revenue growth (excluding transit) over three years. Performance against the TSR, normalised free cash flow and revenue targets was below threshold so the award will lapse in full in May 2021.\n- g  Option granted on 14 June 2019 under the employee saveshare scheme, in which all employees of the company are entitled to participate.",

No changes are proposed to the benefit framework for 2021/22.\n\n## Pension\n\nIn line with the Policy, both executive directors will receive an annual allowance in lieu of pension provision for 2021/22 as set out in the table below:\n\n| Director      | % of salary                      |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 10% in lieu of pension provision |\n| Simon Lowth a | 15% in lieu of pension provision |\n\n- a  This will reduce to 10% of salary in 2022/23 (effective from 1 April).\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nBoth executive directors are eligible for an on-target and maximum bonus payment of 120% and 200% of salary. As per the Policy, 50% of any bonus payable will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\nThe committee has reviewed in full the measures, weightings and targets used in the annual bonus scorecard and agreed that the measures and weightings remain appropriate and aligned to our strategy for 2021/22.\n\nThe 2021/22 annual bonus structure measures and weightings are set out below.\n\n| Category                         | Measure                                                                                                                                              | Weighting   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial                        | Adjusted EBITDA                                                                                                                                      | 35%         |\n|                                  | Normalised free cash flow                                                                                                                            | 35%         |\n| Customer                         | NPS                                                                                                                                                  | 10%         |\n| Converged  networks              | 5G customers - the number of  customers on our 5G network                                                                                            | 5%          |\n|                                  | FTTP connections - the number of  connections in the Openreach  FTTP network                                                                         | 5%          |\n| Digital impact  & sustainability | Carbon emissions - progress  towards an 87% reduction in  carbon emissions intensity by the  end of March 2031                                       | 5%          |\n|                                  | Skills for Tomorrow - progress  towards our ambition to reach 25m  people in the UK with help to  improve their digital skills by end of  March 2026 | 5%          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll seven of the annual bonus measures are linked to our key performance indicators as set out on pages 46 to 47.\n\nWe do not publish details of the targets in advance as these are commercially confidential. We will publish achievement against the targets at the same time as we disclose bonus payments in the 2022 Report on directors' remuneration so shareholders can evaluate performance against the targets.\n\n## RSP\n\nAwards will be granted to both executive directors under the RSP in June 2021.\n\nWhen considering grant levels each year, the committee takes account of share price performance over the preceding year. In 2020, the level of awards granted was reduced from the normal Policy level of 200% of salary to 160% of salary due to share price performance and the decision to suspend the dividend until 2021/22. Since then, our share price has recovered, with performance above that of the FTSE 100 index and the committee has therefore agreed that awards will be granted to both executive directors this year at the normal Policy level of 200% of salary.\n\nTwo underpins will apply over the initial three-year vesting period, as follows:\n\n- -  ROCE is equal to or exceeds WACC over the same period\n- -  there must have been no ESG issues which have resulted in material reputational damage for the company.\n\nShould one or both underpins not be met, the committee may at its discretion reduce the number of shares vesting, including to nil.\n\nThe RSP awards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years. A holding period will apply such that no shares may be sold until year five. When RSP awards vest, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nRSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions as set out in the Policy, and the committee retains the ultimate discretion to adjust vesting levels in exceptional circumstances, should they not reflect the overall performance of the business over the vesting period, or for any other reason.",

It was once again agreed that there would be no increase in fees.\n\nThe basic fee for non-executive directors is \u00a377,000 per annum. There are additional fees for membership and chairing a Board committee, details of which are set out in the table below:\n\n| Committee                       | Chair's   fee   | Member's  fee   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Audit & Risk                    | \u00a335,000         | \u00a325,000         |\n| BT Compliance                   | \u00a3 25,000        | \u00a312,000         |\n| Digital Impact & Sustainability | \u00a314,000         | \u00a38,000          |\n| Investigatory Powers Governance | n/a a           | \u00a38,000          |\n| Nominations                     | n/a a           | \u00a310,000         |\n| Remuneration                    | \u00a330,000         | \u00a315,000         |\n\n- a  Where the chairman or chief executive acts as chair of a board committee, no additional committee chair fee is payable.\n\nThe senior independent director receives an additional fee of \u00a327,000 per annum.\n\nThe designated non-executive director for workforce engagement receives an additional fee of \u00a310,000 per annum.\n\nNo element of non-executive director remuneration is performance related. Non-executive directors do not participate in BT's bonus or employee share plans and are not members of any of the company pension schemes.\n\nThe committee agreed a fee of \u00a3700,000 per year, fixed for five years, on the current chairman's appointment in November 2017 and therefore no review of his fee was undertaken.\n\n## Other remuneration matters\n\n## Advisers tender\n\nDeloitte LLP have been advisers to the committee since 2012. As agreed as part of the 2019/20 internal committee evaluation, during the year the committee undertook a competitive tender exercise to review its advisers. This was led by the committee chair supported by members of the committee and representatives of the reward, HR and company secretarial teams.\n\nA number of leading advisers were invited to submit a proposal, and a shortlist of candidates presented to a panel of committee and management representatives, focusing on the capability of the proposed team as well as the insight provided on the key issues faced by the committee.\n\nFollowing a detailed evaluation of the proposals and discussion, Deloitte were reappointed as advisers to the committee in January 2021. The committee is comfortable that the Deloitte team have no connections with BT that may impair their independence or objectivity.\n\n## Advisers\n\nDuring the year, the committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP. Deloitte received \u00a3202,375 (excluding VAT) in fees for these services.\n\nThe fees are charged on a time-spent basis in delivering advice. That advice materially assisted the committee in their consideration of matters relating to executive remuneration and the new Policy.\n\nDeloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nIn addition, during 2020/21, Deloitte provided the company with advice on corporate and indirect taxes, assistance with regulatory, risk and compliance issues and additional consultancy services.\n\n## Dilution\n\nWe use both treasury shares and shares purchased by the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to satisfy our all-employee share plans and executive share plans. Shares held in the Trust do not have any voting rights.\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, shares equivalent to 5.12% (2019/20: 2.34%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be required to satisfy all outstanding share options and awards. Of these, we estimate that for 2021/22, shares equivalent to approximately 0.26% (2020/21: 0.26%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) will be required to satisfy the all-employee share plans.\n\n## External appointments held by Executive Committee members\n\nThe Nominations Committee determines the policy for, and if thought fit, agrees the taking up of external directorships and other significant external interests by members of the Executive Committee , including the executive directors, the CEO, Openreach and other senior direct reports to the chief executive.\n\nProposed external directorships and other significant external interests must not: be to an organisation that is a BT competitor/ major supplier to BT; create a conflict of interest for the individual with his/her BT role; involve significant amounts of BT working hours nor impede the ability of the individual to perform their BT role; or involve disproportionate incentives or remuneration, with reference to the time commitment of the role.\n\nAny fees or other incentives arising from such appointments may be retained by the individual, subject to the amount being proportionate.\n\n## Previous AGM voting outcomes\n\nThe table below sets out the previous votes cast at the AGM in respect of the Annual remuneration report and the Policy.\n\n|                                    | For  % of   votes cast   Number   | Against  % of votes cast   Number   | Withheld   votes   Number   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Annual  remuneration report at the | 93.32                             | 6.68                                |                             |\n| 2020 AGM                           | 5,920,755,265                     | 423,941,635                         | 11,335,964                  |\n| Policy  at the                     | 95.04                             | 4.96                                |                             |\n| 2020 AGM                           | 6,036,920,089                     | 315,057,559                         | 4,101,574                   |\n\nWithheld votes are not counted when calculating voting outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration in context\n\n## Consideration of colleague and stakeholder views\n\nOur colleagues are vital to our business. At BT, we believe in fairness throughout the group. There are several general reward principles which we apply at all levels:\n\n- -  We will provide a competitive package with reference to the relevant market for each colleague\n- -  We will ensure colleagues can share in the success of the business, and through the operation of all-employee share plans, encourage colleagues to become shareholders\n- -  Where appropriate, variable remuneration is provided to incentivise employees towards driving the strategic aims of the business. Performance is based on both individual performance and the performance of the group, measured on a consistent basis for senior executives and the majority of other colleagues\n- -  We offer a range of employee benefits, many of which are available to all colleagues\n- -  We aim for transparency and a fair cascade of remuneration throughout the group\n- -  Employment conditions for all colleagues reflect our values and are commensurate with those of a large publicly listed company, including high standards of health and safety and equal opportunities.\n\nThe committee supports fairness and transparency of remuneration arrangements and the Policy has been designed to align with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across the wider group. To support this, the committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations.\n\nWhilst the committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining executive pay, the Board does receive feedback from employee surveys that take into account remuneration throughout the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe designated non-executive director for workforce engagement also updates the committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions.\n\nWhen setting executive directors' remuneration, the committee considers the remuneration of other senior managers and colleagues in the group more generally to ensure that arrangements for executive directors are appropriate in this context. When determining salary increases for executive directors, the committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the group.\n\n## Chief executive pay ratio\n\nThe table below sets out the chief executive pay ratios as at 31 March 2021, as well as those reported in respect of the prior two years. This report will build up over time to show a rolling tenyear period.\n\nThe ratios compare the single total figure of remuneration of the chief executive with the equivalent figures for the lower quartile (P25), median (P50) and upper quartile (P75) employees.\n\nA significant proportion of the chief executive's remuneration is delivered through long-term incentives, where awards are linked to share price movements over the longer term. This means that the ratios will depend significantly on long-term incentive outcomes and may fluctuate from year to year - for example, a higher total remuneration ratio was exhibited in 2020 due to the vesting of the chief executive's Worldpay buyout award. We believe that these ratios are appropriate given the size and complexity of the business, and are a fair reflection of our remuneration principles and practices.\n\nWe have used the 'Option B' methodology (based on gender pay reporting), as the most robust way to identify the individual reference points within an organisation with multiple operating segments.\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a32,444,000      | \u00a334,281                 | \u00a341,477                 | \u00a351,594                 | 71:1        | 59:1        | 47:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a33,248,012      | \u00a334,881                 | \u00a342,173                 | \u00a351,351                 | 93:1        | 77:1        | 63:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a32,628,107      | \u00a335,569                 | \u00a341,600                 | \u00a350,391                 | 74:1        | 63:1        | 52:1        |\n\n## Base salary\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a31,222,000      | \u00a330,090                 | \u00a335,918                 | \u00a341,740                 | 37:1        | 31:1        | 27:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,144                 | \u00a337,321                 | \u00a342,800                 | 35:1        | 29:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,842                 | \u00a335,606                 | \u00a342,836                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 26:1        |\n\nThe P25, P50 and P75 employees were identified from the company's gender pay reporting data, based on the April snapshot period at the start of each respective year. We then identified the 80 employees above and below each of the 'P' points to form enlarged groups. This approach is thought to be an appropriate representation - while there is a reasonable level of consistency given the size of the UK population, this methodology reduces volatility in the underlying data, and helps account for differences in the gender pay and pay ratio calculation methodologies. Other than the exclusion of a small\n\nnumber of data points for leavers and divestments, no other adjustments were made to the underlying data.\n\nThe total FTE remuneration paid during the year in question for each employee in each of the groups was then calculated, on the same basis as the information set out in the 'single figure' table for the chief executive. Bonus payments in respect of each year have been determined based on the latest available information at the time of analysis. The median total remuneration figure for each group was then used to determine the three ratios.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework . In addition the group financial statements are required under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs) to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU).\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of the group's profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- -  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- -  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent\n- -  for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the 2006 Act and IFRSs as adopted by the EU\n- -  for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- -  assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- -  use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 2006 Act. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors' report, directors' remuneration report and corporate governance statement that comply with such law and regulation.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Board in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- -  the financial statements , prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- -  the Strategic report and the Report of the Directors include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThis responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 12 May 2021 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n## Philip Jansen\n\nChief Executive\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief Financial Officer",

The Report of the Directors also encompasses the entirety of our Corporate governance report on pages 69 to 110 for the purpose of section 463 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). The Report of the Directors together with the Strategic report on pages 1 to 68 form the Management Report for the basis of DTR 4.1.5R.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and are set out on pages 124 and 125 of the consolidated financial statements . The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques, and have confirmed they are appropriate for the preparation of the 2020/21 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nAs far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 2006 Act) that hasn't been disclosed to the auditor. Each of the directors confirms that all steps have been taken that ought to have been taken to make them aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor has been made aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and revised FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Strategic report on pages 1 to 68 includes information on the group structure, strategy and business model, the performance of each customer-facing unit and the impact of regulation and competition. The Group performance section on pages 48 to 55 includes information on our group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and net debt, and balance sheet position. Notes 25, 26 and 28 of the consolidated financial statements include information on the group's investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, financial risk management objectives, hedging policies and exposure to interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and market risks.\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 59 to 66 including details of each risk and how we manage and mitigate them. The directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks affecting the group, including any that could threaten our business model, future performance, insolvency or liquidity.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on page 68, in estimating the financial impact for a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually, in combination and through probabilistic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2022, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's overall financial position\n\n(including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to emerging and principal risks.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a31.0bn and current asset investments of \u00a33.7bn. The group also had access to committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn. These facilities were undrawn at the period-end and are not subject to renewal until March 2026.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nThe Board has a procedure that allows directors to seek independent professional advice at BT's expense. All directors also have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and her nominated delegate.\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnity\n\nFor some years, BT has bought insurance cover for directors, officers and employees in positions of managerial supervision of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries. This is intended to protect against defence costs, civil damages and, in some circumstances, civil fines and penalties following an action brought against them in their personal capacity. The policy also covers individuals serving as directors of other companies or of joint ventures, or on boards of trade associations or charitable organisations at BT's request. The insurance protects the directors and officers directly in circumstances where, by law, BT cannot provide an indemnity. It also provides BT, subject to a retention, with cover against the cost of indemnifying a director or officer. One layer of insurance is ringfenced for the main directors of the company.\n\nAs at 12 May 2021, and throughout 2020/21, the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity for a group of people similar to the group covered by the above insurance. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where the individual is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.\n\nAs permitted by the company's Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by law, the company indemnifies each of its directors and other officers of the group against certain liabilities that may be incurred as a result of their positions with the group. The indemnity was in force throughout the tenure of each director during the last financial year, and is currently in force.\n\n## Interest of management in certain transactions\n\nDuring and at the end of 2020/21, none of BT's directors were materially interested in any material transaction in relation to the group's business. None are materially interested in any currently proposed material transactions.\n\n## Power to authorise conflicts\n\nAll directors have a duty under the 2006 Act to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the company. The company's Articles of Association include provisions for dealing with directors' conflicts of interest in accordance with the 2006 Act. The company has procedures in place, which it follows, to deal with such situations. These require the Board to:\n\n- -  consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts\n- -  consider the conflict situation in conjunction with its other duties under the 2006 Act\n- -  keep records and Board minutes on any authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given\n- -  regularly review conflict authorisation.\n\nThe company secretary maintains a conflicts of interest register.",

He owes duties to both BT and Deutsche Telekom, and the Conflicted Matters Committee helps him comply with his fiduciary duties, although ultimate responsibility rests with him.\n\n## Systems of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing the group's systems of risk management and internal control each year, and ensuring their effectiveness including in respect of relevant assurance activities. These systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risks we face that may prevent us achieving our business objectives and delivering our strategy. Any system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nOur group risk management framework assists the Board in carrying out its duties as set above. The framework has been in operation throughout the year and up to the date on which this document was approved.\n\nThe framework provides the business with the tools to take on the right risks and make smart risk decisions, supports the identification, assessment and management of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group and is an integral part of the company's annual strategic review cycle. The framework was also designed in accordance with the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.\n\nFurther information on our group risk management framework can be found under the section How we manage risk on pages 57 to 58.\n\nInternal audit carry out periodic assessments of the quality of risk management and control, promote effective risk management across all our units and report to management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the status of specific areas identified for improvement. We do not cover joint ventures and associates not controlled by the company in the scope of our group risk management framework. Such third parties are responsible for their own internal control assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit & Risk Committee , on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control across the group. Further details on how the Audit & Risk Committee fulfils these duties can be found on pages 82 to 84.\n\n## Capital management and funding policy\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating objectives, while investing in the business, supporting the pension fund and meeting our distribution policy.\n\nThe Board reviews the group's capital structure regularly. Management proposes actions which reflect the group's investment plans and risk characteristics, as well as the macroeconomic conditions in which we operate.\n\nOur funding policy is to raise and invest funds centrally to meet the group's anticipated requirements. We use a combination of capital market bond issuance, commercial paper borrowing and committed borrowing facilities to fund the group. When issuing debt, in order to avoid refinancing risk, group treasury will take into consideration the maturity profile of the group's debt portfolio as well as forecast cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for details of our treasury policy.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the group's financial risk management objectives, policies of the group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange are given in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Credit risk management policy\n\nWe take proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on our financial instruments. In managing investments and derivative financial instruments, the group's central treasury function monitors the credit quality across treasury counterparties and actively manages any exposures that arise. Management within the business units also actively monitors any exposures arising from trading balances.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nOther than the financial commitments and contingent liabilities disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements , there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on:\n\n- -  our financial condition\n- -  changes in financial condition\n- -  revenues or expenses\n- -  results of operations\n- -  liquidity\n- -  capital expenditure\n- -  capital resources.",

For further details of legal and regulatory proceedings to which the group is party please see note 31 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\nApart from the information disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements , the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group. In respect of each of the claims described in note 31, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group. Many factors prevent us from making these assessments with certainty, including that the proceedings or investigations are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and/or the frequently slow pace of litigation.\n\n## Other information - Listing Rules\n\nFor the purposes of the Listing Rule (LR) 9.8.4R, the information below is disclosed as follows:\n\n| Section information   | Page      |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| LR 9.8.4R(4)          | 49        |\n| LR 9.8.4R(12)         | See below |\n| LR 9.8.4R(13)         | See below |\n\nIn respect of LR 9.8.4R(12) and (13), the trustee of the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) agrees to waive dividends payable on the BT shares it holds for satisfying awards under the company's executive share plans.

EasyShare is administered by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. As at 10 May 2021 384m shares were held in EasyShare (3.85% of issued share capital (3.87% excluding treasury shares)) on behalf of BT shareholders\n- -  no person holds securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the company\n- -  our share registrar, Equiniti must receive proxy appointment and voting instructions not less than 48 hours before any general meeting (see also page 110)\n- -  the business of the company is managed by the Board. The powers of the company's directors are subject to UK legislation and the company's Articles of Association, and any requirement (consistent with UK legislation and the company's Articles of Association) approved by shareholders passing an ordinary resolution. The directors are authorised to issue and allot shares, and to undertake purchases of BT shares, subject to shareholder approval\n- -  we have no agreements with directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment as a result of a takeover. Similarly, there is no provision for this in our standard employee contracts\n- -  we are not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or on voting rights.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe company's current Articles of Association were adopted pursuant to a resolution passed at the AGM of the company held on 16 July 2020 and contain, amongst others, provisions on the rights and obligations attaching to the company's shares.

        "page_content": "## Directors' appointment, retirement and removal\n\nThe company's Articles of Association regulate the appointment and removal of directors, as does the 2006 Act and related legislation. The Board, and shareholders (by ordinary resolution), may appoint a person who is willing to be elected as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. At every AGM, all directors must automatically retire. A retiring director is eligible for election or re-election (as applicable). In addition to any power of removal under the 2006 Act, the shareholders can pass an ordinary resolution to remove a director.\n\nAdel Al-Saleh is appointed as a non-independent, nonexecutive director under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between BT and Deutsche Telekom. The appointment is terminable immediately by either party.\n\n## Share rights\n\n## (a) Voting rights\n\nOn a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.\n\nThere are no restrictions on exercising voting rights except in situations where the company is legally entitled to impose such a restriction (for example where a notice under section 793 of the 2006 Act has been served).\n\n## (b) Variation of rights\n\nWhenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either: (i) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or (ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class. The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company, which is governed by the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nEngaging with our colleagues takes many forms including through our annual Your Say survey, union/employee representative engagement, pulse surveys, the Colleague Board and regular colleague communications. Colleagues are kept well informed on matters such as the strategy and performance of the group, including after certain key events such as quarterly trading updates. Please see further details of the Colleague Board's activities on page 36 and the other means by which we engage with our colleagues on page 34.\n\nShare plans are used to encourage colleagues to have a stake in the future of the company. We annually consider which all-employee plans to offer both within the UK and globally. In 2020/21, we offered all colleagues based in the UK the opportunity to participate in a HMRC-approved save as you earn plan (saveshare) and a similar scheme for our colleagues based outside the UK (dependent on local laws). We also offered UK colleagues the opportunity to participate in a HMRC-approved share incentive plan (directshare). In June 2020 we launched the yourshare plan which utilised the free share element of the share incentive plan in the UK and conditional share awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninternationally. In June 2020, we granted all eligible colleagues \u00a3500 worth of BT shares (or a cash equivalent where there were geographical restrictions).\n\n## Employees with disabilities\n\nWe are an inclusive employer and actively encourage the recruitment, development, promotion and retention of people with a disability. We are a member of the Business Disability Forum and have well established global practices to support colleagues who have or acquire disabilities or health conditions during their employment. Our disability practices also include those colleagues who are employed by the company who have caring responsibilities.\n\nWe have established a Disability Rapid Action Plan across our business to help us make faster progress as part of our Valuable 500 commitments on disability inclusion. The plan is amplifying colleagues' voices through our Able2 People Network and helping us embed disability inclusion right across our business.\n\n## Political donations\n\nOur policy is that no company in the group will make contributions in cash or in kind to any political party, whether by gift or loan. However, the definition of political donations used in the 2006 Act is very much broader than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. For example, it could cover making members of Parliament and others in the political world aware of key industry issues and matters affecting the company, enhancing their understanding of the company.\n\nThe authority for political donations requested at the AGM is not intended to change this policy. It will, however, ensure that the group continues to act within the provisions of the 2006 Act requiring companies to obtain shareholder authority before they make donations to political parties and/or political organisations as defined in the 2006 Act. During 2020/21, the company's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, paid the costs of BT colleagues joining corporate days at (i) the Liberal Democrats party conference; and (ii) the Labour party conference. This year these costs totalled \u00a3922 (2019/20: \u00a39,967) which were significantly lower than last year as events were attended virtually. No company in the BT group made any loans to any political party.\n\n## Substantial shareholdings\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the company had received notice, under the DTRs, in respect of the following holdings of 3% or more of the voting rights in the issued ordinary share capital of the company:\n\n|                   | Date of notification   | Shares        | % of total  voting  rights   |\n|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|\n| T-Mobile Holdings | 23 March 2018          | 1,196,175,322 | 12.06%                       |\n| BlackRock, Inc.   | 27 January 2020        | 512,002,221   | 5.18%                        |\n| Norges Bank       | 6 January 2021         | 297,729,786   | 3.002%                       |\n\nAt 12 May 2021, the company had not received any further such notices under the DTRs.",

As at previous AGMs, we will take votes on all matters at the 2021 AGM on a poll.\n\nThe separate Notice of meeting 2021, which we send to all shareholders who have requested shareholder documents by post, contains the resolutions (with explanatory notes) which we will propose at the 2021 AGM on 15 July 2021.

Our opinion is unmodified\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of BT Group plc ('the Company') for the year ended 31 March 2021 which comprise the group income statement, group statement of comprehensive income, group balance sheet, group statement of changes in equity, group cash flow statement, company balance sheet, company statement of changes in equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies.\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- -  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2021 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- -  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies to the European Union;\n- -  the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and\n- -  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation to the extent applicable.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 11 July 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the three financial years ended 31 March 2021. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.\n\n## 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of certain unquoted investments in the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS)\n\nCertain unquoted investments in the BTPS: included within unquoted BTPS plan assets of \u00a318.0 billion (2020: \u00a320.3 billion)\n\n## Risk vs 2020:\n\nRefer to page 82 (Audit & Risk Committee Report), page 155 (note 20 accounting policy Retirement benefit plans) and pages 154 to 165 (disclosures note 20 Retirement benefit plans).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\nThe BTPS has unquoted plan assets in private equity, UK and overseas property, mature infrastructure, longevity insurance contracts, secure income and non-core credit assets. Significant judgement is required in determining the value of a portion of these unquoted investments which are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable.\n\nIn 2020, for certain private equity and non-core credit assets the latest asset valuations preceded the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on financial markets, and as such significant judgement was required to evaluate the market indices used by the Group to estimate adjustments to those asset valuations. The same level of market turbulence has not occurred in 2021, therefore the judgement required in evaluating the asset values has reduced.\n\nThe key unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of these plan assets includes estimated rental value for UK and overseas property, discount rates for mature infrastructure and certain secure income assets, discount rate and projected future mortality for the longevity insurance contract and estimated net asset values for private equity, non-core credit assets and certain secure income assets.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of unquoted plan assets in the BTPS has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 20) disclose the sensitivities of key assumptions for the valuation of certain unquoted plan assets estimated by the Group.\n\n## Our response - our procedures included:\n\nAssessing valuers' credentials: Evaluating the scope, competencies and objectivity of the Group's external experts who assisted in determining the key unobservable inputs and market indices listed above.\n\nAssessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the asset valuations to these assumptions.\n\n## Longevity insurance contract\n\nComparing valuations: Challenging, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, the fair value of the longevity insurance contract by comparing it to an independently developed range of fair values using assumptions, such as the discount rate and projected future mortality, based on external data.\n\n## Property/infrastructure and certain secure income assets\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the support of our own valuation specialists, the key unobservable inputs, such as estimated rental value and market value, used in determining the fair value of a sample of UK and overseas property assets, and discount rates used in determining the mature infrastructure and certain secure income assets by comparing them to discount rates for comparable external assets.",

The financial statements (note 20) disclose the sensitivity of key assumptions for the obligation estimated by the Group.\n\n## Our response - our procedures included:\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, the life expectancy of the members, price inflation and discount rates used to determine the defined benefit obligation against independently developed assumptions using external market data.\n\nAssessing actuaries' credentials: Evaluating the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group's external experts who assisted in determining the actuarial assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligation.\n\nAssessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the obligation to these assumptions.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the resulting estimate of the BTPS defined benefit obligation to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).\n\n## Accuracy of revenue due to the complexity of the billing systems\n\nCertain revenue streams: included within total revenue of \u00a321.3 billion (2020: \u00a322.9 billion)\n\nRisk vs 2020:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to pages 129 to 132 (financial disclosures note 5 Revenue).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Processing error\n\nBT non-long-term contract revenue consists of a large number of low value transactions. The Group operates a number of distinct billing systems and the IT landscape underpinning revenue and linking the billing systems together is complex.\n\nThere are multiple products sold at multiple rates with varying price structures in place. Products represent a combination of service based products, such as fixed line telephony, as well as goods, such as the provision of mobile handsets. There are monthly tariff charges.\n\nThe revenue recognition of non-long-term contract revenue is not subject to significant judgement. However, due to the large number of transactions and complexity of the billing systems, this is considered to be an area of most significance in our audit.\n\n## Our response\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\nProcess understanding: Obtaining an understanding of the revenue processes by observing transactions from customer initiation to cash received for certain material revenue streams.\n\nTest of details: Comparing a sample of revenue transactions, including credit notes, to supporting evidence e.g. customer bills, orders, price lists, contractual terms, proof of service and cash received (all where applicable).\n\nWe performed the detailed tests above rather than seeking to rely on the Group's controls because our knowledge of the design of these controls indicated that we would be unlikely to obtain the required evidence to support reliance on controls.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe considered revenue relating to non-long-term contract revenue to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).\n\n## Recoverability of parent company investment in subsidiaries and loans to group undertakings\n\nInvestment in subsidiary \u00a311,096 million (2020: \u00a311,024 million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Refer to page 189 (accounting policy Investments) and page 189 (financial disclosures note 2 Investments).\n\nLoans to group undertakings \u00a3972 million (2020: \u00a34,234 million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Refer to page 189 (accounting policy Impairment of financial assets).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Low risk, high value\n\nThe carrying amount of the parent company investment in subsidiary and the amount of loans to group undertakings represent 92% and 8% respectively (2020: 72% and 28% respectively), of the company's total assets.\n\nTheir recoverability is not considered a significant risk or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, these are considered to be the areas that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.",

However, as there have not been significant changes in the judgements taken in the current year, and no new matters with a high degree of estimation uncertainty, we have not assessed this as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.\n\n## 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\nMateriality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3105 million (2020: \u00a3115 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before tax from continuing operations normalised by averaging over the last 5 years due to fluctuations as a result of Covid-19 of \u00a32,359 million (2020: benchmark of group profit before tax from continuing operations of \u00a32,353 million), of which it represents 4.5% (2020: 4.9%).\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a395 million (2020: \u00a375 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of total assets, of which it represents 0.8% (2020: 0.5%), and chosen to be lower than materiality for the group financial statements as a whole.\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality was set at 65% (2020: 65%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a368 million (2020: \u00a375 million) for the group and \u00a361.75 million (2020: \u00a348 million) for the parent company. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the level of identified control deficiencies during the prior year.\n\nWe agreed to report the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a35.25 million (2020: \u00a35.5 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nIn the current year we reassessed how we define components of the group and have determined our audit scope predominately on a legal entity basis, rather than a Consumer Facing Unit/ Corporate Unit basis. Of the group's 233 (2020: seven) reporting components, we subjected four (2020: all) to full scope audits for group purposes. Work on the Group's entire property, plant and equipment balance was performed by the group audit team on behalf of the Group and component teams.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages:\n\n|                                      | Group  revenue   | Group  profit  before  tax   | Group total  assets   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Audits for group reporting  purposes | 87%              | 78%                          | 95%                   |\n| 2020                                 | 98%              | 97%                          | 100%                  |\n\nThe remaining 13% (2020: 2%) of total group revenue, 22% (2020: 3%) of group profit before tax and 5% (2020: 0%) of total group assets is represented by 229 (2020: nil) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 6% (2020: 2%) of any of total group revenue, group profit before tax or total group assets. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe work on all components, excluding the audit of BT Italy, was performed by the Group audit team. The parent company was also audited by the Group audit team. The group team instructed the BT Italy component auditor as to the significant areas to be covered, including the risks identified above and the information to be reported back.\n\nThe group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a325 million to \u00a390 million (2020: \u00a340 million to \u00a3110 million), having regard to the mix and size and risk profile of the Group across components.\n\nThe Group audit team met frequently on video conference meetings with the BT Italy component audit team as part of the audit planning and completion stages to explain our audit instructions and discuss the component auditor's plans as well as performing file reviews upon the completion of the component auditor's engagement.\n\nAt these meetings with the component auditor, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.\n\n## 4. Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').",

        "page_content": "We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- -  The impact of an additional lockdown as a result of Covid;\n- -  The impact of a complete ban on certain high-risk vendors;\n- -  The impact of a significant service interruption.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as a large scale cyber breach or adverse changes to telecoms regulation which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- -  we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- -  we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- -  we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and\n- -  the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 106 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## 5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- -  Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's highlevel policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- -  Reading Board, Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee minutes.\n- -  Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and directors including the EPS target for management remuneration.\n- -  Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, recent revisions to guidance and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because non-long-term contract revenues are not judgemental and consist of a high number of low value transactions, and longterm contracts are generally low in complexity with most having a revenue recognition profile aligned to billing.\n\nWe did not identify any additional fraud risks.\n\nWe performed procedures including:\n\n- -  Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management, those posted and approved by the same user and those posted to unusual or seldom used accounts.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of noncompliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent auditor's report to the members of BT Group plc continued\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's license to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, regulations affecting telecommunication providers, and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities (including compliance with Ofcom regulation) and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nWe discussed with the audit committee other matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- -  we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- -  in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- -  in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- -  the directors' confirmation within the Viability statement on page 68 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- -  the Emerging and Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- -  the directors' explanation in the Viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability statement, set out on page 68 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longerterm viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 9.

In addition, on 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.7p per share. These shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE. As a result of this transaction the merger reserve was credited with \u00a37,424m net of \u00a33m issue costs. Following settlement of intercompany loans by qualifying consideration of \u00a31,574m (2019/20: \u00a31,575m), equivalent balances were transferred from merger reserve to realised profit.\n- e  For further analysis of other reserves, see note 29.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Basis of preparation\n\n## Preparation of the financial statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements are also prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on page 68, in estimating the financial impact for a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually, in combination and through probabilistic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the group and parent company financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2022, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's and parent company's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks.\n\nThese financial statements consolidate BT Group plc, the parent company, and its subsidiaries (together the 'group', 'us', 'we' or 'our').\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of BT Group plc.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThe following amended standards and interpretations were also effective during the year, however, they have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n- -  Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n- -  Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)\n- -  Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)\n- -  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)\n- -  Extension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4)\n- -  Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)\n\n## New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective\n\nThe following new or amended standards and interpretations are applicable in future periods but are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- -  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)\n\nThe replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) with Alternative Reference Rates (ARAs) will begin from December 2021. Where floating interest bearing receivables and payables exist (currently based on IBORs) the Group will apply suitable replacement benchmark rates and account for the instruments in accordance with the amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (Phase 1) and 2020 (Phase 2). The adoption of these amendments and the transition to ARAs are expected to have an immaterial financial impact. The implications on the trading results of our segments of IBOR reform have also been assessed and the expected impact is immaterial. The Group is preparing to move to the new benchmark rates in accordance with timelines as per regulatory guidelines.\n\n## Presentation of specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items ('adjusted'). The directors believe that presentation of our results in this way is relevant to an understanding of our financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our trading results. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.\n\nSpecific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include acquisitions/disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years. In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items.\n\nSpecific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 9.\n\n## Adjustments to prior year disclosures due to internal reorganisations\n\nOn 1 April 2020, Supply Chain and Pelipod, which serve several parts of BT, were transferred from Enterprise to the central procurement team and as a result will now be reported in Group 'Other' financial results. This did not impact the primary financial statements. In 2019/20 the impact on segmental revenue was a reduction in Enterprise segmental revenue of \u00a3141m and an increase in Other segmental revenue of \u00a328m. The prior year comparatives for Enterprise and Other CFU results have been restated to reflect this. Refer to Notes 4, 5, 7 and 17.",

Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying our accounting policies. We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience. As the use of estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates that carry a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We also make other key estimates when preparing the financial statements, which, while not meeting the definition of a critical estimate, involve a higher degree of complexity and can reasonably be expected to be of relevance to a user of the financial statements. Management has discussed its critical and other key accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit & Risk Committee .\n\nSignificant judgements are those made by management in applying our significant accounting policies that have a material impact on the amounts presented in the financial statements. We may exercise significant judgement in our critical and key accounting estimates.\n\nOur critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements are described in the following notes to the financial statements. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\n| Note                                                          | Critical  estimate   | Key  estimate   | Significant  judgement   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 10.

Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are set out below. Other significant accounting policies applicable to a particular area are disclosed in the most relevant note. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\nWe have applied all policies consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries, and include its share of the results of associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The group recognises its direct rights to (and its share of) jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations under the appropriate headings in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. No material acquisitions were made in the year.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another entity, known as the parent or investor. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries, which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original business combination and noncontrolling share of changes in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the group's financial statements.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from and up to the date of change of control. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned with the policies adopted by the group. All intra-group transactions including any gains or losses, balances, income or expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nWhen the group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements continued\n\n## Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment to be sold to customers are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value, taking into account expected revenue from the sale of packages comprising a mobile handset and a subscription. Cost corresponds to purchase or production cost determined by either the first in first out (FIFO) or average cost method.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with the grants have been complied with and the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase or production of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the related assets and reduce future depreciation expense accordingly. Grants for the reimbursement of operating expenditure are deducted from the related category of costs in the income statement. Estimates and judgements applied in accounting for government grants received in respect of the BDUK programme and other rural superfast broadband contracts are described in note 14.\n\nOnce a government grant is recognised, any related deferred income is treated in accordance with IAS 20 'Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance'.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effects of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign undertakings are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference associated with the undertaking in the translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure, including the cost of internally developed software, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group from the asset being developed, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.\n\nCapitalisation ceases when the asset being developed is ready for use. Research and development costs include direct and indirect labour, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits (leaver costs) are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. We recognise termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to the affected employees leaving the group.",

Segment information\n\nSignificant accounting policies that apply to segment information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating and reportable segments\n\nOur operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Executive Committee , which is the key management committee and represents the 'chief operating decision maker'.\n\nOur organisational structure reflects the different customer groups to which we provide communications products and services via our customer-facing units (CFUs): Consumer, Enterprise, Global and Openreach. The customer-facing units are supported by an internal service unit, Technology, and corporate units including procurement and property management.\n\nThe customer-facing units are our reportable segments and generate substantially all of our revenue. Technology and the group's corporate units are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' for any of the years presented.\n\nWe aggregate the remaining operations and include within the 'Other' category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group. The 'Other' category includes unallocated Technology costs and our corporate units.\n\n## Allocation of certain items to segments\n\nProvisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the 'Other' segment. On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the results of the relevant customer-facing unit and offset in the group results through the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the 'Other' segment. Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the definition of specific items as detailed in note 9.\n\nThe costs incurred by Technology and corporate units are recharged to the customer-facing units to reflect the services it provides to them. Depreciation and amortisation incurred by Technology in relation to the networks and systems it manages and operates on behalf of the customer-facing units is allocated to the customer-facing units based on their respective utilisation. Capital expenditure incurred by Technology for specific projects undertaken on behalf of the customer-facing units is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred. Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular customer-facing unit, capital expenditure is allocated between them based on the proportion of estimated future economic benefits.\n\nSpecific items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reflects how they are reported to the Executive Committee . Finance expense and income are not allocated to the reportable segments, as the central treasury function manages this activity, together with the overall net debt position of the group.\n\n## Measuring segment performance\n\nPerformance of each reportable segment is measured based on adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items, net non-interest related finance expense, and share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the customer-facing units because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specific items, which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nOur revenue recognition policy is set out in the following note.\n\n## Internal revenue and costs\n\nMost of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing units, including the use of BT Ireland's network. This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through Technology which is included within the 'Other' segment. Enterprise internal revenue arises from Consumer for mobile Ethernet access and Technology for transmission planning services. Internal revenue arising in Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services. Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price. Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant customer-facing units and therefore the profitability of customer-facing units may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.\n\n## Geographic segmentation\n\nThe UK is our country of domicile and we generate the majority of our revenue from external customers in the UK. The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country of origin in which the customer is invoiced. The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which exclude derivative financial instruments, investments and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.",

The consideration specified in the contract with the customer is allocated to each performance obligation identified based on their relative standalone selling prices, and is recognised as revenue as they are satisfied.\n\nThe table below summarises the performance obligations we have identified for our major service lines and provides information on the timing of when they are satisfied and the related revenue recognition policy. Also detailed in this note is revenue expected to be recognised in future periods for contracts in place at 31 March 2021 that contain unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n| Service line                  | Performance obligations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ICT and managed  networks     | Provision of networked IT services, managed  network services, and arrangements to design   and build software solutions.

Revenue continued\n\nWe recognise revenue based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Determining the standalone selling price often requires judgement and may be derived from regulated prices, list prices, a cost-plus derived price, or the price of similar products when sold on a standalone basis by BT or a competitor. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the contract price when this represents a bespoke price that would be the same for a similar customer in a similar circumstance.\n\nThe fixed access and mobile subscription arrangements sold by our Consumer business is typically payable in advance, with any variable or one-off charges billed in arrears. Payment is received immediately for direct sales of equipment to customers. Where equipment is provided to customers under mobile and fixed access subscription arrangements, payment for the equipment is received over the course of the contract term. For sales by our enterprise businesses, invoices are issued in line with contractual terms. Payments received in advance are recognised as contract liabilities, amounts billed in arrears are recognised as contract assets.\n\nVariable consideration arising from contracts where services have been performed but customer acceptance has not yet been received are not recognised until it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nWe are applying the practical expedient to recognise revenue 'as-invoiced' for certain fixed access and mobile subscription services revenues. Where we have a right to invoice at an amount that directly corresponds with performance to date, we recognise revenue at that amount. We have also adopted the practical expedient not to calculate the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied for these contracts.\n\nWe do not have any material obligations in respect of returns, refunds or warranties. Where we act as an agent in a transaction, such as insurance services offered, we recognise commission net of directly attributable costs. Where the actual and estimated costs to completion of the contract exceed the estimated revenue, a loss is recognised immediately.\n\nWe exercise judgement in assessing whether the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contracts are distinct from the other services to be delivered under the contract and therefore represent distinct performance obligations. This determines whether revenue is recognised in the early stages of the contract, or deferred until delivery of the other services promised in the contract begins.\n\nWe recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable. If these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable. We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate. Key factors reviewed include:\n\n- -  Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.\n- -  Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.\n- -  The status of commercial relations with customers and the implications for future revenue and cost projections.\n- -  Our estimates of future staff and third-party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.\n\n## Revenue from lease arrangements in scope of IFRS 16\n\nSome consumer broadband and TV products and arrangements to provide external communications providers with exclusive use of fixed-network telecommunications infrastructure meet the definition of operating leases under IFRS 16.\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contact is, or contains a lease following the accounting policy set out in note 15. Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease in which we act as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases at lease inception based on an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case then the lease is a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. For sub-leases, we make this assessment by reference to the characteristics of the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease rather than the underlying leased asset.\n\nIncome from arrangements classified as operating leases is presented as revenue where it relates to our core operating activities, for example leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers and leases of devices to consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription products. Operating lease income from other arrangements is presented within other operating income (note 6).\n\nWe recognise operating lease payments as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any upfront payments received, such as connection fees, are deferred over the lease term. Determining the lease term is subject to the significant judgements set out in note 15.\n\nWhere the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the transaction price is allocated between the components on the basis of relative stand-alone selling price.\n\nWhere an arrangement is assessed as a finance lease we derecognise the underlying asset and recognise a receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease. The receivable is measured based on future payments to be received discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, adjusted for any direct costs. Any difference between the derecognised asset and the finance lease receivable is recognised in the income statement. Where the nature of services delivered relates to our core operating activities it is presented as revenue. Where it relates to non-core activities it is presented within other operating income (note 6).",

Of this, \u00a37,415m (2019/20: \u00a38,191m) relates to ICT and managed services contracts and equipment and other services which will substantially be recognised as revenue within three years. Fixed access and mobile subscription services typically have shorter contract periods and so \u00a35,902m (2019/20: restated \u00a36,057m) will substantially be recognised as revenue within two years.\n\nRevenue recognised this year relating to performance obligations that were satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous years was not material. Revenue related to customers' unexercised rights (for example, unused amounts on prepaid SIM cards) was not material.\n\n## Lease income\n\nPresented within revenue is \u00a32,496m (2019/20: \u00a32,297m) income from arrangements classified as operating leases under IFRS 16 and which represent core business activities for the group. Income relates predominantly to Openreach's leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers, classified as fixed access subscription revenue in the table above, and leases of devices to Consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription offerings, classified as equipment and other services.\n\nDuring the year we also recognised \u00a336m (2019/20: \u00a341m) operating lease income from non-core business activities which is presented in other operating income (note 6). This income relates primarily to sub-leases of unutilised properties.\n\nNote 15 presents an analysis of payments to be received across the remaining term of operating lease arrangements.\n\nDuring the year we renegotiated a non-strategic revenue contract delivered using elements of our leased buildings infrastructure, in exchange for an up-front payment of \u00a3196m. The revised arrangement, previously classified as an operating sub-lease, was reassessed as a finance sub-lease in line with the accounting policy set out above. We derecognised the \u00a3208m carrying amount of the associated right-of-use asset and a net deferred income balance of \u00a333m previously reported within trade and other payables, and recognised in revenue a gain on disposal of \u00a321m, consistent with the presentation of the previous operating lease income. No further amounts are due, therefore no finance lease receivable was recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These assets mainly relate to mobile handsets provided upfront but paid for over the course of a contract. Contract assets are reclassified as receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional and we have billed the customer.\n\nContract liabilities are recognised when we have received advance payment for goods and services that we have not transferred to the customer.

Conversely a contract liability is recognised where these activities are not distinct performance obligations and we receive upfront consideration. In this case eligible costs associated with delivering these services are capitalised as fulfilment costs, see note 17.\n\nWe provide for expected lifetime losses on contract assets following the policy set out in note 17.\n\nContract assets and liabilities recognised are as follows:\n\n| Year ended 31 March   | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Contract assets       |            |            |\n| Current               | 1,515      | 1,442      |\n| Non-current           | 344        | 279        |\n|                       | 1,859      | 1,721      |\n| Contract liabilities  |            |            |\n| Current               | 925        | 972        |\n| Non-current           | 167        | 179        |\n|                       | 1,092      | 1,151      |\n\n\u00a3886m of the contract liability recognised at 31 March 2021 was recognised as revenue during the year (2019/20: \u00a31,094m).

Specific items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include acquisitions/disposals of businesses and investments, retrospective regulatory matters, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items.\n\nIn 2019/20 we included the impacts of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items as at 31 March 2020 as specific. Any releases to this provision have been released through specific items in 2020/21. The impact of Covid-19 on underlying trading is recognised in our underlying (adjusted) results and not as a specific item.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                               | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                           |            |           |\n| Retrospective regulatory matters                  | 39         | (81)      |\n|                                                   | 39         | (81)      |\n| Operating costs                                   |            |           |\n| Retrospective regulatory matters                  | (4)        | 9         |\n| Restructuring charges                             | 421        | 322       |\n| Settlement with Dixons Carphone                   | 149        | -         |\n| Sale of spectrum                                  | (66)       | -         |\n| Divestment-related items                          | (60)       | 199       |\n| Property rationalisation                          | 19         | (131)     |\n| Covid-19                                          | (17)       | 95        |\n| Spectrum annual licence fee refund                | -          | (82)      |\n| Provision for claims                              | -          | (5)       |\n| Italian business investigation                    | -          | 2         |\n|                                                   | 442        | 409       |\n| Operating loss                                    | 481        | 328       |\n| Net finance expense                               |            |           |\n| Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation | 18         | 145       |\n| Interest on spectrum annual licence fee refund    | -          | (5)       |\n|                                                   | 18         | 140       |\n| Associates and joint ventures                     | -          | 39        |\n| Net specific items charge before tax              | 499        | 507       |\n| Taxation                                          |            |           |\n| Tax credit on specific items above                | (96)       | (73)      |\n| Tax charge on re-measurement of deferred tax      | -          | 156       |\n|                                                   | (96)       | 83        |\n| Net specific items charge after tax               | 403        | 590       |\n\n## Retrospective regulatory matters\n\nWe recognised a net charge of \u00a335m (2019/20: net credit of \u00a372m) in relation to regulatory matters. This reflects the settlement of various matters. Of this, \u00a339m charge is recognised in revenue and \u00a34m credit in operating costs.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\nWe incurred charges of \u00a3421m (2019/20: \u00a3322m), primarily relating to leaver costs. These costs reflect projects within the next stage of our group-wide modernisation programme, as announced in May 2020, which will deliver annualised gross benefits of \u00a31bn by March 2023 and \u00a32bn by March 2025, with a \u00a31.3bn one-off cost to achieve across the five years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specific items continued\n\n## Settlement with Dixons Carphone\n\nIn March 2021, following the expiry of the retail agreement between Dixons Carphone and EE Limited earlier in the year, we mutually agreed to resolve all outstanding matters which primarily related to contingent revenue share costs that could have previously been recognised over future years. The associated cost of \u00a3149m which includes the agreed cash payment and the write off of balance sheet prepayments and accruals has been treated as a specific item in the full year 2021 results. The associated cash payment was made in April 2021 and will be reflected in the 2021/22 financial statements.\n\n## Sale of spectrum\n\nIn the year, we sold 25 MHz of unpaired 2.6 GHz spectrum and recognised a gain on disposal of \u00a366m (2019/20: \u00a3nil) as a specific item.\n\n## Divestment-related items\n\nIn May 2020 we completed the sale of our Spanish operations and recorded a net gain of \u00a380m. We incurred net losses on the disposals of our operations in Latin America and France of \u00a311m. We recognised an additional \u00a34m loss on disposal of a number of other businesses and \u00a35m of costs relating to ongoing divestment projects.\n\nIn 2019/20 we recognised impairment charges of \u00a3127m on reclassification of our operations in Spain, France and Latin America as held for sale, losses on disposal of \u00a336m relating to the completed divestments of BT Fleet Solutions and Tikit, and a further \u00a336m of costs relating to ongoing divestment projects.\n\n## Property rationalisation costs\n\nWe recognised a charge of \u00a319m (2019/20: net credit of \u00a3131m) relating to the rationalisation of the group's property portfolio under our Better Workplace Programme. The 2019/20 credit included the gain on sale of BT Centre of \u00a3115m.\n\n## 10. Taxation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to taxation\n\nCurrent income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income. We periodically evaluate positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation, and establish provisions where appropriate on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nIn 2019/20 we recognised one-off charges of \u00a395m relating to the impact of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items. In 2020/21 \u00a317m has been released through the income statement as a specific item. At 31 March 2021 we retain \u00a355m of provisions relating to Covid-19.\n\n## Spectrum annual licence fee refund\n\nIn 2019/20 we received a payment of \u00a387m including interest of \u00a35m from Ofcom, relating to overpaid fees that were charged during the period 2015-2017 under the previous 2015 fees regulation that was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2017.\n\n## Provision for claims\n\nIn 2019/20 we recognised a credit of \u00a35m in relation to release of provisions for claims created through specific items in 2012/13 which were fully settled.\n\n## Italian business investigation\n\nIn 2019/20 we recognised \u00a32m costs relating to the historical investigation in our Italian business.\n\n## Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation\n\nDuring the year we incurred \u00a318m (2019/20: \u00a3145m) of interest costs in relation to our defined benefit pension obligations.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nIn 2019/20, following renegotiation of a contract, \u00a339m owed by an associate was determined irrecoverable and the resulting impairment recognised as a specific item.\n\n## Tax on specific items\n\nA net tax credit of \u00a396m (2019/20: net tax credit of \u00a373m) was recognised in relation to specific items. In 2019/20, legislation was enacted to maintain the UK corporation tax rate at 19%. Accordingly the group re-measured its deferred tax balances which resulted in a charge of \u00a3156m.",

Taxation continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for taxation\n\nWe seek to pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business. However, in some areas these laws are unclear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation. We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases. Our key uncertainties are whether EE's tax losses will be available to us, whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes. We provide for the predicted outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates. Approximately 79% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months. \u00a3200m (2019/20: \u00a3191m) is included in current tax liabilities or offset against current tax assets where netting is appropriate.\n\nUnder a downside case an additional amount of \u00a3572m could be required to be paid, of which \u00a3474m would relate to EE losses. This amount is not provided as we don't consider this outcome to be probable.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental. We only recognise them when we consider it is probable that they can be recovered. In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.\n\nThe value of the group's income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the group balance sheet on page 120. The value of the group's deferred tax assets and liabilities is disclosed below.\n\n## Analysis of our taxation expense for the year\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                               | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| United Kingdom                                                    |            |            |\n| Corporation tax at 19% (2019/20: 19%)                             | (300)      | (495)      |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years                           | 6          | 41         |\n| Non-UK taxation                                                   |            |            |\n| Current                                                           | (65)       | (58)       |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years                           | 6          | (1)        |\n| Total current tax (expense)                                       | (353)      | (513)      |\n| Deferred taxation                                                 |            |            |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                 | 6          | 55         |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years                           | 12         | -          |\n| Impact of change in UK corporation tax rate to 19% (2019/20: 19%) | -          | (156)      |\n| Remeasurement of temporary differences                            | 3          | (5)        |\n| Total deferred taxation credit/(expense)                          | 21         | (106)      |\n| Total taxation (expense)                                          | (332)      | (619)      |\n\n## Factors affecting our taxation expense for the year\n\nThe taxation expense on the profit for the year differs from the amount computed by applying the UK corporation tax rate to the profit before taxation as a result of the following factors:\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                      | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Profit before taxation                                                   | 1,804      | 2,353      |\n| Expected taxation expense at UK rate of 19% (2019/20: 19%, 2018/19: 19%) | (343)      | (447)      |\n| Effects of:                                                              |            |            |\n| Lower/(higher) taxes on non-UK profits                                   | 15         | (5)        |\n| Net permanent differences between tax and accounting\u00aa                    | (34)       | (40)       |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years b                                | 24         | 40         |\n| Prior year non-UK losses used against current year profits               | 12         | 11         |\n| Non-UK losses not recognised c                                           | (9)        | (17)       |\n| Re-measurement of deferred tax balances                                  | 3          | (161)      |\n| Total taxation expense                                                   | (332)      | (619)      |\n| Exclude specific items (note 9)                                          | (96)       | 83         |\n| Total taxation expense before specific items                             | (428)      | (536)      |\n\n- a  Includes income that is not taxable or UK income taxable at a different rate, and expenses for which no tax relief is received.

        "page_content": "## 10. Taxation continued\n\n## What factors affect our future tax charges?\n\nThe Chancellor's Budget on 3 March 2021 announced a UK corporation tax rate increase from 19% to 25%, effective from 1 April 2023. As this rate change was not substantively enacted as at 31 March 2021, deferred tax assets and liabilities in these financial statements continue to be measured at 19%, the enacted rate at which they are expected to reverse. In the event that the rate change is enacted, BT Group estimates that the impact of revaluing existing deferred tax assets and liabilities will be a \u00a30.4bn income statement charge and a \u00a30.3bn credit to other comprehensive income, if the rate change is theoretically applied to the deferred tax balances at 31 March 2021.\n\n## What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?\n\nAt 31 March 2021 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a34.1bn (2019/20: \u00a34.5bn). Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below:\n\n| At 31 March 2021              | \u00a3m    | Expiry      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Restricted losses             |       |             |\n| Europe                        | 1     | 2022 - 2025 |\n| Americas                      | 409   | 2022 - 2045 |\n| Other                         | 3     | 2022 - 2030 |\n| Total restricted losses       | 413   |             |\n| Unrestricted operating losses | 3,302 | No expiry   |\n| Other temporary differences   | 360   | No expiry   |\n| Total                         | 4,075 |             |\n\nAt 31 March 2021 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a316.8bn (2019/20: \u00a316.9bn). These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of significant amounts of these losses to be remote.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were \u00a31.8bn (2019/20: \u00a32.5bn). No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise. Under current tax rules, tax of \u00a343m (2019/20: \u00a336.0m) would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.\n\n## 11. Earnings per share\n\n## How is earnings per share calculated?\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                  | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic weighted average number of shares (millions)   | 9,905  | 9,885  |\n| Dilutive shares from share options (millions)        | 30     | -      |\n| Dilutive shares from share awards (millions)         | 137    | 80     |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) | 10,072 | 9,965  |\n| Basic earnings per share                             | 14.8 p | 17.5 p |\n| Diluted earnings per share                           | 14.6 p | 17.4 p |\n\nThe earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests. Profit after tax was \u00a31,472m (2019/20: \u00a31,734m) and profit after tax attributable to noncontrolling interests was \u00a33m (2019/20: \u00a32m). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.\n\n## 12. Dividends\n\n## What dividends have been paid?\n\nNo dividend is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021 (2019/20: no final dividend paid, interim dividend of 4.62p per share amounting to \u00a3457m paid on 3 February 2020).\n\nThe amount of \u00a31,521m for total dividends paid in the prior year ended 31 March 2020 is disclosed in our statement of changes in equity and analysed below. This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to intangible assets\n\nWe recognise identifiable intangible assets where we control the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the group, and we can reliably measure the cost of the asset. We amortise all intangible assets, other than goodwill, over their useful economic life. The method of amortisation reflects the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight line method is used.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) of the acquired business. Our goodwill impairment policy is set out later in this note.\n\n## Acquired intangible assets - customer relationships and brands\n\nIntangible assets such as customer relationships or brands acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of these relationships or brands and include management's estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by them.\n\n## Telecommunications licences\n\nLicence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period or where our usage can extend beyond the initial licence period, over the period we expect to benefit from the use of the licences, which is typically 20 years. Licences acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. The fair value is based on management's assumption of future cash flows using market expectations at acquisition date.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software comprises computer software licences purchased from third parties, and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost. We only capitalise costs directly associated with the production of internally developed software, including direct and indirect labour costs of development, where it is probable that the software will generate future economic benefits, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs which do not meet these criteria and research costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nOur development costs which give rise to internally developed software include upgrading the network architecture or functionality and developing service platforms aimed at offering new services to our customers.\n\n## Other\n\nOther intangible assets include website development costs and other licences. Items are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life or the term of the contract.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful economic lives assigned to the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- -  Computer software\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- -  Telecommunications licences\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n- -  Customer relationships and brands\n\n1 to 15 years\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash generating unit and the fair value less costs to dispose.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as described below. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, as a specific item. If a cash generating unit is impaired, impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro-rata basis against intangible and other assets.",

On reclassification to held for sale, goodwill associated with the France and Latin America disposals was impaired by \u00a358m, and other intangible assets associated with these disposals were impaired by \u00a31m. See note 23.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to impairment of goodwill\n\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment review.\n\nGoodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit (CGU) level. These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Our CGUs are deemed to be legacy BT Consumer, legacy EE, Enterprise, and Global.\n\nWe allocate goodwill to each of the CGUs that we expect to benefit from the business combination. Each CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period. They reflect management's expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance. Cash flows beyond the fifth year have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in reviewing goodwill for impairment\n\n## Determining our CGUs\n\nThe determination of our CGUs is judgemental. The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows. This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams. The legacy BT Consumer and EE CGUs remain as two separate CGUs due to their having independent cash flows.\n\n## Estimating value in use\n\nOur value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including management's expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows, and the discount rate for each CGU. Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are based on our latest Board-approved five-year financial plans. Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\nWe tested our goodwill for impairment as at 31 March 2021. The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.\n\nLegacy BT\n\n| Cost                              | Consumer  \u00a3m   | Legacy EE  \u00a3m   | Enterprise a \u00a3m   | Global  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| At 1 April 2019                   | 1,183          | 2,768           | 3,509             | 546          | 8,006       |\n| Exchange differences              | -              | -               | 4                 | 48           | 52          |\n| Acquisitions and disposals        | -              | -               | (30)              | -            | (30)        |\n| Transfers to assets held for sale | -              | -               | -                 | (83)         | (83)        |\n| At 31 March 2020                  | 1,183          | 2,768           | 3,483             | 511          | 7,945       |\n| Exchange differences              | -              | -               | (8)               | (100)        | (108)       |\n| Acquisitions and disposals        | -              | -               | -                 | 1            | 1           |\n| At 31 March 2021                  | 1,183          | 2,768           | 3,475             | 412          | 7,838       |\n\n- a  On 1 April 2020, Supply Chain and Pelipod, which serve several parts of BT, were transferred from Enterprise to the central procurement team and as a result will now be reported in Group 'Other' financial results. Goodwill was not affected by the transfer.\n\nThe decrease in goodwill is driven by foreign exchange losses.\n\n## What discount rate have we used?\n\nThe pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the calculation of the group's weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data. The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2020/21 was 8.1% (2019/20: 8.0%). We have used the same discount rate for all CGUs except Global where we have used 8.5% (2019/20: 8.6%) reflecting higher risk in some of the countries in which Global operates.\n\n## What growth rates have we used?\n\nThe perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets. None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected average long-term growth rates for those markets or sectors. We used a perpetuity growth rate of 2.3% (2019/20: 2.4%) for Global and 2.0% (2019/20: 2.0%) for Enterprise and our legacy BT Consumer and EE CGUs.\n\n## What sensitivities have we applied?\n\nThere is significant headroom in all of our CGUs. The CGU with the lowest headroom is legacy Consumer.\n\nFor legacy Consumer, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately \u00a32.2bn (2019/20: \u00a32.5bn). Any of the following changes in assumptions in isolation would cause the recoverable amount for the CGU to equal its carrying amount:\n\n- -  A reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from our 2.0% assumption to a revised assumption of a perpetuity decline rate of 2.7%;\n- -  An increase in the discount rate from our 8.1% assumption to a revised assumption of 11.8%; or\n- -  Shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 39.3% each year and in perpetuity.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Has Covid-19 had a material impact on the impairment assessment?\n\nCovid-19 is not considered to have a significant impact on the assessment of impairment as at 31 March 2021. Its impact on the group is considered to be relatively short-term, and it is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the terminal year which is a key driver of our value in use calculations.\n\n## 14. Property, plant and equipment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to property, plant and equipment\n\nOur property, plant and equipment is included at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation, government grants and any impairment charges. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for on the same basis as our existing assets. We derecognise items of property, plant and equipment on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the date of disposal is recognised in operating costs in the income statement.\n\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure and equipment are direct and indirect labour costs, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis from the time the asset is available for use, to write off the asset's cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\n- -  Freehold buildings\n\n14 to 50 years\n\n- -  Short-term leasehold improvements  Shorter of 10 years or lease term\n- -  Leasehold land and buildings\n\nUnexpired portion of lease or 40 years, whichever is the shorter\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nTransmission equipment\n\n- -  Duct\n\n40 years\n\n- -  Cable\n\n3 to 25 years\n\n- -  Fibre\n\n5 to 20 years\n\nExchange equipment\n\n2 to 13 years\n\nOther network equipment\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n## Other assets\n\n- -  Motor vehicles\n\n2 to 9 years\n\n- -  Computers and office equipment\n\n3 to 7 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are recognised prospectively.\n\n## Network share assets\n\nCertain assets have been contributed to a network share arrangement by both EE and Hutchison 3G UK Limited, with legal title remaining with the contributor. This is considered to be a reciprocal arrangement. Our share of the assets on acquisition of EE were recognised at fair value within tangible assets, and depreciated in line with policy. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\nWe test property, plant and equipment for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, we assess the recoverable amount by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant asset and the fair value less costs to dispose. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for the individual asset then we assess impairment by reference to the relevant cash generating unit as described in note 13.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Building Digital UK (BDUK) government grants\n\nWe receive government grants in relation to the BDUK programme and other rural superfast broadband contracts. Where we have achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, we have an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding. Where this is the case, we recognise deferred income in respect of the funding that will be re-invested or repaid, and make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment.\n\nAssessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable. Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long-term take-up trend.\n\nOur assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up. The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 18.\n\nAssets in\n\n|                                    | Land and  buildings  \u00a3m   | Network  infrastructure  \u00a3m   | Other a \u00a3m   | course of  construction  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| Cost                               |                           |                               |              |                               |             |\n| At 1 April 2019                    | 1,026                     | 51,893                        | 1,722        | 1,191                         | 55,832      |\n| Additions b                        | 7                         | 83                            | 69           | 2,978                         | 3,137       |\n| Transfers                          | 25                        | 3,244                         | 17           | (3,295)                       | (9)         |\n| Disposals and adjustments c        | (55)                      | (1,132)                       | (130)        | 42                            | (1,275)     |\n| Transfer to assets held for sale d | (69)                      | (255)                         | (24)         | -

Leases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to leases\n\n## Identifying whether a lease exists\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A lease exists if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for consideration. In making this assessment, we consider whether:\n\n- -  The contract involves the use of an identified asset, either explicitly or implicitly. The asset must be physically distinct or represent substantially all the capacity of a physically distinct asset. Assets that a supplier has a substantive right to substitute are not considered distinct.\n- -  The lessee (either the group, or the group's customers) has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n- -  The lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset, in other words, has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nWhere practicable, and by class of underlying asset, we have elected to account for leases containing a lease component and one or more non-lease components as a single lease component. Where this election has been taken, it has been applied to the entire asset.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nWe recognise a lease liability and right-of-use asset at the commencement of a lease.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are due over the lease term, discounted using the group's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for the impact of any extension options that we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise, or termination options that we are reasonably certain the lessee will not exercise.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is the rate that we would have to pay for a loan of a similar term, and with similar security, to obtain an asset of similar value.\n\nLease payments include:\n\n- -  fixed payments\n- -  variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate\n- -  amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees\n- -  the exercise price of any purchase options that we are reasonably certain to exercise\n- -  payments due over optional renewal periods where we are reasonably certain to renew\n- -  penalties for early termination of the lease where we are reasonably certain to terminate early",

Leases continued\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments, including changes in the index or rate used to determine those payments, or the amount we expect to be payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWe also remeasure lease liabilities where the lease term changes. This occurs when the non-cancellable period of the lease changes, or on occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances within the control of the lessee and which changes our initial assessment in regard to whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options. Where the lease term changes we remeasure the lease liability using the group's incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment. Where a significant event or change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term remains unchanged and the carrying amounts of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset will decline over time.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at the initial amount of the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepaid lease payments, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any decommissioning costs that have been recognised as provisions, less any lease incentives received. They are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment following the policy set out in note 14 and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nWe have elected not to recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases of low-value assets with a purchase price under \u00a35,000. We recognise lease payments associated with these items as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAny variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as usage-based payments, are recognised as an expense in the period to which the variability relates.\n\nDuring the year we made limited use of the practical expedient available under IFRS 16 when accounting for Covid-19 related rent concessions. Its use had a negligible impact on the amounts that otherwise have been recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Significant judgements made in accounting for leases\n\nThe lease term is a key determinant of the size of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised where the group acts as lessee; and the deferral period for any upfront connection charges where the group acts as lessor. Determining the lease term requires judgement to evaluate whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options. Key facts and circumstances that create an incentive to exercise those options are considered, these include:\n\n- -  Our anticipated operational, retail and office property requirements in the mid and long-term.\n- -  The availability of suitable alternative sites.\n- -  Costs or penalties associated with exiting lease arrangements relative to the benefits to be gained, including costs of removing leasehold improvements or relocating, and indirect costs such as disruption to business.\n- -  Significant investments in leased sites, in particular those with useful lives beyond the lease term.\n- -  Costs associated with extending lease arrangements including rent increases during secondary lease periods.\n\nOur definition of 'reasonable certainty', and therefore the lease term, will often align with the judgements made in our mediumterm plan, in particular for leases of non-specialised property and equipment on rolling (or 'evergreen') arrangements that continue until terminated and which can be exited without significant penalty.\n\nFollowing initial determination of the lease term, we exercise judgement in evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances are sufficiently significant to change the initial assessment of whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options; and in the subsequent reassessment of the lease term.\n\nThe key judgements exercised in setting the lease term are associated with our portfolios of leased properties and cell sites.\n\n## Property\n\nSubstantially all of our leased property estate is held under an arrangement with an initial term ending in 2036 but which can be terminated in 2031, at which point we may either vacate some or all properties; or purchase the entire estate. The lease liability recognised for the arrangement reflects a lease end date of 2031. On initial recognition we concluded that although the majority of these properties are expected to be needed on a long-term basis, we couldn't be reasonably certain that we wouldn't exercise either of the termination or purchase options. In coming to this conclusion we had due regard to material sub-lease arrangements relating to the estate. As time progresses our assessment may change. If this happens we will remeasure the lease liability and right-of-use asset to reflect either the rentals due over through to 2036 for any properties we will continue to occupy, or the cost of purchasing the estate. This could result in a significant increase to the respective lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.",

On initial adoption of IFRS 16 we were not reasonably certain which properties would be handed back and as such the lease term did not reflect the exercise of these options. Subsequently we exercise judgement in identifying significant events that trigger reassessment of our initial conclusion. We exercise similar judgement in identifying events triggering reassessment of whether we are reasonably certain we will not exercise termination options associated with other leased properties.\n\nIn doing so we consider decisions associated with our ongoing workplace rationalisation programme, in particular decisions to exit a particular location or lease an alternative property. Generally we remain reasonably certain that we will not exercise a termination option until implementation of the associated business plan has progressed to a stage that we are committed to exiting the property. At that point we reassess the lease term by reference to the time we expect to remain in occupation of the property and any notice period associated with exercise of the option.\n\n## Cell sites\n\nMost of the liability recognised in respect of leased cell sites relates to multi-site arrangements with commercial providers. The fixed-term nature of these arrangements means it has not been necessary to exercise significant judgement when determining the lease term.\n\nA smaller proportion of the cell site liability relates to arrangements with individual landlords which are either rolling or can be exited with notice. When setting the initial lease term for these arrangements we exercised significant judgement in establishing the period that we are reasonably certain to require use of the site. We broadly aligned lease terms with our medium-term planning horizon after assessing the relative strengths of the following factors:\n\n- -  Long-term economic incentives to remain on sites including existing capital improvements;\n- -  A need to maintain flexibility in our ability to develop and manage our network infrastructure to react quickly to technological developments and evolving capacity requirements; and\n- -  Incentives to renegotiate arrangements in the medium term to gain more security over sites to support future capital investment.\n\nSubsequently, we consider key events that trigger reassessment of lease terms to be developments which resolve uncertainty around our economic incentive to remain on individual sites in the long term. These are primarily lease renegotiations and significant capital investments, for example that associated our 5G rollout and other capital refresh programmes.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nMost of our right-of-use assets are associated with our leased property portfolio, specifically our office, retail and exchange estate. We also lease a significant proportion of our network infrastructure, including mobile cell and switch sites.\n\n|                                  | Land and  buildings  \u00a3m   | Network  infrastructure  \u00a3m   | Motor vehicles a \u00a3m   | Other a \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| At 1 April 2019                  | 4,628                     | 189                           | 314                   | 24           | 5,155       |\n| Additions b                      | 942                       | 59                            | 475                   | -            | 1,476       |\n| Depreciation charge for the year | (513)                     | (37)                          | (97)                  | (2)          | (649)       |\n| Other movements c,d,e            | (228)                     | (32)                          | (315)                 | (16)         | (591)       |\n| At 1 April 2020 e                | 4,829                     | 179                           | 377                   | 6            | 5,391       |\n| Additions b                      | 361                       | 6                             | 116                   | 11           | 494         |\n| Depreciation charge for the year | (546)                     | (30)                          | (110)                 | (4)          | (690)       |\n| Other movements c,f              | (312)                     | (10)                          | (8)                   | (2)          | (332)       |\n| At 31 March 2021                 | 4,332                     | 145                           | 375                   | 11           | 4,863       |\n\n- a  The 'other' asset class has been disaggregated to present motor vehicles and other types of leased asset separately.

Leases continued\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities recognised at 31 March 2021 total \u00a36,152m (31 March 2020: \u00a36,560m). \u00a3730m (31 March 2020: \u00a3812m) of this balance is classified as current, with the remaining \u00a35,422m (31 March 2020: \u00a35,748m) classified as non-current.\n\nIn the prior year we reclassified lease liabilities with a carrying amount of \u00a362m to held-for-sale, see note 23.\n\nThe following amounts relating to the group's obligations under lease arrangements were recognised in the income statement in the year:\n\n- -  Interest expense of \u00a3142m (2019/20: \u00a3140m) accrued on lease liabilities.\n- -  Variable lease payments of \u00a327m (2019/20: \u00a329m) which are not dependent on an index or rate and which have not been included in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n\nExpenses relating to leases of low-value assets and short-term leases for which no right-of-use asset or lease liability has been recognised were not material.\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases in the year was \u00a3924m (2019/20: \u00a3791m). Our cash flow statement (page 122) and normalised free cash flow reconciliation (page 199) present \u00a3782m (2019/20: \u00a3651m) of the cash outflow as relating to the principal element of lease liability payments, with the remaining balance of \u00a3142m (2019/20: \u00a3140m) presented within interest paid.\n\nNote 28 presents a maturity analysis of the payments due over the remaining lease term for lease liabilities currently recognised on the balance sheet. This analysis only includes payments to be made over the reasonably certain lease term. Cash outflows are likely to exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods that we do not currently consider to be reasonably certain, and in respect of leases entered into in future periods.\n\n## Other information relating to leases\n\nWe did not enter into any material sale and leaseback transactions this year. In 2019/20 we recognised net gains of \u00a3115m from sale and leaseback transactions, substantially all of which related to the disposal of our BT Centre headquarters. We occupy the property under a lease arrangement while our new headquarters is prepared. As the transaction met the definition of a sale under IFRS 15 we recognised a right-of-use asset for the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the headquarters, reflecting the right of use retained. We recognised a gain in the income statement relating to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.\n\nOur material lease arrangements do not have indexation clauses linked to Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). As a result we do not consider that the upcoming Interest Rate Benchmark Reform will have a material impact on the lease liabilities or right-of-use assets recognised at 31 March 2021.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the group was committed to future minimum lease payments of \u00a34m in respect of leases which have not yet commenced and for which no lease liability has been recognised (31 March 2020: \u00a3274m, primarily leases entered into under our workplace restructuring programme and including our new headquarters).\n\nThe following table analyses payments to be received across the remaining term of operating lease arrangements where BT is lessor:\n\n| At 31 March 2021                  | To be recognised as  revenue (note 5)  \u00a3m   |   To be recognised as  other operating  income (note 6)  \u00a3m |   Total  \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Less than one year                | 449                                         |                                                          27 |         476 |\n| One to two years                  | 179                                         |                                                          13 |         192 |\n| Two to three years                | 51                                          |                                                          10 |          61 |\n| Three to four years               | 2                                           |                                                          10 |          12 |\n| Four to five years                | 1                                           |                                                          10 |          11 |\n| More than five years              | -                                           |                                                          30 |          30 |\n| Total undiscounted lease payments | 682                                         |                                                         100 |         782 |\n\n| At 31 March 2020                  | To be recognised as  revenue (note 5)  \u00a3m   |   To be recognised as  other operating  income (note 6)  \u00a3m |   Total  \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Less than one year                | 310                                         |                                                          52 |         362 |\n| One to two years                  | 130                                         |                                                          16 |         146 |\n| Two to three years                | 34                                          |                                                          10 |          44 |\n| Three to four years               | 1                                           |                                                           9 |          10 |\n| Four to five years                | -                                           |                                                           7 |           7 |\n| More than five years              | -                                           |                                                          11 |          11 |\n| Total undiscounted lease payments | 475                                         |                                                         105 |         580 |",

Trade and other receivables\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to trade and other receivables\n\nWe initially recognise trade and other receivables at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts receivable.\n\nWe provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers. Because of this, we recognise an allowance for doubtful debts on initial recognition of receivables, which is deducted from the gross carrying amount of the receivable. The allowance is calculated by reference to credit losses expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. In estimating a loss allowance we consider historical experience and informed credit assessment alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues. We consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.\n\nOnce recognised, trade receivables are continuously monitored and updated. Allowances are based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged category as well as forward-looking information and general economic conditions, this includes the impact of Covid-19. Allowances are calculated by individual customer-facing units in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that customer-facing unit.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of Covid-19 we have reassessed our expected loss provisions including assessing the risk factors associated with various industry sectors and applying a risk weighting to each sector.\n\nContingent assets such as any insurance recoveries, or prepaid programme rights which we expect to recoup, have not been recognised in the financial statements as these are only recognised within trade and other receivables when their receipt is virtually certain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

the broad and varied nature of our customer base, the analysis of trade receivables not past due and accrued income by customer-facing unit is considered the most appropriate disclosure of credit concentrations.\n\n## Deferred contract costs\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to deferred contract costs\n\nWe capitalise certain costs associated with the acquisition and fulfilment of contracts with customers and amortise them over the period that we transfer the associated services.\n\nConnection costs are deferred as contract fulfilment costs because they allow satisfaction of the associated connection performance obligation and are considered recoverable. Sales commissions and other third party contract acquisition costs are capitalised as costs to acquire a contract unless the associated contract term is less than 12 months, in which case they are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. A portfolio approach is used to determine contract term.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contractual arrangements represent distinct performance obligations, costs in delivering these services are expensed as incurred. Where these services are not distinct performance obligations, we capitalise eligible costs as a cost of fulfilling the related service. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term, unless the pattern of service delivery indicates a more appropriate profile. To be eligible for capitalisation, costs must be directly attributable to specific contracts, relate to future activity, and generate future economic benefits. Capitalised costs are regularly assessed for recoverability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions\n\nOur provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, insurance claims, litigation and regulatory risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to provisions\n\nWe recognise provisions when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Where these criteria are not met we disclose a contingent liability if the group has a possible obligation, or has a present obligation with an outflow that is not probable or which cannot be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in note 31.\n\nProvisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for provisions\n\nWe exercise judgement in determining the quantum of all provisions to be recognised. Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nAs part of this assessment, we also assess the likelihood of contingent liabilities occurring in the future. Contingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet; they are disclosed in note 31. By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes where this can be reasonably determined.\n\nIn estimating contingent liabilities we make key judgements in relation to applicable law and any historical and pending court rulings, and the likelihood, timing and cost of resolution.\n\nEstablishing contingent liabilities associated with litigation brought against the group may involve the use of critical estimates and assumptions, in particular around the ability to form a reliable estimate of any probable outflow. We provide further information in note 31.\n\nOther provisions and contingent liabilities may involve the use of key (but not critical) estimates as explained below.\n\nRestructuring programmes involve estimation of the direct cost necessary for the restructuring and exclude items that are associated with ongoing activities. The amounts below exclude restructuring costs for which the timing and amount are certain. These are recognised as part of trade and other payables.\n\nIn measuring property provisions, we have made estimates of the costs to restore properties upon vacation where this is required under the lease agreements.\n\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) involve an estimate of the cost to dismantle equipment and restore network sites upon vacation and the timing of the event. The provision represents the group's best estimate of the amount that may be required to settle the obligation.\n\nNetwork asset provisions represent our future operational costs and vacant site rentals arising from obligations relating to network share agreements. Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of up to 20 years.\n\nOur regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters. The charge/credit for the year represents the outcome of management's re-assessment of the estimates and regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues. The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators. When estimating the likely value of regulatory risk we make key judgements, including in regard to interpreting Ofcom regulations and past and current claims.\n\nFor all risks, the ultimate liability may vary materially from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.",

Retirement benefit plans\n\n## Background to BT's pension plans\n\nThe group has both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit plans. The group's main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) which is a defined benefit plan that was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001. After that date new entrants to BT in the UK have been able to join a defined contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme (BTRSS), a contract-based arrangement operated by Standard Life.\n\nSections B and C of the BTPS were closed to future benefit accrual on 30 June 2018 (which represented over 99% of the BTPS active membership at the time) and affected employees were able to join the BTRSS or the BT Hybrid Scheme (BTHS) for future pension accrual. The BTHS, which combines elements of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes, was set up in April 2019 for non-management employees impacted by the closure of the BTPS and was closed to new entrants on 30 September 2019.\n\nEE Limited operates the EE Pension Scheme (EEPS), which has a defined benefit section that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2014 and a defined contribution section which is open to new joiners.\n\nWe also have retirement arrangements around the world in line with local markets and culture.\n\n|                              | What are they?                                                                                                                                           | Future implications for BT?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Defined  contribution  plans | Benefits in a defined contribution plan are linked to the  value of each member's fund, which is based on: -  contributions paid                         | The group has no exposure to investment and other  experience risks.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                              | -  the performance of each individual's chosen investments                                                                                               | -  the performance of each individual's chosen investments                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Defined  benefit   plans     | Benefits in a defined benefit plan are determined by the  plan rules and are: -  dependent on factors such as age, years of service and  pensionable pay | The group is exposed to investment and other  experience risks and may need to make additional  contributions where it is estimated that the benefits  will not be met from regular contributions, expected  investment income and assets held. |",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to retirement benefit plans\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Retirement Benefit Obligations in respect of defined benefit plans is the liability (the present value of all expected future benefit cash flows to be paid by each plan, calculated using the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries) less the fair value of the plan assets.\n\nThe income statement expense is allocated between an operating charge and net finance income or expense.\n\n- -  The operating charge reflects the increase in the liability resulting from the pension benefit earned by active employees in the current period, the costs of administering the plans and any past service costs/credits such as those arising from curtailments or settlements.\n- -  The net finance income or expense reflects the interest on the Retirement Benefit Obligations recognised in the group balance sheet, based on the discount rate at the start of the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the Retirement Benefit Obligations are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. These comprise:\n\n- -  The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the reporting date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted the start of the year;\n- -  The impact on the liabilities of actual experience being different to assumptions made at the start of the year, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement or actual benefit increases being different to the pension increase assumption; and\n- -  The return on plan assets being above or below the amount included in the net finance income or expense.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe operating charge for the defined contribution pension plans we operate represents the contributions payable for the year.\n\n## Amounts in the financial statements\n\n## Group income statement\n\nThe expense or income arising from all group retirement benefit arrangements recognised in the group income statement is shown below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                                           | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Recognised in the income statement before specific items                                      |           |           |\n| -  Service cost (including administration expenses and PPF levy):                             |           |           |\n| -  defined benefit plans                                                                      | 63        | 86        |\n| -  defined contribution plans                                                                 | 527       | 540       |\n| -  Past service cost                                                                          | 1         | -         |\n| Subtotal                                                                                      | 591       | 626       |\n| Recognised in the income statement as specific items (note 9)                                 |           |           |\n| -  Costs to close BT Pension Scheme and provide transition payments a  for affected employees | 21        | 22        |\n| -  Interest on pensions deficit                                                               | 18        | 145       |\n| Subtotal                                                                                      | 39        | 167       |\n| Total recognised in the income statement                                                      | 630       | 793       |\n\n## Group balance sheet\n\nThe Retirement Benefit Obligations in respect of defined benefit plans reported in the group balance sheet are set out below.\n\n|                                               | 2021       | 2021            | 2021         | 2020       | 2020            | 2020         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| At 31 March                                   | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m | Deficit a \u00a3m | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m | Deficit a \u00a3m |\n| BTPS                                          | 53,172     | (57,737)        | (4,565)      | 52,240     | (53,010)        | (770)        |\n| EEPS                                          | 934        | (1,127)         | (193)        | 820        | (879)           | (59)         |\n| Other plans b                                 | 506        | (844)           | (338)        | 411        | (722)           | (311)        |\n| Retirement Benefit Obligations (gross of tax) | 54,612     | (59,708)        | (5,096)      | 53,471     | (54,611)        | (1,140)      |\n| Deferred tax asset                            |            |                 | 925          |            |                 | 175          |\n| Retirement Benefit Obligations (net of tax)   |            |                 | (4,171)      |            |                 | (965)        |\n\n- b  Included in the liabilities of other plans is \u00a3146m (2019/20: \u00a3150m) related to unfunded pension arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On a CARE basis benefits are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of inflation or the individual's actual pay increase in each year to retirement.",

Trustee directors are usually appointed for a three-year term but are then eligible for re-appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chairman of the Trustees\n\nAppointed by BT after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions.\n\n## Member nominated Trustees\n\nAppointed by BT based on nominations by trade unions.\n\n## Employer nominated Trustees\n\nAppointed by BT. Two normally hold senior positions within the group and two normally hold (or have held) senior positions in commerce or industry.\n\n## BTPS assets\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made when valuing our pension assets\n\nUnder IAS19, plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date. Our pension assets include quoted and unquoted investments. A portion of unquoted investments are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable, which require more judgement. The assumptions used in valuing unquoted investments are affected by market conditions.\n\nAround \u00a35bn of these unquoted investments have valuations which precede the reporting date and where the valuations have been adjusted for cash movements between the last valuation date and 31 March 2021, using the valuation approach and inputs as at the last valuation date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are only updated over this period where there are indications of significant market movements.\n\n## Valuation of main quoted investments\n\n- -  Equities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices.\n- -  Bonds that are regularly traded are valued using broker quotes.\n- -  Exchange traded derivative contracts are valued based on closing bid prices.\n\n## Valuation of main unquoted investments\n\n- -  Equities are valued using the IPEVC guidelines where the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and earnings assumptions.\n- -  Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates.\n- -  Bonds that are not regularly traded are valued by an independent valuer using pricing models making assumptions for credit risk, market risk and market yield curves.\n- -  Over the counter derivatives are valued by an independent valuer using cashflows discounted at market rates. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are the yield curves and cost of carry.\n- -  Holdings in investment funds are valued at fair value which is typically the Net Asset Value provided by the fund administrator or investment manager. The significant assumption used in the valuation is the Net Asset Value.\n- -  Infrastructure investments are valued by an independent valuer using a model-based valuation such as a discounted cash flow approach. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are the discount rate and the expected cash flows.\n- -  The value of the longevity insurance contract held by the BTPS is measured by discounting the projected cash flows payable under the contract (projected by an actuary, consistent with the terms of the contract). The significant assumptions used to value the asset are the discount rate (including adjustments to the risk free rate) and the mortality assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Asset allocation\n\nThe allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustee's investment policy. The allocations reflect the Trustee's views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be allocated to match liabilities. Current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.\n\nThe fair value of the assets of the BTPS analysed by asset category are shown below. These are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not (such as investment funds).\n\n|                                |                       | 2021 a             | 2021 a                 | 2021 a   | 2020 (Restated) a   | 2020 (Restated) a      | 2020 (Restated) a   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                |                       | Total  assets  \u00a3bn | of which  quoted b \u00a3bn | Total  % | Total   assets  \u00a3bn | of which  quoted b \u00a3bn | Total  %            |\n| Growth                         |                       |                    |                        |          |                     |                        |                     |\n| Equities                       | UK                    | 0.3                | 0.3                    | 1        | 0.3                 | 0.3                    | 1                   |\n|                                | Overseas developed    | 7.0                | 6.5                    | 13       | 6.7                 | 5.6                    | 13                  |\n|                                | Emerging markets      | 1.3                | 1.3                    | 2        | 1.0                 | 1.0                    | 2                   |\n| Private Equity                 |                       | 1.6                | -                      | 3        | 1.3                 | -                      | 2                   |\n| Property                       | UK                    | 2.9                | -                      | 5        | 3.0                 | -                      | 6                   |\n|                                | Overseas              | 0.8                | -                      | 2        | 1.1                 | -                      | 2                   |\n| Other growth assets            | Absolute Return c     | 1.1                | -                      | 2        | 1.2                 | -                      | 2                   |\n|                                | Non Core Credit d     | 4.3                | 1.4                    | 8        | 4.1                 | 1.0                    | 8                   |\n|                                | Mature Infrastructure | 1.3                | -                      | 2        | 1.3                 | -                      | 2                   |\n| Liability matching             |                       |                    |                        |          |                     |                        |                     |\n| Government bonds               | UK                    | 14.3               | 14.3                   | 27       | 13.9                | 13.9                   | 27                  |\n| Investment grade credit        | Global                | 14.1               | 11.5                   | 27       | 14.4                | 10.1                   | 28                  |\n| Secure income assets e         |                       | 2.1                | -                      | 4        | 0.8                 | -                      | 2                   |\n| Cash, derivatives and other    |                       |                    |                        |          |                     |                        |                     |\n| Cash balances                  |                       | 1.4                | -                      | 3        | 2.3                 | -                      | 4                   |\n| Longevity insurance contract f |                       | (0.8)              | -                      | (2)      | (0.8)               | -                      | (2)                 |\n| Other g                        |                       | 1.5                | -                      | 3        | 1.6                 | -                      | 3                   |\n| Total                          |                       | 53.2               | 35.3                   | 100      | 52.2                | 31.9                   | 100                 |\n\n- a  At 31 March 2021, the Scheme did not hold any equity issued by the group (2019/20: nil).

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## What are the forecast benefits payable from the BTPS?\n\nThere were 280,000 members in the BTPS at 30 June 2020, the date of the membership data used to value the IAS 19 liabilities. Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the BTPS, which impacts the benefits they are expected to receive.\n\nBenefits to members from the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 60 years. Projecting future expected benefit payments requires a number of assumptions, including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and is therefore inherently uncertain. Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement than assumed. The liabilities are the present value of the future estimated benefit payments.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the estimated benefits payable from the BTPS, and projected liabilities, forecast using the IAS 19 assumptions. Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.\n\n## Forecast benefits payable by BTPS at 31 March 2021 (unaudited)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe estimated duration of the BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 15 years using the IAS 19 assumptions.\n\n## What is the breakdown of the membership and liabilities?\n\n|                                      | Active  members   | Deferred  members   | Pensioners   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Sections A and B liabilities (\u00a3bn) a | -                 | 6.9                 | 31.5         | 38.4    |\n| Section C liabilities (\u00a3bn)          | -                 | 14.0                | 5.3          | 19.3    |\n| Total IAS 19 liabilities (\u00a3bn)       | -                 | 20.9                | 36.8         | 57.7    |\n| Total number of members              | - b               | 73,900              | 206,100      | 280,000 |\n\n- a  Sections A and B have been aggregated in this table as Section A members have typically elected to take Section B benefits at retirement.\n- b  At 30 June 2020 there were around 30 active members in the BTPS.\n\n## What are the key assumptions and how have they been set?\n\nThe key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS are shown below.\n\n|                                     | Nominal rates (per year)   | Nominal rates (per year)   | Real rates (per year) a   | Real rates (per year) a   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| At 31 March                         | 2021                       | 2020                       | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Rate used to discount liabilities   | 2.05%                      | 2.45%                      | (1.11)%                   | (0.15)%                   |\n| Inflation - average increase in RPI | 3.20%                      | 2.60%                      | -%                        | -%                        |\n| Inflation - average increase in CPI | 2.75%                      | 1.90%                      | (0.44)%                   | (0.68)%                   |\n\n- a  The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation.\n\nThe BTPS represents around 97% of the group's pension liabilities.

CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI  taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the expected difference.                                                                                                                                   |\n|                       | In 2020, it was announced that RPI will be aligned with CPIH from 2030 onwards.

In 2018, Government made a temporary decision about how these benefits would be increased. We  anticipated Government would continue to pay higher pension increases to public sector pension schemes  at the end of the temporary period and intended to reflect in the liabilities once confirmed. In March 2021,  Government confirmed this decision, which has crystallised a \u00a30.3bn increase to the BTPS liabilities at 31  March 2021. |\n| Longevity             | The longevity assumption takes into account:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                       | -  the actual mortality experience of the BTPS pensioners, based on a formal review conducted at the 2020  triennial funding valuation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                       | -  future improvements in longevity based on a model published by the UK actuarial profession's Continuous  Mortality Investigation (updating to use the CMI 2019 Mortality Projections model, and reducing the long- term improvement parameter to 1.00% per year).

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Risks underlying the assumptions\n\n## Background\n\nThe BTPS faces similar risks to other UK DB schemes: things like future low investment returns, high inflation, longer life expectancy and regulatory changes may all mean the BTPS becomes more of a financial burden.\n\nChanges in external factors, such as bond yields, can have an impact on the IAS 19 assumptions, impacting the measurement of BTPS liabilities. These factors can also impact the Scheme assets. The BTPS hedges some of these risks, including longevity and currency using financial instruments and insurance contracts with reference to the funding liabilities (see page 163 for sensitivities to the funding liabilities). This leads to the BTPS being over-hedged to changes in bond yields under IAS 19.\n\nSome of the key financial risks, and mitigations, for the BTPS are set out in the table below.\n\n| Changes in corporate  and government bond  yields   | A fall in yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, used to set the IAS 19 discount rate, will lead to an increase   in the IAS 19 liabilities. The BTPS's assets include corporate bonds, government bonds and interest rate derivatives which   are expected to more than offset the impact of movements in the discount rate on the IAS 19 liabilities   (but only partly offset movements in the funding liabilities). Yields on these assets may diverge compared   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes in inflation  expectations                  | A significant proportion of the benefits paid to members are currently increased in line with RPI or CPI  inflation. An increase in long-term inflation expectations will lead to an increase in the IAS 19 liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                                     | The BTPS's assets include index-linked government bonds and inflation derivatives which are expected   to largely offset the impact of movements in inflation expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Changes in growth  assets                           | A significant proportion of the BTPS assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities and property.  Although the BTPS has temporary hedges in place to partly offset the impact of a fall in equity markets,   and adopts a diverse portfolio, a fall in these growth assets will lead to a worsening of the IAS 19 deficit.                                                                                                                                |\n| Changes in life  expectancy                         | An increase in the life expectancy of members will result in benefits being paid out for longer, leading to an  increase in the BTPS liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                     | The BTPS holds a longevity insurance contract which covers around 20% of the BTPS's total exposure  to improvements in longevity, providing long-term protection and income to the BTPS in the event that  members live longer than currently expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\nOther risks include: volatile asset returns (i.e. where asset returns differ from the discount rate); changes in legislation or regulation which impact the value of the liabilities or assets; and member take-up of options before and at retirement to reshape their benefits.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nThe potential negative impact of the key risks is illustrated by the following five scenarios. These have been assessed by BT's independent actuary as scenarios that might occur no more than once in every 20 years.\n\n|                                 | 1-in-20 events   | 1-in-20 events   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Scenario                        | 2021             | 2020             |\n| 1.

The purpose of the funding valuation is for BT and the Trustee to agree cash contributions from BT to the BTPS to ensure the BTPS has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. It is prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation, e.g. the 2004 Pensions Act, and uses a prudent approach overall.\n\nThis differs from the IAS 19 valuation, which is used for deriving balance sheet and P&L figures in Company accounts with principles being set out in the IFRS standards, and uses a best-estimate approach overall.\n\nThe different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and deficit.\n\nThe latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2020. The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2023.\n\nThe results of the two most recent triennial valuations are shown below.\n\n|                                                                                                     | June 2020  valuation  \u00a3bn   | June 2017  valuation  \u00a3bn   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| BTPS funding liabilities                                                                            | (65.3)                      | (60.4)                      |\n| Market value of BTPS assets                                                                         | 57.3                        | 49.1                        |\n| Funding deficit                                                                                     | (8.0)                       | (11.3)                      |\n| Percentage of accrued benefits covered by BTPS assets at valuation date                             | 88%                         | 81%                         |\n| Percentage of accrued benefits on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date | 71%                         | 62%                         |\n\n## Key assumptions - funding valuation\n\nThe most recent funding valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions.\n\n|                                         | Nominal rates (per year)   | Nominal rates (per year)   | Real rates (per year) a   | Real rates (per year) a   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                         | June 2020  valuation  %    | June 2017  valuation  %    | June 2020  valuation  %   | June 2017  valuation  %   |\n| Average single equivalent discount rate | 1.4                        | 2.6                        | (1.7)                     | (0.8)                     |\n| Average long-term increase in RPI       | 3.2                        | 3.4                        | -                         | -                         |\n| Average long-term increase in CPI       | 2.4                        | 2.4                        | (0.7)                     | (1.0)                     |\n\n- a  The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\nThe discount rate at 30 June 2020 was derived from prudent return expectations above a risk-free yield curve based on gilt and swap rates. The discount rate reflects the investment strategy over time, allowing for the Scheme de-risk to a portfolio consisting predominantly of bond and bond-like investments by 2034. It has been set consistently with the 2017 valuation, mechanically updated to reflect the move in swap pricing from LIBOR to SONIA, leading to a prudent discount rate of 1.4% per year above the yield curve in 2020, trending down to 0.8% per year above the curve in the long-term. The assumption is equivalent to using a flat discount rate of 0.9% per year above the risk-free yield curve at 30 June 2020.\n\nThe average life expectancy assumptions at the funding valuation dates, for members 60 years of age, are as follows.\n\n| Number of years from valuation date                                                  |   June 2020  assumptions | June 2017  assumptions   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Male in lower pension bracket                                                        |                     25.8 | 25.9 to 27.2             |\n| Male in higher pension bracket                                                       |                     28   | 28.6                     |\n| Female                                                                               |                     28.5 | 28.6 to 28.9             |\n| Average additional life expectancy for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years' time |                      0.9 | 0.9                      |\n\n## Changes in the funding position (unaudited)\n\nThe impact of changes in market conditions on the funding liabilities may differ from the impact on the IAS 19 liabilities.

The funding deficit at 30 June 2020 was \u00a37.98bn. The deficit was agreed to be met as follows:\n\n- -  \u00a32bn met through an Asset Backed Funding arrangement, expected to be implemented by 30 June 2021.\n\nThis will be structured as a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP), with \u00a3180m per year payable annually for 13 years between June 2021 and June 2033. The stream of payments will be financed through proceeds from EE Limited, and shares in EE Limited will provide security over the payment stream. No impact is expected to the day to day operations of BT or EE as a result of implementing the structure.\n\nIf the Scheme reaches full funding as calculated by the Scheme Actuary at any 30 June, the payments to the Scheme will cease. The ABF meets \u00a32bn of deficit as all 13 payments are assumed to be made to the BTPS. However, the market value reflects the possibility that payments may switch-off. This leads to the BTPS recognising a \u00a31.7bn asset initially, with a corresponding reduction in the funding deficit, and BT receiving tax relief on that amount. Tax relief on the balance of the payments comes through over time as payments are made to the BTPS.\n\nThe Asset Backed Funding arrangement has no impact on the gross IAS 19 deficit in the BT plc consolidated accounts initially, but will reduce the deferred tax asset recognised, as tax relief has been received up-front. Annual capital and interest payments will reduce the IAS 19 deficit.\n\n- -  Cash contributions over the 10 years to 30 June 2030.\n\nThese payments are set out in the table below.\n\n| Year to 31 March               | 2022            | 2023    | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   | 2029   | 2030   | 2031      | 2032   | 2033   | 2034   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash provided by BT            | 900 a 800 a 180 | 600 b   | 600 c  | 600 c  | 600 c  | 600 c  |        | 600 c  | 600 c  | 500 c 180 |        |        |        |\n| Cash provided by ABF structure | 180             | 180 780 | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    |        | 180    | 180    |           | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n| Total                          | 1,080 980       |         | 780    |        | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 680       | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n\n- c  \u00a3490m of each payment due by 30 June. \u00a310m is payable to the BTPS, and BT has the option to pay remaining amounts into the co-investment vehicle.\n\nBased on the 2020 funding valuation agreement, the group expects to make cash payments of approximately \u00a31,140m to the BTPS in 2021/22, comprising of contributions of approximately \u00a360m for expenses and future accrual and payments from BT and the ABF to meet the deficit of \u00a31,080m.",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Co-investment vehicle\n\nBT and the Trustee have agreed a new co-investment vehicle, which provides BT with some protection against the risk of overfunding by allowing money to be returned if not needed by the Scheme, enabling BT to provide upfront funding with greater confidence.\n\nBT has the option to pay deficit repair plan payments after 30 June 2023 into the co-investment vehicle (which is a SLP separate to the SLP used for the Asset Backed Funding vehicle), which will be invested as if part of the overall BTPS investment strategy. The value of the assets held in the vehicle will be included in the assets of the BTPS for the purposes of calculating the both the funding deficit and the IAS 19 deficit.\n\nTo the extent there is a funding deficit at 30 June 2034, the co-investment vehicle will pay funds to the BTPS. BT will receive tax relief on funds paid at this point, rather than in the year when funds are paid from BT into the vehicle.\n\nAny remaining funds in the co-investment vehicle will then be returned to BT in three annual payments in 2035, 2036 and 2037, unless the Scheme has subsequently moved into deficit or the Trustee, acting prudently but reasonably, decides to defer or reduce these payments.\n\n## Future funding commitment\n\nBT has agreed additional contributions which will be automatically payable in the event the deficit repair plan is no longer sufficient to meet the deficit.\n\nShould an annual update of the funding position reveal that the Scheme has fallen more than \u00a31bn behind plan, BT will commence additional payments between \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m per year. The first annual test will be at 30 June 2021.\n\nThe payments will stop once the funding deficit at a future annual update has improved such that the remaining deficit repair plan is sufficient to meet the deficit. Payments can switch-on again if the deficit position subsequently deteriorates. Any payments under this mechanism cease by 30 June 2034.\n\n## Other protections\n\nThe 2020 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the BTPS. BT has agreed to continue to provide the Trustee with certain protections to 2035, or until the deficit calculated using the long-term discount rate, currently 0.8% per year above the risk-free yield curve, (the 'Protections Deficit') has reduced below \u00a32bn. A \u00a32bn deficit on this measure is currently broadly equivalent to a nil funding deficit.

It has a defined benefit section that is closed to future accrual, with liabilities of around \u00a31.1bn, and a defined contribution section with around 9,000 members.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the defined benefit section's assets are invested across a number of asset classes including global equities (25%), property & illiquid alternatives (26%), an absolute return portfolio (20%) and a liability driven investment portfolio (29%).\n\nThe most recent triennial valuation of the defined benefit section was performed as at 31 December 2018 and agreed in March 2020. This showed a funding deficit of \u00a3161m. The group is scheduled to contribute \u00a33.3m each month until 31 July 2022.\n\n## BTRSS\n\nThe BTRSS is the largest defined contribution plan maintained by the group with around 66,000 active members. In the year to 31 March 2021, \u00a3468m of contributions were payable by the group to the BTRSS.\n\n## BTHS\n\nThe BTHS combines elements of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. It was set up in April 2019 for nonmanagement employees impacted by the closure of the BTPS and was closed to new entrants on 30 September 2019. At 31 March 2021 it had liabilities of around \u00a338m.",

Further details on these plans are provided in note 22.\n\n## 22. Share-based payments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to share-based payments\n\nWe operate a number of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which we receive services from employees in consideration for equity instruments (share options and shares) of the group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Market-based performance criteria and non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to make contributions to the share purchase programme) are reflected in this measurement of fair value. The fair value determined at the grant date is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the group's estimate of the options or shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using either the Binomial options pricing model or Monte Carlo simulations, whichever is more appropriate to the share-based payment arrangement.\n\nService and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of equity instruments granted. In the case that an award or option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of either counterparty, this is accounted for as a cancellation. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised in the income statement. As the requirement to save under an employee saveshare arrangement is a non-vesting condition, employee cancellations, other than through a termination of service, are treated as an accelerated vesting.\n\nNo adjustment is made to total equity for awards that lapse or are forfeited after the vesting date.",

We also have several share plans for executives. All share-based payment plans are equity-settled. Details of these plans is set out below.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nUnder an HMRC-approved savings-related share option plan, employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted. This price is set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans. The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Similar plans operate for our overseas employees.\n\n## Incentive Share Plan (ISP)\n\nParticipants are entitled to ISP shares in full at the end of a three-year period only if the company has met the relevant predetermined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group. No ISP awards were granted in 2020/21. For ISP awards granted in previous years 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return (TSR) target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period; 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative normalised free cash flow measure; and 20% to growth in underlying revenue.\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)\n\nAwards are granted annually to selected employees. Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.\n\n## Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP)\n\nAwards are granted to selected employees. Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of a specified retention or restricted period if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.\n\nUnder the terms of the ISP, DBP and RSP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.\n\n## Yourshare\n\nThis share incentive plan will operate again this year. All eligible employees of the group at 31 December 2020 who remain employed in June 2021 will be awarded \u00a3500 of BT shares in June 2021. The shares will be held in trust for a 3 year vesting period after which they will be transferred to employees, providing they have been continuously employed during that time. A similar plan operates for our overseas employees.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nMovements in Employee Saveshare options are shown below.\n\n|                         | Number of   share options   | Number of   share options   | Weighted average   exercise price   | Weighted average   exercise price   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 March     | 2021 millions               | 2020 millions               | 2021 pence                          | 2020 pence                          |\n| Outstanding at 1 April  | 214                         | 190                         | 202                                 | 254                                 |\n| Granted                 | 283                         | 107                         | 85                                  | 168                                 |\n| Forfeited               | (59)                        | (50)                        | 175                                 | 251                                 |\n| Exercised               | -                           | -                           | 85                                  | 174                                 |\n| Expired                 | (24)                        | (33)                        | 277                                 | 318                                 |\n| Outstanding at 31 March | 414                         | 214                         | 121                                 | 202                                 |\n| Exercisable at 31 March | -                           | -                           | 282                                 | 319                                 |\n\nThe weighted average share price for all options exercised during 2020/21 was 134p (2019/20: 203p).",

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations. TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each company's volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.\n\nVolatility has been determined by reference to BT's historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future. An expected life of six months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options. For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.\n\nThe fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date. The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2020/21 was 117p (2019/20: 195p) and for RSP awards granted in 2020/21 103p (2019/20: 177p).",

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nWe classify non-current assets or a group of assets and associated liabilities, together forming a disposal group, as 'held for sale' when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through disposal rather than continuing use and the sale is highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed divestment within one year from the date of classification. We measure non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\nUpon completion of a divestment, we recognise a profit or loss on disposal calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest less costs incurred in disposing of the asset or disposal group and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or disposal group (including goodwill). The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item, see note 9.\n\nIn the event that non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale form a separate and identifiable major line of business, the results for both the current and comparative periods are reclassified as 'discontinued operations'.\n\n## Divestments\n\nDuring the year we completed the sale of our domestic operations in Spain, our domestic operations in France and selected domestic operations and infrastructure in 16 countries in Latin America, which were all classified as held for sale at 31 March 2020. We recorded a net gain of \u00a380m on disposal of our Spain operations, a combined net loss of \u00a311m on the disposals of our operations in France and Latin America, and a net loss of \u00a34m relating to the disposal of a number of other businesses.\n\nIn 2019/20 we recognised a loss on disposal of \u00a336m relating to the completed divestments of BT Fleet Solutions and Tikit.\n\nThe divestment of these operations is in line with our long-term strategy. The disposals in the current or prior year have not been reclassified as discontinued operations as they do not meet our definition of a separate major line of business.\n\nThe net consideration recognised on completion of these divestments was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Intangible assets (including goodwill)                                            | 37        | 41        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                                     | 39        | 12        |\n| Right-of-use assets                                                               | 38        | 4         |\n| Other non-current assets                                                          | 3         | 8         |\n| Current assets                                                                    | 159       | 69        |\n| Liabilities                                                                       | (199)     | (50)      |\n| Net assets of operations disposed a                                               | 77        | 84        |\n| Less: recycling from translation reserve b                                        | (23)      | -         |\n| Net impact on the consolidated balance sheet                                      | 54        | 84        |\n| Profit/(loss) on disposal c                                                       | 65        | (36)      |\n| Net consideration                                                                 | 119       | 48        |\n| Satisfied by                                                                      |           |           |\n| Cash proceeds received from disposals completed in the year                       | 161       | 60        |\n| Cash received in respect of disposals completed in prior years                    | 3         | -         |\n| Proceeds received in the year per the cash flow statement                         | 164       | 60        |\n| Adjustments to consideration for expected future payments (to)/from the purchaser | (25)      | 5         |\n| Costs of disposal e                                                               | (20)      | (17)      |\n| Net consideration                                                                 | 119       | 48        |\n\n- a  After impairment charge of \u00a3127m in 2019/20 relating to the France and Latin America divestments, see 'Assets and liabilities held for sale' below.\n- b  Cumulative translation differences previously held in equity and recycled to the income statement on disposal of foreign operations.\n- c  Fully recognised as specific items, see note 9.\n- d  2020/21 includes provisions for proceeds to be paid back to the purchaser through deferred or contingent payments or where negotiations on post-completion purchase price adjustments are ongoing at 31 March 2021. 2019/20 relates to deferred consideration receivable.

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nThere are no assets or liabilities classified as held for sale at 31 March 2021.\n\nDuring the year we reached a preliminary agreement to sell certain business units of our domestic operations in Italy. The divestment is subject to regulatory approval and therefore, in our view, does not meet the held for sale criteria per IFRS 5. Accordingly the asset and liabilities have not been classified as held for sale at 31 March 2021.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale at 31 March 2020 related to our domestic operations in France, our domestic operations in Spain and selected domestic operations and infrastructure in 16 countries in Latin America. All of these divestments are part of the Global segment and have been completed during 2020/21.\n\nOn classification as held for sale, we tested these operations for impairment by reference to whether the carrying value of the associated disposal groups was supported by the fair value less costs to sell. We used the selling price agreed with the prospective purchaser as the fair value for the impairment test, which was classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. As a result we recognised impairment charges of \u00a337m in relation to the France divestment, and \u00a390m in relation to the Latin America divestment. These impairment charges were recognised as specific items, see note 9.\n\nThe disposal groups were stated at fair value less costs to sell and comprised the following assets and liabilities:\n\n| At 31 March                    | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                         |           |           |\n| Intangible assets              | -         | 35        |\n| Property, plant and equipment  | -         | 37        |\n| Right-of-use assets            | -         | 34        |\n| Trade and other receivables    | -         | 87        |\n| Contract assets                | -         | 8         |\n| Deferred tax assets            | -         | 4         |\n| Inventories                    | -         | 1         |\n| Current tax receivable         | -         | 19        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents      | -         | 43        |\n| Assets held for sale           | -         | 268       |\n| Liabilities                    |           |           |\n| Trade and other payables       | -         | 104       |\n| Contract liabilities           | -         | 28        |\n| Lease liabilities              | -         | 62        |\n| Current tax liabilities        | -         | 4         |\n| Retirement benefit obligations | -         | 8         |\n| Provisions                     | -         | 5         |\n| Liabilities held for sale      | -         | 211       |\n\n## 24. Investments\n\nSignificant accounting policies that apply to investments\n\n## Investments classified as amortised cost\n\nThese investments are measured at amortised cost. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Investments classified as fair value through profit and loss\n\nThese investments are initially recognised at fair value plus direct transaction costs. They are re-measured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value and changes are recognised directly in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nWe have made an irrevocable election to present changes in the fair value of equity investments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income. All gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement when the investments are disposed of, aside from dividends which are recognised in the income statement when our right to receive payment is established. Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.",

In the absence of specific market data, these investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value.\n\n## 25. Cash and cash equivalents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less. All are held at amortised cost on the balance sheet, equating to fair value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within the current element of loans and other borrowings (note 26).",

The remaining balance of \u00a39m (2019/20: \u00a313m) was held in escrow accounts, or in commercial arrangements akin to escrow.\n\n## 26. Loans and other borrowings\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to loans and other borrowings\n\nWe initially recognise loans and other borrowings at the fair value of amounts received net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and, if included in a fair value hedge relationship, are re-valued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. The resulting amortisation of fair value movements, on de-designation of the hedge, is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## What's our capital management policy?\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and meeting our distribution policy. In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders. We manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group. The Board regularly reviews the capital structure. No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2020/21. For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.\n\nOur capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders' equity. The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.\n\n| At 31 March                         | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net debt                            | 17,802    | 17,969    |\n| Total parent shareholders' equity a | 11,650    | 14,741    |\n|                                     | 29,452    | 32,710    |\n\n- a  Excludes non-controlling interests of \u00a329m (2019/20: \u00a322m).\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (both current and non-current), less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on balance sheet.\n\nOur net debt calculation starts from the expected undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to loans and other borrowings, current asset investments and cash equivalents to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Net financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities.",

Loans and other borrowings continued\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS.

Overdraft arrangements that reference LIBOR will be transitioned onto Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial instruments and risk management\n\nWe issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations; to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions; for the temporary investment of short-term funds; and to manage currency and interest rate risks. In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.\n\n## How do we manage financial risk?\n\nOur activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Treasury operation\n\nWe have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated market risks, and credit risk.\n\n## Treasury policy\n\nTreasury policy is set by the Board. Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures. The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations. Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the chairman, the chief executive or the chief financial officer.\n\nThere has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31 March 2021 and the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\n## How do we manage interest rate risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings. Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.\n\nOur policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of on-going net debt is at fixed rates. Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the chief financial officer, director tax, treasury, insurance and pensions or the treasury director who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn order to manage our interest rate profile, we have entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed. The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments. The majority of the group's long-term borrowings are subject to fixed sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark reform\n\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority announced on 5 March 2021 that as part of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, LIBOR will start being discontinued as a benchmark rate from 31 December 2021. The group has no floating rate debt securities. It has 5 US dollar cross-currency interest rate swaps and 21 sterling interest rate swaps impacted by the IBOR reform maturing between 2028 and 2030. The net exposure of these swaps is nil. The group has adhered to the International Swaps And Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fall backs Protocol and appropriate fall back rates will apply to derivatives once LIBOR benchmarks are discontinued. The impact of any resulting ineffectiveness arising from the discontinuation of LIBOR will be immaterial to the group and will not adversely affect the group's ability to manage interest rate risk.\n\n## How do we manage foreign exchange risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nForeign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.\n\nThe Board's policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.\n\nThe Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the chief financial officer, director tax, treasury, insurance and pensions or the treasury director.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nA significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in sterling. Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.\n\nWe enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments. The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US dollar, euro and Asia Pacific region currencies. As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows. We use cross-currency swaps to swap foreign currency borrowings into sterling.",

To demonstrate this volatility, management has concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis:\n\n- -  For interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across sterling, US dollar and Euro currencies.\n- -  For foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies.\n\nThe impact on equity, before tax and excluding any impact related to retirement benefit plans, of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies is as detailed below:\n\n| At 31 March              | 2021 \u00a3m  Increase  (reduce)   | 2020  \u00a3m   Increase  (reduce)   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Sterling interest rates  | 816                           | 989                             |\n| US dollar interest rates | (438)                         | (610)                           |\n| Euro interest rates      | (349)                         | (451)                           |\n| Sterling strengthening   | (255)                         | (289)                           |\n\nA 1% decrease in interest rates and 10% weakening of sterling against other currencies would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\nThe impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the group's annual net finance expense and our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, (excluding translation exposures) would not have been material in 2020/21 and 2019/20.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nWe continue to target a BBB+/Baa1 credit rating over the cycle, with a BBB floor. We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements. These include the pension deficit and shareholder distributions.\n\nOur December 2030 bond contains covenants which require us to pay higher rates of interest since our credit ratings fell below A3 in the case of Moody's or A- in the case of Standard & Poor's (S&P). Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade. Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of \u00a31.9bn at 31 March 2021, our finance expense would increase/decrease by approximately \u00a310m a year if the group's credit rating were to be downgraded/upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.\n\nOur credit ratings were as detailed below:\n\n|                   | 2021   | 2021     | 2020   | 2020     |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|\n| At 31 March       | Rating | Outlook  | Rating | Outlook  |\n| Rating agency     |        |          |        |          |\n| Moody's           | Baa2   | Negative | Baa2   | Negative |\n| Standard & Poor's | BBB    | Stable   | BBB    | Stable   |",

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## How do we manage liquidity risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nWe maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined by using short and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period. On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters. We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise. The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2021 is disclosed in note 26. We have no term debt maturities in 2021/22.\n\nOur treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by the Board. We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2021 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn (2019/20: \u00a32.1bn) maturing in March 2026.\n\nIn the UK, the group has arranged for funders to offer a supplier financing scheme to the group's suppliers. This enables suppliers who sign up to the arrangements to sell their invoices to the funders and to be paid earlier than the invoice due date. The group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings. At 31 March 2021 the payables met the criteria of trade payables.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark reform\n\nThe group's syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn at 31st March 2021) currently refers to Euribor, sterling LIBOR and US dollar LIBOR, and includes standard market LIBOR replacement language to adopt alternative benchmark rates for sterling (Sonia) and US dollars (SOFR). Notional cash pooling arrangements and overdraft arrangements which reference LIBOR will be transitioned onto ARRs where applicable. Any outstanding group contracts with reference to LIBOR benchmarks will include provisions for calculation of interest based on alternative benchmark rates when LIBOR is discontinued.\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of the remaining cash flows including interest payable for our non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value.\n\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities At 31 March 2021   | Loans and  other  borrowings c \u00a3m   | Interest on  loans and  other  borrowings c \u00a3m   | Trade and  other  payables \u00a3m   | Provisions \u00a3m   | Lease  liabilities \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                                     | 692                                 | 528                                              | 5,153                           | 1               | 724                     | 7,098      |\n| Between one and two years                               | 1,427                               | 528                                              | -

treasury operation (primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents) and from trading-related receivables.\n\nFor treasury-related balances, the Board's defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3/A- for long-term and P1/A1 for short-term investments. If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.\n\nThe treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.\n\n## Operational management policy\n\nOur credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the customer-facing units to ensure compliance. The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards. Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit. We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.",

Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional \u00a32,024m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised. The related net cash outflow during the year was \u00a3490m (2019/20: inflow \u00a3460m). The collateral paid and received is recognised within current asset investments and loans and other borrowings, respectively.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nThe table below shows our financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the group's balance sheet and the impact of enforceable master netting or similar agreements.\n\n|                                                   |                                              | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets and liabilities At 31 March 2021 | Amounts  presented in  the balance  sheet \u00a3m | Right of set off  with derivative  counterparties \u00a3m | Cash   collateral \u00a3m                                 | Net   amount \u00a3m                                      |\n| Derivative financial assets                       | 1,235                                        | (585)                                                | (588)                                                | 62                                                   |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                  | (1,283)                                      | 585                                                  | 82                                                   | (616)                                                |\n| Total                                             | (48)                                         | -                                                    | (506)                                                | (554)                                                |\n\n|                                                   |                                              | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet    | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off   in the balance sheet   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets and liabilities At 31 March 2020 | Amounts  presented in  the balance  sheet \u00a3m | Right of set off  with derivative counterparties a \u00a3m | Cash   collateral \u00a3m                                 | Net   amount \u00a3m                                      |\n| Derivative financial assets                       | 2,489                                        | (742)                                                 | (1,091)                                              | 656                                                  |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                  | (1,012)                                      | 742                                                   | 83                                                   | (187)                                                |\n| Total                                             | 1,477                                        | -                                                     | (1,008)                                              | 469                                                  |\n\n- a  The 2020 comparative has been re-presented to take account of collateral received from counterparties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments mainly to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAll of our derivative financial instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge\n\nThe group designates certain derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, hedge documentation must be prepared at inception, the hedge must be in line with BT's risk management strategy and there must be an economic relationship based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows of the hedging instrument and hedged item. This is assessed at inception and in subsequent periods in which the hedge remains in operation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer in line with BT's risk management strategy or if it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. For cash flow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the same line of the income statement and in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement. This includes any ineffectiveness as a result of changes in our hedged forecast cash flows as a result of Covid-19.\n\n## Other derivatives\n\nOur policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes. However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or may be specifically not designated as a hedge because natural offset is more appropriate. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are recognised at fair value. Any direct transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the income statement in the line that most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction to which they relate.\n\nWhere the fair value of a derivative contract at initial recognition is not supported by observable market data and differs from the transaction price, a day one gain or loss will arise which is not recognised in the income statement. Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the income statement based on the remaining contractual term and as observable market data becomes available.\n\nThe fair values of outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.\n\n| At 31 March 2021                |   Current  asset \u00a3m | Non-current  asset \u00a3m   |   Current  liability \u00a3m | Non-current  liability \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Designated in a cash flow hedge |                  56 | 950                     |                      58 | 1,023                       |\n| Other                           |                  14 | 215                     |                      30 | 172                         |\n| Total derivatives               |                  70 | 1,165                   |                      88 | 1,195                       |\n\n| At 31 March 2020                |   Current  asset \u00a3m | Non-current  asset \u00a3m   |   Current  liability \u00a3m |   Non-current  liability \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Designated in a cash flow hedge |                 250 | 1,954                   |                      36 |                         740 |\n| Other                           |                  10 | 275                     |                      10 |                         226 |\n| Total derivatives               |                 260 | 2,229                   |                      46 |                         966 |\n\nAll derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 24.\n\nInstruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging euro and US dollardenominated borrowings.

The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the assets. Level 1 investments, classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, were sold in 2020. The fair value gain was reclassified from fair value reserve to profit and loss reserve after disposal.\n- c  The cost of hedging reserve reflects the gain or loss on the portion excluded from the designated hedging instrument that relates to the currency basis element of our cross currency swaps. It is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and accounted for similarly to gains or losses in the cash flow reserve.\n- d  The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the net assets of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.\n- e  Excludes \u00a3nil (2019/20: \u00a3(1)m) of exchange differences in relation to retained earnings attributed to non-controlling interests.\n- f  Movements in cash flow hedges recognised in income and expense include a net charge to other comprehensive income of \u00a3778m (2019/20: charge of \u00a3428m) which have been reclassified to operating costs, and a net credit to the cash flow reserve of \u00a372m (2019/20: \u00a346m) which have been reclassified to finance expense (see note 27).\n- g  Included within the \u00a3189m movement in the translation reserve is \u00a323m which relate to disposals (see note 23).\n\n## 30.

Financial commitments and contingent liabilities\n\nFinancial commitments were as follows:\n\n| At 31 March                     | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| TV programme rights commitments | 1,691     | 2,434     |\n| Capital commitments             | 1,370     | 1,234     |\n| Other commitments               | 263       | 228       |\n| Total                           | 3,324     | 3,896     |\n\nTV programme rights commitments, mainly relating to football broadcast rights, are those for which the licence period has not yet started. Payments made to receive programming in advance of the licence period are classified as prepayments in note 17.\n\nOther than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees at 31 March 2021 other than those arising in the ordinary course of the group's business and on these no material losses are anticipated. We have insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of our operations. Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.\n\n## Commitments and guarantees\n\n## BT plc\n\nFrom March 2019 a formal guarantee was put in place by BT Group plc to fully and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc ('BT plc') under its corporate bonds. This guarantee has been given in respect of all bonds issued since that date and was retrospectively applied to bonds issued prior to that date. It applies to all bonds issued in BT plc's Yankee, Euro Medium Term Note and hybrid bond programmes, and under the BT plc \u00a3600 5.75% bonds due in 2028.\n\n## BDUK\n\nUnder the Building Digital UK programme, grants received by the group may be subject to reinvestment or repayment to the local authority depending on the level of take-up.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica UK Limited leases\n\nWe've provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telef\u00f3nica UK Limited (formerly O2 UK Limited) prior to the demerger of mmO2 from BT on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc (now part of the Telef\u00f3nica Group) has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees. There is no exposure in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations. The guarantee lasts until Telef\u00f3nica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations.\n\n## Legal and regulatory proceedings\n\nThe group is involved in various proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation, and government or regulatory investigations. However, save as disclosed below, the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, or government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group. In respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group. There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and/or the often slow pace of litigation.\n\n## Class action claim\n\nIn January 2021, law firm Mishcon de Reya applied to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring a proposed class action claim for damages estimated at \u00a3608m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a3589m (inclusive of simple interest) on behalf of our landlineonly customers alleging anti-competitive behaviour through excessive pricing by BT to customers with certain residential landline services. We regret being drawn into litigation on a topic which Ofcom considered more than three years ago. At that time, Ofcom's final statement made no finding of excessive pricing or breach of competition law more generally. The claim seeks to hold against us the fact that we implemented a voluntary commitment to reduce prices for customers that have a BT landline only and not to increase those prices beyond inflation (CPI). At the reporting date we are not aware of any evidence to indicate that a present obligation exists such that any amount should be provided for. Class actions must be certified by the Competition Appeal Tribunal at a Collective Proceedings Order (CPO) hearing before proceeding to a substantive trial. The CPO hearing is listed on 24 and 25 June 2021. If the class action is certified the substantive trial will not conclude during 2021/22. BT intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\n## Italian business\n\nMilan Public Prosecutor prosecutions: In February 2019 the Milan Public Prosecutor served BT Italia S.P.A. (BT Italia) with a notice (which named BT Italia, as well as various individuals) to record the Prosecutor's view that there is a basis for proceeding with its case against BT Italia for certain potential offences, namely the charge of having adopted, from 2011 to 2016, an inadequate management and control organisation model for the purposes of Articles 5 and 25 of Legislative Decree 231/2001.\n\nBT Italia disputes this and maintains in a defence brief filed in April 2019 that: (i) BT Italia did not gain any interest or benefit from the conduct in question; and (ii) in any event, it had a sufficient organisational, management and audit model that was circumvented/ overridden by individuals acting in their own self-interest. However, following a series of committal hearings in Autumn 2020, on 10 November 2020, the Italian court agreed (as is the normal process unless there are limitation or other fundamental issues with the claim) that BT Italia, and all but one of the individuals, should be committed to a full trial.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial commitments and contingent liabilities continued\n\nThe trial commenced on 26 January 2021 and is expected to last at least two years. On 23 April 2021, the Italian court allowed some parties to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties ('parte civile') - a procedural feature of the Italian criminal law system. These claims are directed at certain individual defendants (which include former BT/BT Italia employees). Those parties have now applied to join BT Italia as a respondent to their civil claims ('responsabile civile') on the basis that it is vicariously responsible for the individuals' wrongdoing. If successful, the quantum of those claims is not anticipated to be material.\n\n## Phones 4U\n\nSince 2015 the administrators of Phones 4U Limited have made allegations that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure Phones 4U's insolvency. Legal proceedings for an unquantified amount were issued in December 2018 by the administrators and in April 2019 we submitted our defence to this claim. The parties are now working through the procedural steps in the litigation. We continue to dispute these allegations vigorously.\n\n## Regulatory matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are periodically notified of regulatory and compliance matters and investigations. We provide for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. Provisions reflect management's estimates of regulatory and compliance risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.\n\nThe precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory and compliance decisions will result in financial settlement. The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\n## 32. Post balance sheet events\n\n## BT OnePhone acquisition\n\nOn 17 April 2021 the group completed the acquisition of the remaining 30% of the share capital of BT One Phone Limited ('BTOP'), a telecom provider offering fixed-to-mobile replacement telephony networks and enterprise telephony solutions. BTOP is currently accounted for as a joint venture. The acquisition supports the group's strategy to invest in innovative technologies to become the most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.\n\nThe acquisition will be treated as a business combination under IFRS 3 and therefore the results of BTOP will be fully consolidated from the date of acquisition. The group paid \u00a397m for full and final settlement for the remaining share of the company. A purchase price allocation exercise will be completed and allocation of consideration between net assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill will be reported in the group's 2021/22 results.\n\n## Spectrum auction\n\nOn 27 April 2021 it was announced that the assignment stage of Ofcom's spectrum auction for 700 MHz and 3.6-3.8 GHz spectrum bands had been completed. EE Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of BT Group plc, has secured the following positions within the respective spectrum bands: 723-733 MHz and 778-788 MHz; 738-758 MHz; and 3680-3720 MHz. The total cost of the spectrum was \u00a3475m which will be accounted for within 2021/22 together with the related interference mitigation provision. In the 2020/21 Annual Report, \u00a3702m is held within prepayments on deposit with Ofcom. We received a refund of \u00a3227m at the conclusion of the process at the end of April 2021.",

Both loans were fully settled as at 31 March 2021. The remaining balance as at 31 March 2021 consists of a loan to group undertakings of \u00a3971m (2019/20: nil) and accrued interest of \u00a31m (2019/20:\u00a3nil). The loan attracts interest of LIBOR plus 37.5 basis points (2019/20: nil). The loan is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The expected credit loss provision against long-term loan to group undertakings is immaterial. Included in current trade and other receivables are loans to group undertakings of \u00a3nil (2019/20: \u00a31,074m) and accrued interest of \u00a3nil (2019/20: \u00a397m).\n- b  Trade and other payables consists of loans from group undertakings of \u00a310m (2019/20: \u00a382m) and other creditors of \u00a317m (2019/20: \u00a325m).\n- c  Loans and other borrowings consist of a loan from group undertakings of \u00a3nil (2019/20: \u00a33,177m) repayable on 31 January 2058 and attracted an interest of nil (2019/20: LIBOR plus 102.5 basis points).

BT Group plc accounting policies\n\n## Principal activity\n\nThe principal activity of the company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the BT group.\n\n## Accounting basis\n\nAs used in these financial statements and associated notes, the term 'company' refers to BT Group plc (a public company limited by shares). These separate financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with, and presented as required by, the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS 101). These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101 incorporates, with limited amendments, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. Refer to page 123 for further details of this assessment.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company's profit and loss account has not been presented.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThere have been no new or amended accounting standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Exemptions\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to business combinations, share-based payments, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, and presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. The company intends to continue to take advantage of these exemptions in future years. Further detail is provided below.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 contain a consolidated cash flow statement. Consequently, as permitted by IAS 7 'Statement of Cash flow', the company has not presented its own cash flow statement.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 contain related party disclosures. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in IAS 24, 'Related Party Disclosures' not to disclose transactions with other members of the BT Group.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. Consequently, the company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 in respect of its financial instruments.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by continuing to hold the asset and benefiting from the net present value of the future cash flows of the investment.\n\n## Taxation\n\nFull provision is made for deferred taxation on all temporary differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not discounted.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid; final dividends when authorised in general meetings by shareholders. Dividend income is recognised on receipt.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Repurchased shares of the company are recorded in the balance sheet as part of Own shares and presented as a deduction from shareholders' equity at cost.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe company does not incur a charge for share-based payments. However, the issuance by the company of share options and awards to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. An addition to the company's investment in subsidiaries is recorded with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders' funds. The additional capital contribution is determined based on the fair value of options and awards at the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period.\n\n## 2. Investments\n\n| Cost             | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| At 1 April 2019  | 10,952       |\n| Additions        | 72           |\n| At 31 March 2020 | 11,024       |\n| Additions        | 72           |\n| At 31 March 2021 | 11,096       |\n\nAdditions of \u00a372m (2019/20: \u00a372m) comprise capital contributions in respect of share-based payments.\n\nThe company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout 2020/21 and 2019/20.",

Merger reserve\n\nOn 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.70p per share resulting in a total of \u00a380m being credited to the share capital.\n\nThese shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE, which completed on 29 January 2016. As a result of this transaction, a merger reserve was created of \u00a37,424m net of \u00a33m issue costs. The acquisition of EE was structured by way of a share-for-share exchange. This transaction fell within the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 (merger relief) such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued. The company chose to record its investment in EE at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i.e. equal to the difference between the fair value of EE and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.\n\nThis merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis it was represented by the investment in EE. This was not considered to represent qualifying consideration (in accordance with Tech 02/10 (Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006)), as superseded by Tech 02/17 (Guidance on realised and distributable profits under the Companies Act 2006).\n\nImmediately following the acquisition of EE, the company's investment in EE was transferred to the company's subsidiary, BT plc, in exchange for an intercompany loan. To the extent the loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realised. Hence the merger reserve is an unrealised reserve until it is realised by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.\n\nDuring 2020/21, the remaining \u00a31,574m (2019/20: \u00a31,575m) of merger reserve was transferred to realised profit following the settlement of an intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.\n\n## 4. Other information\n\n## Dividends\n\nNo interim or final dividend is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021 (2019/20: interim dividend 4.62p amounting to \u00a3457m was paid; no final dividend paid).\n\n## Employees\n\nThe chairman, the executive and non-executive directors and the company secretary & general counsel, governance of BT Group plc were the only employees of the company during 2020/21 and 2019/20. The costs relating to qualifying services provided to the company's principal subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, are recharged to that company.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures we use are: adjusted revenue, adjusted operating costs, adjusted finance expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share, return on capital employed, normalised free cash flow and net debt. The rationale for using these measures, along with a reconciliation from the nearest measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, are presented below.\n\nThe alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors, such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.\n\nExamples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/ or prior years include acquisitions/disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items.\n\nDetails of items meeting the definition of specific items in the current and prior year are set out in note 9.\n\nReported revenue, reported operating costs, reported operating profit, reported net finance expense, reported profit before tax and reported earnings per share are the equivalent IFRS measures. A reconciliation from these can be seen in the group income statement on page 118.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities (both current and non-current) less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on balance sheet.\n\nOur net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature. Currency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swap rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to loans and borrowings, current asset investments and cash equivalents to reflect the effective interest method are removed.\n\nNet debt is a measure of the group's net indebtedness that provides an indicator of overall balance sheet strength. It is a key indicator used by management to assess both the group's cash position and its indebtedness. The use of the term 'net debt' does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.\n\nNet financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities. It allows for the comparison to net debt measures reported before the introduction of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, and reflects a view that lease liabilities are operational debt in substance, rather than financing transactions.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset investments, the most directly comparable IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt, is set out in note 26.",

It is a group KPI that is directly relatable to the outcome of investment decisions.\n\nROCE represents the group's returns as percentage of capital employed.\n\nReturns are defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax. We use an adjusted measure (before specific items) for the reasons explained in the 'specific items' section above.\n\nCapital employed represents equity, debt and debt-like liabilities. We net the derivative financial instruments and cash and cash equivalent balances that we use to manage financial risk against gross debt, and exclude current and deferred tax balances as the measure is determined on a pre-tax basis.\n\nWhile our long-term capital investment programmes such as our full fibre rollout deliver value-creating long term returns, they suppress ROCE in the short to medium term.\n\nThe following table sets out the calculation of our ROCE measure. In doing so it reconciles returns to operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, and presents the components of capital employed.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Reported operating profit for the                                    | 2,587      | 3,283      |\n| period                                                               |            |            |\n| Share of post tax profits (losses) of  associates and joint ventures | 8          | (33)       |\n| Specific items (non-finance and tax)                                 | 481        | 367        |\n| Return for the period                                                | 3,076      | 3,617      |\n| Equity, debt and debt-like liabilities                               |            |            |\n| Loans and other borrowings                                           | 16,685     | 19,334     |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 6,152      | 6,560      |\n| Retirement benefit obligations                                       | 5,096      | 1,140      |\n| BDUK grant funding deferral                                          | 568        | 619        |\n| Total equity                                                         | 11,679     | 14,763     |\n| Adjust for balances used to hedge  financial risk                    |            |            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                            | (1,000)    | (1,549)    |\n| Investments                                                          | (3,683)    | (5,112)    |\n| Net derivative financial instruments Adjust for tax balances         | 48         | (1,477)    |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities                                         | 440        | 1,308      |\n| Net current tax receivable                                           | (197)      | (46)       |\n| Capital employed                                                     | 35,788     | 35,540     |\n| Return on capital employed                                           | 8.6%       | 10.2%      |\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nIn addition to measuring financial performance of the group and customer-facing units based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items, net non-interest related finance expense, and share of post-tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.\n\nWe consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.\n\nA reconciliation of reported profit for the period, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Reported profit for the period                                       | 1,472      | 1,734      |\n| Tax                                                                  | 332        | 619        |\n| Reported profit before tax                                           | 1,804      | 2,353      |\n| Net interest related finance expense                                 | 773        | 750        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                        | 4,347      | 4,274      |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 6,924      | 7,377      |\n| EBITDA specific items                                                | 481        | 350        |\n| Net other finance expense                                            | 18         | 147        |\n| Share of post tax losses (profits) of  associates and joint ventures | (8)        | 33         |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                      | 7,415      | 7,907      |",

        "page_content": "## Normalised free cash flow\n\nNormalised free cash flow is one of the group's key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured. It is primarily a liquidity measure. However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is defined as free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid and payment of lease liabilities, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, and repayment and raising of debt.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.\n\nA reconciliation from cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to free cash flow and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash generated from operations                                       | 6,251      | 6,481      |\n| Tax paid                                                             | (288)      | (210)      |\n| Net cash inflow from operating  activities                           | 5,963      | 6,271      |\n| Net purchase of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets | (4,818)    | (3,889)    |\n| Free cash flow                                                       | 1,145      | 2,382      |\n| Interest received                                                    | 6          | 30         |\n| Interest paid                                                        | (770)      | (736)      |\n| Add back pension deficit payments                                    | 955        | 1,274      |\n| Remove cash tax benefit of pension  deficit payments                 | (181)      | (434)      |\n| Dividends from associates                                            | 5          | 1          |\n| Add back net cash flow from specific  items                          | 390        | 112        |\n| Add back net sale of non-current asset  investments                  | (11)       | 33         |\n| Add back prepayment in respect of  spectrum licence auction          | 702        | -          |\n| Remove payment of lease liabilities                                  | (782)      | (651)      |\n| Normalised free cash flow                                            | 1,459      | 2,011      |\n\n<!-- image -->",
