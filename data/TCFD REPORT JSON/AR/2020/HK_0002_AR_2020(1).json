In an unprecedented year when a public health crisis brought the importance of business sustainability into sharp focus, this report provides an account of the steps taken by CLP to keep the lights on and provide support to its employees, customers, shareholders and the local communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe resilience demonstrated by CLP in delivering continued reliability of energy services while progressing investments for decarbonisation and digitalisation epitomises the Group's approach to business throughout our long history. The cover design of this report illustrates our deeply embedded values as we celebrate our 120 th anniversary in 2021, and our vision to create a better and more sustainable future together with our communities, grasping the many possibilities from the dynamic changes in the world's economy.\n\nCLP remains committed to integrated reporting, and this report continues to follow the guidelines issued by the International Integrated Reporting Council. We adopt the six-capital approach in explaining how we utilise our financial, intellectual, human, natural, manufactured, and social and relationship capitals to create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders. This approach enables us to present our operational and financial performance as well as our environmental, social, and governance performance in a clear and comprehensive way.\n\nOur report also complies with, and in many respects go beyond, applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and accounting standards including the Hong Kong Listing Rules. CLP continued to enhance its disclosure with reference to the recommendations by the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to allow stakeholders to track the risks and opportunities climate change presents to our business. The full extent of our current TCFD disclosures are included in the complementary online Sustainability Report.\n\nWe hope you find this report - along with the Sustainability Report - informative and interesting, and that it provides you with insights into the Group's efforts to steer the business forward amid the extraordinary challenges of the pandemic and climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Snapshot of 2020 Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 Sustainability Report\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to a diversified portfolio of generating assets that uses a wide range of fuels including coal, gas, nuclear and renewable sources, the Group also has operations in the transmission, distribution and retail of energy, and offers smart energy services. In 2021, CLP celebrates the 120 th anniversary of its founding in Hong Kong with a commitment to continue to move forward with the community based on a shared vision of a better tomorrow.\n\n|                       | Current Operations   | Potential Opportunities   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Generation            |                      |                           |\n| Transmission          |                      |                           |\n| Distribution          |                      |                           |\n| Retail                |                      |                           |\n| Smart Energy Services |                      |                           |\n\nHong Kong\n\nHong Kong's electricity sector is regulated by the Scheme of Control Agreements and operated by two\n\nvertically-integrated utility companies that serve different geographical areas of the city. CLP Power Hong Kong, the larger of the two companies and a wholly-owned subsidy of the Group, provides a power supply of over 99.999% world-class reliability to 2.67 million customers in Kowloon, the New Territories, and most of the outlying islands, serving about 80% of the city's population.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMainland China\n\nThe electricity industry in Mainland China is largely state-controlled. Transmission and distribution are limited to two state-owned enterprises while generation is open for investment. CLP first entered the market in 1979 when the Group began providing electricity to Guangdong province. Today, CLP China is the largest external independent power producer in Mainland China with over 50 power projects in 15 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, concentrating on low-carbon energy, including nuclear power and renewable energy.\n\nMuch of the electricity industry in India has traditionally been owned and controlled by the Federal and State Governments. Over the last decade and a half, private companies have been encouraged to invest in the generation and increasingly transmission segments. On the distribution side, the Federal Government has recently progressed initiatives for more privatisation. Since entering the Indian market in 2002, CLP has built a diversified portfolio comprising wind, solar and supercritical coal generating facilities as well as transmission assets. The Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et\n\nIndia\n\nplacement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) became a 40% strategic shareholder in CLP India in 2018. Our strategy is for CLP India to pursue growth in non-carbon areas.\n\nIndia\n\nSoutheast Asia and Taiwan\n\nCLP has minority interests in a solar project in Thailand and a coal-based generation plant in Taiwan. The electricity industry is government-controlled in both markets. As a committed supporter of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, CLP is exploring investment opportunities in renewable energy generation in the Southeast Asia and Taiwan markets.\n\nMainland\n\nChina\n\nHong Kong\n\nSoutheast Asia and Taiwan\n\nAustralia\n\n## 2020 Operating Earnings\n\nHong Kong electricity and related business HK$ 8,088 million\n\nMainland China\n\nHK$ 2,233 million\n\nIndia\n\nHK$\n\n175\n\nmillion\n\nSoutheast Asia and Taiwan\n\nHK$\n\n386\n\nmillion\n\nAustralia\n\nHK$ 1,690 million\n\nOther earnings and unallocated expenses -HK$ 995 million\n\nTotal HK$ 11,577 million\n\nAustralia\n\nEnergyAustralia is one of the largest privately-owned electricity generators under the National Electricity Market (NEM), a major gas and electricity retailer in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory, and an electricity retailer in Queensland. Private generators operating under the NEM and a number of government-owned assets provide generation services in a competitive wholesale market. The electricity retail market is fully privatised while the transmission and distribution segments remain substantially regulated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As an energy supplier, our focus has been keeping the lights on and providing support to the local communities and our customers to help them get through tough times. Our thoughts remain with those around the world affected by the pandemic.\n\nFacing this unprecedented crisis, we have demonstrated resilience, something we owe to the remarkable efforts of our people. Our long-term strategy and robust crisis planning also helped us adapt while maintaining operational excellence. Managing through the pandemic has highlighted the importance of sound governance as a core corporate value, and crisis preparation as a key governance practice. In 2003 when SARS hit Hong Kong, CLP developed specific\n\ncrisis management policies and procedures that have been reviewed and refined regularly. As the severity of COVID-19 became evident, those plans could readily be brought to bear across all our operations.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has dealt a heavy blow to the global economy, its impact on essential services like electricity has so far been less severe than on many other sectors.\n\nIn 2020, the Group's operating earnings increased by a modest 4% to HK$11,577 million while total earnings rose significantly to HK$11,456 million from 2019 when an impairment of goodwill was booked in the Australian business. The Board remains confident in the Group's prospects, yet in the short term it recognises that the ongoing pandemic creates uncertainties. As such, it approved a fourth interim dividend payment for 2020 of HK$1.21 per share, a 1.7% increase compared with the same period in 2019. Total dividends per share for 2020 are HK$3.10 per share, 0.6% higher than a year ago.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Globally, there has been a welcome intensification of focus on decarbonisation with China announcing carbon neutrality targets for 2060, Hong Kong for 2050, and the US rejoining the Paris Agreement. 2021 is the year of the 26 th United Nations Climate Change Conference where the world will be looking to countries to strengthen their commitments made under this Agreement.  More leadership and ambition from Governments enables businesses to accelerate our contributions and we look forward to further policy clarity in support of decarbonisation.\n\nAs a diversified business we know well that not all of our markets face the same circumstances at the same time. It has long been our approach to remain mindful of the local contexts and the ways in which different markets evolve, and act accordingly in line with our broader decarbonisation strategy and growth plans.\n\nIn our home market Hong Kong, we are taking steps to serve the city with lower-carbon energy with the commissioning in 2020 of a highly-efficient natural gas-fired generating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nunit at Black Point Power Station and the beginning of the construction of another similar facility on the same site. We continue to make significant progress on the offshore LNG terminal to help diversify the region's gas supplies to these developments. These important infrastructure projects underscore our commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our electricity supply and contribute to Hong Kong's sustainable future.\n\nThe Chinese economy has emerged from 2020 stronger than at the start and we are keen to further expand our investments particularly in the Guangdong-Hong KongMacao Greater Bay Area. We look to build on our presence and operating experience in the region as well as existing partnerships to capture the opportunities in a market that is close to our Hong Kong business and is going through large-scale electrification and digitalisation. Recently, we joined our long-standing partner China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd (CSG) to invest in the CSG Energy Innovation Equity Investment Fund that targets innovative energy developments, new energy infrastructure, and smart energy in the Greater Bay Area. This represents just one of the many early opportunities we are pursuing in the region.",

This is a journey that requires the support of substantial investments in the coming years and presents opportunities to those who are agile and visionary in their approach to business. We are committed to playing a responsible role in the energy transition, ensuring the security of electricity supply while working towards the modernisation and decarbonisation of our overall position.\n\nOur growing capabilities in digitisation and innovation ensure that we are ready for new opportunities - whether it is maximising the potential of existing energy assets, powering data centres and electric vehicles, or bringing energy solutions to our customers. In Hong Kong, our progress in digital is marked by our continual roll-out of smart meters across the city and we will likely hit the one million mark early in 2021.\n\nAs the world around us changes, we continue our transition towards a Utility of the Future with diversified, strategic investments in new business models and technologies. Throughout our history, CLP has recognised the need to re-evaluate and realign our activities in the face of changing external circumstances and policies.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that we have the best Board we can to support us on our journey, I was delighted to welcome Ms Christina Gaw and Mr Chunyuan Gu to our Board in 2020.

During this time, our priorities were to maintain a reliable power supply, ensure business continuity and care for our colleagues, customers and the communities. We also remained focused on progressing key infrastructure projects, including the development of two Combined-Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) and an offshore LNG terminal in Hong Kong, and the ongoing evolution of our strategy. Our 2020 results reflect our resilience as a business.\n\nThe pandemic reinforces the importance of paying attention to the broader issues of sustainability in business. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the energy sector as we know it. With so much of the world increasingly focused on decarbonisation, and with a growing awareness of previously set targets, we are mindful that the time horizons for change are shorter than they may first seem.\n\nTo succeed in an increasingly complex energy industry, a utility like CLP will need to be more responsive, resilient and agile. We have long believed in the value and strength that comes from diversity, and our evolving approach to our home and core markets is a continuation of this philosophy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile Hong Kong remains at the heart of our business, Mainland China is another key market for the CLP Group. Together with India and Australia, this provides diversity to our portfolio. Our objective for EnergyAustralia is to strengthen our position as a leading integrated, customer-centric energy supplier with a more flexible fleet of generation assets to supply the changing needs of our mass market and commercial customers. In India, we aim to further expand our portfolio focusing on renewables and low-carbon opportunities. In Mainland China, we will continue to focus on our recent investments in renewables and nuclear. Our strategy for the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is to pursue more diversified opportunities as a natural extension of our activities in Hong Kong.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our priorities were to maintain a safe and reliable service, and support our own people and customers. The modest fall in electricity sales as a result of more subdued economic activities was largely balanced by increased residential consumption as more people worked from home and the hotter summer months. In the second half of the year demand returned to something closer to normal expectations. During the year, operating earnings of Hong Kong's electricity business increased 5% to HK$7,818 million.\n\nTo cope with the pandemic, we rolled out personal protective equipment to our teams, further diversified procurement to build resilience into our supply chain and moved to safer ways of working. We were able to achieve the target of generating about 50% of our electricity from gas, boosted by the new 550MW CCGT at Black Point Power Station. Ground has now been broken on a further unit on the same site.\n\nGood progress has been made on the offshore LNG terminal with construction work in the sea commenced in December. Natural gas remains an important part of the territory's energy mix for the medium term and this facility will enhance Hong Kong's energy security and the sustainability of supply.\n\nCLP has a key role to play in Hong Kong's decarbonisation journey. We are seeing a clear shift from incremental improvements to an acceleration of the desire for change. This will create further opportunities given our strong existing position in the market. Offshore wind is one option for local clean energy and we will look carefully at the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness cases as they emerge. In 2020, the Hong Kong Government announced a target to be carbon neutral by 2050. We are committed to working with the Government and all stakeholders to contribute our power expertise to discussions on how all sectors together can make this a reality.\n\n## Mainland China\n\nElectricity demand was affected by lower industrial activity as a result of COVID-19 in the earlier part of 2020 before rebounding strongly as the Chinese economy started picking up. In this environment, the performance of our diversified portfolio held up well. Operating earnings for 2020 were HK$2,233 million, a decrease of only 2% when compared with 2019.\n\nSafety is one of our core values and I am delighted that our nuclear projects won several prestigious awards for their construction and safety standards. Nothing will ever be more important than the safe operations of all our sites and external recognition of our approach is a reward for the hard work of our teams.\n\nDuring the year, we were pleased to commission phase III of the Laiwu wind farm in Shandong province. This took the total capacity of the project to 149MW, making it the largest operational wind project across the CLP Group. We also committed to invest in phase III of the Qian'an wind project (100MW) in Jilin province - which will be CLP's first gridparity project in the country. Our aspiration is to continue to grow our portfolio of renewable energy projects in Mainland China but we will continue to take a selective approach to our evaluation of these opportunities.",

        "page_content": "CLP has been operating in the GBA for many years and we have established partnerships including those with China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd and China General Nuclear Power Corporation. The GBA presents significant opportunities thanks to the size of its economy and its part in China's journey to carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nThere is a need not just for individual renewable projects but for the integrated provision of supporting infrastructure and energy solutions. The evolution of the energy system in the GBA could bring new opportunities across the electricity supply chain - from generation assets, transmission and distribution to new business models around energy-as-a-service.\n\n## India\n\nIndia was one of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 and it was not without impact on the operations of CLP India. During this difficult period, the Jhajjar coal-fired plant nonetheless performed steadily. While CLP India's wind portfolio experienced unfavourable weather conditions, its solar and transmission assets showed good performance. Our acquisition of two solar farms in Telangana has brought us an additional 80MW capacity and both projects performed well. During the year, operating earnings attributable to CLP decreased 33.5% to HK$175 million.\n\nMeanwhile, we were particularly delighted to receive further recognition of our efforts on safety including an award from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in the UK for Jhajjar's performance.\n\nOur strategy in India remains focused on pursuing opportunities in non-carbon businesses such as renewable energy projects and transmission assets. During 2020, as the country adjusted to disruptions associated with COVID-19, we experienced delays to some regulatory approvals. In the context of the Government's new rules on foreign investments, we will continue to work with the administration to facilitate our future investments.\n\n## Australia\n\nNever has our focus on people been more important than in Australia in 2020 where the devastating impact of bushfires through late 2019 and early 2020 was followed soon after by COVID-19.\n\nWe have proactively supported both residential and small business customers with initiatives ranging from freezing debt collection to dedicated payment plans. While we cannot solve all the challenges that people face, we can play our part in relieving some of the burdens where appropriate.\n\nAustralia's COVID-19 lockdown measures, some of which fell disproportionately in areas where we operate, led to the country's first economic recession in almost 30 years and inevitably affected our results. The National Electricity Market experienced a significant decline in wholesale prices driven by increased renewable generation and changing energy consumption patterns due to the pandemic. This, together with lower generation while we undertook major, planned maintenance programmes, led to reduced earnings from our Energy business.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing impact of retail price regulation and intensified competition in the retail markets, including from newer retailers, put significant pressure on margins in our Customer business. Earnings at an underlying operational level therefore saw a decrease. However, once non-cash changes in the fair value of our energy hedging contracts are included, EnergyAustralia recorded an increase in operating earnings of 8% to HK$1,690 million.\n\nThe new initiatives introduced by the State and Federal Governments in 2020 show that Australia's energy transition is gaining momentum and the shifts will be potentially significant for the industry. EnergyAustralia is committed to playing a constructive role in this accelerated energy transition in close dialogues with Governments and the communities.\n\n## Unlocking the Benefits of Digitalisation\n\nIn 2020, as large parts of the world were grounded to a near standstill by the impact of COVID-19, we put in place special work arrangements to strengthen the protection of our employees. The conscious decision we made a few years ago to enhance our information technology infrastructure now allowed colleagues to switch between remote working and mixed mode working as social distancing rules evolved.\n\nOur ongoing investments in digitalisation also supported our efforts to deliver more user-centric and smart energy services to customers. In Hong Kong, we rolled out an upgraded mobile app that brings to our customers a host of new and easier functions. The app saw a big jump in both downloads and usage in 2020 as a growing number of people preferred remote services during the pandemic. As we moved further along the digitalisation path, we are mindful of greater exposure to cybersecurity-related risks and are therefore stepping up efforts to enhance our cybersecurity.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, Smart Energy Connect, Asia's first online energy app store, has helped more businesses and organisations improve energy efficiency and automation with its offering of energy management solutions. In the postpandemic world, the digitalisation of energy services will be of particular importance as businesses worldwide look to boost operational resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our industry is undergoing a seismic shift and will change beyond recognition. To give an example of how fundamental this change is just reflect on Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone over a century ago. If you showed him a telephone of today - a smartphone - he wouldn't recognise it. By contrast, Thomas Edison who developed electric power distribution and of course invented the lightbulb around the same time would still recognise many of his inventions in the power industry today. But soon our industry will no longer be recognisable to Edison. It too, like the telecoms industry, will have transformed. It's a tremendously exciting time for all of us working in energy. And the answer to your question is that we must put our customers at the very heart of our strategy. If we do, we will be able to play a key role in the energy transition and find many new opportunities that will allow us to prosper.\n\nRichard Lancaster\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The growing spectre of the pandemic had little impact on CLP share price until late March when the stock tracked the plunge in global markets to close at HK$65.00, down by 6.8% during the day. This was the stock's largest daily movement since October 2008, and the lowest closing price in over four years.\n\nDespite this, CLP shares were resilient and by mid-April had regained all the lost ground to be trading at the same level as prior to the plunge. Reflecting confidence in the long-term outlook of the Company, the total dividends declared for 2020 were HK$3.10 per share, up by 0.6% as compared with 2019. Nonetheless, as with many stocks and its peers in the local utility sector, downward pressure on CLP share price resumed and continued for the remainder of the year. CLP shares finished 2020 at HK$71.70, down by 12.5%.\n\nBy comparison, the HSI was down by 3.4% while the Bloomberg World Electric Index (BWEI) was up by 3.2%.\n\nThis comparison is shown in the chart below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trend shown in the 10-year Relative Performance chart below represents the share price changes compared with the closing price 10 years ago.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with our established practice, our ordinary dividends are paid four times a year in each of the quarters.\n\nCLP's Dividends Policy is available on the CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur shareholders, whether institutional or retail investors, have continued to emphasise the importance they attach to a consistent dividend stream with gradual growth from their investment in CLP shares. In fact, our total annual dividends paid out have not decreased since 1960 - a solid record maintained over the past 60 years.\n\nThe following chart demonstrates that we have maintained a stable dividend stream, despite fluctuations in earnings over the period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Past 10 years (2011-2020)\n\nCLP has provided reliable and consistent ordinary dividend payments over the past 10-year period. Our dividend payments have increased over the last five years where the average year to year growth was around 2.8% and this has been supported by a corresponding increase in earnings other than in 2019 where earnings fell against 2018. For the past 10 years, the average year to year growth was approximately 2% and the dividend payouts were in the range of 55% to 68% of operating earnings, except for 2013 and 2019 when our payout ratio rose to 70% of operating earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although Hong Kong remains our core market and strategic focus, the energy transition in China also provides significant business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area. Our priority in Australia is to deliver on the expectations of our customers under challenging market and regulatory conditions, and to prepare for a more digital and less carbon intensive future.\n\nWe continue our transformation into a Utility of the Future by decarbonising our portfolio, investing in new technologies and digitising our operations and customer services. As part of our Climate Vision 2050, we have pledged not to invest in any additional coal-fired generation capacity and to progressively phase out all remaining coal assets by 2050.\n\n## How We Progress on the Execution of Our Strategy\n\nDespite challenges from COVID-19, Hong Kong electricity business remains CLP's key contributor with a slight increase in earnings resulting from the continuous progress of our capital projects. Businesses outside Hong Kong benefitted from a diversified portfolio and recorded broadly stable earnings, although relatively more affected by the pandemic and other operational challenges.\n\nIn 2020, the first 550MW CCGT unit and the landfill gas generation plant started operations in Hong Kong. Civil works for the second CCGT commenced and construction of the offshore LNG terminal and rollout of smart meters progressed. Outside Hong Kong, decarbonisation and innovation initiatives included the acquisitions of two solar projects in India, and the commissioning of Laiwu III and the commercial operation of our first investment in the distribution grid in Fangchenggang in Mainland China. We also completed the sale of our entire interest in the development of a coal-fired project, Vung Ang II, in Vietnam in October 2020.\n\n## Adequate Resources to Support Our Strategy\n\nFree cash flow represents the cash that can be used by a company after taking care of its operations. It can be used for distribution to equity and debt holders, and to grow the business.\n\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19 and the continuous challenging market conditions in Australia, the operating inflow from the SoC business remains the key source of funds for our capital investment programme and dividend in 2020.  Furthermore, leveraging on our financial strength, CAPCO issued a US$350 million (HK$2.7 billion) Energy Transition Bond for our LNG project and CLP Power Hong Kong issued dual tranches of Medium Term Notes on the same date to refinance its borrowings.\n\n## Where We Stand\n\n- \uf09e Continuous progress on energy transition infrastructure projects and deployment of customer-centric products and services\n- \uf09e New business initiatives such as the participation in an innovation fund in Mainland China with China Southern Power Grid\n- \uf09e Our non-carbon emitting generation portfolio accounted for about one quarter of our generation portfolio (including long-term capacity and energy purchase arrangements), but earnings decreased to HK$2,161 million mainly due to lower natural resources available\n- \uf09e Dividend growth of 0.6% for 2020, backed with a solid financial position and adequate financial resources\n- \uf09e Strong investment grade credit ratings maintained\n\n<!-- image -->",

higher profits from renewable projects mainly from the newly commissioned wind projects, partially offset by lower water resource; lower contributions from the coal-fired projects mainly due to lower reward on active participation of market sales at Fangchenggang in 2020 and lower tariff, despite higher utilisation hours, and lower output for the two minority-owned coal-fired projects\n- \uf09e India: Stable contribution from Jhajjar as improved heat rate and lower fuel and operating costs were substantially offset by lower capacity charges; significant drop in profits from renewable projects mainly due to lower natural resources and the impairment provision for Khandke wind project\n- \uf09e Southeast Asia & Taiwan: Higher share of results from Ho-Ping due to lower coal prices and higher generation, despite lower energy tariff (reflecting last year's lower coal prices), and higher recovery of development expenses partly offset by lower earnings from Lopburi solar project due to the expiry of a tax exemption and an impairment resulting from a tariff step down from December 2021\n- \uf09e Australia: Reduced gross margin from the Customer business reflecting the full year impact from price re-regulation, margin pressures under a competitive market and higher bad debt provisions to address the impact from COVID-19; Energy business margin maintained as higher generation from Mount Piper and high prices captured in early 2020 were largely offset by lower generation from other assets\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout this time, CLP has continued to provide a steady electricity supply with a 99.999% reliability to maintain the necessities of daily life. It has also taken exceptional steps to support its people and extend care to customers and businesses suffering from the impact of the pandemic. While demand for electricity was affected by the virus, the impact was mostly confined to non-residential sectors. Sales in the residential sector rose 9% to 10,298 GWh as more people stayed and worked from home, and Hong Kong experienced a hot summer.\n\nOverall, sales of electricity in Hong Kong fell 0.9% to 33,963GWh compared with 2019. The fall in sales would have been larger if demand from data centres had not continued to rise, driven by the increased adoption of big data and cloud computing.\n\nThe number of customer accounts meanwhile rose to 2.67 million, compared with 2.64 million in 2019.\n\nOperating earnings of Hong Kong electricity business rose 5.0% from 2019 to HK$7,818 million in 2020, in line with the increase in invested capital. CLP's performance is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hong Kong Electricity Sales in 2020\n\n|                                    | Increase  /  (Decrease)   | Increase  /  (Decrease)   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                    | GWh                       | %                         |\n| Residential                        | 847                       | 9.0                       |\n| Commercial                         | (706)                     | (5.2)                     |\n| Infrastructure and Public Services | (415)                     | (4.3)                     |\n| Manufacturing                      | (47)                      | (2.8)                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting Hong Kong and the Community\n\nCLP introduced a range of measures to ease the hardships suffered by many Hong Kong people as a result of COVID-19. Dining coupons were given to underprivileged families and elderly customers on concessionary tariffs, generating business for around 700 restaurants at a time when the catering industry suffered a heavy blow to patronage. Separately, a two-month electricity bill payment deferral programme was offered to small and medium-sized enterprises in the catering, hotel, and retail sectors, whose businesses were particularly hard-hit by the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Below are details of some of the initiatives:\n\nCLP Community Support Programmes\n\nHK$1.5 million will be used to fund the CLP Award for Vocational and Professional Education and Training Students\n\nAround HK$3 million will be spent to subsidise NGOs and community partners in organising activities related to energy conservation\n\nOver HK$35 million will be spent on the CLP Power Connect programme to provide assistance to disadvantaged people and encourage energy saving\n\nHK$20 million subsidy will be used on the Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme, and another HK$1 million will be spent on the Retro-Commissioning Training Scheme to help business customers enhancing energy efficiency\n\nAllocated over HK$80 million to launch a CLP Retail and Catering Coupons programme, of which coupons were given to nearly 800,000 households\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver HK$7 million will be allocated to provide electricity subsidy for 10,000 subdivided unit tenants and subsidise landlords to carry out rewiring works needed for the installation of individual electricity meters. Another HK$10 million will be used to provide energy-efficient electrical appliances to 5,000 households living in transitional housing\n\nCLP managed to keep its Average Net Tariff unchanged at HK$1.218 per unit of electricity for 2021, despite a substantially increased proportion of gas-fired generation. A fall in international fuel prices over the course of 2020 meant the Fuel Cost Adjustment could be reduced to the benefit of customers.\n\n## Decarbonising Our Portfolio for Hong Kong\n\nAlthough COVID-19 hampered economic activity in general, CLP was able to manage the challenges and move forward with a number of strategic projects aimed at increasing the use of natural gas in power generation and enhancing Hong Kong's energy security and the sustainability of gas supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA new Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) unit at Black Point Power Station was commissioned, marking the first new major generation unit deployed by CLP in Hong Kong since 2006. Statutory approvals were also obtained for a second CCGT unit at Black Point and early civil works got under way while engineering, procurement, and construction contracts were finalised. Development of the offshore LNG terminal also progressed as fabrication works continued and marine installation works started during the year.\n\nOver the years, CLP has delivered a stable, and reliable electricity supply for Hong Kong while continuing to decrease its carbon emissions-intensity. In 2020, with the new CCGT unit going into operation, CLP substantially increased the",

        "page_content": "proportion of gas-fired generation to around 50%. This represents a reduction of around 20% in the carbon intensity of CLP's electricity supply.\n\nCLP welcomes the announcement by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in her Policy Address that the city will strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The new target will have major implications not just for the electricity industry but also for Hong Kong as a whole. CLP is already well into decarbonisation and will work closely with the Government and the community to support the formulation of a practical roadmap to reduce carbon emissions and contribute strongly towards that goal.\n\nTo support Hong Kong in achieving its 2050 target, CLP will continue to promote the development of renewable energy, help customers improve their energy efficiency, and closely monitor the latest technological developments in new zerocarbon energy. CLP's first landfill gas generation project in Hong Kong, capable of producing 10MW of electricity, went into commercial operation in March and provided a platform for CLP to use landfill gas as a renewable energy source. Meanwhile, over 1,800 solar panels were installed on the rooftops of some buildings in CLP's generation plants and substations. With a combined capacity of around 0.7MW, the system is capable of generating the annual electricity used by around 170 households.\n\nCLP is considering the feasibility of constructing an offshore wind farm in the south-eastern waters of Hong Kong. The project has been under consideration for some time, but recent advances in the technology of wind turbine generators and an increasingly mature supply chain in the region make it appear more feasible.\n\nElectrification is another key driver to lower carbon emissions, and CLP is committed to promoting low-carbon transport to make Hong Kong a greener, smarter city. CLP launched an advanced service called Eco Charge 2.0 in support of a Government scheme that subsidises the installation of electric vehicle charging facilities at residential premises. Eco Charge 2.0 provides one-stop technical support and customer service to applicants interested in applying for funding for electric vehicle charging-enabled infrastructure under the Government's scheme. In the meantime, CLP extended its free EV charging service until the end of 2021, providing EV drivers with a convenient, territory-wide network through 54 semi-quick and quick EV charging stations with a total of 161 chargers across its supply area.\n\n## Providing a Greener Customer Experience\n\nCLP continued to equip its customers with the most up-todate technologies and products to help them adopt greener lifestyles in 2020. By the end of the year, over 840,000 smart meters were connected across CLP's supply area, giving customers rapid access to electricity usage data to allow\n\nthem to better manage their consumption. Another feature of smart meters is that they can help detect supply failures quickly and reduce repair times. Given the severe damage caused by Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018 to power supplies to remote villages, CLP prioritised the connection of smart meters in areas served by overhead lines, which are more prone to typhoon disruption. This work was completed in 2020.\n\nCLP has seen a significant increase in interest in the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme thanks to Hong Kong people's commitment to a more sustainable future and the falling cost of renewable energy equipment. By the end of 2020, an accumulated total of more than 13,000 applications had been received, nearly twice as many as the 6,900 received by the end of 2019. Around 87% of the projects have already been approved or connected to our grid. They represent a combined capacity of 175 MW, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of around 42,800 households.\n\nSales of Renewable Energy Certificates grew about 70% compared with last year. Even more encouragingly, some customers expressed interest in larger purchases of certificates, either for a greater amount or for a longer period, demonstrating their commitment to a greener, lowercarbon Hong Kong.\n\nThe CLP Eco Building Fund provided subsidies for over 700 residential and commercial buildings to install energyefficient equipment in 2020, saving a total of more than 48 GWh of electricity.\n\n## Continuing the Digitalisation Journey\n\nFor all its negative impact globally, one silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that it has quickened the pace of digitalisation. From the beginning of the outbreak in early 2020, CLP swiftly implemented flexible working policies with most of its workforce working remotely during peaks of the pandemic. This was made possible by CLP's strategy of moving to cloud computing several years ago, underpinned by investments in system enhancement.\n\nThe new CLP mobile app provides customers with an endto-end digital experience, from move-in services and eBill applications, to mobile payments and a Smart Shopping platform. Downloads and usage of the app saw a nearly 50% increase compared with the previous year as growing numbers of customers opted for online services.\n\nTo demonstrate the immense range of new possibilities, a CLP customer services centre was renovated and upgraded to feature multi-function self-service kiosks, deploying the latest digital technology to give customers a convenient and flexible account service and shopping experience. CLP also introduced robotic process automation to enhance its operational efficiency in a number of areas, including customer application processing and marketing consent checking.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP also complied with all the emissions caps set by the Government during the year. It achieved this by optimising its diversified fuel mix and maintaining the effectiveness of its emissions control facilities.\n\n## Air Emissions\n\nThe new CCGT unit at Black Point enables CLP to support the Government's target of increasing natural gas use to around 50% of Hong Kong's fuel mix for power generation from 2020 in order to improve air quality. Together with the second CCGT unit being developed, it will contribute to the gradual phase-out of the oldest coal-fired units at Castle Peak Power Station which are expected to reach the end of their operating life in the mid-2020s. Furthermore, the new landfill gas project will help CLP reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of its generation activities in Hong Kong.\n\n## Social Performance\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nTo facilitate communication over environmental issues between CLP and stakeholders regarding the construction of the offshore LNG terminal, a stakeholder liaison group was set up in September comprising academics, marine conservation and fisheries experts, as well as representatives of fishermen's associations and the community. Meanwhile, a Marine Conservation Enhancement Fund and a Fisheries Enhancement Fund were established with HK$100 million\n\navailable to support community initiatives that contribute to the enhancement of the marine environment and fisheries resources. The first round of applications attracted more than 40 entries from academics, non-governmental organisations, and fisheries organisations.\n\nThe Government is constructing Integrated Waste Management Facilities on an artificial island in southwest Hong Kong, and CLP is seeking approvals to lay submarine cables to connect the facilities to nearby Lantau Island so that it can supply power and export any surplus electricity from the waste treatment process to the power grid. Engagement meetings were arranged with major green groups, community leaders, district council members, and fishermen's associations to explain the process for cables laying.\n\n## Community Initiatives\n\nAmid COVID-19, CLP launched a range of activities to help build a more caring society and to support the community fighting the pandemic. As well as distributing supplies of personal protective equipment, sanitisation products, and daily essentials, CLP paid special care to the disadvantaged groups in society.\n\nCLP volunteers used video and online technologies to connect with elderly people and other groups isolated by the need to restrict social contact during the pandemic. COVID-19 also created a digital divide, which was a critical hurdle for students from low-income families when school classes were suspended. Laptops were therefore donated to 40 underprivileged families and basic computer training was provided to parents.\n\nThe commissioning of the CCGT unit at Black Point Power Station increased the use of natural gas to around 50% of CLP's fuel mix in Hong Kong in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It will also continue to bring more lower-carbon gas-fired power generation to\n\nThe Hong Kong Government has announced a target of making the city carbon neutral by 2050. As a utility company, what is CLP doing to decarbonise its business, and how can it help customers like us reduce our carbon footprint?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mr Hoss Vetry\n\nRegional Vice President & Managing Director Rosewood Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong as part of the city's energy transition. CLP will focus on completing construction of the offshore LNG terminal and the second CCGT unit at Black Point, which are expected to go into service in 2022 and 2023 respectively. All these elements will help Hong Kong reduce its carbon footprint and significantly contribute to the city's strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nDigitalisation will continue to be a major priority. Operational and business transformation will accelerate momentum towards automation and digitalisation, while the adoption of digital channels to engage customers will become increasingly mainstream. Looking ahead, smart operations enabled by digital technologies, big data analytics, and innovation will drive the Company's digital capabilities forward, and help CLP achieve its constant objective of meeting and exceeding customer expectations.\n\nCLP believes in sustainable development and has long been a staunch supporter of climate action. We were the first Asian-headquartered power company to set carbon intensity reduction targets for our generation portfolio back in 2007, when we launched Climate Vision 2050. Today, as we transform into a Utility of the Future, we are progressively decarbonising our portfolio of generation assets and evolving our business model to support our customers to improve energy efficiency.\n\nIn Hong Kong, we are committed to helping the Government achieve its 2050 carbon neutrality target through increasing low-carbon electricity supply, and supporting our customers in lowering their carbon footprint.\n\nOn the generation side, in the near to medium term, we are adding more gas-\n\nfired generation, facilitating local renewable energy development and exploring the\n\nfeasibility of developing an offshore wind farm in Hong Kong's waters. In the medium\n\nto longer term, we aim to introduce more zero-carbon energy to our city through regional\n\ncooperation. We will also utilise new technologies such as hydrogen or carbon capture and storage as\n\nand when they become more viable.\n\nAs we all know, decarbonisation requires efforts by everyone, including energy users. To assist our customers, CLP stands to provide the necessary tools and initiatives. We have a suite of programmes to help both commercial and residential customers improve their energy efficiency such as the Eco Building Fund and the Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme. To encourage community participation to support the development of more wind and solar projects, we also have the Feed-in Tariff scheme and the Renewable Energy Certificates.\n\nOur decarbonisation strategy involves a holistic approach, reducing our dependence on coal while helping all our customers lower their power consumption and increase energy efficiency. Let's work together to make Hong Kong greener and\n\nmore sustainable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTK Chiang\n\nManaging Director, CLP Power Hong Kong",

Thanks to the Government's strong effort to contain the pandemic, the Chinese economy was one of the first to reopen, giving it a head start in recovery. Reflecting the comparatively early rebound in industrial activity, power consumption was up 3% during the year.\n\nIn these difficult circumstances all areas of CLP's operations in Mainland China performed well, resulting in a decrease in operating earnings limited to 1.9% to HK$2,233 million.

two-thirds  of the total. While operation of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station remained stable, earnings from the nuclear portfolio decreased 6% mainly because of lower contribution from Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station as a result of higher costs including taxes and despite increased generation.\n\nSent-out from Yangjiang was approximately 3% higher than in the previous year, largely due to the commissioning of its sixth and final operating unit in July 2019. However, the amount of sent-out was affected by unplanned outages and indirect impact of COVID-19 in the first half of the year.\n\nYangjiang won three national awards for engineering excellence, demonstrating the high standards of construction in CLP's nuclear portfolio. Daya Bay also received top-level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncertification from the Norwegian assurance and risk management company DNV GL for its outstanding safety, health, and environmental performance.\n\n## Renewable Energy\n\nCLP's portfolio of renewable energy projects performed steadily in 2020, helped by improvements in wind and solar resources.\n\nAs part of its strategic focus on the development of renewable projects, CLP commissioned Laiwu III Wind Farm in Shandong province in September. With a total generation capacity of 149MW, this three-phase project is the largest operating wind farm across the CLP Group.\n\nLaiwu III contributed to increased total generation by CLP's wind portfolio in Mainland China, which also benefitted from the full-year operation of Laizhou II Wind Farm in Shandong commissioned in June 2019 and record levels of generation by Sandu Wind Farm in Guizhou.",

Construction is expected to start in the first half of 2021, and the plant will be the Company's first grid-parity project in Mainland China. Investing in grid-parity projects will allow CLP to reduce its dependence on national subsidy payments from the Chinese Government, delays in which continued to affect the cash flow of CLP's wind and solar projects. As of 31 December 2020, the total receivables relating to the unpaid national subsidies increased to HK$1.77 billion (2019: HK$1.27 billion).\n\nThe performance of the solar portfolio remained stable and sent-out from the Jinchang plant in Gansu province increased thanks to lower grid curtailment. Most hydro projects reported better performance except Huaiji Hydro Power Stations in Guangdong, which suffered from lower water resources. Some generation units at the plant also encountered unplanned outages because of landslides caused by flooding in June.\n\n## Thermal Energy\n\nThe performance of CLP's only majority-owned coal-fired project in Mainland China, Fangchenggang Power Station in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, remained good as the plant benefitted from lower coal costs in the first three quarters of the year combined with higher output and demand. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower average tariffs received. An electricity retail company was set up to facilitate market sales and act as the plant's interface with customers.\n\nFangchenggang was named 2018-2019 Outstanding Enterprise and one of 2020's Top 100 Enterprises by the regional Government in recognition of its outstanding performance in a range of areas including corporate governance, sustainability, innovation, finance, safety, environmental protection.\n\nMinority-owned coal-fired projects in CLP's portfolio in Mainland China reported lower output, mainly because of the impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter.\n\nCLP China's donation of anti-virus supplies to local schools in Yunnan province in the fight against COVID-19 in early 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## New Opportunities and Innovation\n\nCLP joined China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd and other investors in November to establish the CSG Energy Innovation Equity Investment Fund with the aim of capturing investment opportunities in innovative energy developments, new energy infrastructure, and smart energy in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe incremental distribution network (IDN) in Fangchenggang Hi-Tech Zone, CLP's first investment in the distribution grid in Mainland China, went into service in January and began supplying electricity to customers in April.\n\nIn Sihong Solar Power Station in Jiangsu, the use of robots to regularly clean its solar panels improved the panels' efficiency while eliminating safety risks in the cleaning process. The power station subsequently deployed 62 automatic cleaning robots from September onwards to clean solar panels with a combined output of 10MW.\n\nCLP has successfully trialled the use of smart glasses at Fangchenggang Power Station for remote consultation on construction, repair, and maintenance works. It plans to expand the application to other projects, in particular renewable energy farms in remote locations. Drones and robotic devices have also been experimented with to inspect and monitor the conditions of wind turbine structure and blades. Other new technologies such as virtual fencing are also being examined to improve project safety and productivity.\n\n## Environmental Performance\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Compliance\n\nAll assets under CLP's operational control in Mainland China maintained full compliance with environmental regulations in 2020.\n\n## Air Emissions\n\nSince the completion of the emissions control retrofit project at Fangchenggang by the end of 2018, its sulphur dioxide (SO2) emission intensity remains at a low level. In 2020, although output slightly increased when compared with 2019, emission intensity for SO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) were still low.\n\n## Social Performance\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nAs the outbreak of COVID-19 prevented many faceto-face meetings, online meetings and conferences as well as written correspondence were used to maintain effective communication with CLP's stakeholders, including government officials, industry organisations, and business partners.\n\n## Community Initiatives\n\nCLP made donations and provided support for COVID-19 medical relief, promoting hygiene in the communities and benefitting approximately 350,000 people. The support spanned across regional head offices and regional businesses with priority given to providing medical relief in the vicinity of CLP assets.\n\nThe initiatives rolled out included the donation of medical ventilators to hospitals in Hebei and Sichuan provinces, temperature detectors in Sichuan, a water purifying system for a school in Jiangsu, and medical supplies to frontline medics and communities. CLP also distributed to residents and schoolchildren caring kits containing medical supplies, sanitisers, and a leaflet to remind people to maintain good hygiene to guard against the pandemic.\n\nA Guangxi Ethnic Minority Community Project launched in 2019 continued to preserve the unique culture and enhance the wellbeing of minorities in two of the region's counties, supporting groups such as the Yao, Miao, and Zhuang clans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Outlook\n\nChina aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. To meet this goal, the country has committed to a number of 2030 targets, including cutting carbon intensity by more than 65% from 2005 levels, nearly tripling the capacity to generate electricity from wind and solar to more than 1,200GW, and increasing the ratio of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25%.\n\nIn support of this policy and CLP's own decarbonisation strategy, CLP will continue to focus on developing low-carbon projects in the coming years. Following the investment in Qian'an III Wind Farm, CLP will continue to explore other grid-parity project development opportunities. CLP is also pursuing opportunities to increase the adoption of rooftop solar power generation, and selective investment in offshore wind projects.\n\nThe Chinese Government has a mission to transform the Greater Bay Area into an international business hub by 2035 with an integrated economy and a strong focus on technology. CLP will pursue opportunities in this important emerging region, with new energy infrastructure and smart energy solutions as its priorities. CLP is committed to drawing on its core capabilities and partnerships to contribute to the sustainable growth and long-term development of the electricity sector in China.\n\nCLP has incorporated a holding company in the Qianhai Free Trade Zone in Shenzhen. This will provide a platform for investment in clean energy and smart energy projects which look certain to play an increasingly important role in China's future growth and development.\n\nThe Greater Bay Area is an innovative hub and home to some of the world's most successful emerging businesses. As this economic powerhouse develops, intelligent and effective energy services are essential for it to achieve its potential.\n\nThe growth of the Greater Bay Area offers immense opportunity, and energy players need to be intensely focused on customers and their needs.\n\nThey must provide new business and commercial models and adopt a service mindset across the life cycle of projects and assets, including the possibilities of co-investment.\n\nThe development of digital infrastructure to support cities and businesses continues to grow, particularly in China and the Greater Bay Area, which in turn is creating new business models and market players. Energy infrastructure is a critical enabler for this to continue. How do you envisage the Greater Bay Area developing in this aspect, and in particular the roles that energy market players can play in creating these new digital infrastructure projects?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mr Charles Lee\n\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer OneAsia Network Limited\n\nGiven the energy intensity of data centres, we are in a strong position to add value by offering efficiency, advanced design, low-carbon power, and cost-effective solutions. Power accounts for around 40% of data centres' operating costs, so energy players have a vital role to play in helping manage this.\n\nSustainability is essential as the scale and number of data centres increases, consuming more energy. A central role for energy providers will be to provide a path to sustainable data centres by drawing on their renewable energy development expertise.\n\nSH Chan\n\nManaging Director, China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial and Operational Performance\n\nIndia is one of the countries most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, recording more than 10 million cases and 150,000 deaths by the end of 2020 and enduring a nationwide lockdown for the majority of the year. Despite this, the operations of CLP India, which is co-owned by CLP and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ), maintained a high level of safety and availability, while protecting the health and wellbeing of employees.\n\nDuring the year, CLP India maintained very high levels of availability at Jhajjar Power Station. While poor wind resources coupled with the impact of severe weather events resulted in relatively low wind power generation, this was partially offset by higher generation from the expanded solar portfolio.\n\nAs a result, CLP's operating earnings in India dropped 33.5% to HK$175 million. The financial performance of the business, which was also affected by impairment charges associated with the Paguthan plant and the Khandke wind farm for a total of HK$52 million after tax, is summarised below:\n\n| Operating Earnings 1   |   2020 HK$M |   2019 HK$M | Change %   |\n|------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Renewable Energy       |         104 |         227 | (54.2)     |\n| Thermal Energy         |          66 |          35 | 88.6       |\n| Transmission           |           5 |           1 | 400        |\n| Total                  |         175 |         263 | (33.5)     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Net of CDPQ's share\n\n## Renewable Energy\n\nThe performance of CLP India's wind projects was affected by poor wind resources across all locations due to an erratic summer monsoon. In June, Andhra Lake Wind Farm in Maharashtra was out of service for nearly a month after its transmission system was damaged by Cyclone Nisarga. Flooding in Samana Wind Farm in Gujarat, meanwhile, prevented access and restoration of some turbines for nearly ten days in July, while gales at the Bhakrani Wind Farm in Rajasthan brought down a transmission tower and put the project out of service for five days.\n\n2019 Operating Earnings\n\nRenewables: Lower wind generation and impairment provision for Khandke, offset by contribution from new solar projects\n\nThermal: One-off unfavourable tax adjustment in 2019 and lower O&M costs in 2020, offset by lower tariff and impairment provision for Paguthan\n\nTransmission: Full-year contribution from a new project in 2019\n\n2020 Operating Earnings\n\nThe commencement of construction of the Sidhpur wind project in Gujarat was delayed by COVID-19. Nevertheless, CLP India pushed ahead with preparation work for land development and application for necessary regulatory approvals. The execution of the engineering, procurement, and construction contracts was completed in December.\n\nThe solar portfolio of CLP India fared better as all operational activities were managed effectively during the pandemic. In addition, CLP India took full ownership of the operation and maintenance activities of all its solar assets in 2020, giving it greater operational control. In February, CLP India agreed to acquire three solar projects in Telangana with a combined capacity of 122MW. Two of the projects, with capacities of\n\n<!-- image -->",

Both assets quickly adapted to CLP safety systems and operating procedures and performed well, despite repeated flooding in the monsoon season. The purchase of the third project, with capacity of 42MW, was terminated by mutual agreement in September after the pandemic delayed the process.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 situation, outstanding receivables from local distribution companies relating to the purchase of renewable energy reduced 4.2% to HK$771 million by the end of the year. CLP India also received HK$50 million of delayed payment charges and generation-based incentives.\n\n## Thermal Energy\n\nThe Jhajjar coal-fired power station in Haryana reported an exceptional operational performance due to a record commercial availability of 97.3%. It also won a number of awards for its outstanding safety performance, including\n\na certificate of merit from the Frost & Sullivan Safety Awards 2020 and a Silver Award from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in the UK. With its flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) facilities, Jhajjar is the only power plant in the National Capital Region to successfully keep sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions within compliance levels.\n\nCLP India continued to explore alternate uses for the Paguthan plant in Gujarat, which ceased operations upon the expiry of its previous power purchase agreement in December 2018. The site has been well monitored and maintained since with functional tests conducted periodically. CLP India is currently evaluating a number of options for the asset, including potentially participating in bids to supply 'round-the-clock' power using a combination of renewable energy and thermal energy, and the possible sale of the plant.\n\nThe table below shows the performance of CLP's renewable energy and thermal energy projects in India.\n\n|               | Installed Capacity  Equity MW   | Electricity Sent Out  1 GWh   | Electricity Sent Out  1 GWh   | Availability   %   | Availability   %   | Utilisation   %   | Utilisation   %   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|               |                                 | 2020                          | 2019                          | 2020               | 2019               | 2020              | 2019              |\n| Wind          | 554.5                           | 927                           | 1,046                         | 95.6               | 95.8               | 19.6              | 21.5              |\n| Andhra Lake   | 63.8                            | 103                           | 129                           | 93.8               | 95.7               | 18.9              | 23.1              |\n| Bhakrani      | 61.4                            | 84                            | 84                            | 93.9               | 94.6               | 15.6              | 15.6              |\n| Chandgarh     | 55.2                            | 96                            | 106                           | 98.5               | 98.3               | 21.1              | 22.0              |\n| Harapanahalli | 23.8                            | 48                            | 55                            | 96.5               | 95.9               | 23.9              | 26.4              |\n| Jath          | 36                              | 58                            | 73                            | 97.5               | 97.8               | 19.3              | 23.0              |\n| Khandke       | 30.2                            | 50                            | 58                            | 93.5               | 91.1               | 19.4              | 22.0              |\n| Mahidad       | 30.2                            | 46                            | 59                            | 87.1               | 92.1               | 17.8              | 22.1              |\n| Samana I      | 30.2                            | 45                            | 58                            | 93.9               | 93.8               | 17.6              | 22.0              |\n| Samana II     | 30.2                            | 51                            | 63                            | 94.7               | 93.4               | 19.7              | 24.0              |\n| Saundatti     | 43.2                            | 71                            | 81                            | 98.6               | 97.9               | 19.1              | 21.4              |\n| Sipla         | 30.2                            | 50                            | 49                            | 96.9               | 96.1               | 18.8              | 18.5              |\n| Tejuva        | 60.5                            | 118                           | 121                           | 98.1               | 97.6               | 22.4              | 22.6              |\n| Theni I       | 29.7                            | 54                            | 56                            | 96.4               | 95.7               | 21.2              | 21.5              |\n| Theni II      | 29.7                            | 53                            | 54                            | 96.9               | 97.9               | 20.8              | 20.7              |\n| Solar         | 150                             | 267                           | 182                           | 96.4               | 96.8               | 21.9              | 22.8              |\n| CREPL  2      | 18                              | 23                            | -

The first project - Satpura Transco Private Limited in Madhya Pradesh - was successfully transferred to CLP India in November 2019. It has maintained 100% availability since and contributed positively to CLP India's 2020 earnings. Transaction of the second project with Alipurduar Transmission Limited was terminated after certain conditions precedent could not be  fulfilled. The third project - Kohima Mariani Transmission Limited, spanning three north-eastern states - was commissioned in November 2020 and will be taken over by CLP India following the completion of conditions precedent, including obtaining approval from the Federal Government.\n\n## Environmental Performance\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Compliance\n\nThere was one minor licence limit exceedance for nitrogen oxide (NOx) at Jhajjar in March 2020 but it did not result in any action by the local authorities.\n\n## Air Emissions\n\nThanks to the full operation of FGD units since February 2019, Jhajjar's SO2 emission continued to fall from 0.74 kg / MWh in 2019 to 0.63 kg / MWh in 2020.\n\nParticulate matter emission in 2020 was 0.12 kg / MWh, slightly decreased when compared with 2019. The\n\ncombustion optimisation carried out in 2018 continued to help reduce NOx emissions to 1.01 kg / MWh in 2020, compared with 1.36 kg / MWh * in 2017.\n\n- * Restated by using electricity sent-out, instead of gross output, to calculate the intensity\n\n## Social Performance\n\nCLP India entered into a strategic partnership for the use of solar energy for community benefits in 2020. An agreement was signed with Selco Foundation for solar energy-based community development and livelihood opportunities. In addition, the company launched a programme in partnership with the School of Vocational Education at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences to train 2,000 young people in renewable energy and healthcare skills.\n\nTimely support was extended to communities near CLP India's plants during the pandemic, and the company continued to supply midday meals to around 25,000 school children near the Veltoor and Saundatti plants and the children were given takeaway boxes with food and hygiene kits when classes were suspended.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 affected many community projects. However, CLP India was able to successfully expand a crop residue management project in Haryana. The company also launched a project to plant 50,000 trees in Alwar, Rajasthan. In addition, significant progress was made in ensuring water security for communities near the Gale / Tornado solar plants and the wind farms in Samana, Mahidad, and Khandke.\n\nCLP India's first transmission project has maintained 100% availability since its acquisition in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout the darkest months of the pandemic, CLP India remained true to its principles and continued to connect with communities and build for a brighter and more sustainable future.\n\nCLP India has been seeking clarification from the Government on new foreign direct investment rules announced in April and will continue to work with Indian ministry officials to\n\nWhat inspired CLP India to join hands with the CII Foundation to help farmers in north-west India reduce crop residue burning?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMs Seema Arora CEO, CII Foundation\n\nallow for future investment and overcome uncertainties in approval timelines. Meanwhile, the Indian energy market is evolving rapidly with tariffs for renewable energy projects reaching historic lows amid intense competition from participants from the public and private sectors and lower funding costs.\n\nDespite these issues, CLP India remains firmly committed to the market and its strategy of focusing on decarbonisation and renewable energy projects remains unchanged. It will continue to aspire to operational excellence and to explore new opportunities in India's dynamic power sector.\n\nThe smoke from crop burning contributes significantly to the thick blanket of smog that chokes north-west India, particularly Delhi, every winter. It not only produces harmful emissions but also depletes essential nutrients from the soil.\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, CLP India constantly seeks to address the challenges faced by the communities it serves. CLP India therefore teamed up with the CII Foundation in 2019 for a two-year programme to educate communities and encourage 6,000 farmers with more than 9,000 acres of farmland to minimise stubble burning in the state of Haryana. In its first year, it reduced the practice in the project area among the farmers by around 80%, and more than half of the villagers in surrounding areas reported an improvement in air quality. The project has since been expanded to cover 16 villages and 23,000 acres of farmland.\n\nCLP India has meanwhile pressed ahead with steps to reduce its impact on the environment. To control emissions, Jhajjar Power Station installed flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) technology during its construction in 2012, five years before FGD became mandatory for all thermal power plants in India. This makes Jhajjar the first and only plant in the National Capital Region to have installed and operationalised FGD so far. In addition, we have planted approximately 350,000 trees of different varieties, attracting more than 50 different species of birds and enhancing its biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lopburi Solar Farm in Thailand also operated smoothly during the year. However, its financial performance was affected by the expiry of tax exemption.\n\nIn line with the Group's undertakings under the updated Climate Vision 2050, CLP withdrew from the legacy Vung Ang II coal-fired development project in Vietnam in October 2020. Exit from the Vinh Tan III project is underway.\n\nIn 2020, operating earnings in Southeast Asia and Taiwan increased 15.2% to HK$386 million, which also reflects the impact of an impairment provision at Lopburi resulting from a step down in tariff as from December 2021 and the recovery of development expenses in Vietnam.

        "page_content": "## Financial and Operational Performance\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2020, devastating bushfires in the early part of the year followed by the COVID-19 pandemic-imposed hardships across Australia tipped the country's economy into its first recession for nearly three decades. In response, EnergyAustralia's focus has been on the health, safety and wellbeing of its employees and customers together with the reliable supply of electricity to the communities it serves.\n\nThe combined effects of COVID-19, retail price regulation introduced in July 2019, and ongoing competition from new and existing energy suppliers placed considerable pressure on retail margins in the Customer business. Falling wholesale prices, meanwhile, affected margins in the Energy business. Under these influences EnergyAustralia's underlying operating earnings were lower than in 2019. However, including the favourable impact of non-cash fair value changes in energy hedging contracts, operating earnings increased 7.9% year-on-year to HK$1,690 million.\n\nEnergyAustralia's performance in 2020 is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focusing on Customers\n\nThe EnergyAssist hardship programme was expanded at the beginning of March under the impact of bushfires, COVID-19 and the emerging recession. Additional support staff were assigned to ensure vulnerable households received uninterrupted access to power and tailored assistance, such as payment extension schemes. Since then, EnergyAustralia has set up more than 40,000 new payment plans and arranged almost 200,000 payment extensions for residential customers and has referred tens of thousands to information on government grants. The Rapid Business Assist programme was meanwhile launched in April 2020 to provide support to small businesses.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on customers' capacity to pay necessitated an increase in provision for bad and doubtful debts charged to the income statement to A$91 million (HK$491 million) for the year, up from A$65 million (HK$352 million) in 2019.\n\nEnergyAustralia recorded an improved Net Promoter Score as a higher proportion of retail customers said they were willing to recommend the company to others. Market churn reduced across all states from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and EnergyAustralia's churn reduced in line with market trends. Mass market customer accounts decreased by just over 1%, or around 28,000, over the course of the year with the bulk taking place in the first half. The company's focus on continuous improvement in customer service helped stabilise customer numbers in the second half.\n\nEnergyAustralia operates in an environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny and engagement, requiring faster responses to regulator requests and the ability to understand and act upon significant regulatory changes. At the same time, regulators are more vigorous in enforcing compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

EnergyAustralia paid a penalty of A$1.5 million.\n\nA number of incidents were self-reported to the AER by EnergyAustralia in 2019 regarding the registering of life support needs for some of its customers. The AER launched proceedings which were ongoing at the time of this report going to press. EnergyAustralia has made a number of changes which have improved compliance materially in this respect and is diligently responding to the proceedings.\n\n## Ensuring asset reliability\n\nTo help ensure the long-term reliability of supply to customers, EnergyAustralia's generation assets underwent major maintenance works in 2020 ahead of the summer peak demand period anticipated in early 2021. These included a large maintenance programme at Yallourn Power Station in Victoria with one of the power station's units being taken out of service in July for several months. The program was significantly adjusted to ensure the health and safety of the workforce as they undertook this critical and complex project during the COVID-19 outbreak. A similar outage is scheduled for another unit in 2021.\n\nMount Piper Power Station in New South Wales (NSW) produced substantially more energy in 2020 than in the previous year following the restoration of its full coal supply in late 2019. Major planned maintenance work was meanwhile carried out on one of its units, putting it out of service from late September to late December. The work included a turbine upgrade to deliver an additional 30MW of generation capacity. This extra generation capacity is achieved without requiring the burning of any additional coal, thus reducing overall emissions intensity. The other unit at Mount Piper will undertake a major outage of similar length in the coming year.\n\nEnergyAustralia's gas-fired power facilities in NSW, Victoria, and South Australia operated with a high degree of reliability throughout the year, supporting the company's generation portfolio through a variety of market conditions. EnergyAustralia currently has the dispatch rights to two grid-scale batteries in Australia, and these were used during periods of high volatility to help ensure stable frequency in the National Electricity Market.\n\nAverage wholesale spot prices were significantly lower than in 2019. This was a result of increased renewable energy generation combined with a decrease in business and industrial activity as the country experienced its first recession in nearly 30 years.\n\nAgreement with Genex Power Limited gives EnergyAustralia full dispatch rights to the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro project in Queensland when it becomes operational in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project is expected to reach financial close during 2021 and, subject to these final approvals, will begin operation in 2024. EnergyAustralia also received conditional planning approval in April from the NSW Government to expand its gas-fired Tallawarra Power Station. An economic assessment is being conducted before a decision is made on the investment in the first half of 2021.\n\nFederal and State Governments announced a number of measures which have potentially far-reaching impact on the industry and EnergyAustralia. The Federal Government's Technology Investment Roadmap affirms EnergyAustralia's focus on investing in flexible capacity to allow for the integration of more renewable energy. In addition to emissions reductions, the discussion paper promotes technologies and industries that support job creation and regional economic growth, as well as Australia's research and development sector. EnergyAustralia will continue its constructive dialogue with Government officials on the future share of the industry.\n\nThe NSW Electricity Infrastructure Investment legislation announced in November 2020 is an ambitious plan to create an environment for significant generation and network capacity. It is a significant reform on many levels, setting renewable energy targets, creating renewable energy zones and forming a trustee to represent consumers' interests. EnergyAustralia is in the process of examining the implications of the framework for its business and its customers.\n\nEnergyAustralia is also contributing to the Energy Security Board's post-2025 market design work and a range of significant Australian Energy Market Commission rule change processes.\n\n## New Business\n\nIn September, EnergyAustralia acquired the remaining 51% equity of solar and LED lighting company Echo Group, following an initial investment in 2019. This acquisition supports EnergyAustralia's commitment to offer customers clean, modern energy solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Go Neutral', EnergyAustralia's leading electricity carbon offsetting programme, was expanded to include residential gas customers in September, enabling them to offset all their household energy emissions at no extra cost. A quarter of a million EnergyAustralia electricity customers have already signed up to 'Go Neutral', which is the largest carbon offset product of any energy retailer or generator in Australia, and one of the largest certified carbon offset products in the country.\n\nIn November, EnergyAustralia began work with one of its sustainable icons, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, to install solar panels on the roof of a spectator stand. Energy generated by the panels will be used to help run the water recycling facility, with excess electricity transferred to lighting and power in other areas of the venue.\n\n'On by EnergyAustralia' was launched in late 2019 to rapidly test new products and services with customers to help shape future offerings. Following the launch of its first product in 2019 which allows customers to pay a flat monthly 'subscription' fee for energy, two further products were introduced in 2020: a solar and battery plan to make household solar more affordable and accessible, and an innovative offering where eligible customers pay nothing for their home electricity on Saturdays for a year in lieu of traditional discounts.\n\nEnergyAustralia's partnership with the Startupbootcamp programme, which fast-tracks new energy-related start-up businesses, continued into its third year despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic. Nine start-ups chosen from an initial pool of 1,000 applicants pitched their concepts from home in a live-streamed demo day held in September and EnergyAustralia has been working with five of the companies on testing and piloting their ideas.\n\n## Environmental Performance\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Compliance\n\nEnergyAustralia was not subject to any fines or prosecutions arising from environment-related regulatory non-compliances in 2020.\n\nHowever, three environmental licence non-compliances were reported. At Newport Power Station, there was one minor chemical spill incident of ferrous sulphate in January. At Mount Piper Power Station, there was a minor brine waste leakage incident in March 2020. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) was notified and no fines or penalties were imposed. In addition, there was an administrative breach with the water quality monitoring requirements under the new licence at Mount Piper. Corrective actions have been taken to prevent a repeat of these incidents.",

        "page_content": "## Air Emissions\n\nOverall carbon dioxide emissions intensity from EnergyAustralia's power stations were comparable with 2019. Yallourn saw a 8% reduction in emissions after output dropped by 6%. Emissions from Mount Piper increased 32% after output rose 46% while those at Tallawarra were 33% lower as output decreased 35%. Generation at Hallett was 19% lower, resulting in a 40% decrease in emissions. Jeeralang and Newport, which started reporting emissions data from 2019, saw a 65% and 67% reduction in emissions after output dropped by 67% and 74% respectively.\n\n## Social Performance\n\nThe widespread bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic caused hardship for many Australians in 2020. Employees of EnergyAustralia responded to the crises, supporting each other and customers throughout a highly challenging year.\n\nEnergyAustralia worked especially closely with the communities around its power stations. A dedicated team of experienced and locally-based community relations specialists was created to improve communication between EnergyAustralia and its stakeholders in different parts of the country.\n\nIn September, EnergyAustralia published its second report under the Energy Charter, of which it is a founding member, highlighting measures it has taken and changes it has introduced to improve customers' experience.\n\nEnergyAustralia's Workplace Giving programme has one of Australia's highest participation rates, with almost A$1million raised since its launch in 2018. At the Workplace Giving Excellence Awards in 2020, the project won silver prize in the best overall programme category after being recognised as the best launch programme a year earlier. EnergyAustralia was also named as one of GoodCompany's Top 10 Workplaces to Give Back in 2020.\n\nWith the Australian economy suffering first from the bushfires then from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some households and businesses inevitably ran into financial difficulties. At EnergyAustralia, we are delighted to have been able to offer a helping hand to them.\n\nWhile we have the EnergyAssist programme for our residential customers in financial distress, we have also launched Rapid Business Assist for small businesses with two core objectives: To help customers get back to business as quickly as possible, and to strengthen our relationship with them by giving them the support they need at a hugely challenging time. This approach benefits us by giving customers a reason to stay with us, and reducing the risk of bad debts.\n\nLast year, we devised over 13,000 payment extensions, more than 2,000 payment plans, helped around 1,000 small businesses with cash flow and provided advice on lowering energy consumption and guidance on government energy relief subsidies. As an essential service provider, EnergyAustralia stands ready to continue to reach out to customers with support initiatives as the people of Australia continue to work their way together through these most challenging of times.\n\nCatherine Tanna\n\nManaging Director, EnergyAustralia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are grateful for the hardship programmes introduced by EnergyAustralia.

In a year that saw a pandemic and large-scale maintenance works, it recorded one of its best safety performances.\n\nWorkSafe Victoria completed its investigation into the 2018 fatal incident at Yallourn. It decided it would not pursue proceedings against EnergyAustralia however, as is allowable under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, WorkSafe's decision will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration, and so is subject to revision.\n\n## Outlook\n\nEnergyAustralia will continue to face challenging market conditions as the economy emerges from COVID-19. The level of customer hardship, the speed of demand recovery, the intensity of retail competition, and the longer-term outlook for price regulation will all have a significant impact on the Customer business. The Australian Energy Market Commission expects residential electricity prices and bills to decrease until 2021-22 in line with wholesale cost reductions before increasing as supply-demand conditions tighten.\n\nMargins in the gas business are going to be under pressure as legacy gas supply contracts expire. In addition, the continuing decline of forward prices in the wholesale market and other regulatory changes will put pressure on margins in the Energy business.\n\nEnergyAustralia's focus will remain the optimisation of a diversified generation portfolio, enhancing asset reliability. It will continue to work to ensure an adequate fuel supply for Mount Piper Power Station in the long term. It will also continue to develop and integrate flexible capacity options, including pumped hydro, gas-fired generation, and batteries. Such projects have the potential to safeguard and enhance the power system's reliability and security as Australia moves towards a low-carbon future.\n\nIn response to the competitive market in which EnergyAustralia operates, the focus on improving customer experience remains. EnergyAustralia continues to invest in measures which will improve the speed and performance of the business, enhancing its competitiveness and efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n2020 was an unprecedented year, characterised by tumultuous developments across global health, geopolitical, social, and economic frontiers.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions to economic activities and presented perilous challenges to corporate financiers and treasurers amid extreme turbulence in financial markets.\n\nFirstly, global financial markets experienced huge swings in foreign exchange, interest rate, debt and equity capital sectors. Ten-year US treasury yield collapsed from 1.88% in early January 2020 to 0.54% by early-March 2020 when panic spread globally. Major regional currencies such as the Australian dollar, the Indian Rupee, the Renminbi tumbled 18%, 7% and 4% respectively in the same period.\n\nSecondly, the unforeseen, unpredictable nature of pandemic, and the lack of effective preventive measures had unsettled global asset valuations which caused global equity and bond markets to plummet in the first quarter of 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell 24% while stock indices of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong dropped 11%, 5% and 17% over the period respectively. The uncertainty of valuations also temporarily stalled most fund-raising activities in the equity and bond markets until late March 2020, and caused spikes in credit spreads and other disruptions in commercial terms such as pricing and tenor for funding, especially for the borrowers who are less financially-strong.\n\nThirdly, the restrictions on economic and social activities, including lockdown measures to contain the spread of the virus by certain authorities, had significantly reduced revenues in most business segments and caused severe liquidity drain in the financial markets. In Hong Kong, the one-week Interbank Offered Rate rose from 0.7% to 2.6% in about three weeks in March 2020 when a large number of businesses rushed to replenish working capital and shore up liquidity to survive.\n\nCLP remained financially strong despite an interim, moderate decline for electricity demand due to lower business activity in the first quarter of 2020. Demand was gradually recovered from the second quarter onwards with the resumption of economic momentum in Hong Kong and overseas markets where we invest or operate in. CLP was not immune from market challenges in 2020 but had promptly taken actions to identify possible pitfalls, formulate contingency plans and fully mitigate the residual risks.\n\nCLP's strong financial foundations stem from its wellestablished corporate governance and prudent risk management philosophies, with strong disciplines to execute. We are mindful that persistent application of tenacious vigilance, at good or bad times, would differentiate eminent corporations from others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are pleased to report that the disruptions due to the pandemic and geopolitical issues have not affected CLP in any material way. CLP remains financially strong with affirmation of credit ratings and stable outlooks by all credit rating agencies, and face no undue financial risk exposures.\n\n## Vigilance, Cautious and Earnest Actions at Opportune Time\n\nCLP recognises that the power sector is capital-intensive and requires sustainable, diversified, cost-effective funding to maintain operations and support selective business growth opportunities.\n\nCLP had closely monitored the development of pandemic and the increasing tension of the Sino-US relationship since the turn of 2020 to guard against adversities in the financial markets. Notably the Hong Kong Scheme of Control (SoC) business would incur more long-term capital spending to further reduce the emission levels in the city under the Five Year Development Plan from 2018-2023.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nScrupulous financial planning for the SoC business required the consideration of the cyclical funding and long payback nature of the investments. These factors guide CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO in reviewing the pros and cons of various financing options. Management reiterated that both companies needed to guard against financial market uncertainties and must avoid speculation on the development of the aforementioned issues. Requests were issued for financing proposals right after the Chinese New Year, to secure early debt funding at the best available commercial terms. The outcomes were remarkable. CAPCO finalised discussions with preferred lenders and received financing commitments with very favourable terms as soon as in midFebruary 2020 for up to HK$6.0 billion to fund the offshore LNG terminal in Hong Kong waters, with plans to diversify into long-tenured financing when justified by cumulated capital spending. CLP Power Hong Kong also received overwhelming responses and finally accepted funding commitments for HK$6.9 billion at preferential terms in early March 2020.\n\nWhen financial markets settled in mid-2020, CLP observed our financing and treasury policies to optimise the debt portfolio by spreading out the debt tenor and achieving more diversification in terms of geography, instruments and lenders, by way of Export Credit Agency- (ECA) covered loans and public bonds.\n\nOn 15 June 2020, CAPCO successfully issued a US$350 million (HK$2.7 billion) Energy Transition Bond at 2.2% fixed rate, which was reported to be the lowest coupon bond that a corporate has ever issued in Hong Kong at the date of placement, to partially replace the shorter-tenured bank",

        "page_content": "loans for the offshore LNG terminal project. The bond was priced at a 1.625% margin over 10-year US Treasury Notes and received more than US$1.7 billion of orders from global fund managers and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investors. This was the second Energy Transition Bond issued by CAPCO and has also been selected as the best energy transition bond in The Asset magazine's Country Awards 2020.\n\nLeveraging on the strong investor support for the CAPCO bond issuance, on 22 June 2020, CLP Power Hong Kong issued US$750 million (HK$5.8 billion) 10-year, 2.125% bond, and US$250 million (HK$1.9 billion) 15-year, 2.5% bond. They carried 1.6% and 1.9% credit spreads respectively over 10-year US Treasury Notes, and replaced some of the short-term bank facilities in the debt portfolio. The 10-year tranche received more than US$3.0 billion of orders, which represented more than four times over-subscription, from over 170 global investors. The longer tranche was the first 15-year public US dollar bond issued by a Hong Kong corporate since 2012, when CLP Power Hong Kong pioneered this class of debt securities in the region. According to the arranging banks, the dual-tranche bonds set the lowest coupon record for 10- and 15-year bonds issued by Hong Kong-based corporates at the time of placement. The full amounts of the bond proceeds raised by CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO were swapped into Hong Kong dollar fixed rates to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks.\n\nThe above financings were adequate to fully cover CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO's 2020 funding needs, apart from the usual annual rollover of a moderate amount of short-term bank facilities. At the same time, CLP Holdings also timely communicated with lending institutions to secure commitment for the majority of its 2020 funding needs in the early part of the year to mitigate funding uncertainties and to serve as contingency and firepower.\n\nBoth CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO have Medium Term Note Programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2.0 billion may be issued respectively. As at 31 December 2020, notes with an aggregate nominal value of about HK$29.3 billion and HK$6.8 billion had been issued by the two entities respectively.\n\n## Outside Hong Kong\n\nOur business units continued to receive good support from lending institutions in 2020 and were able to obtain debt funding as required including new financing for selected new business expansion. In Australia, EnergyAustralia maintained no debt status, good liquidity position and achieved higher operating cash inflow than in 2019. CLP India issued Rs3.0 billion (HK$315 million) of two- and three-year green bonds, arranged Rs7.3 billion (HK$777 million) of 4- to 13year project loan facilities and issued Rs1.0 billion\n\n(HK$106 million) of three-year bond at very competitive rates. In Mainland China, CLP received an in-principle offer for a RMB200 million (HK$238 million) 15-year, non-recourse bank loan facility for a solar project.\n\n## The Group\n\nReduced business activities and lower business revenues due to the pandemic had challenged the ability of most corporates in managing their liquidity positions and funding capabilities, along with their abilities to manage multiplicity of risks. Although CLP has put financing principles and treasury policies in place, with periodic reviews of committed funding, liquidity buffers and contingency thresholds especially during times of uncertainty, CLP quickly determined in the first quarter of 2020 to perform a Group-wide stress test on liquidity and earnings to evaluate the changing dynamics under different parameters and business scenarios, and to scrutinise the respective impacts to various business units and the Group. This comprehensive study facilitated the management to fully appreciate the challenges and volatilities that CLP entities might encounter, and to come up with the right measures to combat the challenges if necessary, in addition to the existing protocols in business and financing. The result showed that CLP entities would face no undue liquidity issues, apart from potential reduction in revenue and earnings under certain circumstances.\n\nThe continuous upholding of corporate governance has enabled CLP to navigate uncharted waters and emerge in good shape from the pandemic and a more volatile financial environment in 2020.\n\n## Material Topic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responding to Climate Change\n\nThis section discusses CLP's strategies on sustainable financing to give the Group the wherewithal and flexibility for funding of climate actions.\n\n## Perseverance in Sustainability Financing\n\nNotwithstanding the formidable financial market challenges which required dedicated management efforts, CLP is devoted to its sustainability financing trajectory with continuous enhancements in line with market best practices.\n\nCLP updated its Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF) in June 2020 to reflect the increased climate-related commitments in the Group's updated Climate Vision 2050 published in December 2019 and the broader range of financial transactions that CLP is considering to raise funding for its climate actions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ECA facility was also the first ESG export credit facility in Hong Kong covered by Sinosure.\n\nCLP joined the Sustainable and Green Exchange (STAGE) established by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited as one of the inaugural members in August 2020. STAGE is an online repository of information for sustainability, green\n\nSee CLP Climate Action Finance Framework updated in June 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee DNV GL Second Party Opinion Report on CAFF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Transition Financing for Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal Project\n\nThe construction of an offshore LNG terminal in Hong Kong waters is one of the approved capital projects of Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) under the 2018-2023\n\nDevelopment Plan. The project, which can receive and store LNG and then deliver regasified LNG by subsea pipeline to Black Point Power Station, will further improve Hong Kong's long-term natural gas supply stability by diversifying supply sources, and enable procurement of natural gas at competitive prices from the global market. The implementation of the offshore LNG terminal is therefore a critical step in supporting the Hong Kong Government's plan to increase the percentage of natural gas used for power generation and reduce carbon intensity in the city.\n\nCLP is committed to sustainability in its business and financing activities. In line with this commitment, the Group updated its Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF) in June 2020 to support a broader range of financial transactions from bonds to other types of financing including loans. This enables us to further diversify the sources of debt and access a wider pools of capital committed to socially-responsible and sustainable financing. All these stem from our recognition of the significant role played by the offshore LNG Terminal project in CLP's transition into a lower-carbon future, therefore Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) components were embedded in the associated financings.\n\nIn view of the long-term nature of the project, and to optimise the debt funding arrangement, a financing package was arranged which includes:\n\n- \uf09e an inaugural HK$3.3 billion medium-term commercial bank facility which carried the Energy Transition element. This followed a rigorous environmental and social due diligence process by the lenders, including a joint objective to comply with the Equator Principles 4, an international framework to assess environmental and social risks;\n- \uf09e an US$350 million Energy Transition Bond. The 10-year bond came with an attractive long-term fixed coupon rate of 2.20%. The issuance received overwhelming support of investors, including ESG investors, with 4.9 times oversubscription. The bond was selected as the best energy transition bond in The Asset magazine's Country Awards 2020, reflecting the recognition of CLP's leading position in energy transition financing by market participants;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nand social bonds which are listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. By joining STAGE, CLP will display the associated information and post-issuance reports of its Energy Transition Bonds on a platform that can be accessed by global investors.\n\nCLP endeavours to further diversify and expand its sustainability financing portfolio. We envisage that most of CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO's financing transactions going forward will take the form of green bonds and loans, Energy Transition Bonds or sustainability-linked loans. This will enable CLP to meet pre-determined ESG performance targets in a more meaningful way.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Export Credit Agency-covered facility, together with the above HK$3.3 billion medium term commercial bank facility, were the first Energy Transition credit facilities after the enrichment of the CAFF. According to Sinosure, this transaction was also the first ESG export credit facility extended by Sinosure in Hong Kong.\n\nThese financings, which were executed in an unprecedented COVID-19 environment and a challenging financial market in 2020, underscore the strong commitments of CLP and CAPCO to sustainable and ESG financings, complementing the Group's efforts on business sustainability.\n\n## Proven, Resilient Risk Management\n\nAt CLP, we understand that effective risk management is indispensable. Our long-established risk management policies and periodic review functions throughout the Group have protected CLP from unfavourable financial and market risk exposures.\n\nAgain, our approach is to identify risk exposures and apply natural hedge or straight-forward, pre-approved financial derivative instruments that can qualify for effective accounting hedge, with no adverse profit-and-loss or cash flow impact, to offset the underlying economic obligations and risks. This approach has proven to be effective and efficient. CLP's conscientious management of risk and regular re-assessment have reassured our key stakeholders including government authorities, customers, shareholders, financial institutions, bond investors and business partners that residual risks remained very low and the Group is capable of taking up business assignments and obligations for the very long-term.\n\n## Digital Transformation\n\nSince CLP's first initiative and subsequent success to implement a cloud-based software-as-a-service Group Treasury Management System (GTMS) in 2016, we have been continuously exploring ideas to realise greater automation, analytical capability, straight-through processes and paperless work cycle. It is essential for CLP to adopt and maintain an agile treasury system that can keep pace with technological advancements and the high complexities of a dynamic financial market, taking into account the fast, vigorous and effective solutions from the fintech evolution. An upgrade of the GTMS implemented by the Treasury team was in progress in 2020, which will enhance the functionality and scalability of the system, and to achieve greater straight-through processing and perform better analyses with automatic matching process, consolidation of end-to-end workflows and improvement of cash flow forecasting visibility, efficiency and accuracy.\n\n| Debt Profile as at 31 December 2020   | CLP   Holdings HK$M   | CLP Power  Hong Kong HK$M   | CAPCO HK$M   | Other  Subsidiaries HK$M   | CLP Group HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| Availability Facility  1              | 6,500                 | 38,274                      | 19,071       | 16,240                     | 80,085           |\n| Bank Loans and Other Borrowings       | -                     | 29,684                      | 13,573       | 11,091                     | 54,348           |\n| Undrawn Facility                      | 6,500                 | 8,590                       | 5,498        | 5,149                      | 25,737           |\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 For the Medium Term Note Programmes, only the amounts of the bonds issued as at 31 December 2020 were included in the total amount of Available Facility.

The Group remains committed to safely managing these assets to high standards of performance, even during unplanned global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As always, CLP remains focused on maintaining reliable electricity provision and delivering value-adding energy services to customers.\n\n## Material Topics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarnessing the Power of Technology\n\nResponding to Climate Change\n\nReinforcing Cyber Resilience\n\nThis section discusses the strategies deployed in CLP operations to manage the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthen cybersecurity, and continue the Group's journey to decarbonisation.\n\n## Operational Resilience\n\nCLP's business operations have continued to demonstrate high levels of resilience throughout 2020, navigating the many challenges flowing from the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nPrior to the outbreak, CLP regularly reviewed and refreshed relevant business continuity plans and procedures as part of its ongoing planning against potential emergencies. CLP's well-established response plans are constantly reinforced by organisational learnings from past events such as SARS in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2003 and Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018, and reflect the Group's commitment to long-term business sustainability.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic was unique and unprecedented, these existing preparations enabled CLP to take rapid action across its Asia-Pacific operations from the beginning of the outbreak, subsequently learning and updating its management approach quickly as further information became available in the rapidly unfolding situation.\n\nControls were implemented across all CLP's operating regions to minimise the risk of virus transmission and to respond appropriately in the event of positive COVID-19 cases being suspected or identified. Special arrangements were immediately put in place to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in all CLP locations. For example, heightened hygiene and sanitation measures, body temperature screening, and meticulous cleaning in offices and work sites were swiftly introduced.\n\nSpecial work arrangements were implemented, and essential and non-essential operations were identified. Working-fromhome and split teams arrangements were introduced, and CLP ensured workers had access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. Where necessary, missioncritical employees and resources were deployed to locations prior to travel constraints and lockdowns being implemented. In support of the COVID-19 response measures, CLP adopted remote working, while the use of digital technologies was increased to maintain effective communications across the business.\n\n## The benefits of digitalisation\n\nCLP decided several years ago to move some of the Group's key software tools to cloud\n\ncomputing. This decision established capabilities that underpinned the ability for employees in\n\nHong Kong, Mainland China, India, and Australia to efficiently perform their duties away from work\n\npremises, even in extended periods of national or regional lockdown.\n\nThanks to key enterprise software tools becoming available for remote users as part of CLP's ongoing rollout of cloud-based intranet services in Mainland China, employees working from home were able to continue cooperating with on-site colleagues to manage power plant operations, as the COVID-19 outbreak escalated in early 2020.\n\nFor many large energy businesses with geographically diverse operations, enterprise software tools remain vital to effective and efficient operations. For CLP China, these tools also allow users to control and manage capital projects, authorise equipment purchases, and carry out other critical actions. Before the scope was extended in January 2020 to include remote users working from home, the enterprise software tools were being routinely accessed in CLP China's offices and work sites for operational purposes.\n\nCloud computing technologies enabled CLP China employees to keep projects on track while working from home through video or audio conference calls. Within a few weeks, near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the level of conference calls increased approximately tenfold.\n\n<!-- image -->",

New software was fast-tracked to enable real-time communication and collaboration between sites, allowing workers to share information and conduct virtual meetings.\n\nContinuous planning and investments in proven and secure information technology systems including virtual private networks enabled CLP India to quickly transition employees to remote working in the national lockdown, while maintaining reliable operations. New communication software was introduced to ensure CLP India employees continued to collaborate effectively, both from the safety of their homes or when on-site.\n\n## Enhancing Asset Reliability and Quality\n\nCLP continued to invest in maintaining and upgrading the Group's generation assets in the Asia-Pacific region to ensure reliable energy supply.\n\nEnergyAustralia completed an extensive maintenance programme at its Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales in December, which prepared it for the seasonallyhigh levels of power demand experienced in the Australian summer. The maintenance programme required an 87-day planned outage on one of the power station's steam turbine generating units and was the plant's most significant upgrade\n\nin recent years. Major boiler works were also carried out, supporting continuing improvements in the power station's levels of operational reliability and efficiency.\n\nCOVID-19 required extensive levels of additional planning and operational controls to be implemented, especially given that over 1,100 workers were required to be on site to carry out the works.\n\nStringent safety measures were also established to protect workers during an outage at EnergyAustralia's Yallourn Power Station in Victoria. The works involved major boiler maintenance to further boost levels of operational reliability.\n\nCLP's data analytics platform supports continuous improvements in the performance of renewable energy assets in Mainland China and India.

Digital technologies including artificial intelligence and data analytics support CLP in optimising the performance of its assets continuously, enabling real-time monitoring of plant operations, and providing performance-enhancing predictive analytics capabilities. The data analytics system also supports CLP in the effective management of wind and solar assets, identifying potential faults and managing a scheduled programme of maintenance and cleaning. The data analytics platform will be fully implemented across CLP's renewable energy assets in Mainland China and India in 2021.\n\nDeployment of technologies to improve safety outcomes accelerated during the pandemic, reducing the need for manual labour in hazardous activities. Automated drones with thermal cameras are now used across CLP's fleet of solar energy plants in Mainland China and India, allowing for more effective and efficient inspection of plant performance and the detection of malfunctioning systems. Drones have also been trialled to inspect wind turbine blades in India.\n\n## Progressing Carbon Emissions Reductions\n\nCLP maintained its progress in reducing the carbon intensity of its energy portfolio through the commissioning of a new combined cycle gas turbine generating unit at Black Point Power Station in Hong Kong. With a high efficiency level, the new natural gas-fired generating unit is a key investment to strengthen CLP's efforts to reduce emissions from generation and support Hong Kong's transition to a lower-carbon future.\n\nCLP commissioned the 50MW Laiwu III Wind Farm in the Shandong province in September, the latest addition to its portfolio of renewable energy assets in Mainland China.\n\nTwo solar plants acquired by CLP India in 2020 in the southern state of Telangana reported solid operating performance. CLP India meanwhile continued to make progress with its new 250.8MW wind energy project in Sidhpur in Gujarat, with construction starting in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Robust Supply Chains\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented supply chain challenges for many energy utilities around the world. CLP's multi-regional supply chains remained resilient to these challenges and were able to adapt and provide continuity of supply. For example, collaboration across CLP's regional businesses ensured sufficient supplies of personal protection equipment, including face masks and hand sanitisers, to the workforce amid a global shortage in the early stages of the outbreak.\n\nThis level of operational flexibility and adaptability played a key role in maintaining the safety and reliability of the Group's operations. This also highlighted the value of developing and maintaining positive partnerships with suppliers.\n\nCLP remains committed to responsible procurement practices and proactively engages with suppliers to promote those practices that are key to a sustainable supply chain, including regulatory compliance, safe working conditions, ethical business conduct, environmental responsibility, and protection of intellectual property.\n\nThe commitment to ongoing enhancement and improvement of CLP's procurement capabilities is vital to support the ongoing needs of the Group's operations, in addition to growth projects. CLP continues to develop its internal capabilities to better understand global supply chains, risk management and supplier relationships. The Group will also focus on the benefits of adopting digital technologies, especially data analytics for improved insights into suppliers' performance and supply chain management. Digitalisation will help deepen CLP's collaboration with strategic suppliers, enhancing the Group's access to resources and capabilities in support of business objectives.",

As electricity demand from customers in Hong Kong increased to a new record of 7,264MW on 14 July 2020, some users were prompted to reduce power consumption by demand response technologies deployed by CLP, thereby improving system reliability. Without the demand response programme, peak power demand would have been more than 100MW higher. Technology from AutoGrid Systems, a Silicon Valley energy management company, further enhanced the demand response programme's operation. AutoGrid is among CLP's portfolio of investments in energy technology companies and venture capital funds in global innovation centres including Mainland China, the US and Israel.\n\nIn Australia, meanwhile, integrated solar energy and battery storage systems allow households to benefit from lowcarbon electricity with long-term cost savings, although some users may be deterred by the upfront costs of installation. EnergyAustralia's new Solar Plus plan helps customers avoid some of the costs by charging only a fixed-rate fee. Through the use of virtual power plant technology, the solar and battery systems installed at customers' premises are managed by EnergyAustralia, improving the stability of the electricity grid. The new service is part of the 'On by EnergyAustralia' platform, which focuses on innovative energy services. EnergyAustralia also uses the platform to offer flat-rate electricity subscription plans similar to mobile phone services, allowing customers to manage their energy expenses more effectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP is continuing to strengthen its data science capabilities by developing new software to improve the performance of its operations. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are providing CLP with new tools to enhance efficiency by creating accurate ways to predict key operational parameters such as system loads, emissions from power generation, and cable faults. CLP provided machine learning-based solution to Sarawak Energy, an electricity utility in Malaysia, for power theft detection.\n\nSmart Charge (HK) Limited, CLP's joint venture with telecommunications company HKT Limited, has continued to step up efforts to install new electric vehicle charging infrastructure in residential estates in Hong Kong in response to growing demand. Government support is increasing for private residential car parks to install charging systems, providing new opportunities for Smart Charge which has put forward proposals to build EV charging infrastructure for more than 400 residential car parks. CLP also continued to offer free electric vehicle charging services through a network of more than 50 charging stations across its supply area, while its new Eco Charge 2.0 service offers support for Hong Kong customers applying for Government subsidy to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n\n## Accessing the Best Energy Innovations\n\nCLP continued to participate in the Free Electrons global energy accelerator programme, gaining access to the most innovative energy technologies from providers in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, despite the challenges of the pandemic. Collaboration between utility companies and start-up companies in the programme was made possible through video conferencing and other remote working tools, supporting the development of pilot projects with potential for commercialisation. CLP also strengthened its partnerships with technology providers around the world through other programmes including the Alibaba JUMPSTARTER programme and the Australian Technology Competition.\n\nEnergyAustralia continued the annual accelerator programme it runs in conjunction with Startupbootcamp, overcoming restrictions imposed by COVID-19 to work with technology providers from around the world to speed up innovation in services and solutions for Australian energy users.",

CLP continued efforts to promote health and safety for employees and contractors, with a focus on addressing risks from high-consequence, low-probability events. The Group reported no workplace fatality for employees and contractors in 2020, the first time since 2015.\n\nCLP aims to provide an operating environment that encourages the reporting of safety-related incidents, as the development of a mature safety culture is a key goal of the Group's ongoing efforts to improve performance on health, safety and the environment (HSE). Safety leadership programmes were offered across business units in the region to provide leaders with the skills to support their teams and spread best practices among employees and contract workers.\n\nRethinking risk is a key pillar of CLP's HSE improvement strategy, as the Group is committed to proactive measures to improve safety, moving beyond compliance. In 2020, CLP developed a new framework for Safety in Design (SiD), where risk is minimised in the design stage instead of relying upon post-design mitigations. This is supported by training to further increase capabilities in this area.\n\nTo help support the management of safety risks across business units, the Group is upgrading its internal management system to provide clear standards, with a focus on operations carrying higher safety risks. New documentation was released to support the revamped management system.\n\n## Group Lost Time Injury Rate and Total Recordable Injury Rate\n\nLost Time Injury Rate at Group and Regional Level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal Recordable Injury Rate at Group and Regional Level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 The LTIR and the TRIR are the number of lost time injuries and recordable injuries respectively measured over 200,000 working hours, which is equivalent to around 100 persons working for one year.\n- 2 To reflect the organisational restructuring of CLPe Solutions in 2019, its LTIR and TRIR are reported under CLP Holdings while the category of Overall represents the total LTI and total TRI divided by the total man-hour.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Addressing Strategic Workforce Challenges\n\nIndustry, regional, social and demographic drivers are bringing unprecedented change to CLP and are redefining the people agenda. There is no single solution to meeting these challenges - it requires a coordinated and integrated range of strategic initiatives to build an agile, inclusive and sustainable workforce.\n\nWhile conventional energy needs will reduce in significance, the resourcing needs of low-carbon energy, new energy solutions businesses and digitalised operating models will increase, together with addressing labour market challenges of an ageing workforce and increased competition for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)-qualified people. In 2021, millennials will make up around 44% of CLP's employees; this is expected to increase to 67% by the end of 2025. This digital-native generation of employees brings different expectations of work and how CLP should engage and support them. In this context, CLP must find ways to attract and retain a more gender- and culturally-diverse, multigenerational workforce and share talent effectively across the Group portfolio of businesses. Facilitating youth development, strengthening organisation capability to support CLP's new businesses in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, equipping leaders to lead transformation under increasingly complex social and political influences, and accelerating gender diversity progress are key priorities in 2021.\n\nEnergy transition, digital evolution, and increasing social and political uncertainties and expectations in CLP's markets are driving the need for greater organisational agility: the ability to adapt and succeed in a rapidly changing environment. Early steps in CLP's path to agility are upskilling and empowering employees to respond rapidly to changing customer needs and drive breakthrough improvements, providing physical and virtual work environments that facilitate collaboration, and equipping employees to leverage new technologies. In 2021, cultural change efforts to encourage idea generation, experimentation and ownership will accelerate, along with helping employees adapt to structure and process changes over time.\n\nAs the energy industry evolves, CLP is committed to supporting its people to thrive in change. This means helping them to embrace change, strengthening their wellbeing and resilience and developing more inclusive workplaces, supporting increased gender, age and cultural diversity. In 2020, CLP invested in tools and resources to support employees' physical and mental wellbeing and also enhanced flexibility policies as part of its COVID-19 response. This focus will continue in 2021 as employees return to the workplace.\n\nCLP is mindful that it operates in a social context where there is increasing concern over inclusive growth, and the preservation of basic rights and freedoms in the workplace along with equality of income and opportunity. Consequently, employees and other stakeholders expect CLP to demonstrate values-based management in dealing with potentially divisive social issues. The Group is focused on providing competitive, fair and sustainable benefits and support to employees in need. Work to operationalise CLP's commitments to respecting internationally-recognised human rights through the application of Group labour standards continues.\n\n## Attracting and Retaining Tomorrow's Workforce\n\nRetaining the wealth of knowledge among CLP's employees, together with transferring skills to a new generation of managers and team members, is essential to CLP's long-term success, as is developing skills for a low-carbon, digitally enabled future.\n\nInvesting in building pipelines of skilled engineers and technicians in preparation for the energy transition and to address future skills shortages continue to be a key priority. A suite of new and refreshed development programmes targeted at Graduate Trainee and early- to mid-career levels was launched in Hong Kong in 2020, focusing on building future leadership capabilities and technical competencies, and accelerating the readiness of young engineers to take up leadership positions. These programmes aim to progressively develop technical, innovation, project, commercial and change leadership skills at different career stages and to increase exposure to different cultures through experiences in CLP's operations in Mainland China and further afield. In 2020, 32 Graduate Trainees and 27 Leaders of the Future management trainees commenced programmes. In addition, 16 highpotential engineers successfully concluded their participation in a cross-business engineering development programme. CLP continued to strengthen resourcing of innovation, major projects, business development and energy transition-related activities and projects, recruiting 32 senior hires in 2020 into critical roles. CLP's Group careers website was relaunched to enhance attractiveness to candidates interested in the new careers and opportunities that energy transition presents.\n\nCLP's Executive Development Programme, targeted at enterprise leaders, was refreshed to strengthen development of the skills required to lead transformation under complex social and political influences. The programme combines leadership, energy transition and business simulation elements, and is conducted in partnership with the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), and Tilt Global.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over 70 professional and managerial staff participated in programmes in 2020. Staff based in Hong Kong and Mainland China continue to participate in cross-border secondment opportunities.\n\nRecognising the challenges faced by students graduating during the COVID-19 outbreak, 59 graduate interns joined CLP in Hong Kong to gain work experience, half of which were in environmental fields (See case study on page 100). In total, CLP more than doubled the work opportunities for university and vocational college graduates in Hong Kong for 2020, compared to 2019.\n\nIn 2020, CLP's employees received 42.5 hours of internal and external training and development on average, compared with 40.1 hours in 2019. This reflected a strong focus on delivering critical health and safety, operational and compliance training together with pivoting to virtual delivery wherever possible.\n\n| Employee Training        | Average   Training Hours   per Employee   | % of   Employees   Trained   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| By Gender                |                                           |                              |\n| Male                     | 47.7                                      | 97.1%                        |\n| Female                   | 27.6                                      | 98.5%                        |\n| By Professional Category |                                           |                              |\n| Managerial               | 26.8                                      | 95.4%                        |\n| Professional             | 34.9                                      | 98.1%                        |\n| General & Technical      | 52.2                                      | 97.0%                        |\n| By Region                |                                           |                              |\n| Hong Kong                | 49.5                                      | 98.4%                        |\n| Mainland China           | 66.8                                      | 100.0%                       |\n| India                    | 33.8                                      | 69.9%                        |\n| Australia                | 23.2                                      | 100.0%                       |\n| Group Total              | 42.5                                      | 97.4%                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting Diversity and Inclusion\n\nA diverse workforce and an inclusive culture support high performance and CLP's ability to operate effectively in the many communities in which it operates.\n\nCLP has set several Group-wide gender diversity targets which support UN SDG's, particularly the commitment to SDG 8 Decent Work & Economic Growth. Female representation at all levels was maintained or increased in 2020. CLP's Women in Leadership percentage increased to 27.3%, while Women in Engineering increased to 11.5%. This progress reflects the Group's commitment and efforts in attracting and developing female employees, and the focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\nIncreasing female representation in Graduate Trainee Programmes, ensuring that women are well-represented in development programmes, and retaining experienced female staff are key priorities. In 2020, CLP set an aspirational target to achieve gender balance over time in its Hong Kong Graduate Trainee intake (19% female in 2020) in order to address significant under-representation of women in operational professional and leadership roles. Efforts to develop women continued across the Group in 2020, including the mentoring programme for more than 40 female engineering students in Hong Kong to provide exposure to CLP's operations and help them become more work-ready, the annual Female Engineer Networking event with 26 female engineers participating from across the Group, and establishing a local Diversity and Inclusion Council in India. To date, seven female engineers have progressed from mentoring into CLP's Graduate Trainee Programme.\n\nInclusion is an essential ingredient that unlocks progress. Recognising this, EnergyAustralia established Gender Affirmation guidelines and new LGBTIQ+ community groups, receiving recognition for its efforts at the 2020 Australian Workplace Equality Index Awards.",

Looking ahead, cultural change efforts to encourage idea generation, experimentation and ownership will accelerate, along with helping employees adapt to structure and process changes.\n\nMore than 3,900 Hong Kong employees have now participated in Design Thinking training since launch in early 2019. The Design Thinking programme is intended to nurture a people-centric innovation culture in CLP Power, providing practical problem-solving frameworks for product and service development with users' needs in mind. To date, employees have applied Design Thinking in projects spanning across digital transformation, productivity, safety and customer service.\n\nAcross the Group, more agile team structures and working environments were established in Hong Kong and Australia to encourage collaboration and speed up decision-making. COVID-19 accelerated ongoing digital transformation and adoption of new ways of working to facilitate collaboration, with implementation of tools and policies supporting remote and flexible working.\n\nIn 2020, over 30 employees gained professional accreditation in data analytics skills, building their capability to leverage technology and data in new and insightful ways to enhance the customer experience and operation excellence. During the year, data analytics training was extended with over 300 employees completing courses ranging from awareness to advanced analytics skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender Distribution by Region\n\nNote:  Data of other gender identities is tracked.

In CLP, this means engaging and helping people to embrace change, strengthening their wellbeing and resilience, and developing more inclusive workplaces.\n\nAn engaged workforce is critical for CLP to deliver value. In 2020, CLP conducted employee engagement surveys across its Hong Kong and Mainland China and EnergyAustralia workforces. Pleasingly, response rates were high and employee engagement scores improved. While there is more to do to develop CLP's culture to support and enable transformation into a Utility of the Future, the improvement over the past three years is proof that actions taken are making a difference.\n\nThis year, CLP Power Hong Kong entered international human resources firm Randstad's Hall of Fame as one of the world's 12 most attractive employers in 2019, after having won 'Most Attractive Employer in Hong Kong' three times in five years.\n\nThrough its Boost Health and Wellbeing programme in Hong Kong and similar programmes in India, China and Australia, CLP provided resources and training to support employees' long-term physical, mental, financial and social wellbeing and address additional stresses and challenges brought by COVID-19. CLP provided mental health first-aid training, online mental health wellbeing resources on how to stay mentally well during COVID-19, and training for over 300 managers in dealing with mental health and emotional issues in the workplace. CLP was recognised as a 'Mental Health Friendly Supreme Organisation' by the Advisory Committee of Mental Health and Department of Health in Hong Kong for its ongoing efforts to promote mental health awareness and employee resilience. Additionally, an enhanced support programme for employees with long-term injuries or illness was launched in Hong Kong, providing individualised rehabilitation support to assist recovery and return to work.\n\nCLP continued to help employees in Hong Kong to address housing affordability issues through its Home Loan scheme, which provides additional financial support for employees seeking to buy a first home. Since the scheme was launched in early 2019, 74 employees have received assistance. Company support for employees to undertake advanced degree studies was also enhanced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Demonstrating Fair Work Practices\n\nThe Group's human resources policies and procedures are intended to ensure compliance with all local laws and regulations in relation to compensation and dismissal, recruitment and promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunity, diversity, non-discrimination and harassment, and those covering benefits and welfare in the markets in which it operates. CLP takes immediate action to investigate and address any suspected breaches or issues that are brought to its attention and carries out independent audits to identify any risks of legal non-compliance and to take remedial action if any risks are identified.\n\nBeyond compliance, CLP recognises its responsibility to respect human rights at work, as laid out in international principles, standards and laws. CLP became a signatory of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Call to Action for Business Leadership on Human Rights, and of the Good Employer Charter established by the Labour Department of Hong Kong, pledging to be an employee-oriented employer implementing good human resource management practices. Human rights due diligence continued, with reviews of compliance with the Group's labour standards conducted in all business units, and with selected contractors in Hong Kong in preparation for progressively embedding CLP's standards into procurement requirements. Opportunities to strengthen controls on working hours in emergency and non-emergency situations were identified and are being addressed.\n\nCLP prohibits the employment of child labour or forced labour in any of its operations. The steps it takes to prevent such practices included stringent checking and control procedures in selection and on-boarding processes, and training for key contractors who provide manpower or services to operations. CLP did not identify any operation or supplier as having a significant risk of child labour, young workers exposed to hazardous work or forced or compulsory labour in 2020. There was no breach of laws and regulations in relation to child and forced labour across CLP in 2020.",

It complies fully with any local legal requirements with respect to minimum wage, and in practice its remuneration and benefits often significantly exceed local legal requirements. Following certification of CLP's Hong Kong operations as a Fair Wage Employer in 2018, a follow-up assessment was conducted in 2020. This reaffirmed the certification, and recognised the market competitiveness of CLP's remuneration, progress made in providing pay progression opportunities for technical staff that encourage multi-skilling, and in enhancing employment status and pay for technical trainees to encourage them to take up careers in the power industry.\n\nBusinesses around the world switched to working from home and flexible working arrangements during the pandemic. What has the impact been of these new ways of working on CLP, and how effectively do employees communicate, connect, and create in a virtual environment?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grace Tam\n\nProject Engineer LNG Terminal Project CLP Power Hong Kong\n\nCore employee benefits are reviewed regularly to ensure they are fit for purpose and sustainable. Recognising its efforts to provide sustainable retirement benefits, CLP again received Good Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Employer and e-Contribution awards from the MPF Schemes Authority in Hong Kong, and an award for the Best ORSO (Occupational Retirement) Scheme in the 2020 Best of the Best Country Awards granted by Asia Asset Management.\n\nAt CLP, we believe that providing employees with flexibility in their working arrangements helps to attract and retain a diverse, multi-generational workforce. We offer many forms of flexibility today and are mindful of offering choices that can be accommodated operationally given the nature of our business and that are fair across groups of employees with different work roles and home situations.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, our offices and sites in Hong Kong and other regional markets adopted flexible ways of working to ensure the safety of our employees while maintaining the continuity of business operations. These special work arrangements included work-from-home and flexible working hours.\n\nEmployees pivoted rapidly to working remotely or in split team arrangements for extended periods of time with team meetings, gatherings and training conducted via online conferences, webcasts or other tools. CLP's employees have demonstrated their resilience in delivering major projects, collaborating on business plans and maintaining community outreach efforts, all through virtual channels. Policies to embed flexible working post-COVID are now being piloted in Hong Kong, and EnergyAustralia is introducing a new team-based approach to flexible working.\n\nGreater flexibility, including blended remote and office working, using virtual collaboration tools, more flexible office configurations and more flexible hours and work contracts, will become the norm. 2020 has accelerated putting the 'hardware and wiring' in place - technology, policies and processes, and trialling new office environments. Our next step is to strengthen the 'software'.

Action and investment to build stronger communities and enhance their wellbeing not only fulfil the Group's responsibilities to the people it serves but also support the long-term, sustainable development of CLP's business as a leading energy provider.\n\n## Combatting the Pandemic Together\n\nGlobal events in 2020 were overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented crisis that mandated extraordinary policy measures to protect public health, and precipitated profound changes in the way people\n\nlive and work. Millions of people around the world were infected by the virus, and strict social distancing and economic restrictions disrupted the lives of billions, with underprivileged groups in society and industry sectors such as travel and catering among the most severely impacted.\n\nFrom the beginning of the outbreak in January 2020, CLP continued to support communities in its operating areas to improve the wellbeing of people in need and mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic. In keeping with CLP's long-standing commitment to effect positive change in society, the Group was determined to stand alongside communities and combat the pandemic together.\n\n## CLP Standing Alongside Its Communities to Combat the Pandemic\n\nHong Kong\n\n- \uf09e Surgical masks and daily necessities donated to the Hospital Authority, frontline medical staff, elderly, residents of subdivided flats, catering personnel and underprivileged groups\n- \uf09e Disinfectant sprays provided to around 70% of restaurants in Hong Kong to fight the virus and strengthen confidence among diners\n- \uf09e face shields with energy saving tips cards distributed to kindergarten students POWER FOUR\n- \uf09e Dining coupons provided for customers on Concessionary Tariffs for the Elderly and disadvantaged households\n- \uf09e Laptop computers donated to underprivileged groups to bridge digital divide during pandemic; virtual visits to elderly in elderly homes and day care centres using video conferencing software\n- \uf09e Goody bags given out to elderly people and the residents of subdivided flats\n- \uf09e Connecting electricity supply to Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre in record time to support anti-virus efforts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMainland China\n\n- \uf09e Medical supplies including ventilators, temperature detectors, and sanitisers donated to hospitals, medical workers and residents\n- \uf09e Supporting installation of water purifying systems in schools near Sihong Solar Power Station to improve hygiene\n- \uf09e Distributing caring kits with face masks, sanitisers and leaflets on personal hygiene to local residents and students\n\nAustralia\n\n- \uf09e Size of customer support team for customers in financial distress significantly increased to handle increased enquiries\n- \uf09e Increased programme to help residential customers manage energy bills amid economic uncertainty\n- \uf09e Protecting financially-challenged customers from service disconnections\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09e Partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Akshaya\n\nPatra Foundation to provide anti-virus supplies and food , benefitting 80,000 individuals\n\n- \uf09e Continuing programme to provide food and hygiene kits to students near CLP India's Veltoor plant\n- \uf09e Launching COVID-19 resilience building programme including sanitation improvement and emergence response training\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "CLP donated surgical masks and daily necessities to the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong to support the needs of frontline medical staff in the early stages of the outbreak. CLP also partnered with non-governmental organisations including the Hong Kong Community Anti-Coronavirus Link and the Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society, Kowloon to distribute anti-virus supplies to schools and needy families. The CLP Volunteer Team worked with charitable organisations including Sik Sik Yuen to distribute daily essentials to elderly people and tenants of subdivided units (SDU). Surgical masks and hand sanitisers have also been distributed to catering personnel through the Occupational Safety & Health Council. One million pieces of masks have also been donated to around 20,000 SDU tenants.\n\nIn Mainland China, CLP delivered medical supplies including ventilators, temperature detectors, and sanitisers to hospitals, medical workers, and residents, with a focus on communities near its operations. CLP also supported the installation of water purifying systems in schools near Sihong Solar Power Station in Jiangsu Province to improve hygiene as part of its anti-virus efforts. CLP India meanwhile went into partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Akshaya Patra Foundation to provide anti-virus supplies and food for people in communities near its operations.\n\n## Targeted, Impactful Community Support\n\nIn addition to its devastating public health impact, the COVID-19 pandemic led to massive economic challenges in countries around the world. CLP focused on devising targeted programmes tailored to practical community needs. In Hong Kong, CLP provided dining coupons for customers on concessionary tariffs and underprivileged families, boosting business for restaurants during the challenging economic environment. Disinfectant spray was also given out to around 12,000 restaurants - about 70% of the total in Hong Kong to help give customers more confidence in dining out.\n\nCLP announced in November that more customers would receive dining and retail coupons, with 800,000 households benefitting along with more than 2,000 participating outlets in 2021. The new CLP Retail and Catering Coupons programme is part of more than HK$160 million worth of projects to be funded by the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund, supporting people in different sectors of society and stimulating consumer spending in a challenging economic environment. Increased retail spending has a multiplier effect and is an effective way to inject momentum into the economy. Funding will also go to other projects, such as electricity subsidies for tenants of subdivided units and assistance to help people in transitional housing purchase energy-efficient electrical appliances.\n\nAs an essential service provider, CLP is committed to its responsibility to deliver a reliable energy supply to customers as more people work from home and school classes are held remotely. CLP maintained consistently reliable services to customers in the Asia-Pacific region throughout 2020 as the COVID-19 situation unfolded, prioritising measures to safeguard the health and safety of customers, employees, and contractors.\n\n## Bridging the Digital Divide\n\nDigital communication tools have been necessities amid steps to reduce interpersonal contact and limit the spread of COVID-19, leaving underprivileged people without access to technology at risk of becoming further disadvantaged. To help bridge the digital divide, CLP provided laptops to lowincome families in Hong Kong to support remote learning for children during the pandemic. CLP volunteers also provided computer training to parents to help them use digital technology effectively at home.\n\nAlthough social-distancing restrictions reduced the opportunities for physical meetings, CLP used digital technology to support people in need. Virtual visits to elderly homes and day care centres using video conferencing software were held in Hong Kong in June to celebrate the Tuen Ng Festival as part of the Sharing the Festive Joy programme. Organised in partnership with Po Leung Kuk, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, and Yan Chai Hospital, the online visits were the first of their kind in Hong Kong and opened a new window for people to maintain regular external interactions despite COVID-19 restrictions. Digital technology also allowed CLP volunteers to continue a programme supporting the families of elderly people with early signs of dementia, despite home visits being suspended.\n\n## Increasing Opportunities for Young People\n\nCLP continued to focus on initiatives to promote youth development, recognising the importance of empowering young people and creating opportunities for them to flourish and contribute to a brighter future.\n\nThe economic shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic have impaired the employment prospects for workers around the world, in particular younger people with limited work experience. In response to the increased challenges faced by graduates, CLP more than doubled its recruitment of university and vocational college graduates in Hong Kong in 2020 compared with a year earlier. Around 60 oneyear internships were offered for university graduates in engineering, environmental affairs, information technology, finance, sales and marketing, and human resources under the CLP Graduate Internship Programme. CLP also took on around 70 university graduates and secondary school students through the CLP Graduate Trainee Programme and the CLP Technician Trainee Programme.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Instead of focusing only on finding full-time roles in the finance, consumer goods, and technology sectors, she started to consider part-time or temporary employment in other industry sectors before eventually securing a two-month role as an office administrator at Lingnan University. After completing her temporary contract at the university, Ms Ma became one of the successful new recruits in the CLP Graduate Internship Programme in 2020, with a position in the Human Resources department.\n\n'The internship programme has helped to open up more opportunities for graduates, at a time when economic conditions have reduced the number of full-time openings in the job market,' Ms Ma says.\n\nKen Ng, who graduated in Energy Science and Engineering from the City University of Hong Kong in 2020, also joined CLP as a recruit in the Graduate Internship programme in September 2020, eight months after making his first job application.\n\n'A lot of students were aware 2020 was going to be a tough year so we started planning early,' says Mr Ng, who joined the commercial department in CLP's Mainland China business through an internship based in Hong Kong.\n\n'There are many exciting new developments in the energy sector at the moment, and many of the trends I used to learn about at university are happening in the real world right now,' Mr Ng says.\n\nTo provide financial assistance to students on vocational and professional education and training (VPET) courses, CLP set up a new HK$1.5 million award programme. Up to 75 students enrolled in VPET programmes run by the Vocational Training Council will receive subsidies of HK$20,000 each to support their academic and career development.\n\nThe CLP Power Academy, established in 2017, continued to provide a range of part-time accredited programmes for individuals seeking a career in power engineering, from junior secondary school leavers lacking relevant qualifications to existing industry practitioners. The academy works in partnership with tertiary institutions in Hong Kong and overseas to provide programmes from diplomas to bachelor's and master's degrees. In 2020, the CLP Power Academy established exchange and cooperation agreements with the Guangzhou Mechanics and Electronics Technician College and Guangzhou Public Utility Technician College to jointly promote professional training and mutual recognition of training programmes by Guangzhou and Hong Kong.\n\nCLP continued to strengthen efforts to promote energy efficiency and conservation education in the community. Since January 2020, schools, educational institutions and non-profit making organisations in Hong Kong could apply to the CLP Education Fund for financial support for education\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand publicity projects on energy efficiency and conservation. Seven applications have been approved, supporting programmes and events including seminars, workshops, competitions and web-based learning, benefitting more than 28,000 members of the public including students, teachers and parents.\n\nCLP joined the City University of Hong Kong's 'Industry Ready Programme' to offer mentoring guidance and on-the-job training to undergraduates in the School of Energy and Environment. The programme will equip students with well-rounded theoretical and practical knowledge related to energy audit and energy management, and help them prepare for future career development in the energy, environmental and sustainability fields. In addition to CLP, six professional bodies and companies also joined the programme.\n\nCLP India teamed up with the School of Vocational Education at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences on a programme to train 2,000 youths in renewable energy and healthcare skills, using online technologies because of the pandemic. Students who benefited from CLP India's midday meals programme near the Hubli and Veltoor plants continued to receive meals along with hygiene kits when COVID-19 forced schools to close.",

The scale of destruction by wildfires in Australia and on the US west coast, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as tropical storms, have further galvanised international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The global COVID-19 pandemic meanwhile focused attention on the critical importance of taking timely action based on scientific evidence.\n\n## Material Topic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responding to Climate Change\n\nThis section discusses CLP's strategies for decarbonising its business and minimising environmental impact as the Group continues to contribute to global efforts to address the challenges of climate change.\n\n## Towards Decarbonisation\n\nCLP continued its ongoing transition into a lower-carbon business in 2020 by moving forward with key decarbonisation projects in the Asia-Pacific region despite the challenges of COVID-19. Carbon intensity fell to 0.57 kg CO2 / kWh, below the Group's interim target of 0.60 kg CO2 / kWh under Climate Vision 2050. CLP remains committed to meeting future targets, which will be further strengthened as part of a review of Climate Vision 2050 currently underway.\n\nThe commissioning of the new 550MW CCGT gas-fired generation unit at Black Point Power Station enabled an increase in the use of natural gas to about 50% of CLP's fuel mix in Hong Kong in 2020, and reduced the proportion of coal power. The 10MW West New Territories Landfill project began operations, using landfill gas as a renewable energy source.\n\nCLP commissioned its new 50MW Laiwu III Wind Farm in Shandong province in September, further expanding its renewable energy operations in Mainland China. CLP India meanwhile acquired two operational solar farms, with capacities of 30MW and 50MW, in the southern state of Telangana.\n\nWhile CLP achieved its 2020 decarbonisation target to reduce carbon intensity under Climate Vision 2050, the Group did not meet two supporting clean energy objectives. Renewable energy capacity was 13.5% of CLP's overall portfolio as of 31 December 2020, short of the target of 20%. Non-carbonemitting generation capacity was 24.4%, against a target of 30%.\n\nThe Group's clean energy portfolio was reduced by the partial divestment of CLP India in 2018. Meanwhile reductions in government subsidies for renewable energy in Mainland China and India in recent years have affected the business models of new projects and curtailed potential revenue streams. Going forward, opportunities for renewable energy investment are expected to increase due to lower-cost solar and wind energy technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Climate Vision 2050 is integrated into CLP's strategies on asset portfolio management, including those for acquisitions and divestments, guiding the Group in managing climaterelated opportunities and risks. Under Climate Vision 2050, CLP has committed not to make any additional investments in coal-fired generation capacity, and to phase out all remaining coal assets. In October, CLP sold its interests in the Vung Ang II coal-fired project in Vietnam, and is in the process of exiting the Vinh Tan III project in the country.\n\n## Exploring New Low-Carbon Opportunities\n\nIn line with Climate Vision 2050, CLP is focused on investment opportunities in emerging low-carbon businesses, including renewable energy generation, nuclear energy, transmission and distribution, energy storage, and smart energy services, to support the Group's future growth as coal-based assets are progressively phased out.\n\nConstruction in CLP India's new 250.8MW Sidhpur wind project in the western state of Gujarat started after engineering, procurement, and construction contracts and operation and maintenance agreements were finalised with project partners. Despite a delay caused by logistical issues related to COVID-19, the new project will be a significant addition to CLP India's renewable energy capabilities when it is completed in the first half of 2022. It will be the largest wind energy asset in the CLP Group in terms of generation capacity.\n\nThe Chinese Government announced in September it intends to make the country carbon-neutral by 2060. This goal is favourable to the development of a clear and stable policy environment to support the long-term investments in clean energy needed to further decarbonise the electricity sector and the wider economy.\n\nCLP continued to move ahead with plans to construct the new Qian'an III Wind Farm in Jilin province. Unlike other renewable energy assets in CLP's portfolio in Mainland China, Qian'an III is a grid-parity project that is not dependent on Government subsidies, as the declining cost of wind energy infrastructure enables the Group to take advantage of an important new commercial model for the development of clean energy.\n\nLower-cost wind power technologies are also opening up opportunities for CLP in Hong Kong. Advances in wind turbine equipment and improved cost efficiency may make offshore wind power development more commercially viable as CLP studies the feasibility of a project in Hong Kong's south-eastern waters. As the Hong Kong Government formulates policies for long-term decarbonisation to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, potential reductions in the cost of\n\noffshore wind power may add impetus to renewable energy development in the city, where scarcity of land has been a limiting factor.\n\nAlongside the newly-commissioned CCGT generation unit at Black Point, CLP continued to make progress with the development of a second additional gas-fired generator at the power station using similarly emission-efficient technologies. Both projects will help facilitate the retirement of older coal-fired power generation capacity at Castle Peak A Power Station and support the ongoing lower-carbon transition of Hong Kong's electricity market.\n\nEnergyAustralia signed an offtake agreement with Genex Power Limited for full dispatch rights to the 250MW Kidston pumped storage hydro project in northern Queensland on a site converted from disused gold mines. The arrangement adds to EnergyAustralia's commercial interests in the Ballarat and Gannawarra battery storage projects in Victoria, supporting the development of a cleaner electricity market in Australia by addressing the intermittency of renewable energy sources.\n\n## Concerted Action to Fight Climate Change\n\nRecent climate commitments from the Chinese and Hong Kong Governments, in addition to similar announcements from policymakers in Europe and Asia, are welcome signs of increasing momentum in efforts to address climate change. Despite concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may derail climate action in the private sector, corporations around the world have stepped up initiatives to decarbonise and make businesses more sustainable, while ESG investments have provided returns on capital that have matched or exceeded the performance of traditional investments.\n\nMore than 1,500 organisations around the world have embraced recommendations for transparency in reporting by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), 85% more than a year earlier, according to data released in October. CLP continued to enhance its disclosure with reference to the recommendations from the TCFD. Throughout 2020 focus was placed on enhancing climaterelated risk assessment and developing bespoke climate scenarios for the markets where the Group is present. More information is available in CLP's Sustainability Report.\n\nChanges in political leadership in the US and other major economies in 2021, combined with intergovernmental forums including the United Nations COP26 climate summit in November 2021, are expected to add to momentum for concerted action to combat climate change by policymakers, businesses, and financial investors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP's performance in key environmental areas is summarised in the table below.\n\n| Environmental Category   | Aspect           | Parameters                                 | 2020                                            | 2019                                            |\n|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Emissions                | Greenhouse gases | Total CO 2  emissions 1                    | 43,808kt                                        | 50,412kt                                        |\n|                          |                  | Carbon intensity                           | 0.65kg CO 2   per kWh /  0.57kg CO 2  per kWh 2 | 0.70kg CO 2  per kWh /   0.62kg CO 2  per kWh 2 |\n|                          | Air pollutants   | Total SO 2  emissions                      | 48.0kt                                          | 44.7kt                                          |\n|                          |                  | Total NOx emissions                        | 43.2kt                                          | 47.0kt                                          |\n|                          |                  | Total particulate matter  emissions        | 6.9kt                                           | 7.7kt                                           |\n|                          | Water discharged | Total water discharged                     | 5,200.3Mm 3                                     | 5,337.1Mm 3                                     |\n|                          | Waste            | Total solid waste produced                 | 19,404t                                         | 14,206t                                         |\n|                          |                  | Total liquid waste produced                | 1,094kl                                         | 1,637kl                                         |\n| Resource Use             | Fuel             | Total coal consumed                        | 403,379TJ                                       | 485,453TJ                                       |\n|                          |                  | Total gas consumed                         | 134,776TJ                                       | 107,183TJ                                       |\n|                          |                  | Total oil consumed                         | 2,243TJ                                         | 2,620TJ                                         |\n|                          |                  | Non-carbon emitting  generation capacity % | 20.9% / 24.4% 2                                 | 21.1% / 24.9% 2                                 |\n|                          |                  | Total renewable energy  capacity%          | 12.8% / 13.5% 2                                 | 12.8% / 13.7% 2                                 |\n|                          | Water            | Total water withdrawal                     | 5,229.2Mm 3                                     | 5,377.4Mm 3                                     |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 emissions of CLP's generation and energy storage portfolio on an operational control basis. Energy storage assets include pumped storage and battery storage. Prior to 2020, the portfolio included generation assets only.\n- 2 Equity basis / equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis\n\nPower generation facilities under CLP's operational control are required to achieve third-party certified ISO14001 environmental management certification within two years of acquisition, or from the beginning of operations. All assets in this category have successfully certified their environmental management system to the ISO14001: 2015 standard in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Air Emissions\n\nNew technologies and practices continued to help CLP meet and exceed increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on air emissions in the markets in which it operates. The operation of the new CCGT generation unit at Black Point Power Station supported CLP's air emissions performance in Hong Kong, where it continued to fully comply with emission limits. CLP continued to be vigilant to prevent the leak of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a greenhouse gas, throughout the life cycle of the electrical equipment in transmission line assets. CLP has also explored non-SF6 gas equipment in the market and trial-used 11kV non-SF6 gas switchgear.\n\nFull operation of the flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) units at CLP India's Jhajjar Power Station since 2019 supported a continuing improvement in sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Jhajjar is the first and only power station in the National Capital Region to have FGD technology installed, helping reduce air pollution and contributing to a healthier environment around the plant and in nearby regions. In Mainland China, Fangchenggang Power Station continued to perform well after earlier upgrades of emission control equipment for SO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx). Across the Group, SO2 emissions increased due to higher generation at Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales.\n\nIn South Australia, the installation of a new fast-start gas generator at Hallett Power Station increased fuel efficiency. The new generator uses less fuel than other units at the plant, improving its NOx and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions performance.\n\n## Waste\n\nTotal solid and liquid waste generated was higher, as construction waste from projects increased at Castle Peak Power Station and Black Point Power Station, while hazardous solid waste increased from maintenance activities at Fangchenggang and Yallourn power stations. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, CLP continued to implement waste management programmes and initiatives across the Group.\n\nDespite the national lockdown, Jhajjar Power Station achieved a 100% utilisation rate for ash generated by its processes. Apart from its enhanced ash handling systems, Jhajjar ensured contracts were in place with cement manufacturers, construction industries, and other traders for reuse and recycling of ash, as well as pursuing other opportunities, including brick manufacturing and bridge construction projects.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP continued to encourage employees to reduce the use of single-use plastics for take-away meals and home delivery since the outbreak of COVID-19. The rollout of a new electronic meal ticket system in the canteens of Castle Peak and Black Point power stations has helped to save about 260,000 paper tickets a year.\n\nIn 2020, Fangchenggang Power Station used around 1,150 tonnes of white mud waste by-product from paper mill factories to partially replace the use of limestone in the FGD process. Since 2017, Jinchang Solar Power Station has been returning damaged solar panels to manufacturers for recycling. More than 2,000 solar panels have been recycled since the initiative's launch.\n\n## Water\n\nCLP is committed to using water resources responsibly and sustainably in all of its operations and to ensure its assets withdraw water according to their licence entitlements.\n\nThermal plants use large quantities of sea water for cooling, and there is a slight temperature increase when the water is returned to the sea. As in previous years, the total water withdrawal and discharge from freshwater and municipal sources by CLP was determined by the electricity generation of its operating assets.\n\nThe Springvale mine water treatment plant was commissioned in the first quarter of the year to supply Mount Piper Power Station with around 80% of its daily water needs. The initiative has resulted in significantly less water being drawn from river catchments for the plant, and has lowered the risk of contaminated water from the mine entering rivers. Mount Piper is one of three coal-fired power stations in the CLP Group to adopt a zero-liquid discharge approach to conserve water, while other generation assets continued to implement water-saving initiatives.\n\nSihong Solar Power Station in Mainland China and Veltoor Solar Farm in India successfully deployed robotic cleaning, with brushes replacing the use of water. These projects not only eliminated the use of water for cleaning but could also potentially increase the efficiency of electricity generation by making the panels more productive. In 2020, Huai'an Solar Power Station started to implement the technology, while Sihong has expanded its deployment to cover increased areas of the plant.\n\nCLP continued to participate in the international CDP Water Survey, working with industry peers to benchmark and share best practices related to water resource management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The second - the Fisheries Enhancement Fund supports initiatives for fisheries-related education and tourism, enhancements to fisheries resources, sustainable fishery development, and fishery equipment upgrade programmes, such as the purchase of environmentally-friendly fishing equipment. Both funds were opened for a first round of applications from October to November.\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Compliance\n\nIn 2020, there were no environmental regulatory non-compliance incidents resulting in fines or prosecutions at any of CLP's operating sites.\n\nThere was one minor licence limit exceedance incident for NOx emissions at Jhajjar in India that did not result in any penalties.\n\nIn Australia, three environmental license non-compliances were reported. There was a minor chemical spillage incident at Newport Power Station, involving ferrous sulphate, and there was also a minor brine waste leakage incident at Mount Piper. Environmental agencies were notified and no fines or penalties were imposed. At Mount Piper, there was also an administrative breach of water quality monitoring requirements under the new license. Corrective action has been taken to prevent a repeat of these incidents.\n\n|                                                                                |   Environmental Regulatory Non-Compliances and Licence Limit Incidents |   Environmental Regulatory Non-Compliances and Licence Limit Incidents |   Environmental Regulatory Non-Compliances and Licence Limit Incidents |   Environmental Regulatory Non-Compliances and Licence Limit Incidents |   Environmental Regulatory Non-Compliances and Licence Limit Incidents |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                |                                                                   2020 |                                                                   2019 |                                                                   2018 |                                                                   2017 |                                                                   2016 |\n| Environmental regulatory non- compliances resulting in fines   or prosecutions |                                                                      0 |                                                                      0 |                                                                      0 |                                                                      0 |                                                                      0 |\n| Environmental licence limit incidents   and other non-compliances              |                                                                      4 |                                                                     10 |                                                                      2 |                                                                     13 |                                                                      2 |\n\n## Regulatory Developments\n\nCLP has started discussions with the Hong Kong Government on the review of the latest Technical Memorandum for new emissions caps for power stations from 2026. Since the first memorandum in 2010, emission allowances for SO2, NOx and respirable suspended particulates (RSP) have been reduced by 71%, 44%, and 44% respectively. With the new CCGT unit at Black Point and another gas-fired unit of similar capacity planned for commissioning by 2023, emissions will be further reduced along with other improvements in generation efficiency.\n\nIn India, Jhajjar Power Station made preparations to comply with revised NOx emission limits. The revision was formally gazetted in October.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Australia, Mount Piper is implementing measures and controls to ensure compliance with the tightened emission limits specified in its new license. The Environment Protection Authority in Victoria released a draft licence for Yallourn Power Station which covers a variety of environmental matters, including tightened emission limits and monitoring requirements. EnergyAustralia is engaging with the authority and hopes to finalise the licence in early 2021. Detailed site investigations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in soil and groundwater at the Jeeralang and Newport power stations have been completed and a remediation action plan developed to guide a clean-up strategy which will be deployed in 2021. New State Government environmental legislation due to come into effect in Victoria in July has been deferred by 12 months because of COVID-19. Planned new legislation on greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the state has also been deferred until 2021.",

        "page_content": "What opportunities and challenges are being presented to CLP as China officially launched the National Emission Trading Scheme early this year? Any opportunities and challenges for other countries?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress in the development of the emission trading scheme at a national level this year is a significant step by the Chinese Government to further expand the use of market-based mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the first stage, the national scheme covers more than 2,000 power plants across the country, before expanding to other sectors of the economy. The national scheme builds on the experiences from the operations of earlier pilot emission trading schemes at provincial levels, and CLP's Fangchenggang Power Station in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been taking active steps to use the new trading mechanism to optimise carbon emission management and reduce carbon emission.\n\n## Mr Dennis Ip\n\nRegional Head of Power, Utilities, Renewables & Environment Research, Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Limited\n\nInternationally, the latest data from the World Bank showed that just over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are now covered by carbon pricing or emission trading schemes, and there is clearly potential for the proportion to increase further. Market-based mechanisms have a major role in creating the economic incentives needed to accelerate progress in decarbonisation.\n\nNon-carbon businesses including renewable energy and nuclear energy now contribute most of CLP's operating earnings in Mainland China, and we continue to focus on pursuing low-carbon opportunities in the market. The costs for wind and solar power generation technologies have been steadily decreasing, making new projects commercially competitive with fossil fuels. We expect that the Chinese Government's target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 will underpin a stable, longterm framework that is necessary to drive investments to decarbonise the country's energy industry and other sectors of the economy.\n\nDecarbonisation is integral to the CLP Group's business. We achieved our cornerstone interim target to reduce the Group's carbon intensity to below 0.6 kg CO2 per kWh in 2020 and we plan to further strengthen the Group's targets for decarbonisation this year, to reflect developments in the policy environment and emerging technologies.\n\nDavid Simmonds\n\nGroup General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer, Company Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP's commitment to good corporate governance practices enabled us to tackle, with conviction, many of the disruptions and changes brought about by COVID-19.\n\nCrisis management preparation is a key element of good governance. In managing the challenges of COVID-19, we were able to draw on the experience and planning developed during the 2003 SARs crisis which had been refined and enhanced regularly over the years as part of our governance process. This enabled us to continue to deliver operational excellence for our customers right across the Group in 2020.\n\nSustainable business depends on a sustainable society and COVID-19 has driven home that point forcefully. Throughout the pandemic, CLP has maintained a focus on operational excellence, putting the safety and wellbeing of our own people and of the communities we serve at the heart of everything we do. The challenges of 2020 further emphasised the importance of a genuine focus on ESG and reinforced our long-term commitment to sustainable business practices.\n\nDespite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, we continued with our ongoing efforts to gradually refresh our Board. In 2020, in line with the retirement age\n\nguideline we established in 2019, Mr Vernon Moore and Mr Vincent Cheng, our Independent Non-executive Directors retired and Ms Christina Gaw and Mr Chunyuan Gu were appointed as new Independent Non-executive Directors to our Board with skills and experience that will guide our transition towards a Utility of the Future.\n\nIn 2019, we conducted the first Hybrid Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Hong Kong as a way to allow more shareholders to participate in this important opportunity to engage with our Board and Senior Management. While a relatively small proportion of shareholders attended online in 2019, this experience saw us well prepared to run our 2020 AGM with social distancing measures and our hybrid meeting format allowed the vast majority of participating shareholders to attend and vote online. For more details, please see '2020 At a Glance'.\n\nAt CLP, we believe that good corporate governance is an enabler of long-term value creation and we are committed to continually reviewing and evolving our governance policies and practices to ensure that they continue to serve us well in a changing environment. 2020 brought a year of dramatic change and once again highlighted the importance of this approach.\n\nDavid Simmonds Company Secretary\n\nCLP has been honoured to receive a number of awards for our Corporate Governance and Annual Report.  In 2020, we are most humbled to have received the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountant's Outstanding Achievement Award as a special one-off award for outstanding performance over the past 20 years of the Institute's Best Corporate Governance Awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommenting on these recognitions, we acknowledge the unique role that CLP has in Hong Kong and in the words of our Chairman The Hon Sir Michael Kadoorie, 'it is a role that CLP plays conscientiously'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2020 At a Glance\n\n## Value Framework Refreshed\n\nThe CLP Value Framework has been a strong foundation for our Corporate Governance. It articulates multiple layers of our corporate identity and culture, namely:\n\n- 'Vision, Mission, Values, Commitments and Policies & Codes.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Background:\n\nThe Value Framework was first introduced in 2003 and reflects time-honoured principles and commitments that have been integral to CLP's success for 120 years.\n\nConsistent with our approach of continuous review and improvement to our governance practice, in 2020, we made key changes to the Value Framework by fully integrating our Sustainability Principles in order to underscore the fundamental role of sustainability in our long-term development.\n\n## Other Key Changes:\n\n- Integrating 'Future Culture' into the Value Framework.\n- Updating our Mission to 'provide sustainable energy solutions'.\n- Strengthening innovation values and commitments.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee considered and endorsed the refreshed Value Framework; for more details, please refer to the Sustainability Committee Report.\n\n## Hybrid AGM\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit Hong Kong in early 2020 and prior to the Government introducing the social distancing requirements for AGMs, we were able to draw from our experience in running a Hybrid AGM in 2019 to prepare for our 2020 AGM with social distancing measures in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What the Hybrid platform offered:\n\n- Registered and non-registered shareholders were able to view the AGM live and to pose questions.\n- Registered shareholders were able to vote online.\n- The convenience of posing questions online.\n\n## Social distancing measures undertaken:\n\n- A limit of 50 shareholders attending the AGM in person was imposed.\n- As our AGMs have been well attended historically, we asked our shareholders to register their interest in attending as the 50 spaces were balloted in advance ensuring that the attendance on the day would be fair and orderly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Follow up to External Board Review Recommendations\n\n- We implemented the following recommendations from our 2019 external Board Review:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Non-executive Director search for candidates who can add value on emerging strategic issues - we were able to identify two candidates with strong experience in Mainland China and the Greater Bay Area and they were subsequently appointed as our new Independent Non-executive Directors.\n- Further strengthening the Sustainability Committee's role of overseeing the impact of longer-term sustainability issues on the Group's strategy - the Sustainability Committee held extended meetings with dedicated sessions on innovation and digitalisation, and another session on climate change that included a briefing from a leading external climate change expert.\n- Reviewing the approach to the strategic talent agenda - the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee has enhanced the oversight of strategic talent and succession planning with specific briefings on talent development at the organisational level and succession planning at the senior management level.\n- Access to Board Committee Papers - Directors can now access all Board Committee minutes.\n\n## COVID-19 and a Challenging Risk Environment\n\nCOVID-19 brought about many challenges for CLP on the corporate governance front, these included COVID-19 related risks in the following areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Completing the financial year-end closing process in early 2020 as COVID-19 hit Mainland China and Hong Kong.\n- The convening of our 2020 AGM.\n\nIn addition to COVID-19, the risks that the CLP Group are faced with have become increasingly challenging and complex, these are some of the key risks that we have been actively monitoring in 2020:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Board level - the Board examined the risks associated with the acceleration of energy transition, and digital technologies, along with the impact of changing geo-political dynamics and the rise of more protectionist trade and investment policies; the Board also considered the potential opportunities that could be captured from these developments.\n- Audit & Risk Committee - this Committee closely monitored risk items that evolved rapidly during the course of the year, including geo-political related risks, regulatory risks, the bushfires in Australia and cybersecurity.\n- Sustainability Committee - this Committee had a dedicated session to gain a deeper understanding of the risks (and opportunities) relating to innovation, technology developments and the increasing adoption of digital technologies; and another dedicated session on climate change with a briefing by a leading expert on how the progress of CLP's climate action was perceived.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CLP Code is on our website and available on request.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Code incorporates and goes beyond the principles of good corporate governance, and the two levels of recommendations in The Corporate Governance Code and Corporate Governance Report (the Stock Exchange Code), Appendix 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities (the Listing Rules) issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The only exception to this, however, concerns quarterly reporting, details of which are explained on page 122.\n\nWe have made further enhancements to our corporate governance practices in 2020 and some of these are highlighted in ' 2020 At a Glance '.\n\n## Areas in which our Code exceeds the Stock Exchange Code\n\n## Our Board\n\n- \uf09e The composition of the Board and the Audit & Risk Committee exceed the independence requirements under the Listing Rules.\n- \uf09e We conduct a regular evaluation of the Board and its Committees and a summary of the conclusions is published on the CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09e We issue a formal letter of appointment for Non-executive Directors. The model letter is on our website and deals with a range of matters regarding a Director's appointment and responsibilities including an expected level of time commitment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09e We have a set of bespoke CLP Onboarding Guidelines for Directors with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. The Guidelines are available on the CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09e With the objective of minimising succession risk, the retirement age guideline in our Board Diversity Policy provides that where a Non-executive Director has reached the age of 72 at the time of the relevant AGM, such Director will not be considered for re-election, however, this may be waived if the Board considers such Director has skills, experience or capabilities that cannot be replaced at the relevant time. This applies to all Non-executive Directors other than the Chairman. In 2020, we appointed two new Independent Non-executive Directors, with two having retired.\n- \uf09e The number of Board meetings exceed the requirements under the Listing Rules. Each year, we hold five Board meetings and in addition, the Chairman holds a separate meeting with the Non-executive Directors only and another meeting with the Independent Non-executive Directors only.\n\n## Our disclosure\n\n- \uf09e Our Fair Disclosure Policy sets out the principles for the broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public.\n- \uf09e Our Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures guide the organisation in monitoring and disclosing potential inside information.\n- \uf09e The Continuous Disclosure Committee conducts regular assessment of potential inside information.\n- \uf09e Our Risk Management Report sets out CLP's risk management framework and how CLP manages the Group's material risks.\n- \uf09e We disclose our Senior Management's CLP shareholding interests and their confirmation of compliance with the Model Code and CLP Code for Securities Transactions, in addition to similar disclosures by our Directors.\n- \uf09e Our disclosure of financial information on the CLP Group's joint ventures and associates are enhanced in various ways such as the inclusion of off-balance sheet contingent liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We publish our full Annual Report and our Sustainability Report on our website within the following fortnight; the Annual Report will also be sent to shareholders about two weeks after that.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09e We disclose on our website minutes of our AGM; in addition, any questions or topics that are not specifically addressed at the AGM, full answers are provided and disclosed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our unique policies and practices\n\n- \uf09e CLP has established its own Corporate Governance Framework, the Value Framework and its own Code for Securities Transactions. Our Value Framework was refreshed in December 2020.\n- \uf09e We have formulated our own Anti-Fraud Policy (updated in June 2019) which stipulates our commitment to preventing, detecting and reporting fraud, bribery and extortion. In 2020, we carried out a group-wide anti-fraud online training for our staff (see 'Management and Staff' on page 138).\n- \uf09e General Representation Letters are issued by our CEO and CFO to the Audit & Risk Committee as verification of compliance.\n- \uf09e We conduct a group-wide Business Practice Review for our staff on a periodic basis to foster employees' understanding of our Code of Conduct (updated in May 2020) under CLP's Value Framework. An important aspect of this is ensuring that our employees maintain a good understanding of CLP's culture and values.\n- \uf09e Under our Value Framework, we also have a Responsible Procurement Policy Statement. This sets out our expectations of the suppliers and of their suppliers and subcontractors and we encourage them to follow the same standards of integrity and transparency in doing business with us.\n- \uf09e Our Audit & Risk Committee will regularly examine the audit activity reviews conducted by the Internal Auditors. The Internal Auditors will highlight the significant events and findings which require the Committee's attention and further examination, where appropriate.\n- \uf09e Members of our Audit & Risk Committee will conduct a meeting as between Members only prior to the full Committee meeting attended by management and the auditors; two of which are joined by the independent auditor.\n- \uf09e For the Group's continuing connected transactions (CCTs), we engaged the Company's independent auditor, PwC to undertake an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement on the Group's CCTs pricing policies. The AUP findings were provided to the Independent Non-executive Directors as part of their consideration of the CCTs for the purposes of giving the required confirmation under Rule 14A.55 of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Compliance with the Stock Exchange Code and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Reporting Guide\n\nThroughout the year, the Company has met the Code Provisions and applied all the principles in the Stock Exchange Code. CLP deviates from only one Recommended Best Practice in the Stock Exchange Code - that an issuer should announce and publish quarterly financial results.\n\n## Our Considered Reasons for not Issuing Quarterly Financial Results\n\nWhile CLP does issue quarterly statements which set out key financial and business information such as electricity sales, dividends and progress in major activities, we do not issue quarterly financial results for the following considered reasons:\n\n- \uf09e they do not bring significant benefits to our shareholders;\n- \uf09e they encourage a short-term view of the Company's business performance;\n- \uf09e CLP's activities do not run and need not be disclosed and judged on a three-month cycle; and\n- \uf09e preparation of quarterly reports is costly, including the opportunity cost of Board and management time spent on quarterly reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Full details on the materiality assessment is provided in our Sustainability Report and in 'Board's Statement on ESG' in the Directors' Report.\n- \uf09e Quantitative and Consistency - our ESG disclosures follow these guidelines and recommendations: the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's ESG Reporting Guide (ESG Reporting Guide); the integrated approach under the <IR> guidelines published by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC); the Global Reporting Initiative Reporting Standards (GRI Standards); and the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations. ESG KPIs are provided over a period of five years in the Five-year Summaries to facilitate comparison.\n- \uf09e Boundaries - as our business needs evolve, scenarios may arise where our previously defined reporting scope was not able to fully capture the material impacts of our overall portfolio, and to better reflect these impacts, selected reporting scopes will be adjusted in different aspects and these are explained fully in our Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndependent oversight\n\nExternal Assurance and Group Internal Audit",

        "page_content": "## Why Board Diversity is Important to CLP\n\nWe recognise that Board diversity is an essential element contributing to the sustainable development of CLP.\n\nThe CLP Board Diversity Policy was adopted by the Board in 2013 and revised in 2019. This Policy incorporates Code Provisions of the Stock Exchange Code, the retirement age guideline (at the age of 72) for our Non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman) and the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff.\n\n## Board Composition & Diversity\n\n## Gender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessment Results of Diversity\n\nThe Board is characterised by its strong independence and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPercentage of Directors having served the Board for over 10 years remained at 42% (gradual Board refresh is in progress with an increasing number of Directors serving the Board for five years or below during 2020)\n\nPercentage of Directors aged 70 or above is on a downward trend (reduced from 21%)\n\nOur concept of diversity incorporates a number of different aspects, such as independence, professional experiences, business perspectives, skills, knowledge, gender, age, cultural and educational background, ethnicity and length of service.\n\nOur Board Diversity Policy also recognises that board diversity can be achieved without increasing the size of the Board and that a reduction in board size due to retirements without replacement can also be a way to further diversity.\n\nThe CLP Board Diversity Policy is available on the CLP website.\n\n## Age group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nationality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard is reasonably diverse in terms of nationality, with resident Directors in Hong Kong, India and Australia where CLP has major business and operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board Expertise\n\nTo ensure the Board continues to possess a balance of skills appropriate for the requirements of the business of the Group, an analysis of the skill set mix was considered by the Nomination Committee.\n\nThe table below highlights the breakdown of the skill set mix of our Directors and demonstrates the broad and diverse mix of experience and background relevant to CLP that the Directors bring to the Board and its Committees.\n\n| Expertise

In 2020, none of the Directors were required to withdraw from meeting in these circumstances.\n\nThe Company follows guidelines at each financial reporting period to obtain confirmations from Directors in respect of any transactions of the Company or its subsidiaries which are related to Directors or their connected entities.\n\nIn addition, identified significant related party transactions are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence\n\nAs required under the Listing Rules, the Company received written confirmations from all of the Independent Nonexecutive Directors regarding the independence of each of them and their immediate family members.\n\nAmong the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, Mr Nicholas C. Allen holds cross-directorship with Ms May Tan, as both of them serve on the boards of the Company and Link Asset Management Ltd.\n\nGiven that each of Mr Nicholas C. Allen and Ms May Tan plays a non-executive role and holds less than 1% of the number of issued shares in each of the relevant companies, the Company considers that such cross-directorship would not undermine their independence with respect to their directorships at CLP Holdings.\n\n## Our view on independence\n\nThe Company maintains the view that a Director's independence is a question of fact and this is formally recognised in the Board Diversity Policy. The Board is committed to assessing this on an ongoing basis with regard to all relevant factors concerned. Some of these factors include: the ability to continually provide constructive challenge for management and other Directors and to express one's own views independent of management or other fellow Directors and the gravitas inside and outside the boardroom context. These attributes and desired behaviour have been demonstrated by our Independent Nonexecutive Directors as circumstances require.\n\nTaking into account all of the circumstances described in this section, the Company considers all of the Independent Nonexecutive Directors to be independent.\n\nDetails of all Directors and their biographies including, if any, relationship between the members are disclosed on pages 110 to 115 and on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Shareholding Interests\n\nDirectors' interests in CLP's securities as at 31 December 2020 are disclosed in the Directors' Report on page 192. All Directors have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company, that throughout the year ended 31 December 2020 they have complied with the required standard set out in the Model Code and our own Code for Securities Transactions. CLP's own Code for Securities Transactions is largely based on the Model Code set out in Appendix 10 of the Listing Rules and is on terms no less exacting than those in the Model Code.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our respect for people and diversity are embedded in CLP's Value Framework and our Board Diversity Policy has also incorporated the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff. The Value Framework was updated in 2020 and a number of labourrelated commitments have been reinforced in the updated Value Framework.\n\nOne of the key tasks of CLP's management and staff is the successful implementation of strategy and direction as determined by the Board under the leadership of our Chairman. This includes promoting and 'living' the good corporate culture set by our Board over the years. In doing so, they must apply business principles and ethics which are consistent with those expected by the Board, CLP's shareholders and other stakeholders, and these have been documented in our Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced the Fraud Risk Awareness e-learning course, a mandatory training for staff covering all regions, aimed at enhancing the fraud risk awareness across the CLP Group. The course focused on the importance of identifying different forms of potential fraud, and on how CLP staff can prevent, detect, respond to, and report cases of fraud. These are exceptionally relevant in light of the pandemic situation, unprecedented in many ways, where organisations could potentially be more vulnerable to the heightened risk of fraud.\n\n## Role of Management and Staff in Promoting Good Corporate Governance Practices\n\nThe positions of Chairman and CEO are separate, our CEO has the overall responsibility for carrying out the strategy and direction set by the Board and for managing the Group's business. The delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees, Senior Management and management are prescribed in the form of a 'Company Management Authority Manual'.\n\nManagement and staff adhere to various Group policies that reflect the values and corporate culture of CLP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Senior Director - GIA has the right to consult the Audit & Risk Committee without reference to management.\n\n## Independent Auditor\n\nThe Group engages PwC (Certified Public Accountants and Registered Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor) as our external independent auditor and we regard their independence as a fundamental governance principle.\n\nHow the Group ensures the independence of the external auditor:\n\n- \uf09e The lead audit partner of PwC is subject to rotation every seven years (as per The International Federation of Accountants rules on independence of external auditors).\n- \uf09e The current lead audit partner, after having served the Company's statutory audits in that capacity since the 2014 financial year-end audit, will complete his seven years of service as the lead audit partner after the 2020 financial year-end audit. He will be replaced by a new lead audit partner who has not had any prior involvement in the CLP Group audit.\n- \uf09e PwC is required to give an annual confirmation on their independence.\n- \uf09e The Audit & Risk Committee will assess PwC's independence in considering their re-appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, PwC will not be engaged to perform non-audit work unless the non-audit work meets the criteria suggested in the Listing Rules and has been pre-approved by the Audit & Risk Committee or its delegates. There must be clear efficiencies and value-added benefits to CLP from the work being undertaken by PwC, with no adverse effect on the independence of their audit work, or the perception of such independence.\n\nDuring the year, PwC provided the following audit and permissible audit related and non-audit services to the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Audit                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 39          | 39          |\n| Permissible audit related and non- audit services                                                                                                                                                                   |             |             |\n| Audit related services   (including Sustainability                                                                                                                                                                  |             |             |\n| Report assurance, Continuing  Connected Transactions limited  assurance, limited assurance  over EnergyAustralia's  regulatory reviews and  reporting, audits of CLP's  provident funds and auditor's  attestation) | 10          | 7           |\n| Non-audit services                                                                                                                                                                                                  |             |             |\n| (including tax advisory and  other services)                                                                                                                                                                        | 1           | 2           |\n| Total                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 50          | 48          |\n\n(For these purposes, permissible audit related and non-audit services include any entity under common control, ownership or management with PwC or any entity that a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information would reasonably conclude as part of the audit firm nationally or internationally.)\n\nThe fees of PwC and other non-principal external auditors are shown in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, the fees for permissible audit related and non-audit services accounted for 20% and 2% of the total fees respectively.\n\n## Other Stakeholders\n\nGood governance requires due regard to the impact of business decisions (including environmental impact), both on shareholders and on other key stakeholders.

        "page_content": "## Risk Management and Internal Control Systems\n\nEffective risk management and internal control systems help the organisation anticipate its risk exposure, put controls in place to counter threats, and effectively pursue the set objectives. They are therefore an essential part of an organisation's operation and governance processes. This section explains (and contains cross references) the key features of our risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Risk Management Framework\n\nCLP's overall risk management framework is overseen by, and is the responsibility of, the Board, through its Audit & Risk Committee, and comprises four key elements.\n\n## Risk Management Philosophy\n\nCLP recognises that risk management is the responsibility of everyone within CLP and thus it is integrated into the business and decision-making process.\n\n## Risk Governance Structure\n\nClear roles and responsibilities are assigned to multiple layers within the organisation. This structure facilitates risk identification and escalation.\n\n## Risk Management Process\n\nThrough an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process, which enables risks identification and prioritisation throughout the Group, management maintains an open and effective communication channel to enable the timely escalation of material risk and adequate supervision of risk mitigation.\n\nThe way we manage risk is set out in the Risk Management Report on page 146.\n\n## Internal Control Framework\n\nCLP structure of internal control is based on the internationally recognised COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) 2013 integrated framework. Our internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material loss or misstatement. CLP Corporate Governance Structure is consistent with our Risk Governance Structure - see page 147.\n\nThe Board of Directors , through the Audit & Risk Committee 's review, is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness. The reviews cover management's assessment on the key business operations, changes in material risks, internal controls, audit and compliance issues.\n\nGIA provides independent assurance to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls for CLP. They adopt a risk-based approach, concentrating on areas with significant risks or where significant changes have been\n\nmade. GIA is equipped with well qualified and capable staff with access to all the data and operations of the Group.\n\nThe CEO and the Group Executive Committee have primary accountability to the Board in ensuring that robust risk management and internal control systems are established and functioning effectively. Such responsibility is discharged by exercising structured and continuous monitoring and oversight across the Group.\n\nGroup Functions establish relevant group-wide policies and procedures, oversee the risk and control activities of Business Units relevant to their respective functions.\n\nControl Owners (Business Units, Functional Units and individuals) are primarily responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of risk management and internal control systems within his / her own area of responsibility. These systems are supported by welldefined policies and procedures, properly established and communicated, which reflect the values and corporate culture of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Appetite\n\nThe nature and extent of the risks that the Group is willing to undertake in pursuit of its strategic and business objectives.",

Material risks and associated controls, including mitigation when needed, are continually reviewed and updated. The Board is regularly informed of significant risks that may have an impact on CLP's performance. Regular management briefings and 'deep dive' presentations are presented to the Audit & Risk Committee, as set out in the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 158.\n\nOur internal control review process continues to follow the substance of the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on internal controls over financial statements. Three times a year, management provides internal control review updates to the Audit & Risk Committee which cover the scoping of significant processes and controls, assessment on controls design and operating effectiveness. High risk key controls are required to be tested annually by management while lower risk key controls are tested on rotational basis.

This dialogue offers an opportunity for management to identify and respond to emerging risks early on, voice risk concerns, share risk insights, and seek risk management guidance.\n- \uf09e Group Risk Management facilitates the review of emerging risks by compiling relevant information from both internal and external sources.\n- \uf09e Emerging risks that are identified and considered material are further assessed and monitored by relevant business units or Group Functions.\n\n## Bottom-up Process\n\n- \uf09e CLP's business units and Group Functions are required to submit their lists of material risks identified through their risk management process to Group Risk Management on a quarterly basis.\n- \uf09e Through a diligent process of aggregation, filtering, prioritising, and consultation, Group Risk Management compiles a Quarterly Group Risk Management Report for review and discussion by the Group Executive Committee.\n- \uf09e Upon approval, the report is submitted to the Audit & Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. 'Deep dive' presentations on selected risks are presented to the Audit & Risk Committee for more detailed review.\n\n## Risk Review Process for Investment Decisions\n\n- \uf09e CLP adopts a multi-gated system of periodic project appraisals during development and investment cycles.\n- \uf09e CLP requires an independent, multi-disciplinary review of any investment proposal. Independent risk appraisal by Group Risk Management is part of the investment review process.\n- \uf09e Group Risk Management ensures a detailed project risk assessment is carried out for each investment project. Detailed checklists and worksheets are used to identify risks and mitigations and assess risk levels. Material risks and associated mitigations are highlighted and discussed at the Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO.\n\n## Risk Management Integrated with Internal Control Systems\n\n- \uf09e Risk management is closely linked to CLP's Integrated Framework of Internal Control. Key controls are subject to testing in order to assess their effectiveness. Details on Internal Control are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 143 to 144.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP identifies, assesses, and manages climate change risks alongside all other types of risk as an integral part of its Group-wide Risk Management Framework.\n\nAccording to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), climate change risks can be classified into two major categories:\n\n- \uf09e Transition Risks - Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change, and may pose varying levels of financial impacts as well as reputational risk to the Group.\n- \uf09e Physical Risks - Physical risks resulting from climate change can be event-driven (acute) or longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns, causing direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption.\n\nCLP recognises the wide-ranging implications of climate change and considers climate change risks a combination of standalone risks and cross-cutting risk drivers of other material risks. As shown in CLP's toptier risk tables on pages 152 to 157, climate change transition risk and physical risk have been identified as standalone risks and catergorised under Regulatory Risk and Operational Risk respectively. In addition, the tables illustrate other material risks with either Transition or Physical risk drivers, or both.\n\nAs with other material risks, CLP adopts the same set of risk profiling criteria in assessing the climate change risks. Climate change risks are managed across the Group according to CLP's risk governance structure and risk management process, with management oversight and assurance provided to the Board. In addition, Climate Vision 2050 is integrated into CLP's strategies on asset portfolio management, guiding the Group in managing climate-related risks as well as opportunities.\n\nAdditional references: Natural Capital on pages 102 - 103, 2020 Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This brought the Committee back to a four-member Committee which was the size of the Committee before Mr Vernon Moore retired from the Board and the Committee.\n\n## A Risk-Focused Agenda in a Challenging Year\n\nWith the various challenges in a turbulent year, the Committee spent considerable time in understanding, analysing and monitoring the key risks that faced the Group; a highlight of these is set out below.\n\nCOVID-19 - The Committee first considered the impact of COVID-19 in the context of the closing process of the financial statements for the financial year ended 2019. As the pandemic situation continued in 2020, COVID-19 was regarded as a standalone risk item for the CLP Group on issues such as health, supply chain, workforce availability, regulatory compliance, financial position and tariff and debt collection. Throughout 2020 as the pandemic situation developed, the Committee examined contemporaneously the different and varying effects of the pandemic on the Group.\n\nGeo-political situation - During the course of 2020, the geo-political tensions had heightened and this led to sanctions and restrictions being imposed against China and related interests. The Committee assessed the impact of the international sanctions risk concerning the Group's business units, in particular, Hong Kong, China and India.\n\nBushfires in Australia - In the Australian summer of 2019/2020, the eastern states of Australia were hit by widespread devastating bushfires. Part of the bushfires affected the nearby area of EnergyAustralia's Mount Piper power plant where the operations were threatened. Given the seriousness of the bushfires, the Committee requested management to provide a detailed briefing on the bushfires. The Committee assessed the potential impact of the bushfires on the EnergyAustralia's business with particular attention on the operation of the power plant and EnergyAustralia's customers.\n\nCybersecurity - The Committee had undertaken a regular deep dive examination into the topic of cybersecurity in recent years. With cybersecurity being kept at a high risk rating, the Committee requested that the periodic deep dive examination should continue and that a dashboard report on various key indicators should be presented to the Committee. The Committee was particularly focused in understanding and monitoring the progress on various cybersecurity initiatives.\n\nThe above topics were analysed by the Committee holistically and enabled the Committee Members to understand the issues, challenges and risks faced by the Group from both an operational perspective and a financial reporting perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

None of the 25 breaches in 2020 were material to the Group's financial statements or overall operations. The breaches were mainly related to issues of workplace behaviour and individuals' ethics and integrity. Two of the reported Code of Conduct violations involved employees at the grade level of senior manager and above.\n\nThe Committee analysed the 2019 findings on ethics and controls commitment survey for the employees. In comparison with previous year's findings, the ratings of Australia and Hong Kong were improving slightly, China was quite steady, and India was on a slight upward trend. There was an added focus on the company culture in the survey.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the 2020 results on the ethics and controls commitment survey for the Senior Management which is conducted every three years. The overall rating of the survey results was similar to the last survey in 2017, with China having slightly better results and the other regions remained relatively steady.\n\n## Accountability\n\nThe Committee's primary responsibilities include:\n\n- \uf09e satisfying itself that good accounting, audit principles, risk management, internal controls and ethical practices are applied on a consistent basis throughout the CLP Group (without limiting the primary responsibilities of all the business unit managers throughout the Group);\n- \uf09e assuring adequate risk management and internal control systems are in place and followed and where deficiencies are found, appropriate remedial actions are taken in a timely manner;\n- \uf09e assuring appropriate accounting principles and reporting practices are followed;\n- \uf09e performing the corporate governance duties described further in this Report and fulfilling the functions conferred on the Committee by the CLP Code;\n- \uf09e satisfying itself that the scope and direction of external and internal auditing are adequate; and\n- \uf09e reviewing and making sure the assurance of the sustainability data in the Sustainability Report is appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee is accountable to the Board. The Chairman reports to the Board at the Board meetings in which the full year and half year financial statements are considered and this would cover key issues considered by the Committee in the course of the review of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference follow international best practice and they also comply with the HKICPA's 'A Guide for Effective Audit Committees' and the Stock Exchange Code.

The expert session was complemented by management's briefing on the broader climate action landscape and the Committee and management had an open dialogue on the directional approach that CLP should be taking in line with the Climate Vision 2050 and the updating of CLP's decarbonisation targets.\n\nThe Committee considered how CLP could transform into a Utility of the Future and spent a considerable amount of time on discussing and deliberating on digitalisation, innovation and climate change-related issues. The Committee Members had a constructive exchange with members of the Innovation Team on a number of topics covering potential business opportunities in the areas of energy-related services and the critical success factors for developing data centres.\n\nIn the innovation and digitalisation session, management provided the Committee with an overview of the impact of digitalisation and the associated changing competitive landscape along with a review of the actions being taken and investments made by CLP in this area.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of how the Committee spent its time during the Period:\n\n|                                                                       | Feb   | 2020 Oct   | Nov   | 2021 Feb   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|\n| Sustainability Matters - risks, opportunities and emerging  issues    |       |            |       |            |\n| Sustainability Reporting / Indices performance                        |       |            |       |            |\n| Health, Safety, Security and Environment                              |       |            |       |            |\n| Community, Charitable and Environmental Partnerships and  Initiatives |       |            |       |            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Allen as the new Chairman following the retirement of Mr Vincent Cheng, the former HR&RC Chairman, at the conclusion of the 2020 AGM.\n\nThe HR&RC also welcomed the appointment of Mrs Fanny Law and Ms May Tan as new Members in January 2020.\n\n## Succession Planning\n\nBased on the 2019 External Board Review's recommendations, the Committee spent considerable effort and time in reviewing and helping shape management's plan to refresh the approach to succession planning. The Committee paid particular attention to understand the roles and attributes that are required for CLP's future success and gained deeper insights into the organisation's succession readiness. The Committee enhanced its understanding of management efforts in reinforcing the organisation's culture and the wider workforce planning in transitioning CLP into the Utility of the Future.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of how the Committee spent its time during the Period:\n\n|                                                              | Feb   | 2020 Jul   | Nov   | 2021 Feb   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|\n| Performance and Remuneration Review                          |       |            |       |            |\n| Succession Planning and Organisation Capability  Development |       |            |       |            |\n| Staff Policies and Benefits                                  |       |            |       |            |\n| Governance                                                   |       |            |       |            |\n\n## Responsibilities and Summary of Work Done\n\nThe HR&RC considers major human resources and pay issues. It also provides forward guidance on EnergyAustralia's remuneration policy through interactions between the HR&RC and the EnergyAustralia Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn addition to the Highlights of the Committee's Work for the Period, the table below explains the work carried out by the HR&RC and how it discharged its responsibilities for the Period.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\n## Performance and Remuneration Review\n\nRemuneration review\n\nThe Committee scrutinised and approved:\n\n- \uf09e Group performance for 2019 and 2020 and Group targets for 2020 and 2021;\n- \uf09e 2019 and 2020 organisation performance for CLP Power Hong Kong, CLP India and China, and targets for 2020 and 2021;\n- \uf09e Base pay for 2020 and 2021 for Hong Kong payroll staff, CLP India and China;\n- \uf09e CEO's remuneration; and\n- \uf09e Remuneration of direct reports to the CEO, including annual incentive payments for 2019 and 2020 and pay review for 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed a report on the peer groups used for executive remuneration benchmarking and approved changes to these peer groups to reflect recent developments in the international utilities sector including the shift to renewables and energy management solutions and shifts within Hong Kong-based industrials.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fees are subject to a formal independent review undertaken no less frequently than every three years. Those fees were most recently reviewed at the beginning of 2019 (the 2019 Review). The methodology adopted in the 2019 Review is the same as that used in the previous reviews and as explained to shareholders in the CLP Code, save for (i) maintaining the fees for the Finance & General Committee unchanged although the indicative fees under the methodology showed slight reduction in fees; and (ii) applying our standard review methodology for determining the fees for the Nomination Committee instead of a nominal fee which resulted in a modest increase in absolute dollar value.\n\nCLP's approach goes beyond that required by law or regulation in Hong Kong or the provisions of the Stock Exchange Code. Further to CLP's commitment to the adoption of a transparent methodology for determining Non-executive Directors' remuneration, the 2019 Review and the opinion of J.S. Gale & Co on that 2019 Review are placed on CLP's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Higher level of fees was paid to Chairmen of the Board and Board Committees and the Vice Chairman of the Board as indicated by (C) and (VC) respectively. Executive Directors and management serving on the Board and Board Committees are not entitled to any Directors' fees.\n\nDespite an increase in the level of Non-executive Directors' fees which took effect on 7 May 2020, there was a small decrease in total Directors' fees compared to 2019, primarily due to the retirement of Directors in May 2020 and the appointment of new Directors in October 2020.\n\n| In HK$                              | Board         |         | Audit & Risk   Committee   | Nomination   Committee   | Finance &   General   Committee   | HR&RC        | Provident &   Retirement   Fund   Committee   | Sustainability   Committee   | Total  2020   | Total  2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Non-executive Directors             |               |         |                            |                          |                                   |              |                                               |                              |               |               |\n| The Hon Sir Michael Kadoorie        | 830,877  (C)  | -       |                            | 18,053                   | - -                               |              | -                                             | -                            | 848,930       | 803,691       |\n| Mr William Mocatta  1               | 652,798  (VC) | -       |                            | -                        | 449,900  (C)                      | 81,401       | 14,000  (C)                                   | -                            | 1,198,099     | 1,155,216     |\n| Mr J.

        "page_content": "## Change of Remuneration - Executive Directors and Senior Management (Audited)\n\nDetails of the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards for the 12 months ended 31 December 2020 are set out in the tables on page 182 (Executive Directors) and pages 189 and 190 (Senior Management).\n\nThe amounts disclosed consist of remuneration accrued or paid for service in 2020 and, for the annual and long-term incentives, service and performance in previous years.\n\nThe amounts disclosed are the amounts recognised in the financial year for accounting purposes, which do not necessarily reflect the cash actually received by the individual. Where payments are made to the individual over more than one financial year, this is explained in the notes.\n\nTo provide a clear picture of remuneration, amounts are shown as recurring or non-recurring items. Recurring items are the normal annual remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management, whilst non-recurring items relate primarily to the appointment or termination of Executive Directors and Senior Management.\n\nIn the tables on page 182 and pages 189 and 190 the 'Total Remuneration' column for 2020 includes the following recurring items:\n\n- (i) base compensation, allowances & benefits paid;\n- (ii) 2020 annual incentive accrued based on previous year's Company performance and the 2019 annual incentive adjustment. The adjustment is the difference between the actual annual incentive paid in 2020 for 2019 performance and the annual incentive accrual for 2019;\n- (iii)  the 2017 long-term incentive award paid in January 2020 when the vesting conditions were satisfied (the comparative figures are the long-term incentive for 2016 paid in 2019). Approximately 24% of the increase in the value of the phantom shares portion of 2017 long-term incentive payments resulted from the change in CLP Holdings' share price between 2017 and 2019, with dividends reinvested; and\n- (iv)  provident fund contribution made.\n\nThe 'Other Payments' column includes the following non-recurring items:\n\n- (i) relocation payments for newly hired Senior Management.\n\n## Performance Outcomes for the Year\n\nIn considering performance outcomes against the balanced scorecard of measures set for the 2020 performance year, the Committee reviewed progress made against a mix of financial, operational, safety, environmental, internal control and objectives reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability.\n\nIn 2019, the Committee awarded a lower performance outcome than in prior years, reflecting the tragic fatality of a contract staff member and the need to improve operational safety and project delivery. 2020 brought unprecedented external challenges. Notwithstanding these challenges, financial and operational performance was resilient, with reliable operations maintained. There were no fatalities and project safety performance and delivery was improved. Management of critical risks was strengthened, and progress was maintained on major decarbonisation and digitalisation projects and initiatives underpinning growth. Having considered these outcomes, the Committee decided to award a performance outcome in line with average outcomes in the recent years prior to 2019.\n\nThe Committee considers that this outcome appropriately aligns management remuneration with shareholder outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Policy is designed to be sustainable, aligned with shareholders and simple . Delivery of a highly-reliable supply of electricity today together with transforming our business into a Utility of the Future, is a commitment that requires long-term stewardship and a sustainable approach to remuneration. Ensuring fairness and internal equity; encouraging and rewarding appropriate behaviour while discouraging inappropriate behaviour; and balanced judgement of short- and long-term performance, aligned with shareholder outcomes, underpin this approach.\n\nFairness and internal equity are key elements of our approach. Depending on individual roles, Senior Management is responsible for a mix of businesses: a vertically-integrated regulated business in Hong Kong, a customer-focused energy business in Australia, and an independent power producer in Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. We seek to fairly recognise the extent of Senior Management's assigned job responsibilities and capabilities demonstrated, and to ensure that our remuneration attracts, retains and motivates a diverse, high-performing executive team. The structure of our executive remuneration packages is assessed in terms of appropriateness to the role, and with reference to both local and international markets. We emphasise strong management development, succession planning and job mobility to fill vacancies for executive positions as we believe that a long-term career with the Group is an important asset to CLP. Consequently, external competitiveness of remuneration must be balanced with internal equity. While Senior Management pay reflects the scale and scope of their responsibilities, our policy is designed to ensure that remuneration structure and outcomes are aligned with our wider workforce, whose skills, values and commitment are essential to our success, and HR&RC decisions on executive pay outcomes are taken in the context of wider workforce considerations.\n\nSenior Management pay is structured to seek to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance targets and is governed by and compliant with relevant regulatory frameworks. In determining incentive payments and Total Remuneration, the HR&RC considers and balances a broad range of performance indicators including financial (e.g., long-term growth in the share price and dividends), operational, safety, environmental, social, business sustainability (including responding to climate change), governance and compliance-related factors linked to CLP's strategy. Decisions on pay reflect considerations of both what was achieved and how it was achieved. The determination of performance outcomes is not formulaic, as the HR&RC believes that their overriding responsibility to exercise judgement and responsibility, ensuring alignment between shareholders and management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The HR&RC strives to keep remuneration arrangements simple, clear and consistent to enable effective stakeholder scrutiny. We have maintained our Remuneration Policy in line with prior years in part on the belief that the current arrangements remain fit for purpose, are embedded into our business and are well-understood both internally and externally. Mindful of continuing external interest and debate on executive pay, we have reshaped the structure of our reporting on Remuneration Policy in order that the links between policy, strategy and performance are more clearly and simply articulated.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Executive Directors and Senior Management (excluding Managing Director - EnergyAustralia)\n\nThe illustration below summarises policy design and operation for members of Senior Management. The policy is set out in full on pages 184 to 188.

        "page_content": "## Board's Statement on ESG\n\nThe following is a statement from the Board of Directors explaining the Board's oversight of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues and how CLP approaches the management of ESG issues.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nThe CLP Board has overall responsibility for CLP's ESG strategy and reporting, and sustainability is integrated into our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. As one of the Board Committees, the Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues. In 2020, the Committee's role has been strengthened with a further focus on the impact of longer-term sustainability issues on the Group's strategy. The Sustainability Committee is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, retains oversight of material risks and assurance of the reported sustainability data. For further details on the governance structure, please see the section 'CLP's Approach to ESG Reporting' in the Corporate Governance Report.\n\n## How does CLP approach and manage material ESG issues?\n\nOur current approach in managing our material ESG issues is centred around identifying the most important ESG topics facing the Group, those that are strategic to our business in the medium- to long-term.\n\nAn extensive materiality assessment based on a megatrends analysis was conducted in 2018 and the following material ESG topics were identified: responding to climate change; harnessing the power of technology; reinforcing cyber resilience and data privacy; and building an agile, inclusive and sustainable workforce. In 2019, the assessment was conducted in conjunction with our external stakeholders and the results were validated by them.\n\nFor 2020, given the various unprecedented challenges from COVID-19, geo-political tensions and other key developments throughout the year, we examined the identified material ESG topics and reaffirmed that these remain valid, current and relevant to CLP. The assessment process was conducted by management with active executive-level participation. These topics were then presented to the Sustainability Committee for their analysis and endorsement. For further details on how other ESG issues are addressed by the Sustainability Committee, please see the Sustainability Committee Report.\n\n## Climate Vision 2050\n\nClimate change remains one of the material topics and our Climate Vision 2050 publication is a pledge from CLP on our climate action which sets out clear climate-related targets for the Group. These commitments guide the Group in managing our climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nWe have achieved the 2020 carbon intensity targets set out in our Climate Vision 2050, but we acknowledge that the demand for tougher climate action will only get stronger. Under our Climate Vision 2050, we have committed to strengthening our decarbonisation targets at least every five years and with the next review planned to be undertaken in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, through the oversight of the Sustainability Committee, we commenced the preparations for a review of our climate targets. The Committee had a dedicated session and undertook a comprehensive review of CLP's progress on climate action. In addition to reviewing the progress against the targets that we have set for ourselves, the Committee learned from a leading international expert as to how CLP's progress is perceived from an external perspective.\n\nFor the coming review of our climate targets, we will continue to track the Group's progress against the Science Based Targets initiative* (SBTi) to ensure that CLP will be able to stay on course to accelerate its decarbonisation trajectory.\n\nWe continue to strengthen our disclosures in line with the TCFD recommendations in our Sustainability Report and our total Scope 3 GHG emissions figure for 2020 was assured. This is part of our ongoing efforts to better manage our supply chain and engage our stakeholders to understand how we can further reduce these emissions. We also focused on enhancing climaterelated risk assessment and developing bespoke climate scenarios for the markets where we operate. We believe that this will greatly assist us in analysing and managing the resilience of our Climate Vision 2050.\n\nIn 2020, we saw how the challenges of COVID-19 have further highlighted the importance of ESG issues and this has affirmed and reinforced our long-term commitment to sustainable business practices.\n\n- * A globally-recognised framework backed by the United Nations Global Compact and other international organisations.

Purchases from the Group's five largest suppliers, in aggregate, accounted for 52.32% of the Group's total purchases during the year and a breakdown of the purchases (as a percentage of the Group's total purchases) from each of the five largest suppliers are set out below in descending order:\n\n- 1 13.50% from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in which the Group has no economic interest. AEMO is the administrator and operator of the Australian energy market, from whom electricity is bought to supply EnergyAustralia group customers and to whom electricity is sold from EnergyAustralia group generators (as market participants, EnergyAustralia group entities are members of AEMO but do not hold any economic interest in AEMO).\n- 2 12.67% from Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company, Limited (GNPJVC) which is 25% owned by the Group. GNPJVC owns Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS), and CLP Power Hong Kong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the largest electricity supplier in Hong Kong, purchases 80% of GNPS's output for supply of electricity to its customers in Hong Kong.\n- 3 11.10% from PetroChina International Guangdong Co., Ltd. (PCIGD) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from PCIGD for its electricity generation.\n- 4 9.32% from CNOOC China Limited (CNOOC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from CNOOC for its electricity generation.\n- 5 5.73% from Ausgrid Operator Partnership (Ausgrid) in which the Group has no interest. EnergyAustralia pays the distribution charges to Ausgrid which owns and operates the electricity distribution network that provides services to customers located in Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter regions of NSW.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, none of the Directors, their close associates or substantial shareholders of the Company had any interest in those suppliers other than their indirect interests in GNPJVC, which interests arose from the Group's interest in GNPJVC and the Group's approximate 0.28% shareholding interest in CGN Power Co., Ltd. (the listed entity of which GNPJVC is a subsidiary).",

The project level caps of the CCTs for 2020 set out in the table on pages 196 to 205 are for reference only and were used to derive the annual aggregate cap of HK$1,600 million.\n\nOther details of the CCTs, which are required to be disclosed pursuant to Rules 14A.49 and 14A.71 of the Listing Rules, are also set out in the same table. The transaction consideration for 2020, unless otherwise stated, represented the actual transaction values of the relevant CCTs in the full twelve months of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this objective, it is always our aim to present the financial information of CLP as clearly and concisely as possible. This overview helps you understand how information is organised and presented in our financial statements. Hopefully, this will bring you a more insightful reading experience.\n\n## Accounting Mini-series\n\nWe believe that understanding financial statements is a right, not a privilege. To help those unfamiliar with accounting terms read our financial statements, we have developed an Accounting Mini-series to explain topical and difficult accounting concepts in a way that is easier to understand. A number of topics have been discussed since 2007, the content of which can be found in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our accounting mini-series\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFinancial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS). You do not need to be familiar with all the requirements of HKFRS because the accounting policies which are significant and relevant to the Group are disclosed in the financial statements. The disclosures include specific principles and procedures selected and applied by management in preparing the financial statements, as well as the methods, measurement basis and procedures to account for the transactions.\n\nLook for purple gradient boxes\n\n## Tips & Hints\n\nTips & Hints are our initiatives to facilitate you to understand the content of a particular disclosure or complicated accounting concepts or terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for bell boxes\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n## Essential Financial Statements\n\nFinancial statements start with summaries of the financial position, performance and changes in resources of the Group. These summaries are presented in three essential financial statements with different objectives as shown in the diagram.\n\nThe relationships between these statements and the interactions with the Group's stakeholders are set out in our website.\n\n## Statement of Financial Position\n\nA snapshot taken at a point in time, of all the assets the company owns and all the claims against those assets\n\nFinancial performance measured by recording the flow of resources over a period of time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Statement of Cash Flows\n\nWhere a company gets its cash and how it spends it\n\nCash\n\nInflow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nManagement makes judgements and estimates in preparing the financial statements, some of which will have a significant effect on the reported results and financial position. HKAS 1 specifies that an entity shall disclose (1) the key judgements that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised; and (2) the assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at period end that have a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year. You should pay attention to our disclosures under 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' which help you assess CLP's financial position and performance and understand the sensitivities to changes in assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for light purple boxes\n\nStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These transactions may take many forms, from acquisition or combination of target companies to acquisition of target assets. Interestingly, the accounting treatment of a merger or acquisition does not depend on the legal form, but whether the transaction falls into 'business' as defined in the accounting context. As CLP also makes use of mergers and acquisitions to keep growing its business, we want to take this opportunity to introduce the new accounting definition of business and its application. Readers interested in the acquisition accounting under business combination can visit the Accounting Miniseries in our website where we have discussed this topic in detail in the past.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe definition of business is used in determining whether a transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or as a business combination. This distinction is important because the accounting for an asset acquisition significantly differs in certain respects from the accounting for a business combination. Business combinations require the assets acquired to be recognised at fair value with goodwill or gains from bargain purchase recognised. However, asset acquisitions allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis among the assets and no goodwill or gain is recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe application of the definition of business was a very complicated issue in the past, which also resulted in many transactions qualifying as business combinations. The new definition of business based on the HKFRS 3 (revised) does not change\n\nthe accounting method for business combinations nor asset acquisitions. Instead, it provides a new and narrower definition of business, which will likely result in fewer acquired sets of assets to be identified as businesses.\n\n## Key Account ing Implicat ions\n\n| Business Combinations                                                               |                                                                  | Asset Acquisitions                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair valued                                                                         | Identified assets  (tangible and intangible)  and liabilities    | Purchase price allocated  based on relative fair value |\n| Expensed as incurred                                                                | Transaction costs                                                | Capitalised as part of the purchase price              |\n| Recognised                                                                          | Goodwill                                                         | Not recognised                                         |\n| Recognised (occur in occasion)                                                      | Bargain purchase                                                 | Not recognised                                         |\n| Recognised all resulting  deferred tax liabilities and  certain deferred tax assets | Deferred tax due to  differences from  original carrying amounts | Exempted to recognise                                  |\n\nMergers and Acquisitions are a way to keep growing a business while achieving instant results.",

Despite most businesses having outputs, outputs are not necessary for an integrated set of assets and activities to qualify under the definition of business, such as early-stage companies that have not generated revenue.\n\n## Elements\n\nAn economic resource that creates outputs, or has the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs\n\n- \uf09e Tangible fixed assets\n- \uf09e Right-of-use assets\n- \uf09e Intangible assets\n- \uf09e Intellectual property\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInputs\n\nOutputs\n\nA system that when applied to an input, creates or has an ability to contribute to the creation of outputs\n\nProcesses of:\n\n- \uf09e strategic management\n- \uf09e operation\n- \uf09e resource management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProcesses\n\n## Three Key Tests to Identify a Business\n\nTo determine if the acquired set of activities and assets is a business, three key tests were introduced under the new business definition. The first test is the concentration test, which is an optional simplified assessment. If the condition under the concentration test is met, a company can immediately reach the conclusion that the transaction is an asset acquisition. If the test is not met , the entity should go through the other two tests, which focus on assessing the existence of relevant skilled workforce and substantive processes.\n\n## Concentration Test\n\nIs substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired concentrated in a single (or group of similar) identifiable asset(s)?\n\n## Workforce Test\n\nIs there a workforce with skills that are critical for producing or developing into outputs?\n\n## The Concentration Test\n\nThe concentration test is a newly added optional test that permits a simplified assessment for determining when a set of activities and assets is not a business.

When substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set of activities and assets would not be considered a business. This test serves as a fast track to determine either an asset acquisition or a business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApplying the concentration test may save a lot of work; the most critical and complicated step of the test counts on the identification of the assets acquired\n\nThe result of applying inputs and processes that provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income or other income from ordinary activities\n\n- \uf09e Revenue\n- \uf09e Dividend\n- \uf09e Interest income",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Determining All Identifiable Assets\n\nIn order to conduct the concentration test, all assets acquired shall first be identified. This asset identification would apply the same basis that is used for identifying assets recognised in a business combination. The assets identified may be a single asset or a group of similar assets.\n\nTangible assets and intangible assets (e.g. a nuclear power plant and a licence to operate it) that are combined for recognition in a business combination would also be considered as a single identifiable asset for the purposes of the concentration test.\n\nIdentify\n\nIdentify asset or group of assets that would be recognised as a single identif iable asset in a business combination\n\nOnce the acquired assets are clearly identified, the rest of the concentration test should be simple and straight forward\n\nCombine\n\nCombine any tangible asset which is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and used separately from, another tangible asset\n\nCombine assets that have similar nature and have similar risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the assets\n\nTest\n\nAssets are clearly identif ied for the concentration test\n\n## Impact on CLP - Acquisition of Power Projects\n\nFor every power project acquisition, CLP shall determine whether the transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition by applying the definition of business. In the past, the application of the definition was sometimes ambiguous. When a transaction was accounted for as business combination, it may have resulted in the recognition of goodwill (usually because of the recognition of deferred tax liabilities), which was difficult to explain from a commercial perspective, especially when acquiring a single power plant project.\n\nCLP believes that the new business definition, which clarifies current vague areas, narrows down the number of transactions being identified as business, and at the same time coupled with the introduction of the concentration test, it provides a relief to companies by simplifying the assessment.\n\nUsually, a power project would come together with a power purchase agreement (PPA) or a transmission service agreement (TSA). When applying the concentration test, CLP needs to identify assets which are qualified to combine. CLP considers the infrastructure and the PPA or TSA with similar useful lives as a single asset. PPA or TSA is not recognised separately from the infrastructure as an intangible asset as it is more in the nature of an embedded operation licence to the power plant. Therefore, PPA or TSA together with the infrastructure are treated as a single identifiable asset when applying the concentration test.\n\nBelow are acquisitions which the new business definition has been applied during the year.\n\n| Timing of  Transaction   | Interest  Acquired   | Acquiree                                       | Asset Type         | Consideration                     | Key Assets  Identified             | Substantially  All of the  Fair Value  Concentrated?   | Conclusion  of the  Concentration  Test   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| March 2020               | 100%                 | Cleansolar  Renewable  Energy Private  Limited | 30 MW   Solar Farm | HK$112 million  (Rs1,084 million) | Solar plant   (with PPA  embedded) | Yes                                                    | Asset   acquisition                       |\n| April 2020               | 100%                 | Divine Solren   Private Limited                | 50 MW   Solar Farm | HK$126 million  (Rs1,245 million) | Solar plant   (with PPA  embedded) | Yes                                                    | Asset   acquisition                       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenues are measured on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and include an estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group totalled HK$3,478 million as at 31 December 2020.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power Hong Kong) calculates unbilled retail revenue using estimates including: consumption quantity based on the electricity sent-out adjusted by a loss factor, the pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, the weather and certain other factors.\n\nEnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) calculates unbilled retail revenue based on the electricity purchased and the applicable tariffs for the mass market customer segment, as well as the actual meter readings and the contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because the calculation of unbilled retail revenue involves a high degree of estimation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur procedures in relation to unbilled retail revenue included:\n\n- Understanding the estimates made relating to volumes, loss factors and tariffs used in determining the level of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Obtaining an understanding of and testing the key controls in place to determine the estimate of unbilled retail revenue for both CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Assessing the reasonableness of estimates by comparing them against historical trends and against the weighted average tariff for prices;\n- Testing the volume of electricity sent-out by CLP Power Hong Kong to supporting information; and\n- Testing the volume of electricity purchased by EnergyAustralia from the wholesale electricity market to the underlying Australian Energy Market Operator invoices on a sample basis and reconciling the total purchase volumes to revenue volumes.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's unbilled retail revenue amount is supported by the available evidence.",

This includes fixed assets and leasehold land relating to CLP Power Hong Kong and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (together the SoC Companies) (SoC fixed assets) which are the base used in the calculation of the permitted return under the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement.\n\nThe annual permitted return is 8% of the SoC Companies' average net fixed assets. If the gross tariff revenue in a period is less than or exceeds the total of the SoC operating costs, the permitted return and the taxation charges, such deficiency shall be deducted from, or such excess shall be added to, the Tariff Stabilisation Fund (TSF). In any period, the amount of deduction from or addition to the TSF is recognised as a revenue adjustment to the extent that the return and charges under the SoC are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the significance of the balance. The accuracy of SoC fixed asset additions, disposals and depreciation charges is important to ensure the SoC fixed asset balance is appropriate and the SoC permitted return is calculated correctly.\n\nOur procedures in relation to the Group's SoC fixed assets and the calculation of the SoC permitted return included:\n\n- Assessing the control environment and testing controls over SoC fixed assets additions, disposals and depreciation charges;\n- Testing the SoC fixed asset additions in the year to supporting evidence on a sample basis and assessing whether the items have been appropriately capitalised;\n- Validating the estimated useful lives of the SoC fixed assets for compliance with the SoC Agreement;\n- Testing depreciation charges by performing depreciation reasonableness tests;\n- Obtaining management's reconciliation of SoC fixed assets from the opening balance at the beginning of the year to the closing balance at the end of the year and reconciling this to the general ledger and supporting records;\n- Recalculating the SoC permitted return for the year; and\n- Recalculating the SoC adjustment to revenue for the year.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's SoC fixed asset accounting and the SoC permitted return calculation are supported by the available evidence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The offtakers for the Group's other generation businesses are mainly a small number of state grid operators. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nExpected credit losses in CLP Power Hong Kong are close to zero as the trade receivables are mostly secured by cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers and there is limited recent history of default.\n\nEnergyAustralia has trade receivables of HK$6,317 million at 31 December 2020 against which provisions for expected credit losses of HK$1,155 million are held. Management estimated the level of expected losses, by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying them to the receivables held at year end. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had receivables of HK$1,774 million relating to unpaid Renewable National Subsidies in its Mainland China business. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nCLP India Private Limited's (CLP India) renewable projects have trade receivables of HK$771 million of which HK$680 million are past due at 31 December 2020. Management has assessed the recoverability of past due amounts and concluded that the expected credit loss is close to zero as there is no recent history of default and continuous payments are received.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the magnitude of the trade receivables balance and the significant judgement applied in assessing the allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nOur procedures in relation to trade receivables included:\n\n- Testing controls over the billing and collection cycles in both CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the system calculated trade receivables ageing analysis used to assess the recoverability of receivables in CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the credit loss provisioning methodologies used by the Group;\n- Assessing the estimates used to determine the expected credit losses by considering cash collection performance against historical trends and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking factors included in the expected credit loss model;\n- Reviewing the accuracy of management's judgements by comparing historical provisions against actual write-offs;\n- Reviewing minutes of the boards of directors' meetings relating to the recoverability of trade receivables;\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in their determination that the expected credit loss on unpaid Renewable National Subsidies is close to zero, assessing the regulatory eligibility for the Group's projects and considering subsidies collected to-date; and\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in estimating the expected credit loss provision on trade receivables from the state grid operators of CLP India's renewable projects and corroborating with correspondence with the customers.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that management's assessments of the recoverability of trade receivables are supported by the available evidence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Estimating the amount and timing of the obligation requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nManagement's key asset retirement obligations (AROs) judgements are as follows:\n\n- The Group's ARO provision of HK$2,704 million mainly relates to land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets in Australia. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives.\n- CLP Power Hong Kong expects that its transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers and considers it remote that the network will be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore, AROs have not been recognised for transmission and distribution assets.\n- CAPCO will retire the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak A Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Management considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered by the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2020.\n- No provision for AROs has been recognised for the other generation units of CAPCO as the removal of CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units is possible and it is expected that should such obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because significant judgement is required in determining whether an ARO exists, and estimating the amount and timing of the obligation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur procedures in relation to AROs included:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policy;\n- Evaluating management's judgement that it is remote that the Hong Kong transmission and distribution network would be removed from the existing land sites; it is probable that the CPA units will be removed; and it is possible that CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units may be removed at some point in time in the future;\n- Assessing management's judgements as to whether a contractual or constructive obligation exists based on the respective power purchase agreements, lease agreements, local laws and regulations and past practice;\n- Assessing the independence, objectivity and competence of management's experts involved in respect of the future cost estimates for those assets where a provision has been recognised; and\n- Testing the appropriateness of management's estimates of future costs, the timing of payments and the discount rates where management has concluded that a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the ARO provisions are supported by the available evidence.",

        "page_content": "## Legal matters\n\nRefer to note 33 to the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of litigation, regulatory judgments and contractual disputes in the course of its normal operations. Provisions are recognised when management considers the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Where management considers it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nEnergyAustralia disposed of its entire interest in the Iona Gas Plant for a total consideration of A$1,780 million (HK$9,991 million) in December 2015. On 19 May 2017, EnergyAustralia received a Statement of Claim issued by Lochard Energy (Iona Operations Holding) Pty Ltd, the purchaser of the Iona Gas Plant, and certain related entities (together 'the plaintiff'), commencing formal legal proceedings seeking damages (the Iona legal claim).\n\nIn February 2021 the plaintiff has indicated that it now estimates: (a) its original claim to be in the range of A$457 million to A$1,449 million (approximately HK$2,719 million to HK$8,622 million); and (b) its alternative claim to be in the range of A$289 million to A$370 million (approximately HK$1,720 million to HK$2,202 million).\n\nEnergyAustralia has rejected the claim and is defending the legal proceedings. On the basis of currently available information, the Directors' view is that a material outflow of economic benefits is unlikely and no provision has been made in the Group Financial Statements.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because significant management judgement has been required, based on external legal advice to conclude that no provision is required in the Group Financial Statements in relation to the Iona legal claim.\n\nOur procedures on management's assessment of legal matters included:\n\n- Assessing the processes and entity level controls over identifying and monitoring legal matters;\n- Reviewing the Iona legal claim and other contractual claims;\n- Discussing with management any material developments and the latest status of the Iona legal claim;\n- Reviewing the minutes of boards of directors' meetings in respect of discussions relating to the Iona legal claim;\n- Obtaining written confirmation from external legal counsel on the status of the lona legal claim;\n- Reviewing written correspondence from both external and internal legal counsel documenting the status of the Iona legal claim;\n- Considering management's assessment of those legal matters that are not provided and / or disclosed as the probability of material outflow is considered to be not probable for provisioning or remote for disclosure; and\n- Reviewing the appropriateness of the Group's Financial Statement disclosures.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found management's measurement and disclosures are supported by the available evidence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises all of the information included in the annual report other than the Group Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Group Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Group Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Group Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit & Risk Committee for the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Group Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Group Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Group Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Group Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Group Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Group Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Group Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Group Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Group Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit & Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit & Risk Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit & Risk Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Group Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Sean William Tuckfield.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nCertified Public Accountants Hong Kong, 22 February 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Company, CLP Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap.622). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) and investment property which are carried at fair value.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are especially significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in relevant notes to the financial statements.\n\n## 2. Changes in Accounting Policies\n\n- (A)  Amendments of standards first time adopted in 2020\n\nThere have been a number of amendments to standards effective from 1 January 2020. Amendments which are applicable to the Group include:\n\n- The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2018\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKAS 8 Definition of Material\n- Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1 (the Reform Phase 1)\n\nIn addition, the Group has elected to early adopt the amendments to HKFRS 16 Leases on COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions on 1 January 2020. The amendments to HKFRS 16 allow the Group as a lessee not to account for COVID-19 directly related rent concessions as lease modifications when certain criteria are met. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020.\n\nThe Group applied these amendments for the first time in 2020. The impact of these amendments to the Group is immaterial. The Group does not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments.\n\nDetails on the impact of the Reform - Phase 1 can be found in paragraph (C) below.\n\n## (B)  Amendments to standards effective after 2020\n\nThe following amendments to standards, which may be applicable to the Group, have been issued and are effective after 2020. The Group has not elected to early adopt these amendments in 2020. The adoption of these amendments is not expected to have any significant impact on the results or the financial position of the Group.\n\n- Amendments to HKFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- Amendments to HKFRS 9 Fees in the '10 per cent' Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n- Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39, HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n- Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n- Amendments to HKAS 16 Proceeds before Intended Use\n- Amendments to HKAS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2. Changes in Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## (C)  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nA number of concerns were raised regarding the integrity and reliability of major financial market benchmarks, particularly interest rate benchmarks that are considered to play the most fundamental role in the global financial system. In 2014, the Financial Stability Board published a report setting out recommendations to reform some major benchmarks. The global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes the replacement of some Interbank offered rates (IBOR) with alternative benchmark rates, is referred to as the interest rate benchmark reform. The Reform aims to have these new rates based on liquid underlying market transactions, and not be dependent on submissions based on expert judgement.\n\nPhase 1 - The first phase of amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7, issued in November 2019, focuses on hedge accounting in the period before the Reform. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the Reform. The reliefs have the effect that the Reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2020 and are mandatory for all hedge relationships directly affected by the Reform.\n\nPhase 2 - The second phase of amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39, HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16, issued in October 2020, focuses on the financial reporting issues that may arise once an existing IBOR is replaced with an alternative interest rate. These amendments adjust specific accounting requirements relating to modifications of financial instruments and lease liabilities, other reliefs for hedge accounting and disclosures. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2021 with earlier application permitted. Hedging relationships previously discontinued solely because of changes resulting from the Reform will be reinstated if certain conditions are met.\n\nAs a result of an ongoing reform of the interest rate reference benchmark and its replacement with a risk-free alternative interest rate, the Group has established a project team to manage the transition for any of its contracts that could be affected.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's assessment of primary exposure to the Reform is related to the debt related cash flow and fair value hedges with cross currency interest rate swaps and / or interest rate swaps based on hedged risk of US dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). There remain many uncertainties associated with the Reform. It is not known when hedged items and hedging instruments will be amended to alternative interest rates, or how this will change the fair values and cash flows on these instruments, which cast uncertainty on the prospective assessment of the effectiveness of hedge accounting. Therefore, in assessing the hedge effectiveness requirements on a forward-looking basis, the Group has assumed that US dollar LIBOR interest rates are not altered by the Reform and has not discontinued the hedges. The Group will continue to apply the first phase of amendments to deal with pre-replacement issues until the end of uncertainty arising from the Reform with respect to the timing and amount of the underlying cash flow and fair value that the Group is exposed. The Group has assumed that this uncertainty will not end until the Group's contracts and hedge documentations that reference IBORs are amended to specify the date on which it will be replaced, the cash flows of the alternative interest rate and the relevant spread adjustment. This will, in part, be dependent on the introduction or amendment of fallback clauses which have yet to be added or amended to the Group's contracts and the negotiation with counterparties.\n\nThe outstanding interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps of an aggregate notional amount of HK$7,019 million equivalent are impacted by the Reform. 88% of these will mature after 2021 when US dollar LIBOR might be discontinued.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting\n\n## (A)  Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 December and include the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates on the basis set out in (B) below.\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n## (B)  Joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures / associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of postacquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which joint control or significant influence ceases. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.\n\n## (C)  Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control (as explained in (B) above), whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. When the Group undertakes its activities under a joint operation, the Group as a joint operator recognises its direct right to, and its share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation. They are incorporated in the financial statements under appropriate headings.\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received, and the reattribution of other comprehensive income to non-controlling interests are recognised in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Group.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are reclassified to profit or loss. Gains or losses on disposals are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consolidation and Equity Accounting (continued)\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests (continued)\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or associate is reduced, it is possible that joint control or significant influence is retained or a joint venture becomes an associate. As the Group continues to apply the equity method under both cases, the retained interest is not remeasured. However, a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income of the investment is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA quick guide to the classification of equity investments:\n\nControl \uf0d2 Subsidiary Joint control \uf0d2 Joint venture / joint operation Significant influence \uf0d2 Associate Less than significant influence \uf0d2 Equity investment\n\n## 4. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nNon-financial assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation. They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and, in any case, at least annually. Non-financial assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units (CGUs)). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of an asset or a CGU less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in prior years for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there is a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of an asset. A reversal of the impairment loss is limited to the asset's carrying amount (net of accumulated amortisation or depreciation) that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.\n\n## 5. Inventory\n\nInventory comprises stores and fuel and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 6. Renewable Energy Products\n\nRenewable energy and energy efficiency schemes operate through the creation, trade and surrender of energy products. Renewable energy certificates are recognised upon the risks and rewards being transferred to the Group and are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis.\n\n## 7. Employee Benefits\n\n## (A)  Defined contribution obligations\n\nThe Group operates and / or participates in a number of defined contribution plans. The assets of these plans are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and by participating companies of the Group, and provide benefits linked to contributions and investment returns on the plans. The Group has no further legal or constructive payment obligations if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefit relating to employee service in the current and prior periods, once the contributions have been paid.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee Benefits (continued)\n\n- (A)  Defined contribution obligations (continued)\n\nForfeited contributions (by employers on behalf of employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in such contributions) are not used to offset existing contributions but are credited to a reserve account of that provident fund, and are available for distribution at the discretion of the relevant employers.\n\nContributions to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses in the year to which the contributions relate, except to the extent that they are capitalised as part of the cost of qualifying assets.\n\n- (B)  Defined benefit obligations\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension plans in Australia and India. Under the plans, the employees are entitled to lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The level of benefits provided depends on employees' years of service and final average salary. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\n- (C)  Incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement\n\nProvisions are made for the estimated liability for incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period, where there is a contractual obligation or past practice that has created a constructive obligation.\n\n## 8. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies by using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nFor subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency for the purpose of consolidation, assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period; and income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange rates for the reporting period (unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. Reclassifications of gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss are translated by using the exchange rate at the date of reclassification. The remaining reserve balances are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period. Any exchange differences arising from these are taken to retained profits directly.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary / loss of joint control over a joint venture / loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 8. Foreign Currency Translation (continued)\n\nIn the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group's ownership interest in a joint venture or associate that do not result in the Group losing joint control or significant influence) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are assets to be received and liabilities to be paid in fixed amounts. For example, a trade receivable is a monetary asset (the amount to be received is fixed) but a fixed asset is not a monetary asset because it is uncertain how much you will receive if the fixed asset is sold.\n\nAn entity can have both functional currency and presentation currency, however, a consolidation group can only have presentation currency but not functional currency. This is because presentation currency is a matter of choice but functional currency is based on the different primary economic environment in which each group entity operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9. Leases\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset if the customer has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nFor the Group as a lessor, leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an underlying asset to the customer, are classified as operating lease arrangements. The respective lease assets are included in the financial statements according to their nature. Operating lease payments which vary with operation parameters are recognised as other revenue in the period in which they are earned.\n\nFor the Group as a lessee, the Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets which are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Group recognises lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n## 1. General Information\n\nThe Company is a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The principal activity of the Company is investment holding, and the principal activities of the subsidiaries are generation and supply of electricity in Hong Kong, Mainland China, India and Australia, and investment holding of power projects in Mainland China, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThe financial operations of the Company's major subsidiaries, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power Hong Kong) and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (collectively referred to as SoC Companies), are governed by a SoC Agreement entered into with the Hong Kong Government. Our electricity business in Hong Kong is therefore also referred to as the SoC business. The main features of the current SoC are summarised on pages 297 and 298, which are unaudited.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 February 2021.\n\n## 2. The Impact of COVID-19 in the Current Reporting Year\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has developed rapidly in 2020 and significantly affected entities and economic activities in varying scales globally. While there have been more immediate and pronounced disruptions in certain industries, its impact on the energy industry in the countries where we operate has been rather modest during the current reporting year. Nevertheless, as COVID-19 continues to evolve, it is challenging at this juncture to predict the full extent and duration of its impact to the business and the economy. Up to the date of this report, management has not identified any areas that could have a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## 3. Revenue\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenues from sales of electricity and gas are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured at the amounts billed to the customers based on the periodic cycle meter readings and the estimated accruals for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period ('unbilled revenue').\n\n## (B)  Other revenue\n\nRevenue from power purchase agreements represents operating lease income comprising capacity charge and energy charge. Capacity charge is recognised to the extent that capacity has been made available to the offtakers during the year. Energy charge is recognised when electricity is supplied.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Unbilled Retail Revenue\n\nThe Group records revenues from retail and wholesale energy sales using the accrual accounting method. In Hong Kong, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated using estimates including consumption quantity based on electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factor, pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors. In Australia, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated based on the electricity purchased and applicable tariffs for the mass market customers, as well as actual meter readings and contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group (included in trade and other receivables) totalled HK$3,478 million at\n\n31 December 2020 (2019: HK$3,459 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

PPAs are accounted for as operating leases with contract prices mainly comprising capacity and energy charges. Certain capacity charge is considered as in-substance fixed payment as it is payable for maintaining availability of the plant for the dispatch of electricity.

Segment Information\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision-maker of the Group. In accordance with the Group's internal organisation and reporting structure, the operating segments are based on geographical regions.\n\nSegment revenue is based on the geographical region in which the electricity is generated and / or services are rendered. Segment capital additions represent the total costs incurred during the year to acquire fixed assets and other segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, corporate assets, and the Company's liquid funds and borrowings.\n\nThe Group operates, through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in five major geographical regions Hong Kong, Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan, and Australia. The operating segments are based on geographical regions. Substantially all the principal activities of the Group in each region are for the generation and supply of electricity which are managed and operated on an integrated basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fixed Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed asset. Cost may also include transfer from equity of any gains / losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of fixed assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. For any asset replacement, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate their costs to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the fixed assets are set out below:\n\n|                                                                           | SoC fixed assets   | Non-SoC fixed assets   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                                             | not applicable     | not depreciable        |\n| Cable tunnels                                                             | 100 years          | 30 years               |\n| Buildings and civil structures at power stations                          | 35 years           | 20 - 50 years          |\n| Ash lagoon                                                                | 35 years           | 20 - 40 years          |\n| Other buildings and civil structures                                      | 60 years           | 10 - 60 years          |\n| Generating plants                                                         | 25 - 45 years *    | 10 - 40 years          |\n| Overhead lines (33kV and above)                                           | 60 years           | 20 years               |\n| Overhead lines (below 33kV)                                               | 45 years           | 18 - 20 years          |\n| Cables                                                                    | 60 years           | 10 - 30 years          |\n| Switchgear and transformers                                               | 50 years           | 15 - 35 years          |\n| Substation miscellaneous                                                  | 25 years           | 10 - 20 years          |\n| Meters                                                                    | 15 years           | 10 - 15 years          |\n| Other equipment, furniture and fittings, motor vehicles and marine crafts | 5 - 10 years       | 5 - 30 years           |\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. For plant under construction, no depreciation is provided until the construction is completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The gain or loss on disposal of a fixed asset is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fixed Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\n- (A) Assessment of the Carrying Value of Generation Assets in Australia\n\nGiven continued changes in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia and changes in the supply and demand equilibrium, risk is introduced in market modelling which heightens the criticality of this judgement area. As part of making these critical judgements, risks do exist in the assumptions made around supply and demand with regard to the Group's generation assets in Australia. In certain circumstances, where contraction of demand and supply side response vary substantially from the assumptions made, significant changes in the value of the assets could eventuate.\n\nWhen determining the recoverable amount of the generation assets, scenarios are produced which reflect a range of economic conditions that could exist over the life of the CGU. The scenarios consider a broad range of outcomes including increased renewable generation, emissions reduction and carbon pricing schemes, potential regulatory changes and the impact to the useful lives of the Group's generation assets. The scenarios are then considered in terms of likelihood to arrive at management's best estimate of recoverable amount.\n\nKey estimates and assumptions for assessing the carrying value of the generation assets are as follows:\n\n- Critical judgement exists in estimating forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, retail volumes and gas prices. The forward curve has a significant impact on the accounting for certain items including value in use calculations for impairment purposes.\n- Operating costs are escalated by relevant cost drivers using activity-based costing principles. Noncontracted fuel costs are based on management's estimate of future fuel prices.\n\nChanges to the estimates and assumptions and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable amounts of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's financial performance and position. Management considers that no reasonably possible change would result in an impairment of generation assets, in view of the long-term nature of the key assumptions and the headroom by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount. Furthermore, given the level of uncertainty, management considers it would be inappropriate to reverse any previous impairment charges.\n\n- (B) Assessment of the Carrying Values of Fixed Assets and Right-of-use Assets in Other Regions\n\nThe Group has also made substantial investments in fixed assets and right-of-use assets (mainly leasehold land and land use rights) in other regions. The Group conducts impairment reviews of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermining whether an asset or a CGU should be impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows, a growth rate (that reflects the economic environments in which the Group operates) and a pre-tax discount rate (that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset) in order to calculate the present value. Where the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss may arise. During 2020, after reviewing the business environment as well as the Group's strategies and past performance of the investments, management concluded that there were impairments for fixed assets of HK$68 million and goodwill of HK$12 million (Note 13) relating to power projects in India.\n\nApart from the assets impaired above, the impairment models indicated that sufficient headroom (meaning the excess of the recoverable amount over carrying value) existed. Management considers that any reasonably possible changes in the assumptions used in the models would not affect management's view on impairment at 2020 year end.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right-of-Use Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nThe Group as a lessee recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nThe Group has lease contracts for land and buildings and various items of plant, machinery and equipment used in its operations.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions. Tenures of the leases range from 2 to 30 years.\n\n## 12.  Investment Property\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nInvestment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties. Land held under an operating lease is accounted for as an investment property when the rest of the definition of an investment property under the accounting standard is met. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, unless they are still in the course of construction or development at the end of the reporting period and their fair value cannot be reliably measured at that time. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value or from the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the existing rental / licence income and potential reversionary income over the remaining tenure of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate capitalisation rates that by reference to the yields achieved in analysed market sales transactions and as expected by investors. The significant unobservable input is the capitalisation rate adopted for the valuation which are ranging from 3.9% to 4.15% (2019: 3.7% to 3.95%). The fair value is negatively correlated to the capitalisation rate.\n\nThe fair value measurement of the Group's investment property is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\n## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\n## (B)  Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are measured initially at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, fair value at the acquisition date. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amounts of CGUs with allocated goodwill are determined based on value in use calculations, which use cash flow projections as at 31 December 2020. These cash flow projections are derived from the approved business plan which has a forecast covering a period of ten years and have incorporated necessary updates. Projections for a period of greater than five years have been used on the basis that a longer projection period represents the long-dated nature of our generation and electricity supply assets and a more appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia\n\n## Key assumptions for value in use calculations\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations reflect a combination of internal and external factors impacting gross margin, number of customer accounts and discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions impacting gross margin include:\n\n- Retail tariffs are sensitive to regulatory changes including regulation and deregulation, and based on management estimates and expectations of current and expected market conditions arising from known and potential regulatory outcomes.\n- Electricity and gas volumes for purchases and sales in the short term represent the forecast projections in EnergyAustralia's Business Plan. External information is used to verify and align internal estimates.\n- Electricity and gas network (distribution) cost assumptions are based on published regulated prices. When no estimates are available, network costs are assumed to escalate by the relevant consumer price index.\n- Electricity pool prices, generation volumes, dispatch levels and gas prices were derived using modelling of the electricity and gas wholesale markets. NEM modelling is prepared internally using, where possible, observable inputs. The modelling used for the electricity wholesale and gas markets is based on experience and observable market activity.\n\nOther assumptions include:\n\n- The number of customer accounts in the short term for electricity and gas aligns with EnergyAustralia's Business Plan.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.9% (2019: 10.4%). The discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital.\n- A long term growth rate of 2.5% (2019: 2.0%) is applied in the terminal value calculation after the first ten years of cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment (continued)\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia (continued)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for the energy retail CGU valuation\n\nWhen undertaking the value in use calculation of our retail CGU at year end, the results indicate that minimal headroom remains. The energy retail CGU valuation is sensitive to certain key assumptions, in particular, gross margin and customer accounts growth. Despite more certainty over retail tariffs following the introduction of the default offers, both retail tariffs and customer account growth assumptions are judgemental and have a direct impact on our CGU valuation. Movements in discount rates, whilst driven by different assumptions, would also have an impact.\n\n- A 5% decrease in long term gross margin would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,779 million (A$299 million).\n- A 1% decrease in long term annual customer growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,595 million (A$268 million).\n- An increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,654 million (A$278 million).\n\nThese sensitivities are based on a change in the relevant assumption while holding other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. Up to the date of this report, there were no confirmed material changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value.\n\n## Hong Kong electricity business\n\nGoodwill arising from the CAPCO acquisition in 2014 was allocated to CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO as a combined CGU as the acquisition is considered beneficial to the whole SoC business. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows:\n\n- The electricity tariff for the supply of electricity in meeting the demand of customers in Hong Kong over the forecast periods is determined with reference to the rate-setting mechanism under the SoC.\n- The forecast for electricity demand is based on the load forecast to support local infrastructure development and meeting customer load requirements, maintaining safety and supply reliability, and meeting environmental requirements.\n- Expenditures for the supply of electricity in meeting the forecast demand are based on committed purchase contracts where applicable, and inputs on costs trend as specific to the electricity business in Hong Kong. Such forecast aligns with the projection in the Business Plan for our Hong Kong electricity business, with capital expenditures for the periods to year 2023 aligned with those forecasted in the approved Development Plan.\n- Terminal value of the CGU is adopted to estimate the cash flows to be generated for the periods beyond ten years. This is expressed as a multiple of net asset values which corresponds to our return model based on fixed assets investment. The terminal value is a multiple of 1.2 times of the net asset values forecasted as at the end of 2030.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.80% (2019: 9.79%), or a post-tax return of 8.00% (2019: 8.00%) which reflects the SoC return rate applicable to the electricity business in Hong Kong.\n\nUp to the date of this report, there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amounts of this CGU to be less than its carrying value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value gain or loss arising from derivatives not designated or not qualified for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges, which are hedges of the fair value of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or firm commitments (e.g. fixed interest rate loans and foreign currency trade receivables) or cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the cash flows of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions (e.g. floating interest rate loans and future purchases of fuels denominated in US dollar).\n\nAs mentioned in Note 2(A) and Note 2(C) of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has adopted the Reform Phase 1, as a result, it is assumed that cash flows associated with designated hedge relationships will continue to be highly probable after LIBOR is replaced with alternative interest rate.\n\nThe Group documents at the inception of the transaction the intended relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\n\n## (A)  Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss, which offset any changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss of the corresponding hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk and achieve the overall hedging result.\n\n## (B)  Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss. Such reclassification from equity will offset the effect on profit or loss of the corresponding hedged item to achieve the overall hedging result. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset at the time of acquisition. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in fuel costs in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.\n\nFor cash flow hedges affected by the Reform, the Group retains the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve, even though there is uncertainty arising from the Reform with respect to the timing and amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider that the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than the Reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity at that time is accounted for according to the nature of the underlying transactions (as discussed above) once the hedged cash flow occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is reclassified to profit or loss immediately.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)\n\n## Accounting Policy (continued)\n\n## (C)  Costs of hedging\n\nTime value of options, forward element of forward contracts and foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments may be separated and excluded from the designated hedging instruments. In such case, the Group treats the excluded elements as costs of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are recognised in a separate component of equity. For time-period related hedged items, these elements at the date of designation (to the extent that it relates to the hedged item) are amortised on a systematic and rational basis to profit or loss over the period. For transaction related hedged items, the cumulative change of these elements is included in the initial carrying amount of any non-financial asset recognised when the hedged transaction occurs or is recognised in profit or loss if the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (D)  Rebalancing of hedge relationships\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\n|                                    | 2020        | 2020             | 2019        | 2019             |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|                                    | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M |\n| Cash flow hedges                   |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 22          | 115              | 38          | 77               |\n| Foreign exchange options           | 7           | -                | 19          | -                |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | 230         | 1,144            | 206         | 756              |\n| Interest rate swaps                | -           | 166              | 26          | 44               |\n| Energy contracts                   | 2,108       | 1,412            | 1,701       | 931              |\n| Fair value hedges                  |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | 279         | 68               | -           | 142              |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 55          | 17               | -           | 44               |\n| Not qualified for hedge accounting |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 107         | 60               | 242         | 44               |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 14          | 2                | 20          | 1                |\n| Energy contracts                   | 691         | 317              | 172         | 259              |\n|                                    | 3,513       | 3,301            | 2,424       | 2,298            |\n| Current                            | 1,816       | 1,166            | 1,035       | 993              |\n| Non-current                        | 1,697       | 2,135            | 1,389       | 1,305            |\n|                                    | 3,513       | 3,301            | 2,424       | 2,298            |\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the contractual maturity profile of the hedging instruments from the end of the reporting period is summarised below:\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts\n\nUp to 5 years\n\nForeign exchange options\n\nUp to 2 years\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps\n\nUp to 15 years\n\nInterest rate swaps\n\nUp to 12 years\n\nEnergy contracts\n\nUp to 10 years\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other Non-current Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Investments\n\nEquity investments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Where an equity investment is elected to present subsequent changes in the fair value in other comprehensive income, the gains or losses on such equity investments are never reclassified to profit or loss and no impairment is recognised in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained profits on disposal of an equity investment. Dividends on equity investments are recognised in profit or loss unless they clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are deducted from the carrying amounts of the equity investments directly.\n\nOther financial assets (mainly investments in funds) are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (B)  Contract acquisition costs\n\nIncremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer are capitalised if they are expected to be recoverable. Costs capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected benefit periods of the contracts. Nonincremental costs, i.e. costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract is obtained, are expensed when incurred.\n\n## (C)  Service concession receivables\n\nThe Group recognises a financial asset arising from a service concession arrangement when it has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor for the construction. Such financial assets are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n|                                                              | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Contract acquisition costs                                   | 154         | 136         |\n| Defined benefit asset                                        | 130         | 134         |\n| Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income | 273         | 331         |\n| Investments at fair value through profit or loss             | 291         | 247         |\n| Service concession receivables (note)                        | 243         | 255         |\n| Others                                                       | 209         | 177         |\n|                                                              | 1,300       | 1,280       |\n\nNote:\n\nSatpura Transco Private Limited operates 400kV transmission lines in Madhya Pradesh, India, on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis which is considered as a service concession arrangement under HK(IFRIC) Interpretation 12.

        "page_content": "## 18.  Property under Development\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProperty under development comprises leasehold land and construction-in-progress and is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Property under development is included in current assets when it is expected to be realised or is intended for sale in the normal operating cycle.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Group and Sino Land Company Limited (Sino Land) agreed to collaborate on redeveloping the Group's former headquarters at Argyle Street for residential purposes and to preserve the Clock Tower building for community use. Under the development arrangement, Sino Land is fully responsible for all development costs such as land premium, construction costs, professional fees etc. and paid a non-refundable upfront payment of HK$3 billion to the Group. When the property is completed and sold, the Group is entitled to share a percentage of the sale proceeds.\n\nThe arrangement entered into by the Group and Sino Land does not involve an establishment of a separate legal entity and is considered as a joint operation under HKFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The non-refundable upfront payment forms part of the proceeds from the property development and is recorded as deferred revenue (Note 22(e)). When legal titles of the units in the developed property are passed to the purchasers, deferred revenue and the percentage share of the sale proceeds to which the Group is entitled will be credited to the profit or loss as revenue, while property under development will be charged to the profit or loss as cost of development.\n\n## 19.  Trade and Other Receivables\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at transaction price and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowances for expected credit losses. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to its recognised amount is recognised in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss. Trade and other receivables are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nExpected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the trade receivables. Expected credit losses on trade receivables are calculated by using the provision matrix approach. Trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative of the customers' abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nIf there has no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, impairment on other receivables is measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, then impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nProvision for expected credit losses is made when the Group does not expect to collect all amounts due. The provision is determined by grouping together trade debtors with similar risk characteristics and collectively or individually assessing them for likelihood of recovery. The provision reflects lifetime expected credit losses i.e. possible default events over the expected life of the trade receivables, weighted by the probability of that default occurring. Judgement has been applied in determining the level of provision for expected credit losses, taking into account the credit risk characteristics of customers and the likelihood of recovery assessed on a combination of collective and individual basis as relevant. While the provision is considered appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provision recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has established credit policies for customers in each of its retail businesses.\n\nIn Hong Kong, electricity bills are due within two weeks after issuance. To limit the credit risk exposure, customers' receivable balances are generally secured by cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers for an amount determined from time to time by reference to the usage of the customers, and in the normal course of events will not exceed the highest expected charge for 60 days. At 31 December 2020, such cash deposits amounted to HK$5,895 million (2019: HK$5,677 million) and the bank guarantees stood at HK$854 million (2019: HK$834 million). For all the deposits held, customers are paid a floating market interest rate equivalent to the HSBC bank saving rate. The customers' deposits are treated on the statement of financial position as current liabilities on the basis that they are repayable on demand.\n\nIn Australia, customers are allowed to settle their electricity bills in no more than 45 days after issue. EnergyAustralia has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to retail customers (including residential and commercial customers) of an appropriate credit quality and collectability is reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nTrade receivables arising from sales of electricity to the offtakers in Mainland China and India are due for settlement within 30 to 90 days and 15 to 60 days after bills issuance respectively. The offtakers of these regions are mainly state-owned enterprises. Management has closely monitored the credit qualities and the collectability of these trade receivables and consider that the expected credit risks of them are close to zero.\n\n<!-- image -->",

EnergyAustralia recognises lifetime expected credit losses for receivables by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying to the receivables held at year end. The determining factor impacting collectability is customer attributes. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The application, approval and settlement of the Renewable National Subsidy are governed by the relevant policies issued by the Central People's Government. All of the Group's Mainland China wind and solar projects are qualified for renewable energy subsidy in accordance with the prevailing government policies. There is no due date for the settlement of Renewable National Subsidies as the collection is subject to the allocation of funds by relevant government authorities to local grid companies, which takes a relatively long time for settlement. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\n## India\n\n## (i) Renewable receivables\n\nAt 31 December 2020, CLP India's renewable projects have trade receivables of HK$771 million (2019: HK$805 million) of which HK$680 million (2019: HK$704 million) were past due. The expected credit loss is close to zero as there are no history of default and continuous payments received. In addition, the offtakers are state-owned enterprises and the exposure is therefore considered a sovereign credit risk. Trade receivables in dispute are assessed individually for impairment allowance in order to determine whether specific provisions are required.\n\n## (ii) JPL - Disputed charges with offtakers\n\nJPL has disputes with its offtakers over applicable tariff of capacity charges and energy charges relating to transit losses. At 31 December 2020, total disputed amounts were Rs3,105 million (HK$329 million) (2019: Rs3,034 million (HK$331 million)). The Group considers that JPL has a strong case and hence, no provision has been made.\n\nIn September 2013, JPL filed a petition to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) against its offtakers. In 2016, CERC pronounced its judgment in favour of JPL, which supports the Group's decision that no provision should be made. The offtakers filed an appeal against the CERC's order in the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) and JPL filed an appeal challenging certain findings of the CERC. The APTEL hearing concluded on 16 June 2020 and the matter was reserved for judgment. However, the tenure of the Technical Member on the APTEL bench expired before the judgment was passed and the APTEL's bench had to be reconstituted. The matter will be reheard by the APTEL and is now listed for hearing in April 2021.\n\nOther disputed receivables of HK$165 million (2019: HK$163 million) were provided in full as there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Trade and Other Receivables (continued)\n\n## Notes (continued):\n\n- (a) Trade receivables (continued)\n\n## Expected credit losses (continued)\n\n## India (continued)\n\n- (iii)  Paguthan - Deemed generation incentive payment\n\nThe Supreme Court in India pronounced its judgment in May 2020 on the dispute for the 'deemed generation incentive payments' between CLP India and its offtaker Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL). Both appeals by CLP India and GUVNL were dismissed. Accordingly, the amounts withheld by the offtaker of Rs3,796 million, for which a full provision was made, were written off in 2020. There was no financial impact to the Group's results and financial position, and no related contingent liabilities in respect of the timebarred portion of Rs4,737 million.\n\n- (b) The current accounts with joint ventures and associates are unsecured, interest free and have no fixed repayment terms.\n\n## 20.  Bank Balances, Cash and Other Liquid Funds\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and on hand, demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions, short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash, subjected to insignificant risk of change in value and with a maturity of three months or less from date of investment, and bank overdrafts.

Fuel Clause Account\n\nCost of fuel consumed by CLP Power Hong Kong is passed on to customers. Any variations between the actual cost of fuel and the fuel cost billed are captured in the fuel clause account. The balance of the account (inclusive of interest) represents amounts over-recovered or under-recovered and is treated as an amount due to or from customers. Interest charged to customers on the amount under-recovered is based on the actual borrowing cost of CLP Power Hong Kong, while interest is credited to customers at prime rate on the amount over-recovered. CLP Power Hong Kong may adjust fuel related tariff from time to time, including on a monthly basis, in accordance with the SoC to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Trade Payables and Other Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## (B)  Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments with reference to an expected lease term, which includes optional lease periods when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to terminate the lease. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, over a similar term and with a similar security. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest on the lease liabilities (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment made to the related right-ofuse asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in case of reassessment of options under certain conditions.\n\n|                                              | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade payables  (a)                          | 6,077       | 5,850       |\n| Other payables and accruals                  | 7,136       | 6,743       |\n| Lease liabilities  (b)                       | 219         | 99          |\n| Advances from non-controlling interests  (c) | 1,021       | 1,344       |\n| Current accounts with  (d)                   |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                               | 1           | 1           |\n| Associates                                   | 583         | 468         |\n| Deferred revenue  (e)                        | 3,104       | 3,081       |\n|                                              | 18,141      | 17,586      |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (a) The ageing analysis of trade payables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                  | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below | 5,852       | 5,580       |\n| 31 - 90 days     | 123         | 172         |\n| Over 90 days     | 102         | 98          |\n|                  | 6,077       | 5,850       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Non-current deferred revenue of HK$1,434 million (2019: HK$1,295 million) was included under other non-current liabilities.\n\n## 23.  Bank Loans and Other Borrowings\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is amortised to profit or loss or capitalised as cost of the qualifying assets over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Group's bank loans and other borrowings at 31 December were repayable as follows:\n\n|                           | Bank Loans   | Bank Loans   | Other Borrowings *   | Other Borrowings *   | Total     | Total     |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                           | 2020 HK$M    | 2019 HK$M    | 2020 HK$M            | 2019 HK$M            | 2020 HK$M | 2019 HK$M |\n| Within one year           | 5,299        | 9,331        | 3,448                | 4,220                | 8,747     | 13,551    |\n| Between one and two years | 4,321        | 4,957        | 1,536                | 3,332                | 5,857     | 8,289     |\n| Between two to five years | 4,708        | 4,395        | 7,755                | 6,015                | 12,463    | 10,410    |\n| Over five years           | 3,115        | 3,423        | 24,166               | 16,676               | 27,281    | 20,099    |\n|                           | 17,443       | 22,106       | 36,905               | 30,243               | 54,348    | 52,349    |\n\n- * Other borrowings mainly included Medium Term Notes of HK$35,587 million (2019: HK$28,677 million) and bonds of HK$1,296 million (2019: HK$1,539 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother presentation of the Group's liquidity risk is set out on pages 287 to 289.\n\nTotal borrowings at 31 December included secured liabilities of HK$10,676 million (2019: HK$10,654 million), analysed as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| CLP India group  (a)                | 5,322       | 5,402       |\n| Subsidiaries in Mainland China  (b) | 5,354       | 5,252       |\n|                                     | 10,676      | 10,654      |\n\n## Notes:\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 2019, all of the Group's borrowings are either in the functional currencies of the corresponding Group entities or hedged into those currencies.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group had undrawn bank loans and overdraft facilities of HK$25,737 million (2019: HK$18,854 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred Tax\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is also provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off when the taxes relate to the same tax authority and where offsetting is legally enforceable. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n|                          | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 571         | 524         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (15,429)    | (15,117)    |\n|                          | (14,858)    | (14,593)    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future\n\nThe gross movement on the deferred tax account is as follows:\n\n|                                                    | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                               | (14,593)    | (13,815)    |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries                        | (9)         | (9)         |\n| Charged to profit or loss ( Note 7)                | (464)       | (598)       |\n| Credited / (charged) to other comprehensive income | 164         | (166)       |\n| Exchange differences                               | 44          | (5)         |\n| Balance at 31 December                             | (14,858)    | (14,593)    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

SoC Reserve Accounts\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Classification of SoC-related Accounts\n\nAs stipulated in the SoC, the balances in the Tariff Stabilisation Fund and the Rate Reduction Reserve shall represent liabilities in the financial statements of CLP Power Hong Kong and shall not accrue to the benefit of its\n\nshareholders save as provided for by the SoC. CLP Power Hong Kong also has the obligation to maintain the Fuel Clause Account (Note 21). The Group considers that CLP Power Hong Kong is required under the SoC to discharge its obligations arising from the SoC upon the expiry of the SoC Agreement such that these account balances meet\n\n- the definition of a financial liability.\n\nThe Tariff Stabilisation Fund, Rate Reduction Reserve and Rent and Rates Refunds of the Group's major subsidiary, CLP Power Hong Kong, are collectively referred to as SoC reserve accounts.

Following the settlement of appeals up to 2007/08 in 2018, CLP Power Hong Kong reached settlement with the Hong Kong Government in 2020 in respect of the appeals for rating years from 2008/09 to 2017/18, with final resolution for the remaining appeals from 2018/19 onwards still to be completed.\n\nIn addition to the interim refund of HK$300 million received earlier in 2020 for the appeal years 2008/09 to 2017/18, a further refund of HK$437 million was received later this year from the Hong Kong Government in full and final settlement for those years. These additional refunds bring the total amount of refunds received for all appeal years up to 2017/18 to HK$2,791 million. Using these refunds, CLP Power Hong Kong has provided customers with the Rent and Rates Special Rebate. Including the rebate of HK$400 million paid during the year, the Rent and Rates Special Rebate made by CLP Power Hong Kong has reached an aggregate of HK$2,454 million.\n\nThe refunds are classified within the SoC reserve accounts. The Rent and Rates Special Rebate paid to customers was offset against the refunds received.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 26.  Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nWhen the Group has a legal and / or constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood of economic outflow is probable, provisions for asset retirement obligations are recorded for estimated remediation costs of reclamation, plant closure, dismantling and waste disposal. A provision for asset retirement costs is determined by estimating the expected costs associated to remediate the site based on the current legal requirements and technologies and is discounted to its present value with an unwind adjustment recognised in finance costs. An asset is recognised on initial recognition of the provision and is depreciated over the useful life of the facility. The asset retirement costs are reviewed annually and adjustments are made to the carrying amount of the assets to reflect changes made to these estimated discount rates or future costs.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of the obligation to be recorded requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong has been investing in the transmission and distribution network to supply electricity to the customers in its supply area in Hong Kong. As CLP Power Hong Kong expects that the land sites being used for the transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers, it is currently considered remote that the network would be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore in accordance with applicable accounting standards, asset retirement obligations for these assets have not been recognised by CLP Power Hong Kong.\n\nAs part of the new development plan agreed with the Hong Kong Government in 2018, CAPCO will retire the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Following this retirement, the removal of CPA's coal-fired generation units has become probable. It is also envisaged that with the Hong Kong Government's continued commitment to reduce carbon intensity, the removal of CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units from the existing land sites may be possible at some point of time in the future. Under the SoC, CAPCO makes a periodic charge to accrue in the statement of financial position a liability balance to be utilised in discharging asset decommissioning costs if and when incurred. CAPCO considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered under the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2020. While no provision for asset retirement obligations for the other generation units of CAPCO has been recognised, it is expected that if such an obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nAsset retirement obligations of EnergyAustralia amounted to HK$2,704 million (2019: HK$2,411 million) which mainly related to the provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. The calculation of the provision requires management judgement with respect to estimating the timing of asset removal, costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments. On an ongoing basis, we continually review and update underlying assumptions relating to forward rehabilitation estimates and timelines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Perpetual Capital Securities and Redeemable Shareholder Capital\n\n## (A)  Perpetual Capital Securities\n\nA total of US$500 million perpetual capital securities was issued by the wholly owned subsidiary, CLP Power HK Finance Ltd. (CLPPHKFL) on 6 November 2019. The securities are perpetual, non-callable in the first 5.25 years (with issuer call option at par at any time in the 3 months before 5 February 2025) and entitle the holders to receive distributions at a distribution rate of 3.55% per annum in the first 5.25 years, floating thereafter and with fixed step up margins at year 10.25 and at year 25.25, payable semi-annually in arrears, cumulative and compounding. The distributions are at the Group's discretion, as long as the issuer and CLP Power Hong Kong, as guarantor of the securities, do not (a) declare or pay dividends to their shareholders or (b) cancel or reduce their share capitals within each distribution payment period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Perpetual Capital Securities and Redeemable Shareholder Capital (continued)\n\n## (B)  Other Non-controlling Interests\n\nOther non-controlling interests included CSGHK's pro-rata share of HK$5,115 million (2019: HK$5,115 million) of redeemable shareholder capital of CAPCO. The redeemable shareholder capital is subordinated, unsecured, interest free and has no fixed terms of repayment. CAPCO can, at its sole discretion, redeem all or part of the redeemable shareholder capital at any time after 31 December 2032.\n\nAs both the perpetual capital securities and redeemable shareholder capital do not contain any contractual obligation to pay cash or other financial assets, in accordance with HKAS 32, they are classified as equity and regarded as part of noncontrolling interests for accounting purpose.\n\n## 30.

Related Party Transactions\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nRelated parties are individuals and companies, including subsidiaries, fellow subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and key management personnel, where the individual or company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control or jointly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. A close family member of any such individual is considered to be a related party.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRelated Parties \u2260 Connected Parties\n\nThey sometimes overlap but should not be confused. Accounting standards define related parties, while the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange define connected parties.\n\nBelow are the more significant transactions with related parties for the year:\n\n- (A)  CLP Power Hong Kong is obliged to purchase 70% of the output from Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS). The price paid by CLP Power Hong Kong for electricity generated by GNPS throughout the terms of the PPAs is determined by a formula based on GNPS's operating costs and a calculation of profits with reference to the capacity factors. The purchase of nuclear electricity under the arrangement was HK$5,582 million (2019: HK$5,643 million).\n- Under separate purchase arrangements with GNPJVC and its shareholder, Guangdong Nuclear Investment Company Limited, CLP Power Hong Kong would purchase approximately 10% of additional nuclear electricity from GNPS on a best endeavour basis from October 2014 to end of 2023, at the same unit price as that under the above purchase arrangement. The purchase of nuclear electricity under the arrangements was HK$798 million (2019: HK$813 million).\n- (B)  The loans and shareholder's loan facilities to joint ventures are disclosed under Note 14. Other amounts due from and to the related parties at 31 December 2020 are disclosed in Notes 19 and 22 respectively. At 31 December 2020, the Group did not have any guarantees which were of a significant amount given to or received from these entities (2019: nil).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Remuneration of all Directors for the year totalled HK$58 million (2019: HK$61 million). With respect to the emoluments of the highest paid employees, the five highest paid individuals in the Group during the year included two Directors (2019: two Directors) and three members (2019: three members) of Senior Management. The total remuneration of these five highest paid individuals amounted to HK$106 million (2019: HK$116 million). Further details of the remuneration of the Directors and Senior Management, on a named basis, and remuneration paid to the five highest paid individuals by bands are disclosed in highlighted sections of the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report with a heading of 'Audited' on pages 180 to 183 and 189 to 191. These sections are part of the financial statements.\n\n## (D)  Interest of Directors\n\nThere are no loans, quasi-loans or other dealings in favour of directors, their controlled body corporates and connected entities (2019: nil).\n\nDuring the year and at the year end, no director of the Company had or has a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any significant transactions, arrangements and contracts in relation to the Group's business to which the Group was or is a party (2019: nil).\n\n## 33.  Contingent Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contingent Liabilities (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of litigation, regulatory judgments and contractual disputes in the course of its normal operations. The Group considers each instance separately in accordance with legal advice and will make provision and / or disclose information as appropriate. Changes in the assumptions around the likelihood of an\n\noutflow of economic resources or the estimation of any obligation would change the values recognised in the\n\n- financial statements.\n\n## (A)  EnergyAustralia - Disposal of Iona Gas Plant\n\nIn December 2015, EnergyAustralia completed the disposal of its entire interest in the Iona Gas Plant for a total consideration of A$1,780 million (HK$9,991 million). On 19 May 2017, EnergyAustralia received a Statement of Claim issued by Lochard Energy (Iona Operations Holding) Pty Ltd, the purchaser of the Iona Gas Plant, and certain related entities (together 'the plaintiff'), commencing formal legal proceedings seeking A$967 million (approximately HK$5,754 million) or alternatively A$780 million (approximately HK$4,641 million) in damages (plus interest and costs). The claims allege that certain information regarding the technical performance of the Iona Gas Plant, and on which the plaintiff claims to have relied to make its offer, were incomplete or misleading.\n\nOn 6 May 2019, an amended Statement of Claim was issued by the plaintiff which introduced (as a third alternative method of quantifying its damages) a damages claim based on the cost to fix the alleged issues with the plant as well as alleged associated losses and costs. The plaintiff made further amendments to its Statement of Claim in 2020.  In further particulars filed in February 2021, the plaintiff has indicated that it now estimates the amount of:\n\n- (a) its original claim to be in the range of A$457 million to A$1,449 million (approximately HK$2,719 million to HK$8,622 million); and\n- (b) its alternative claim to be in the range of A$289 million to A$370 million (approximately HK$1,720 million to HK$2,202 million),\n\n(plus interest and costs). Each estimate is based on a range of specified assumptions.\n\nThe trial for this proceeding has been set down to commence in May 2021. Prior to this, the parties are required to participate in a mediation which is scheduled in March 2021.\n\nEnergyAustralia has rejected the claims and is vigorously defending the legal proceedings. On the basis of currently available information, the Directors' view is that a material outflow of economic benefits is unlikely and no provision has been made in the financial statements.\n\n## (B)  Indian Wind Power Projects - WWIL's Contracts\n\nCLP India group has invested in approximately 533MW of wind power projects developed with Wind World India Limited (WWIL). WWIL's major shareholder, Enercon GmbH, commenced litigation against WWIL claiming infringement of intellectual property rights. CLP India group, as a customer of WWIL, has been named as a defendant. Enercon GmbH is also seeking an injunction restraining CLP India group's use of certain rotor blades acquired from WWIL. As at 31 December 2020, the Group considers that CLP India group has good prospects of defending these claims and the legal proceedings are unlikely to result in any material outflow of economic benefits from the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails relating to the disputed receivables of Jhajjar and Paguthan can be found in Note 19(a) on pages 264 to 265.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial Risk Management\n\n## 1. Financial Risk Factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks, and energy portfolio risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the impact of exchange rate, interest rate and energy price fluctuations on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses different derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure in these areas. All derivative financial instruments are employed solely for hedging purposes.\n\nRisk management for Hong Kong operations is carried out by the Group's central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors or the Finance & General Committee of relevant Group entities. Overseas subsidiaries conduct their risk management activities in accordance with policies approved by their respective Boards. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and monitors financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's operating units. The Group has written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and cash management.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group operates in the Asia-Pacific region and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. This is primarily with respect to Australian dollar, Renminbi and Indian rupee. Additionally, the Group has significant foreign currency obligations relating to its foreign currency denominated debts and major capital project payments, US dollar denominated nuclear power purchase offtake commitments and other fuel related payments. The Group uses forward contracts and currency swaps to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the respective Group entity. Hedging is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\n## SoC Companies\n\nUnder the SoC, the SoC Companies are allowed to pass-through foreign exchange gains and losses arising from future non-capital projects related commercial transactions and recognised liabilities which are denominated in a currency other than Hong Kong dollar, thus retaining no significant foreign exchange risk of such payments over the long term. The SoC Companies use forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge all their debt repayment obligations denominated in foreign currencies for the full tenor, and a significant portion of their US dollar obligations on fuel and nuclear power purchases, provided that for US dollar the hedging can be accomplished at rates below the Hong Kong Government's historical target peg rate of HK$7.8: US$1. The objective is to reduce the potential impact of foreign exchange movement on electricity tariffs. The SoC Companies also use forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risks of non-Hong Kong dollar payment obligations for major capital projects, for which the exchange gains and losses are capitalised.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the fair value movement of the derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship is recorded in equity. The extent of the impact to the cash flow hedge reserve under equity due to exchange rate movements, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Increase / (decrease) in the cash flow hedge reserve  |             |             |\n| Hong Kong dollar against US dollar                    |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 0.6% (2019: 0.6%)     | 92          | 98          |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 0.6% (2019: 0.6%) | (92)        | (98)        |\n\n## The Group's Asia-Pacific Investments\n\nWith respect to the power project investments in the Asia-Pacific region, the Group is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks.\n\nThe Group closely monitors translation risk using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach but does not hedge foreign currency translation risk because translation gains or losses do not affect the project company's cash flow or the Group's annual profit until an investment is sold. At 31 December 2020, the Group's net investment subject to translation exposure was HK$65,577 million (2019: HK$60,664 million), arising mainly from our investments in Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan and Australia. This means that, for each 1% (2019: 1%) average foreign currency movement, our translation exposure will vary by about HK$656 million (2019: HK$607 million). All the translation exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore have no impact on our profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1. Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n## The Group's Asia-Pacific Investments (continued)\n\nWe consider that the non-functional currency transaction exposures at the individual project company level, if not managed properly, can lead to significant financial distress. Our primary risk mitigation is therefore to ensure that project-level debt financings are implemented on a local currency basis to the maximum extent possible. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme into local currency taking into consideration any indexing provision in project agreements, tariff reset mechanisms, lender requirements, and tax and accounting implications.\n\nMost foreign currency exposures of the Group entities are hedged and / or their transactions are predominantly conducted through the functional currency of the respective entity. The following analysis presents the Group's (apart from the SoC Companies) sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the functional currencies of the Group entities against the US dollar and Renminbi, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity rates in US dollar and Renminbi used are considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility observed in the different functional currencies of the Group entities. These are both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates. The extent of the impact to post-tax profit or equity due to exchange rate movements of US dollar and Renminbi against different functional currencies of Group entities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| US dollar                                  |             |             |\n| If US dollar strengthened by 3% (2019: 3%) |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 17          | 25          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | 13          | 21          |\n| If US dollar weakened by 3% (2019: 3%)     |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (17)        | (25)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | (13)        | (21)        |\n| Renminbi                                   |             |             |\n| If Renminbi strengthened by 3% (2019: 3%)  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 12          | 13          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |\n| If Renminbi weakened by 3% (2019: 3%)      |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (12)        | (13)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |\n\n## Energy portfolio risk\n\nEnergyAustralia's activity in energy markets exposes it to financial risk.\n\nThe electricity market is a competitive power pool. In this market generation supply and retail demand are exposed to spot (half-hour) prices. EnergyAustralia purchases and sells majority of its electricity through the pool, at the same time EnergyAustralia enters into electricity spot-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage the spot electricity price risk against forecast retail and generation exposures.\n\nThe gas market is a balancing market. To meet retail demand, EnergyAustralia procures gas supply agreements from various gas producers. The contract prices of certain agreements comprise a fixed component, and a variable component that is linked to oil spot prices on the global markets. EnergyAustralia enters into oil-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage this oil price risk component.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Energy portfolio risk (continued)\n\nEnergy portfolio exposure is managed through an established risk management framework. The framework consists of policies which place appropriate limits on overall energy market exposures, hedging strategies and targets, delegations of authority on trading, approved product lists, regular exposure reporting, and segregation of duties. Risk monitoring includes physical position reporting, stress testing of the portfolios and 'at-risk' analyses of potential earnings. At-risk measures are derived by modelling potential variability in spot and forward market prices and supply and demand volumes, across the wholesale energy portfolio, through Monte Carlo simulations, historic simulations, and scenarios.\n\nThe corporate governance process also includes oversight by an Audit & Risk Committee (ARC-EA) which acts on behalf of EnergyAustralia's Board.\n\nOverall Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) exposure for the coming financial year is reported as the 1 in 4 probability downside (2019: 1 in 4 probability downside) of the expected earnings distribution, as simulated with the methods explained above. The energy portfolio risk exposure for EnergyAustralia as at 31 December 2020 was HK$430 million (2019: HK$550 million). The change in risk exposure is the result of the decrease in 2021 forward prices.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The risks are managed by monitoring an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe appropriate level of the fixed / floating mix is determined for each operating company subject to a regular review. For instance, SoC Companies conducts an annual review to determine a preferred fixed / floating interest rate mix appropriate for its business profile. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme taking into consideration project debt service sensitivities to interest rate movements, lender requirements, tax and accounting implications.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the effects on the Group's post-tax profit for the year (as a result of change in interest expense on floating rate borrowings) and equity (as a result of change in the fair value of derivative instruments which qualify as cash flow hedges). Such amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss, and offset one another in the profit or loss.\n\nThe analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. The sensitivity to interest rates used is considered reasonable given the market forecasts available at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates, with all other variables held constant.\n\n|                                                 | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Hong Kong dollar                                |             |             |\n| If interest rates were 0.1% (2019: 0.7%) higher |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | (10)        | (98)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | 5           | 30          |\n| If interest rates were 0.1% (2019: 0.7%) lower  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year                    | 10          | 98          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve                | (5)         | (30)        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Good credit ratings from reputable credit rating agencies and scrutiny of the financial position of non-rated counterparties are two important criteria in the selection of counterparties. The credit quality of counterparties will be closely monitored over the life of the transaction. The Group further assigns mark-to-market limits to its financial counterparties to reduce credit risk concentrations relative to the underlying size and credit strength of each counterparty. In an attempt to forestall adverse market movement, the Group also monitors potential exposures to each financial institution counterparty, using VaR methodology. All derivatives transactions are entered into at the sole credit of the respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates without recourse to the Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and making available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities with staggered maturities to reduce refinancing risk in any year and to fund working capital, debt servicing, dividend payments, new investments and close out market positions if required. The Group maintains significant flexibility to respond to opportunities and events by ensuring that committed credit lines are available to meet future funding requirements. In addition, CLP Power Hong Kong will fund its committed contractual maturities through cash flows earned under the terms of the SoC and financing available under its credit lines and MTN programme. Management also monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the expected cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group seeks to apply, wherever possible, hedge accounting to present its financial statements in accordance with the economic purpose of the hedging activity. The Group determines the economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments by reviewing their critical terms. As a result, the Group concludes that the risk being hedged for the hedged items and the risk inherent in the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned. There is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationships. Certain ineffectiveness can arise during the hedging process. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are considered to be the effects of re-designation of the hedging relationships and the counterparty credit risks on the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedges on debt related transactions\n\nThe Group applies various types of derivative financial instruments (forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps) to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in foreign currencies and / or interest rates of debt. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items. In view of the nature of the hedging activities, no significant ineffectiveness is expected at inception.\n\n## Hedges on non-debt related transactions\n\nThe SoC Companies use forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from fuel and nuclear purchases obligations, and payments for major capital projects. The SoC Companies hedge a high portion of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\nEnergyAustralia uses electricity spot-price-linked forward contracts and oil-price-linked forward contracts to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in electricity spot price and oil spot price embedded in gas contracts. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting\n\nThe tables below summarise the effect of the hedge accounting on financial position and performance of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 and 2019:\n\n|                                          |                    |

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques and making assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the Group's financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, their carrying values approximate their fair values.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are analysed into the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 -  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -  inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 -  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The finance department of EnergyAustralia includes a team that performs the valuations of non-property assets required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to EnergyAustralia's Chief Financial Officer (CFO-EA) and ARC-EA. The valuation of Level 3 forward energy contracts involves the use of a short term forward curve which is observable in the liquid market and an internally generated long term forward electricity price and cap price curve which is derived using unobservable inputs. This short term forward curve is reviewed at least once every six months, in line with the Group's half-yearly reporting dates. Review of the long term forward curve is performed by the CFO-EA and ARC-EA annually due to the lack of market liquidity. Analysis of fair value changes is performed on a monthly basis for reasonableness.\n\n- (C)  Movements and sensitivity analysis of Level 3 financial instruments\n\n|                                                                            | Investments HK$M   | 2020 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   | Investments HK$M   | 2019 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance                                                            | 282                | 1,077                         | 1,359        | 136                | 339                           | 475          |\n| Total (losses) / gains recognised in                                       |                    |                               |              |                    |                               |              |\n| Profit or loss and presented in fuel   and other operating expenses (note) | (16)               | 7                             | (9)          | 9                  | (157)                         | (148)        |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                 | 2                  | (650)                         | (648)        | -                  | 741                           | 741          |\n| Purchases                                                                  | 58                 | -                             | 58           | 137                | -                             | 137          |\n| Settlements                                                                | -                  | (42)                          | (42)         | -                  | 106                           | 106          |\n| Transfer out of Level 3                                                    | -                  | -                             | -            | -                  | 48                            | 48           |\n| Closing balance                                                            | 326                | 392                           | 718          | 282                | 1,077                         | 1,359        |\n\nNote: Out of which, unrealised losses recognised in profit or loss relating to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period was HK$3 million (2019: gains of HK$64 million).\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 2019, the valuation of long tenure energy contracts is sensitive to electricity pool price assumptions. A favourable and unfavourable change of 15% (2019: 15%) would cause the balance of the energy contracts to rise by HK$802 million (2019: HK$859 million) and decline by HK$806 million (2019: HK$860 million) respectively, with all other variables held constant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capital Management\n\nThe primary objective of the Group's capital management is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, maintain a strong credit rating and a healthy capital ratio to support the business and to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and fine-tunes it in light of changes in economic conditions and business strategies. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or change the level of debts. The Group's capital management objectives, policies or processes were unchanged during 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using 'total debt to total capital' and 'net debt to total capital' ratios. These ratios are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2020 HK$M   | 2019 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total debt  (a)                                             | 54,348      | 52,349      |\n| Net debt  (b)                                               | 42,640      | 44,023      |\n| Total equity  (c)                                           | 126,993     | 120,673     |\n| Total capital (based on total debt)  (d)                    | 181,341     | 173,022     |\n| Total capital (based on net debt)  (e)                      | 169,633     | 164,696     |\n| Total debt to total capital (based on total debt) ratio (%) | 30.0        | 30.3        |\n| Net debt to total capital (based on net debt) ratio (%)     | 25.1        | 26.7        |\n\nModerate decrease in the Group's net debt to total capital is mainly attributable to lower net debt from higher cash inflow.\n\nCertain entities of the Group are subject to loan covenants. For both 2020 and 2019, there is no material non-compliance with those loan covenants.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (a) Total debt equals bank loans and other borrowings.\n- (b) Net debt equals total debt less bank balances, cash and other liquid funds.\n- (c) Total equity equals equity plus advances from non-controlling interests.\n- (d) Total capital (based on total debt) equals total debt plus total equity.\n- (e) Total capital (based on net debt) equals net debt plus total equity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP Power Hong Kong owns the transmission and distribution network.\n\nSince financial year 1964, the electricity-related operations of CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO (the SoC Companies) have been governed by a Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Hong Kong Government. The SoC specifies the SoC Companies' obligations to supply adequate and reliable electricity supplies to customers at the lowest reasonable cost and the mechanism for the Hong Kong Government to monitor their financial affairs and operating performance. In return, CLP Power Hong Kong is allowed to charge tariffs designed to recover the operating costs (including tax) and allowed net return of the SoC Companies.\n\nThe current SoC took effect from 1 October 2018 and covers a term of over 15 years ending on 31 December 2033. The SoC contains a provision to give the SoC Companies protection for stranded costs, which may arise as a result of future changes to the market structure which adversely impact on the SoC Companies' ability to recover and to earn returns on existing investments made in good faith in accordance with the SoC. These costs will include the costs of investments, fuel and power purchase agreements previously approved by the Hong Kong Government. If stranded costs arise after the SoC Companies have implemented mitigation measures reasonably required by the Hong Kong Government, the SoC Companies are entitled to recover them from the market, consistent with international practice. Three years before market changes are introduced, the SoC Companies and the Hong Kong Government will agree on the amount of stranded costs and the mechanism for their recovery by the SoC Companies.\n\n## Tariff Setting Mechanism\n\nFor each year, CLP Power Hong Kong designs the net tariff it charges to cover the SoC Companies' operating costs and allowed net return. The net tariff consists of the following components:\n\n- (i) basic tariff rate which is derived by taking into account the annual forecast of (a), (b) and (c) below, using the formula '(a-b) / c':\n- (a) the allowed net return and operating costs including the standard cost of fuel; generation, transmission, distribution and administration expenses; depreciation; interest expenses; and taxes;\n- (b) 80% of the profit on electricity sale to Mainland China; and\n- (c) local unit sales as determined by the load forecast.\n- (ii) fuel clause charge or rebate (Fuel Cost Adjustment) which represents the difference between the costs of fuel (including natural gas, coal and oil) and the standard cost recovered through the basic tariff rate. The Fuel Cost Adjustment may be adjusted from time to time, including on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity.\n\nAny difference between the actual profit for SoC operations and the permitted return for the year is transferred to or from a Tariff Stabilisation Fund. The Tariff Stabilisation Fund does not form part of distributable shareholders' funds and represents a liability in the accounts of CLP Power Hong Kong. A charge on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is credited to the Rate Reduction Reserve in the accounts of CLP Power Hong Kong, which balance as at the end of each year is to be transferred to the Tariff Stabilisation Fund in the following year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These provisions state that each company will receive that proportion of the total net return represented by the net return that company would receive if it were the only company under the SoC and the net return were calculated solely on the basis of its own financial statements.\n\nUnder the SoC, 65% of the energy efficiency incentives earned by the SoC Companies are to be contributed to a CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) to support programmes in promotion of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, the disadvantaged groups and other programmes as agreed with the Hong Kong Government.\n\nThe calculations shown on next page are in accordance with the SoC and the agreements between the SoC Companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refers to a range of businesses, including generation and energy storage portfolio, transmission and distribution, retail and others.\n- 2. Numbers have been subject to rounding. Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 3. Paguthan Power Station, the power purchase agreements of which expired in December 2018, was not included in the 2019 and 2020 numbers.\n- 4. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, WE Station, which makes use of landfill gas from waste for power generation, is not included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions and reported separately in the Asset Performance Statistics. Its non-CO\u2082 GHG emissions (i.e. CH 4 and N\u2082O) is included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082e emissions.\n- 5. Starting from 2020, the portfolio includes energy storage assets and generation assets. Energy storage assets include pumped storage and battery storage. In previous years, the portfolio included generation assets only.\n- 6. CO\u2082 emissions of Yallourn and Hallet Power Stations have been used since 2018. Prior to 2018, CO\u2082e emissions data of these assets were used.\n- 7. Numbers include assets with majority and minority share, and those under 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' arrangements with CLP. Starting from 2018, 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' has been defined as a purchase agreement with duration of at least five years, and capacity or energy purchased being no less than 10MW.\n- 8. Starting from 2020, a new 'Energy Storage' asset category is added, under which pumped storage and battery storage are included. In previous years, assets under the 'Others' category included oil-fired generation assets and pumped storage.\n- 9. Only percentages are available for the years 2016-18.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Numbers include operating assets where CLP has operational control during the calendar year.\n- 11.  Since 2019, numbers at the asset level have been aggregated and then rounded.\n- 12.  Waste categorised in accordance with local regulations.\n- 13.  Starting from 2019, numbers have included full-time and part-time employees. Numbers in the previous years included full-time employees only.\n- 14.  The percentages given refer to permanent employees within each region, who are eligible to retire within the next five years.\n- 15.  There is no mandatory retirement age in Australia. Since 2019, retirement age assumption has been adjusted from 60 to 65 to reflect local norms, which led to a significantly lower percentage compared to previous years. Numbers in previous years adopting the adjusted retirement age for Australia are as follows: 2016 - Australia: 4.6%/Group total: 12.0%; 2017 - Australia: 4.8%/Group total: 12.9%; 2018 - Australia: 4.6%/Group total: 14.0%.\n- 16.  Voluntary turnover is employees leaving the organisation voluntarily and does not include dismissal, retirement, company-initiated termination or end of contract.\n- 17.  Includes permanent employees only except for Mainland China, which includes both permanent and fixed-term contract employees due to local employment legislation.\n- 18.  The system of rules applied in recording and reporting accident statistics complies with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Code of Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases. Each year's safety data cover the incidents that happened in that calendar year and are based on the latest information available at the time of publication.\n- 19.  A fatality is the death of an employee or contractor personnel as a result of an occupational illness/injury/disease incident in the course of employment.\n- 20.  All rates are normalised to 200,000 worked hours, which approximately equals to the number of hours worked by 100 people in one year.\n- 21.  Refers to an occupational illness/injury/disease sustained by an employee or contractor personnel causing him/her to miss one scheduled workday/shift or more after the day of the injury (including fatalities). A lost time injury does not include the day the injury incident occurred or any days that the injured person was not scheduled to work and it does not include restricted work injuries.\n- 22.  The health-related lost-time-injury in Australia was reported as lost time injury. It can also be categorised as occupational disease in Australia.\n- 23.  Total recordable injuries count all occupational injury incidents and illness other than first aid cases. They include fatalities, lost time injuries, restricted work injuries, and medical treatment.\n- 24.  Refers to the number of working days lost when workers are unable to perform their usual work because of an occupational accident or disease. A return to limited duty or alternative work for the same organisation does not count as lost days.\n- 25.  188 out of 443 days were carried forward from one incident in the past.\n- 26.  158 out of 464 days were carried forward from three incidents in the past.\n\nAll 2020 data on this page have been independently verified by PricewaterhouseCoopers except those numbers which are shaded in grey.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Commencing 1 October 2018, the Fuel Cost Adjustment is automatically adjusted on a monthly basis to reflect changes in actual price of fuel used.\n- 2 CLP Power Hong Kong provided customers with a Rent and Rates Special Rebate of 1.1 cents per unit from January 2018 to mid-February 2019 and 1.2 cents per unit in 2020, returning to customers the refunds received from the Government in relation to CLP Power's claims against the Government's overcharged rent and rates.\n- 3 Effective net tariffs including one-off special fuel rebates in 2017 was 110.5 cents per unit.\n- 4 Taking into account the effect of the customer programme of demand response pursued to reduce electricity usage, the maximum demand would have been higher at 7,268 MW in 2019 and 7,368 MW in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
