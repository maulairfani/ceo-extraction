        "page_content": "## FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO\n\nFellow Shareholders,\n\n2020 was a pivotal year for Marathon as we began a process to transform the company, lowering our cost structure and shaping our asset portfolio amid evolving stakeholder expectations and opportunities created by the energy evolution. While these e/fforts continue through 2021, we made significant progress during the year.\n\nDespite the demands of COVID-19, our teams remained focused on our core values and on their central mission. As a result, we set a new industry benchmark for certifications in the EPA's ENERGY STAR \u00ae program and achieved significant improvements over 2019 in our process safety and environmental performance.\n\nComplemented by our ongoing sustainability focus, which inspired us to take industry-leading actions, our e/fforts collectively served to enhance the company's competitiveness and longevity amid shifting market dynamics.\n\nOur humanitarian and operational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic reflected our broader vision of sustainability, which emphasizes delivering essential energy products and services to the world in ways that create shared value for all our stakeholders - our people, business partners, customers, communities, governments and shareholders. We deployed more than 500,000 N95 respirator masks to frontline healthcare workers in our local communities and increased our employee giving match from 60% to 100%. The Marathon Petroleum Foundation also donated $1 million to the American Red Cross to supply critical resources.\n\n## Building Resiliency - Our Strategic Initiatives\n\nWe quickly began implementing actions to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, improve our commercial performance and lower our cost structure. We made significant moves in our portfolio in 2020, which included:\n\n- \u00b7 Reaching an agreement with 7-Eleven for the pending sale of our Speedway retail business for $21 billion, which will help strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Beginning production at our Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable diesel facility, which is the second largest facility of its kind in the United States, designed to produce approximately 180 million gallons per year. This facility is anticipated to reach its full rate of production by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n- \u00b7 Moving forward with engineering and permitting e/fforts on a project to convert our idled Martinez, California, refinery to a facility that produces renewable transportation fuels. It is anticipated this project would be commissioned in 2022 and eventually reach a production capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, we strengthened our e/fforts to lower our carbon intensity and produce a range of fuels that meet the needs of evolving and emerging consumer demands, consistent with our principles for Leading in Sustainable Energy. These principles correspond with several of our most substantial 2020 achievements:",

These e/fforts contributed to MPC earning high scores from ESG rating organizations that are monitored by institutional investment firms. Our scores led to several recognitions, such as placement on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Forbes JUST 100. Our comprehensive sustainability framework helps to di/fferentiate us and provides us with the flexibility to accommodate a variety of emerging topics and marketplace demands.\n\nAs we look ahead in 2021, the availability of COVID-19 vaccines provides hope for the return of global transportation fuel demand and economic recovery. Even though many uncertainties still exist, the world's need for reliable, a/ffordable and responsibly produced energy remains important. We believe we can continue to meet this need through our strategies that will allow us to successfully adapt to the evolving energy landscape.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael J.

Additionally, we were the only petroleum refiner to earn the ENERGY STAR \u00ae Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence Award.\n- \u00b7 In the past decade, our Focus on Energy program helped us avoid the equivalent of 1.8 billion Btu/hr of energy use or roughly the same amount of energy used by about 100,000 homes. The program's cost savings are approximately $500 million.\n\n## Renewable Fuels and Technologies\n\n- \u00b7 Our Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable diesel facility is the second largest facility of its kind in the United States, designed to produce approximately 180 million gallons per year. It makes renewable diesel from corn and soybean oils and is expected to reach its full rate of production by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n- \u00b7 Progress continues on plans to convert our Martinez, California, refinery into a facility that produces renewable fuels from lower carbon-intensity renewable feedstocks with an eventual capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year. Pending the completion of engineering and permitting activities, commissioning is expected in 2022 with a potential build to full capacity in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Our Cincinnati biodiesel facility produced more than 80 million gallons of biodiesel in 2020. We also blended approximately 84 million gallons of biodiesel into the diesel fuel that we marketed and sold in 2020.\n- \u00b7 The joint venture between MPC and The Andersons produced more than 435 million gallons of ethanol in 2020 across four plants, including one in Greenville, Ohio. We also blended more than 1.8 billion gallons of ethanol into the gasoline that we marketed and sold in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Virent, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC in Madison, Wisconsin, is working to commercialize its BioForming \u00ae process, which converts biobased feedstocks, such as sugars, into renewable fuel. Virent operates a demonstration plant that generates data as part of moving its patented technology forward.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corporation ('MPC') has over 130 years of experience in the energy business, and is the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and midstream business in the United States. We operate the nation's largest refining system with approximately 2.9 million barrels per day of crude  oil  refining  capacity  and  believe  we  are  one  of  the  largest  wholesale  suppliers  of  gasoline  and distillates  to  resellers  in  the  United  States.  We  also  operate  Speedway,  the  second  largest  chain  of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, which we have agreed to sell to 7-Eleven, Inc. ('7-Eleven') for $21 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. We distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and one of the largest private domestic  fleets  of  inland  petroleum  product  barges.  In  addition,  our  integrated  midstream  energy  asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets.\n\nOur operations consist of two reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.\n\n- \u00b7 Refining & Marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent  and  West  Coast  regions  of  the  United  States,  purchases  refined  products  and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing  services  provided  largely  by  our  Midstream  segment.  We  sell  refined  products  to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon \u00ae branded outlets, through long-term supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the ARCO \u00ae brand and to approximately 3,800 Speedway locations.\n- \u00b7 Midstream - transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and  barges;  gathers,  processes  and  transports  natural  gas;  and  gathers,  transports,  fractionates, stores  and  markets  NGLs.  The  Midstream  segment  primarily  reflects  the  results  of  MPLX  LP ('MPLX'). MPLX is a diversified, large-cap master limited partnership ('MLP') formed in 2012 that  owns  and  operates  midstream  energy  infrastructure  and  logistics  assets  and  provides  fuels distribution  services.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  we  owned  the  general  partner  of  MPLX  and approximately 62 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units.\n\n## Corporate History and Structure\n\nMPC was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon  Oil  Corporation  ('Marathon  Oil').  On  May  25,  2011,  the  Marathon  Oil  board  of  directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing & Transportation Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil on June 30, 2011. Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'MPC.'\n\nOn  October  1,  2018,  we  acquired  Andeavor.  Andeavor  shareholders  received  in  the  aggregate approximately 239.8 million shares of MPC common stock valued at $19.8 billion and $3.5 billion in cash. Andeavor  was  a  highly  integrated  marketing,  logistics  and  refining  company  operating  primarily  in  the Western and Mid-Continent United States. Our acquisition of Andeavor in 2018 substantially increased our geographic diversification and the scale of our assets, which provides increased opportunities to optimize our system.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder Value\n\n## Speedway Sale\n\nOn August 2,  2020,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  our  company-owned  and operated  retail  transportation  fuel  and  convenience  store  business,  to  7-Eleven  for  $21  billion  in  cash,",

        "page_content": "subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. This transaction is expected to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion. We expect to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  we  have  agreed  to  enter  into  certain  ancillary agreements,  including  a  15-year  fuel  supply  agreement  associated  with  7-Eleven  or  its  subsidiaries, depending on the fuel demand of Speedway and other factors to be set forth in the fuel supply agreement. Further,  we  expect  incremental  opportunities  over  time  to  supply  7-Eleven's  remaining  business  as  7Eleven's existing arrangements mature and as new locations are added in connection with its announced U.S. and Canada growth strategy.\n\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets to assets and liabilities held for sale. Prior to presentation of Speedway  as  discontinued  operations,  Speedway  and  our  retained  direct  dealer  business  were  the  two reporting  units  within  our  Retail  segment.  Beginning  with  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  the  direct  dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented.\n\nAs a result  of  our  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  the  following  changes  in  our  basis  of  presentation  have occurred:\n\n- \u00b7 In accordance with ASC 205, Discontinued Operations, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue, since we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway  subsequent  to  the  sale  to  7-Eleven.  All  periods  presented  have  been  retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n- \u00b7 Beginning  August  2,  2020,  in  accordance  with  ASC  360,  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment,  we ceased  recording  depreciation  and  amortization  for  Speedway's  property,  plant  and  equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets.\n\n## Midstream Review\n\nOn March 18, 2020, we announced that MPC's board of directors unanimously decided to maintain MPC's current midstream structure, with MPC remaining, through a wholly owned subsidiary, the general partner of MPLX. This decision concluded a comprehensive evaluation, led by a special committee of the board, that included extensive input from multiple external advisors and significant feedback from investors.\n\n## OUR OPERATIONS\n\nOur operations consist of two reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream.\n\n## REFINING & MARKETING\n\n## Refineries\n\nWe currently own and operate refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions of the United States with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of 2,874 mbpcd. During 2020, our refineries processed  2,418  mbpd  of  crude  oil  and  165  mbpd  of  other  charge  and  blendstocks.  During  2019,  our refineries processed 2,902 mbpd of crude oil and 210 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks.\n\nOur  refineries  include  crude  oil  atmospheric  and  vacuum  distillation,  fluid  catalytic  cracking, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, coking, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of condensate and light and heavy crude oils purchased from various domestic and foreign suppliers. We produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with ethanol and ULSD fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, propane, propylene and sulfur. See the Refined Product Marketing section for further information about the products we produce.",

The  crude  oil  sourced outside of North America was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, production companies and trading companies.\n\n| ( mbpd )                            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| United States                       | 1,650  | 1,962  | 1,319  |\n| Canada                              | 442    | 541    | 465    |\n| Middle East and other international | 326    | 399    | 297    |\n| Total                               | 2,418  | 2,902  | 2,081  |\n\nOur refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels, including pipelines, trucks, railcars, ships and barges.\n\n## Renewable Fuels\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the conversion of our Dickinson, North Dakota refinery into an approximately 184 million gallons per year renewable diesel facility.\n\nWe also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility,  including  applying  for  permits,  advancing  discussions  with  feedstock  suppliers,  and  beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. On February 24, 2021, MPC's board of directors approved these plans.\n\nWe own a biofuel production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio that produces biodiesel, glycerin and other byproducts. The capacity of the plant is approximately 91 million gallons per year.\n\nOur  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Virent,  is  an  advanced  biofuels  facility  in  Madison,  Wisconsin  that  is working to commercialize a process for converting biobased feedstocks into renewable fuels and chemicals.\n\nWe hold an ownership interest in ethanol production facilities in Albion, Michigan; Logansport, Indiana; Greenville,  Ohio  and  Denison,  Iowa.  These  plants  have  a  combined  ethanol  production  capacity  of approximately 475 million gallons per year and are managed by our joint venture partner, The Andersons.\n\n## Refined Product Marketing\n\nOur refined products are sold to independent retailers, wholesale customers, our brand jobbers and direct dealers.  In  addition,  we  sell  refined  products  for  export  to  international  customers.  As  of  December  31, 2020,  there  were  7,090  branded  outlets  in  35  states,  the  District  of  Columbia  and  Mexico  where independent entrepreneurs primarily maintain Marathon-branded outlets. We also have long-term supply contracts  for  1,093  direct  dealer  locations  primarily  in  Southern  California,  largely  under  the  ARCO \u00ae brand. We believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 41-state market area.",

The  following  table  sets  forth  our  refined  product  sales destined for export by product group for the past three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.\n\n| ( mbpd )    |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gasoline    |    110 |    131 |    117 |\n| Distillates |    187 |    215 |    193 |\n| Other       |     43 |     51 |     24 |\n| Total       |    340 |    397 |    334 |\n\n## Gasoline and Distillates\n\nWe sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and distillates (including No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, jet fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel) to wholesale customers, Marathon-branded jobbers, direct dealers and in the spot market. In addition, we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers. The demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months.\n\n## Feedstocks and Petrochemicals\n\nWe are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals. Product availability varies by refinery and  includes,  among  others,  propylene,  naphtha,  butane,  xylene,  benzene,  alkylate,  cumene,  raffinate, toluene and platformate. We market these products domestically to customers in the chemical, agricultural and fuel-blending industries. In addition, we produce fuel-grade coke at our Garyville, Detroit, Galveston Bay  and  Los  Angeles  refineries,  which  is  used  for  power  generation  and  in  miscellaneous  industrial applications,  and  anode-grade  coke  at  our  Los  Angeles  and  Robinson  refineries,  in  addition  to  calcined coke at our Los Angeles refinery, which are both used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry.\n\n## Asphalt\n\nWe have refinery-based asphalt production capacity of up to 139 mbpcd, which includes asphalt cements, polymer-modified  asphalt,  emulsified  asphalt,  industrial  asphalts  and  roofing  flux.  We  have  a  broad customer base, including asphalt-paving contractors, resellers, government entities (states, counties, cities and  townships)  and  asphalt  roofing  shingle  manufacturers.  We  sell  asphalt  in  the  domestic  and  export wholesale markets via rail, barge and vessel.\n\n## Propane\n\nWe produce propane at all of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are split approximately 80 percent and 20 percent between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers, respectively.",

Heavy  residual  fuel  oil  is  primarily  used  in  the  utility  and  ship  bunkering  (fuel)  industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.\n\n## Terminals and Transportation\n\nWe transport, store and distribute crude oil, feedstocks and refined products through pipelines, terminals and marine fleets owned by MPLX and third parties in our market areas.\n\nWe own a fleet  of  transport  trucks  and  trailers  for  the  movement  of  refined  products  and  crude  oil.  In addition,  we  maintain  a  fleet  of  leased  and  owned  railcars  for  the  movement  and  storage  of  refined products.\n\nThe locations and detailed information about our Refining & Marketing assets are included under Item 2. Properties and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Competition, Market Conditions and Seasonality\n\nThe downstream petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other  feedstock  supply  and  the  marketing  of  refined  products.  We  compete  with  a  number  of  other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products. Based upon company data as reported in the 'The Oil & Gas Journal 2020 Worldwide Refinery Survey,' we ranked first among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity.\n\nWe compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products-wholesale, including exports, spot, branded  and  retail  distribution.  Our  marketing  operations  compete  with  numerous  other  independent marketers, integrated oil companies and high-volume retailers. We compete with companies in the sale of refined  products  to  wholesale  marketing  customers,  including  private-brand  marketers  and  large commercial and industrial consumers; companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; and refiners  or  marketers  in  the  supply  of  refined  products  to  refiner-branded  independent  entrepreneurs.  In addition,  we  compete  with  producers  and  marketers  in  other  industries  that  supply  alternative  forms  of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and retail consumers.\n\nMarket  conditions  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  are  cyclical  and  subject  to  global  economic  and  political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils, ANS, WTI and LLS crude oils and other market structure impacts also affect our operating results.\n\nDemand for gasoline, diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the  winter  months  in  most  of  our  markets,  primarily  due  to  seasonal  increases  in  highway  traffic  and construction.  As  a  result,  the  operating  results  for  our  Refining  &  Marketing  segment  for  the  first  and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year.\n\n## MIDSTREAM\n\nThe  Midstream  segment  primarily  includes  the  operations  of  MPLX,  our  sponsored  MLP,  and  certain related operations retained by MPC.\n\n## MPLX\n\nMPLX owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and refined product pipelines and has joint ownership interests in other crude oil and refined products pipelines. MPLX also owns and operates light products terminals, storage assets and maintains a fleet of owned and leased towboats and barges. MPLX's assets  also  include  natural  gas  gathering  systems  and  natural  gas  processing  and  NGL  fractionation complexes.",

Properties and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Competition, Market Conditions and Seasonality\n\nOur  Midstream  operations  face  competition  for  natural  gas  gathering,  crude  oil  transportation  and  in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services; in obtaining unprocessed NGLs for gathering,  transportation  and  fractionation;  and  in  marketing  our  products  and  services.  Competition  for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants, operating  efficiency  and  reliability,  residue  gas  and  NGL  market  connectivity,  the  ability  to  obtain  a satisfactory  price  for  products  recovered  and  the  fees  charged  for  the  services  supplied  to  the  customer. Competition for oil supplies is based primarily on the price and scope of services, location of gathering/ transportation  and  storage  facilities  and  connectivity  to  the  best  priced  markets.  Competitive  factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of fractionation capacity, proximity to supply and industry  marketing  centers,  the  fees  charged  for  fractionation  services  and  operating  efficiency  and reliability of service. Competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and NGLs is based primarily on price, credit and market connectivity. In addition, certain of our Midstream operations are subject to rate regulation, which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines.\n\nOur Midstream segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act ('CAA') with respect to  air  emissions,  the  Clean  Water  Act  ('CWA')  with  respect  to  water  discharges,  the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ('RCRA') with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ('CERCLA') with  respect  to  releases  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  the  Oil  Pollution  Act  of  1990 ('OPA-90') with respect to oil  pollution  and  response.  In  addition,  many  states  where  we  operate  have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized.\n\nFor a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see Item 7. Management's Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Environmental  Matters  and Compliance Costs. For additional information regarding regulatory risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n## Air\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nWe  believe  it  is  likely  that  the  scientific  and  political  attention  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  climate change, and climate adaptation will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations.  Currently,  legislative  and  regulatory  measures  to  address  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  in various  phases  of  review,  discussion  or  implementation.  Reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities, (iii) capture the emissions from our facilities and (iv) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\n\nIn  January  2021,  President  Biden  announced  that  the  United  States  was  rejoining  the  2015  Paris  UN Climate  Change  Conference  Agreement,  effective  February  19,  2021.  President  Biden  also  issued  an Executive Order on climate change in which he announced putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. The Executive Order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible, and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions",

        "page_content": "and  climate  change.  In  a  second  Executive  Order,  President  Biden  reestablished  a  working  group  to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. A higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation.\n\nStates  are  becoming  active  in  regulating  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  These  measures  may  include  state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions. These measures may also include low-carbon fuel standards, such as the California program, or a state carbon tax. These measures could  result  in  increased  costs  to  operate  and  maintain  our  facilities,  capital  expenditures  to  install  new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented. For example, the California state legislature enacted AB 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Much of  the  compliance  costs  associated  with  these  California  regulations  are  ultimately  passed  on  to  the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs. States are increasingly announcing aspirational goals to be netzero carbon emissions by a certain date through both legislation and executive orders. To date, these states have not provided significant details as to achievement of these goals; however, meeting these aspirations will require a reduction in fossil fuel combustion and/or a mechanism to capture greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  As  a  result,  we  cannot  currently  predict  the  impact  of  these  potential  regulations  on  our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.\n\n## Other Air Emissions\n\nIn  2015,  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  ('EPA')  finalized  a  revision  to  the  National Ambient Air Quality Standards ('NAAQS') for ozone. The EPA lowered the primary ozone NAAQS from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. In December 2020, the EPA published a rule maintaining this standard. Designation as a nonattainment  area  could  result  in  increased  costs  associated  with,  or  result  in  cancellation  or  delay  of, capital projects at our facilities, or could require nitrogen oxide ('NOx') and/or volatile organic compound ('VOC') reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities.\n\nIn  California,  the  Board  for  the  South  Coast  Air  Quality  Management  District  ('SCAQMD')  passed amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market ('RECLAIM') that became effective in 2016, requiring  a  staged  reduction  of  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  through  2022.  In  2017,  the  State  of  California passed AB 617, which requires implementation of best available retrofit control technology ('BARCT') on specific  facilities,  including  facilities  subject  to  RECLAIM.  In  response  to  AB  617,  the  SCAQMD  is currently working to identify BARCT and determine whether to 'sunset' the existing RECLAIM program. A 'sunset' of the RECLAIM program and application of BARCT is expected to result in increased costs to operate and maintain our Los Angeles refinery.\n\n## Water\n\nWe maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which, among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank  vessel  or  a  facility  to  maintain  an  emergency  plan  to  respond  to  releases  of  oil  or  hazardous substances. OPA-90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate tank vessels and  facilities  from  which  spills  of  oil  and  hazardous  substances  could  occur.  We  have  implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established  Spill  Prevention,  Control  and  Countermeasures  plans  for  all  facilities  subject  to  such requirements. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.\n\nOn October 22, 2019, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers ('Army Corps') published a final rule to repeal the 2015 'Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States' ('2015 Rule'), which amended portions of the Code of Federal Regulations ('CFR') to restore the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 Rule, effective December 23, 2019. The rule repealing the 2015 Clean Water Rule has  been  challenged  in  multiple  federal  courts.  On  April  21,  2020,  the  EPA  and  the  Army  Corps promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule ('2020 Rule') to define 'waters of the United States.' The 2020 Rule has been challenged in court. The Biden administration has signaled its intent to revisit the definition of 'waters of the United States,' and replace it with a definition consistent with the 2015 Rule. A",

        "page_content": "broader definition could result in increased cost of compliance or increased capital costs for construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities.\n\nIn  April  2020,  the  U.S.  District  Court  in  Montana  vacated  Nationwide  Permit  12  ('NWP  12'),  which authorizes the placement of fill material in 'waters of the United States' for utility line activities as long as certain best management practices are implemented. The decision was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which partially reversed the district court's decision, temporarily reinstating NWP 12  for  all  projects  except  the  Keystone  XL  oil  pipeline.  The  United  States  Army  Corps  of  Engineers subsequently reissued its nationwide permit authorizations on January 13, 2021, by dividing the NWP that authorizes utility  line  activities  (NWP  12)  into  three  separate  NWPs  that  address  the  differences  in  how different utility line projects are constructed, the substances they convey, and the different standards and best management practices that help ensure those NWPs authorize only those activities that have no more than  minimal  adverse  environmental  effects.  The  2021  authorization  may  be  challenged  in  court  or  the Biden Administration may repeal or replace the 2021 authorization in a subsequent rulemaking. Repeal or replacement of the rule could impact pipeline maintenance activities.\n\nAs  part  of  our  emergency  response  activities,  we  have  used  aqueous  film  forming  foam  ('AFFF') containing  per-  and  polyfluoroalkyl  substances  ('PFAS')  chemicals  as  a  fire  suppressant.  At  this  time, AFFFs  containing  PFAS  are  the  only  proven  foams  that  can  prevent  and  control  most  flammable petroleum-based liquid fires.\n\nIn May 2016, the EPA issued lifetime health advisories ('HAs') and health effects support documents for two PFAS substances - Perfluorooctanoic Acid ('PFOA') and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate ('PFOS'). Then, in February 2019, EPA issued a PFAS Action Plan identifying actions the EPA is planning to take to study and regulate various PFAS chemicals. The EPA identified that it would evaluate, among other actions, (1) proposing national drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, (2) develop cleanup recommendations for PFOA and PFOS, (3) evaluate listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, and (4)  conduct  toxicity  assessments  for  other  PFAS  chemicals.  To  date  EPA  has  not  issued  any  further regulations for PFAS under the Trump administration; however, the Biden Administration has indicated its intent to issue proposed rules to regulate PFAS, which could include the designation of variants of PFAS as CERCLA hazardous substances and/or establish national drinking water standards. Congress may also take further action to regulate PFAS. We cannot currently predict the impact of potential statutes or regulations on our operations or remediation costs.\n\nIn addition, many states are actively proposing and adopting legislation and regulations relating to the use of AFFF. Additionally, some states are adopting and proposing state-specific drinking water and cleanup standards for various PFAS. We cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.\n\n## Solid Waste\n\nWe continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices,  RCRA  also  addresses  the  environmental  effects  of  certain  past  waste  disposal  operations,  the recycling of wastes and the regulation of USTs containing regulated substances.\n\n## Remediation\n\nWe own or  operate,  or  have  owned  or  operated,  certain  convenience  stores  and  other  locations  where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet  applicable  standards.  Penalties  or  other  sanctions  may  be  imposed  for  noncompliance.  The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases  and  the  applicable  state  laws  and  regulations.  A  portion  of  these  remediation  costs  may  be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied.  We  also  have  ongoing  remediation  projects  at  a  number  of  our  current  and  former  refinery, terminal and pipeline locations.\n\nClaims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint",

        "page_content": "and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site,  the  complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during  which  such  costs  may  be  incurred,  we  are  unable  to  reasonably  estimate  our  ultimate  cost  of compliance  with  CERCLA;  however,  we  do  not  believe  such  costs  will  be  material  to  our  business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Renewable Fuels and Other Fuels Requirements\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ('EISA'), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States  by  model  year  2020.  In  March  2020,  the  EPA  and  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety Administration  ('NHTSA')  released  the  final  Safer  Affordable  Fuel-Efficient  ('SAFE')  Vehicles  Rule setting corporate average fuel economy ('CAFE') and carbon dioxide ('CO2') standards for model years 2021-2026  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks.  The  final  rule  increases  the  stringency  of  CAFE  and  CO2 emission  standards  by  1.5  percent  each  year  from  model  years  2021  through  2026.  The  rule  has  been challenged  in  court  and  could  be  revised  by  the  Biden  Administration  through  notice  and  comment rulemaking. Higher CAFE standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels.\n\nIn addition, the NHTSA and the EPA issued rules providing that the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ('EPCA') preempts state regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions, withdrew the waiver granted to California for its Advanced Clean Car program and determined that the Clean Air Act permits other states to  adopt  only  those  California  standards  that  are  designed  to  control  traditional  'criteria  pollutants.' California  may  establish  per  its  Clean  Air  Act  waiver  authority  different  standards  that  could  apply  in multiple  states.  California's  governor  issued  an  executive  order  requiring  sales  of  all  new  passenger vehicles  in  the  state  be  zero-emission  by  2035.  Other  states  have  issued,  or  may  issue,  zero  emission vehicle  mandates.  The  Biden  Administration  could  reinstate  the  California  waiver  and  may  take  federal action to incentivize or mandate zero emission vehicle production.\n\nPursuant  to  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  and  the  EISA,  the  EPA  has  promulgated  a  Renewable  Fuel Standard ('RFS') program that requires certain volumes of renewable fuel be blended with our products. By November 30 of each year, the EPA is required to promulgate the annual renewable fuel standards for the following compliance year. In a legal challenge to the 2014-2016 volumes, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  vacated  the  total  renewable  volume  for  2016  and  remanded  to  the  EPA  for  reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion. A rule that increases the total renewable volume for any compliance year to make up for the 2016 shortfall could increase our cost of compliance with the RFS program, require us to use carryover RINs and be detrimental to the RIN market.\n\nThe EPA has finalized the annual renewable fuel standards for the year 2020. For the first time, the EPA has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small refinery  is  eligible  for  an  exemption  from  the  RFS  only  if  it  is  applying  for  an  extension  of  its  original exemption. According to the EPA's data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery  exemption  in 2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit decision is upheld, EPA's reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC's RFS  cost  of  compliance.  Further,  the  EPA  has  failed  to  promulgate  timely  the  annual  renewable  fuel standards for 2021.\n\nThe RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure constraints  limit  the  blending  of  significantly  more  than  10  percent  ethanol  into  gasoline  ('E10').  Since 2016,  the  volume  requirements  have  resulted  in  the  ethanol  content  of  gasoline  exceeding  the  E10 blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover RINs.\n\nThere is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN generators.  Nevertheless,  if  any  of  the  RINs  that  we  purchase  and  use  for  compliance  are  found  to  be invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.",

        "page_content": "In addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation of  state  renewable  or  low  carbon  fuel  standards.  For  example,  California  began  implementing  its  Low Carbon Fuel Standard ('LCFS') in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.\n\nIn sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by  renewable  fuels.  Demand  for  our  refined  products  also  may  decrease  as  a  result  of  low  carbon  fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates.\n\n## Safety Matters\n\nWe  are  subject  to  oversight  pursuant  to  the  federal  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act,  as  amended ('OSHA'),  as  well  as  comparable  state  statutes  that  regulate  the  protection  of  the  health  and  safety  of workers.  We  believe  that  we  have  conducted  our  operations  in  substantial  compliance  with  OSHA requirements,  including  general  industry  standards,  record-keeping  requirements  and  monitoring  of occupational exposure to regulated substances.\n\nWe are also subject at regulated facilities to the OSHA's Process Safety Management ('PSM') and EPA's Risk Management Program requirements, which are intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic  releases  of  toxic,  reactive,  flammable  or  explosive  chemicals.  The  application  of  these regulations can result in increased compliance expenditures.\n\nIn  general,  we  expect  industry  and  regulatory  safety  standards  to  become  stricter  over  time,  resulting  in increased compliance expenditures. While these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nThe DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection  and  management  of  our  pipeline  assets.  These  regulations  contain  requirements  for  the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and  testing  of  pipelines  and  the  correction  of  anomalies.  These  regulations  also  require  that  pipeline operation  and  maintenance  personnel  meet  certain  qualifications  and  that  pipeline  operators  develop comprehensive spill response plans.\n\n## Tribal Lands\n\nVarious federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American  tribes,  promulgate  and  enforce  regulations  pertaining  to  oil  and  gas  operations  on  Native American tribal lands where we operate. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and  production  requirements,  and  standards  to  protect  environmental  quality  and  cultural  resources.  In addition,  each  Native  American  tribe  is  a  sovereign  nation  having  the  right  to  enforce  certain  laws  and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our operations on such lands.\n\n## TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES\n\nOur Marathon and ARCO trademarks are material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations, and our Speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail operations. We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents  or  licenses  as  critical  or  essential  to  our  business  as  a  whole.  In  general,  we  depend  on  our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe  believe  our  employees  are  our  greatest  source  of  strength,  and  our  culture  reflects  the  quality  of individuals  across  our  workforce.  Our  collaborative  efforts  to  foster  an  inclusive  environment,  provide",

Empowering our people and prioritizing accountability also are key components for developing MPC's high-performing culture, which is critical to achieving our strategic vision.\n\n## Employee Profile\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  we  employed  approximately  57,900  people  in  full-time  and  part-time  roles. Excluding employees of Speedway, which is targeted to be sold in the first quarter of 2021, we employ approximately 18,600 people in full-time and part-time roles. Many of these employees provide services to MPLX, for  which  we  are  reimbursed  in  accordance  with  employee  service  agreements.  Approximately 3,770 of the 18,600 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## Talent Management\n\nExecuting our strategic vision requires that we attract and retain the best talent. Recruiting and retention success  requires  that  we  effectively  nurture  new  employees,  providing  opportunities  for  long-term engagement and career advancement. We also appropriately reward high-performers and offer competitive benefits.  Our  Talent  Acquisition  team  consists  of  three  segments:  Executive  Recruiting,  Experienced Recruiting  and  University  Recruiting.  The  specialization  within  each  group  allows  us  to  specifically address  MPC's  broad  range  of  current  and  future  talent  needs,  as  well  as  devote  time  and  attention  to candidates during the hiring process. We value diverse perspectives in the workforce, and accordingly we seek candidates with a variety of backgrounds and experience. Our primary source of full-time, entry-level new hires is our intern/co-op program. Through our university recruiters, we offer college students who have  completed  their  freshman  year  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  our  hands-on  programs  focused  in areas of finance and accounting, marketing, engineering and IT.\n\nWe provide a broad range of leadership training opportunities to support the development of leaders at all levels.  Our  programs, which are offered across the organization are a blended approach of business and leadership content, with many featuring external faculty. We utilize various learning modalities, such as visual, audio, print, tactile, interactive, kinesthetic, experiential and leader-teaching-leader to address and engage  different  learning  styles.  We  believe  networking  and  access  to  our  executive  team  are  a  key leadership success factor, and we incorporate these opportunities into all of our programs.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nTo ensure we are offering competitive pay packages in our recruitment and retention efforts, we annually benchmark  compensation,  including  base  salaries,  bonus  levels  and  equity  targets.  Our  annual  bonus program  is  a  critical  component  of  our  compensation,  as  it  provides  individual  reward  for  MPC's achievement against preset financial and sustainability goals, encouraging a sense of employee ownership. Employees in our officer-level pay grades, as well as senior leaders and most mid-level leaders, are eligible to receive long-term equity incentive awards as part of their compensation.\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance for our employees, their spouses or domestic partners, and their dependents. We also provide retirement programs, life insurance, education assistance, family assistance, short-term disability and paid vacation and sick time. Following our acquisition of Andeavor, we enhanced several of our benefits programs to reflect our larger, coast-to-coast organization.  We  increased  the  maximum  accrual  cap  for  vacation  banks  and  doubled  the  number  of college and trade school scholarships offered to the high school senior children of our employees through the  Marathon  Petroleum  Scholars  Program.  In  addition,  we  increased  our  paid  parental  leave  benefit  to eight weeks for birth mothers and four weeks for nonbirth parents, including adoptive and foster parents. Both  full-time  and  part-time  employees  are  eligible  for  this  benefit.  Parents  who  both  work  for  the company are each eligible for a parental pay benefit.\n\n## Inclusion\n\nOur company-wide Diversity and Inclusion ('D&I') program is managed by a dedicated D&I Office team and supported by leadership. Our program is based on our three-pillar D&I strategy, of building awareness, increasing  representation  and  ensuring  success.  The  strategy  focuses  on  understanding  the  benefits  of diverse perspectives, increasing diversity across the organization and recognizing that cultural inclusion is an  ongoing  process.  We  have  employee  networks  focusing  on  six  populations:  Asian,  Black,  Hispanic, Veterans,  Women  and  LGBTQ+.  Our  employee  networks  have  approximately  60  chapters  across  the company  and  all  networks  encourage  ally  membership.  This  broad  support  extends  also  to  our  leaders throughout MPC, with each employee network represented by two active executive sponsors. The sponsors",

Our employee networks not only provide opportunities for our employees to make meaningful and supportive connections, but they also serve a significant role in our D&I strategy.\n\n## Safety\n\nWe are committed to safe operations to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities.  Our  commitment  to  safe  operations  is  reflected  in  our  safety  systems  design,  our  wellmaintained equipment and by learning from our incidents. Part of our effort to promote safety includes a management system based on the principles of RC14001\u00ae, the Plan-Do-Check-Act continual improvement cycle,  and  our  Operational  Excellence  Management  System.  Together,  these  components  of  our  safety management system provide us with a comprehensive approach to managing risks and preventing incidents, illnesses  and  fatalities.  Additionally,  our  annual  cash  bonus  program  metrics  includes  several  employee, process and environmental safety metrics.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  underscored  for  us  the  importance  of  keeping  our  employees  safe  and healthy. In March 2020, MPC activated its Corporate Emergency Response Team to ensure a consistent and  aggressive  response  across  all  facets  of  our  company.  The  safety  and  health  of  our  employees, including our essential personnel, were our top priorities. As part of our existing pandemic plan, we had a central  inventory  of  N95  respirators,  surgical  masks,  and  nitrile  gloves  to  supply  to  our  employees  and contractors  when  the  pandemic  began.  We  implemented  a  number  of  protective  measures  to  ensure employee  and  contractor  safety  as  they  continued  to  keep  our  critical  operations  running  safely.  We continue to monitor the situation and adapt our practices as appropriate.\n\n## Information about our Executive and Corporate Officers\n\nThe executive and corporate officers of MPC are as follows:\n\n| Name                  |   Age as of  February 1,  2021 | Position with MPC                                                                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Michael J.

Information  contained  on  our  website  is  not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other securities filings.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\n\n## Business and Operational Risks\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, which has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic, financial and business conditions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact worldwide economic and commercial activity. Travel  restrictions,  business  and  school  closures,  increased  remote  work,  stay-at-home  orders  and  other actions  taken  by  individuals,  governments  and  the  private  sector  to  stem  the  spread  of  the  virus  have significantly  reduced  global  economic  activity,  significantly  reduced  demand  for  the  petroleum  products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and contributed to increased market and oil price volatility. Our  refinery  utilization  and  operating  margins  and  other  aspects  of  our  business  have  been  adversely impacted by these developments.\n\nDuring 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.\n\nDepending on future movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect on our financial performance. In addition, a sustained period of low crude oil prices may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil, which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business. Such conditions could also result in an increased risk that our customers and other counterparties may be unable to fully fulfill their obligations in a timely manner, or at all.\n\nResurgences in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new stay-at-home orders or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, which could further weaken demand for the petroleum products we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and could contribute to increased market and oil price volatility.\n\nA prolonged  period  of  economic  slowdown  or  recession,  or  a  protracted  period  of  depressed  prices  for crude oil or refined petroleum products, could continue to have significant and adverse consequences for our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and",

        "page_content": "could  diminish  our  liquidity,  trigger  additional  impairments  and  negatively  affect  our  ability  to  obtain adequate crude oil volumes and to market certain of our products at favorable prices, or at all.\n\nThe ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect us and our customers, suppliers and other counterparties will depend largely on the length and severity of the pandemic; actions taken by individuals,  governments  and  the  private  sector  to  stem  the  spread  of  the  virus;  general  economic conditions; and the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\n## Our  financial  results  are  affected  by  volatile  refining  margins,  which  are  dependent  on  factors beyond our control.\n\nOur operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute  share  repurchases  and  continue  the  payment  of  our  base  dividend  are  highly  dependent  on  the margins  we  realize  on  our  refined  products.  Historically,  refining  and  marketing  margins  have  been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. The price of crude  oil  and  the  price  at  which  we  can  sell  our  refined  products  may  fluctuate  independently  due  to  a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;\n- \u00b7 transportation  infrastructure  availability,  local  market  conditions  and  operation  levels  of  other refineries in our markets;\n- \u00b7 natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;\n- \u00b7 political instability, threatened or actual terrorist incidents, armed conflict or other global political conditions;\n- \u00b7 local weather conditions;\n- \u00b7 seasonality of demand in our marketing areas due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;\n- \u00b7 natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;\n- \u00b7 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n- \u00b7 local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.\n\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain.  We  purchase  our  crude  oil  and  other  refinery  feedstocks  weeks  before  we  refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results. We  also  purchase  refined  products  manufactured  by  others  for  resale  to  our  customers.  Price  changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nLower refining and marketing margins have in the past, and may in the future, lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. Significant  reductions  in  refining  and  marketing  margins  could  require  us  to  reduce  our  capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), and require us to re-evaluate practices regarding our repurchase activity and dividends.\n\n## Legal,  technological,  political  and  scientific  developments  regarding  emissions  and  fuel  efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels.\n\nDevelopments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing vehicle efficiency may decrease the  demand  or  increase  the  cost  for  our  transportation  fuels.  In  March  2020,  the  U.S.  Environmental Protection  Agency  (the  'EPA')  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation's  National  Highway  Traffic Safety Administration ('NHTSA') released the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient ('SAFE') Vehicles Rule setting corporate average fuel economy ('CAFE') and carbon dioxide ('CO2') standards for model years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks. The final rule increases the stringency of CAFE and CO2 emission standards by 1.5 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026. The rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the Biden Administration through notice and comment rulemaking.  In  addition,  California's  governor  issued  an  executive  order  requiring  sales  of  all  new passenger vehicles in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Other states have, or may issue, zero-emission",

        "page_content": "vehicle mandates. Future developments involving climate change and environmental laws and regulations may require heightened fuel efficiency standards.\n\nGovernment efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may  foster  a  negative  perception  toward  transportation  fuels  or  increase  costs  for  our  products.  New technologies that increase fuel efficiency or offer alternative vehicle power sources and the proliferation of alternative-fuel  vehicles  (i.e.,  vehicles  that  do  not  use  petroleum-based  transportation  fuels  or  that  are powered by hybrid engines) may result in decreased demand for petroleum-based transportation fuel. These developments  could  have  a  material  and  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, which could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur  operations  are  subject  to  business  interruptions,  such  as  scheduled  and  unscheduled  refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, acts of terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. The inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products.\n\nExplosions,  fires,  refinery  or  pipeline  releases,  product  quality  or  other  incidents  may  result  in  serious personal  injury  or  loss  of  human  life,  significant  damage  to  property  and  equipment,  environmental pollution,  impairment  of  operations  and  substantial  losses  to  us.  We  have  experienced  certain  of  these incidents in the past. For assets located near populated areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater.\n\nIn addition, we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker, pipeline, rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge. MPLX operates a fleet of boats and barges to transport light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks to and from refineries and terminals owned by MPC. Transportation and storage of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to  water  involves  inherent  risk  and  subjects  us  to  the  provisions  of  the  OPA-90  and  state  laws  in  U.S. coastal  and  Great  Lakes  states  and  states  bordering  inland  waterways  on  which  we  operate,  as  well  as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we are unable to promptly and adequately contain  any  accident  or  discharge  involving  tankers,  pipelines,  rail  cars  or  above  ground  storage  tanks transporting  or  storing  crude  oil,  other  feedstocks  or  refined  products,  we  may  be  subject  to  substantial liability. In addition, the service providers contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions, governmental regulations or other local or global events.\n\nDamages  resulting  from  an  incident  involving  any  of  our  assets  or  operations  may  result  in  our  being named  as  a  defendant  in  one  or  more  lawsuits  asserting  potentially  substantial  claims  or  in  our  being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.\n\n## We rely on the performance of our information technology systems, and the interruption or failure of any  information  technology  system,  including  an  interruption  or  failure  due  to  a  cybersecurity breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems (and those of our third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted on proprietary servers), including our network infrastructure and cloud applications, for the safe and effective operation of our business. We rely on such systems to process, transmit  and  store  electronic  information,  including  financial  records  and  personally  identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, retail sales, credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous  other  processes  and  transactions.  Our  systems  and  infrastructure  are  subject  to  damage  or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, malware, power failures, cyberattacks  and  other  events.  We  also  face  various  other  cybersecurity  threats  from  criminal  hackers  and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems or render data or systems unusable.",

We have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems. To date, the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us.\n\nAny  cybersecurity  incident  involving  our  information  technology  systems  or  those  of  our  third-party business partners could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential financial and other data, intellectual property, customer awards or loyalty points; give rise to remediation or other expenses;  expose  us  to  liability  under  federal  and  state  laws;  reduce  our  customers'  willingness  to  do business with us; disrupt the services we provide to customers; and subject us to litigation and legal liability under federal and state laws. Any of such results could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Competition in our industry is intense, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry. For example, competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\n\nWe have agreed to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven. Nevertheless, pending closing of the Speedway sale, which remains subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals, we still face strong competition  in  the  market  for  the  retail  sale  of  transportation  fuels  and  merchandise.  Our  competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at  very competitive prices. Non-traditional transportation fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and  mass  merchants,  may  be  better  able  to  withstand  volatile  market  conditions  or  levels  of  low  or  no profitability in the retail segment of the market. These retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales, which could in turn pressure us to  offer  similar  discounts.  Additionally,  the  loss  of  market  share  by  our  convenience  stores  to  these  and other retailers relating to either transportation fuels or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products.\n\nWe utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions.\n\nIn  particular,  pipelines  or  railroads  provide  a  nearly  exclusive  form  of  transportation  of  crude  oil  to,  or refined products from, some of our refineries. A prolonged interruption, material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway, whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason, or  any  other  prolonged  disruption  of  the  ability  of  the  trucks,  pipelines,  railways  or  vessels  to  transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## A significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in MPLX's areas of operation may adversely affect MPLX's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\n\nA significant portion of MPLX's operations is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. The production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will  naturally  decline  over  time,  which  means  that  MPLX's  cash  flows  associated  with  these wells  will  also  decline  over  time.  To  maintain  or  increase  throughput  levels  and  the  utilization  rate  of MPLX's facilities, MPLX must continually obtain new oil, natural gas, NGL and refined product supplies, which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed.",

        "page_content": "We have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of MPLX's operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. In addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by demand, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves,  geological  considerations,  governmental  regulations  and  the  availability  and  cost  of  capital. Reductions  in  exploration  or  production  activity  in  MPLX's  areas  of  operations  could  lead  to  reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities.\n\nDecreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. The prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend upon  factors  beyond  our  control,  including  global  and  local  demand,  production  levels,  changes  in interstate  pipeline  gas  quality  specifications,  imports  and  exports,  seasonality  and  weather  conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. Sustained periods of low prices could result in producers deciding to limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs to MPLX's facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us.\n\nThis impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of MPLX's commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a Btu equivalent basis than NGL products. In addition, the purchase and resale of natural gas and NGLs in the ordinary  course  exposes  our  Midstream  operations  to  volatility  in  natural  gas  or  NGL  prices  due  to  the potential  difference  in  the  time  of  the  purchases  and  sales  and  the  potential  difference  in  the  price associated  with  each  transaction,  and  direct  exposure  may  also  occur  naturally  as  a  result  of  production processes.  Also,  the  significant  volatility  in  natural  gas,  NGL  and  oil  prices  could  adversely  impact MPLX's  unit  price,  thereby  increasing  its  distribution  yield  and  cost  of  capital.  Such  impacts  could adversely impact MPLX's ability to execute its long -term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers  and  make  distributions  to  unitholders  at  intended  levels,  and  may  also  result  in  non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.\n\n## Severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.\n\nOur facilities are subject to potential acute physical risks, such as floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires and snowstorms, and potential chronic physical risks, such as sea-level rise or water shortages. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. We have incurred and will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  to  protect  our  assets  and  operations  from  such  physical  risks  and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks. To the extent such severe weather  events  or  other  climate  conditions  increase  in  frequency  and  severity,  we  may  be  required  to modify  operations  and  incur  costs  that  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We  are  subject  to  risks  arising  from  our  operations  outside  the  United  States  and  generally  to worldwide political and economic developments.\n\nWe operate and sell some of our products outside the United States, particularly in Mexico, South America and  Asia.  Our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  could  be  negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets, including economic instability, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties and tariffs, transportation delays, difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments. Global outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the current COVID-19  pandemic,  could  affect  demand  for  refined  products  and  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries, if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated,  if  new  economic  sanctions  relevant  to  such  jurisdictions  are  passed  or  if  taxes,  border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe are required to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving antibribery,  anti-corruption  and  anti-money  laundering.  For  example,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining  business  or  gaining  any  business  advantage.

Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nMore broadly, political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, NGLs and natural gas. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. For example, the U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, NGLs, natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries could restrict imports, investments or commercial transactions.\n\n## Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our reliance on our joint venture partners and their financial condition, and our joint venture partners may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and  business  interests  with  our  joint  venture  partners.  Our  joint  venture  partners  may  have  economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have an interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  or  results  of  operations  of  our  joint  ventures  and  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.\n\nRefining, gathering and processing, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, and other energy assets, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. Any terrorist attack on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other energy assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nWe  have  significant  debt  obligations;  therefore,  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile or downgrade of our credit ratings, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were $32.17 billion, including $20.54 billion of obligations of MPLX and its subsidiaries and $130 million of obligations of Speedway. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.\n\nOur indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n- \u00b7 limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;\n- \u00b7 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n- \u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.",

        "page_content": "A decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. The planned Speedway sale could be a factor causing or contributing to a future determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. Any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables outstanding. In periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.\n\n## Our working capital, cash flows and liquidity can be significantly affected by decreases in commodity prices.\n\nPayment terms for our crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms we extend to our customers for refined product sales. As a result, the payables for our crude oil purchases are proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales. Due to this net payables position, a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital, and given the significant volume of crude oil that we purchase the impact can materially affect our working capital, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## The  expected  phase  out  of  LIBOR  could  impact  the  interest  rates  paid  on  our  variable  rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase.\n\nA portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. The ICE Benchmark Administration Limited ('ICE') announced that it will cease calculating and publishing  all  USD  LIBOR  tenors  on  June  30,  2023  and  cease  calculating  and  publishing  certain  USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021. Further, U.K. and U.S. regulatory authorities have recently issued statements encouraging banks to cease entering into new USD LIBOR based loans as soon as possible and by no later than December 31, 2021 and to continue to transition away from USD LIBOR based loans in preparation  of  ICE  ceasing  to  calculate  and  public  LIBOR  based  rates  on  June  30,  2023.  These developments may cause fluctuations in LIBOR rates and pricing of USD LIBOR based loans that are not transitioned to a new benchmark rate.\n\nThe  agreements  that  govern  our  variable  rate  indebtedness  contain  customary  transition  and  fallback provisions  in  contemplation  of  the  cessation  of  LIBOR.  Nevertheless,  at  this  time,  it  is  not  possible  to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any  other  reference  rate,  or  the  establishment  of  alternative  reference  rates  may  have  on  LIBOR,  other benchmarks or floating  rate  indebtedness.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  nature  of  such  potential  discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for  securities  linked  to  such  benchmarks.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  alternative  reference  rates  or  other reforms could cause the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our  floating  rate  indebtedness  to  be  materially  different  than  expected  and  could  materially  adversely impact  our  ability  to  refinance  such  floating  rate  indebtedness  or  raise  future  indebtedness  on  a  cost effective basis.\n\n## We may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\n\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.\n\n## We do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.\n\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities  arising  from  operating  hazards.  Uninsured  liabilities  arising  from  operating  hazards  such  as explosions,  fires,  refinery  or  pipeline  releases,  cybersecurity  breaches  or  other  incidents  involving  our",

Historically,  we  also  have  maintained  insurance  coverage  for  physical  damage  and  resulting  business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.\n\n## We  have  recorded  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  that  could  become  further  impaired  and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\n\nWe accounted for the Andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires  that  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  acquired  business  be  recorded  to  our  balance  sheet  at  their respective  fair  values  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  Any  excess  of  the  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our balance sheet reflected $8.3 billion and $2.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible  assets,  respectively.  In  2020,  we  recorded  approximately  $7.4  billion  and  $177  million  in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense, respectively. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired, we may be required to incur additional material non-cash charges  relating  to  such  impairment.  Our  operating  results  may  be  significantly  impacted  from  both  the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\n\n## Large  capital  projects  can  take  years  to  complete,  and  market  conditions  could  deteriorate significantly  between  the  project  approval  date  and  the  project  startup  date,  negatively  impacting project returns.\n\nWe have several large capital projects underway, including the activities associated with the conversion of the  Martinez  refinery  to  a  renewable  diesel  facility.  Delays  in  completing  capital  projects  or  making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability  to  supply  certain  products  we  produce.  Such  delays  or  cost  increases  may  arise  as  a  result  of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 denials of, delays in receiving, or revocations of requisite regulatory approvals or permits;\n- \u00b7 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n- \u00b7 disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n- \u00b7 adverse  weather  conditions,  natural  disasters  or  other  events  (such  as  equipment  malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n- \u00b7 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n- \u00b7 market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs;\n- \u00b7 nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors; and\n- \u00b7 delays due to citizen, state or local political or activist pressure.\n\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions  change,  it  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe  expect  to  continue  to  incur  substantial  capital  expenditures  and  operating  costs  to  meet  the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations. Future environmental laws and regulations may impact our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  numerous  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  These  laws  and  regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our business. Laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the emission or discharge of materials into the environment,\n- \u00b7 solid and hazardous waste management,\n- \u00b7 the regulatory classification of materials currently or formerly used in our business,\n- \u00b7 pollution prevention,\n- \u00b7 greenhouse gas emissions,\n- \u00b7 climate change,",

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and  remediation  expenditures  to  modify  operations,  install  pollution  control  equipment,  perform  site cleanups  or  curtail  operations.  We  may  also  face  liability  for  personal  injury,  property  damage,  natural resource  damage  or  clean-up  costs  due  to  alleged  contamination  and/or  exposure  to  chemicals  or  other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, benzene, MTBE  and  petroleum  hydrocarbons,  at  or  from  our  facilities.  Such  expenditures  could  materially  and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities could result in reductions or delays in U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile  we  do  not  conduct  hydraulic  fracturing  operations,  we  do  provide  gathering,  processing  and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result  of  such  operations.  Our  refineries  are  also  supplied  in  part  with  crude  oil  produced  from unconventional  oil  shale  reservoirs.  A  range  of  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  currently govern or, in some cases, prohibit, hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Stricter laws, regulations and permitting processes may be enacted in the future. For example, President Biden has suspended new oil and gas permitting on public lands and properties, and has proposed modifying royalties to account for climate costs.  If  these  or  other  federal,  state  and  local  legislation  and  regulatory  initiatives  relating  to  hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas production activities are enacted or expanded, such efforts could impede oil and gas production, increase producers' cost of compliance, and result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather, process and fractionate.\n\n## Climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas  emission  regulation  could  affect  our  operations,  energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations, any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCurrently,  multiple  legislative  and  regulatory  measures  to  address  greenhouse  gas  (including  carbon dioxide,  methane  and  nitrous  oxides)  and  other  emissions  are  in  various  phases  of  consideration, promulgation  or  implementation.  These  include  actions  to  develop  international,  federal,  regional  or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for refined products. Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\n\nFor  example,  in  2017,  the  California  state  legislature  adopted  AB  398,  which  provides  direction  and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system. Additionally, the CARB is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions  by  2045  via  a  yet  undefined  carbon  neutrality  standard.  Other  states  are  proposing,  or  have already  promulgated,  low  carbon  fuel  standards  or  similar  initiatives  to  reduce  emissions  from  the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable  to  meet  our  compliance  obligation,  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be adversely affected.\n\nRegional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy.

        "page_content": "intensity  have  also  resulted  in  societal  concerns  and  a  number  of  international  and  national  measures  to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\n\nInternational  climate  change-related  efforts,  such  as  the  2015  United  Nations  Conference  on  Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose  policies  directly  influence  our  present  and  future  operations.  Though  the  United  States  had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden issued an executive order recommitting the United States  to  the  Paris  Agreement  on  January  20,  2021.  President  Biden  also  issued  an  Executive  Order  on climate change in which he announced putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. The Executive Order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible, and requires  federal  permitting  decisions  to  consider  the  effects  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  climate change. In a second Executive Order, President Biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. A higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation.\n\nThe scope and magnitude of the changes to U.S. climate change strategy under the Biden administration and  future  administrations,  however,  remain  subject  to  the  passage  of  legislation  and  interpretation  and action of federal and state regulatory bodies; therefore, the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time.\n\n## Energy assets and companies are subject to increasing environmental and climate-related litigation.\n\nGovernmental  and  other  entities  in  various  U.S.  states  have  filed  lawsuits  against  coal,  gas,  oil  and petroleum  companies,  including  us.  The  lawsuits  allege  damages  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and  the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be  filed  in  other  jurisdictions.  Additionally,  private  plaintiffs  and  government  parties  have  undertaken efforts  to  shut  down  energy  assets  by  challenging  operating  permits,  the  validity  of  easements  or  the compliance with easement conditions. For example, the Dakota Access Pipeline, in which MPLX has a minority  interest,  has  been  subject  to  litigation  in  which  plaintiffs  have  challenged  the  validity  of  an easement necessary for the operation of the pipeline and demanded a permanent shutdown of the pipeline. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these types of proceedings, as well as their potential effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.\n\nWe  operate  and  develop  our  business  with  the  expectation  that  regulations  and  societal  sentiment  will continue  to  enable  the  development,  transportation  and  use  of  carbon-based  fuels.  However,  policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, storage and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups.\n\nThe approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines, negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations. In addition, government disruptions may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. Our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all), or at the budgeted cost. We also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and the  surrounding  terrain.  We  may  be  required  to  install  additional  facilities,  incur  additional  capital  and operating expenditures, or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly.\n\nMoreover,  our  revenues  may  not  increase  immediately  upon  the  expenditure  of  funds  on  a  particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project, if at all. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction  of  facilities  (including  improvements  and  repairs  to  our  existing  facilities)  could  adversely",

Rail transportation is regulated by federal,  state  and  local  authorities.  New  regulations  or  changes  in  existing  regulations  could  result  in increased compliance expenditures. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crude-by-rail transportation (Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational  Controls  for  High-Hazard  Flammable  Trains).  These  or  other  regulations  that  require  the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries, increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## Historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.\n\nWe currently  are  defending  litigation  and  anticipate  we  will  be  required  to  defend  new  litigation  in  the future.  Our  operations,  including  those  of  MPLX,  and  those  of  our  predecessors  could  expose  us  to litigation  and  civil  claims  by  private  plaintiffs  for  alleged  damages  related  to  contamination  of  the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be  material  to  us,  in  class-action  litigation,  large  classes  of  plaintiffs  may  allege  damages  relating  to extended  periods  of  time  or  other  alleged  facts  and  circumstances  that  could  increase  the  amount  of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials have in the past and may in the future pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens  for  a  variety  of  claims,  including  violation  of  consumer  protection  and  product  pricing  laws  or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result  in  liability  to  our  company  that  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  In  addition  to  substantial  liability,  plaintiffs  in  litigation may  also  seek  injunctive  relief  which,  if  imposed,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nApproximately  3,771  of  our  employees  are  covered  by  collective  bargaining  agreements.  Of  these employees,  approximately  192  employees  at  our  St.  Paul  Park  refinery  are  covered  by  a  collective bargaining agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. Approximately 231 employees at our El Paso refinery  are  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  scheduled  to  expire  in  April  2021. Approximately  2,390  employees  at  our  Anacortes,  Canton,  Catlettsburg,  Galveston  Bay,  Los  Angeles, Mandan, Martinez and Salt Lake City refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due  to  expire  on  February  1,  2022.  The  remaining  958  hourly  represented  employees  are  covered  by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. These agreements may be renewed at an increased cost to us. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. For example, approximately 192 workers at our  St.  Paul  Park  refinery  have  been  on  strike  since  January  21,  2021.  Any  prolonged  work  stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  California  requires  refinery  owners  to  pay  prevailing  wages  to  contract  craft  workers  and restricts refiners' ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants. Legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages, higher labor costs, and an increased risk that contract workers become  joint  employees,  which  could  trigger  bargaining  issues,  and  wage  and  benefit  consequences, especially during critical maintenance and construction periods.",

Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## If  foreign  investment  in  us  or  MPLX  exceeds  certain  levels,  MPLX  could  be  prohibited  from operating  inland  river  vessels,  which  could  adversely  affect  MPLX's  business,  financial  condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\n\nThe Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (collectively, the 'Maritime Laws'), generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, MPLX would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Our  operations  could  be  disrupted  if  we  are  unable  to  maintain  or  obtain  real  property  rights required for our business.\n\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located, particularly our midstream assets, but  rather  obtain  the  rights  to  construct  and  operate  such  assets  on  land  owned  by  third  parties  and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased  costs  to  retain  necessary  land  use  if  our  leases,  rights-of-way  or  other property rights lapse, terminate or are reduced or it is determined that we do not have valid leases, rightsof-way or other property rights. Any loss of or reduction in these rights, including loss or reduction due to legal, governmental or other actions or difficulty renewing leases, right-of-way agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Certain  of  our  facilities  are  located  on  Native  American  tribal  lands  and  are  subject  to  various federal and tribal approvals and regulations, which may increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations.\n\nVarious  federal  agencies  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior,  particularly  the  Bureau  of  Indian Affairs,  Bureau  of  Land  Management,  and  the  Office  of  Natural  Resources  Revenue,  along  with  each Native American tribe, regulate natural gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands, including drilling and production requirements and environmental standards. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from  federal,  state  and  local  statutes  and  regulations.  These  tribal  laws  and  regulations  include  various taxes,  fees,  requirements  to  employ  Native  American  tribal  members  and  other  conditions  that  apply  to operators  and  contractors  conducting  operations  on  Native  American  tribal  lands.  Persons  conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. In addition, if our  relationships  with  any  of  the  relevant  Native  American  tribes  were  to  deteriorate,  we  could  face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on Native American tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct operations on such lands.\n\n## The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders.\n\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\n- \u00b7 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of MPC;\n- \u00b7 any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of MPC to MPC or its stockholders\n- \u00b7 any  action  asserting  a  claim  against  MPC  arising  pursuant  to  any  provision  of  the  General Corporation  Law  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  MPC's  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  any Preferred Stock Designation or the Bylaws of MPC; or\n- \u00b7 any other action asserting a claim against MPC or any Director or officer of MPC that is governed by or subject to the internal affairs doctrine for choice of law purposes.",

        "page_content": "The forum selection provision may restrict a stockholder's ability to bring a claim against us or directors or officers of MPC in a forum that it finds favorable, which may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims at all. Alternatively, if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated  with  resolving  such  action  in  another  forum,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  However,  the  forum  selection  provision  does  not apply to any claims, actions or proceedings arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\n\n## Provisions  in  our  corporate  governance  documents  could  operate  to  delay  or  prevent  a  change  in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.\n\nThe existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  could  discourage,  delay  or  prevent  a  change  in  control  of  us  that  a  stockholder  may  consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;\n- \u00b7 providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n- \u00b7 providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;\n- \u00b7 limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n- \u00b7 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n- \u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n- \u00b7 establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation;\n- \u00b7 providing that our directors may only be removed for cause;\n- \u00b7 authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our  board  of  directors  to  issue  shares  to  persons  friendly  to  current  management,  thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and\n- \u00b7 authorizing the issuance of 'blank check' preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\n\nOur  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  also  authorizes  us  to  issue,  without  the  approval  of  our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or  more  classes  or  series  of  preferred  stock  could  dilute  the  voting  power  or  reduce  the  value  of  our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\n\nFinally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common  stock  or  any  other  class  of  our  capital  stock  by  non-U.S.  citizens  to  exceed  23  percent.  Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation  on  the  liquidity  of  the  market  for  our  common  stock  could  adversely  impact  the  market price of our common stock.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic Transaction Risks\n\nOur pending sale of Speedway to 7-Eleven is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us. Even if completed, the Speedway sale may not achieve the intended benefits.\n\nWe  have  announced  our  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  our  company-owned  and  operated  retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven. The sale, which is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2021, is subject to customary conditions. We and 7-Eleven may be unable to satisfy such conditions to the closing of the sale in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the Speedway sale may be delayed or may not be completed. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us, including by delaying our strategic and other objectives relating to the separation of Speedway and adversely affecting our plans to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. Even if the sale is completed, we may not realize some or all the expected benefits. For example, we may be unable to utilize the proceeds from the sale as anticipated or capture  the  value  we  expect  from  our  plans  to  strengthen  our  balance  sheet  and  return  capital  to  our shareholders. Executing the Speedway sale will require significant time and attention from management, which  could  divert  attention  from  the  management  of  our  operations  and  the  pursuit  of  our  business strategies.  If  the  proposed  Speedway  sale  is  completed,  our  diversification  of  revenue  sources  will diminish, and it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be subject to increased volatility as a result.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\nSignificant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist  stockholders  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming  and  could  divert  the  attention  of  our  board  of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFuture  acquisitions  will  involve  the  integration  of  new  assets  or  businesses  and  may  present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFuture transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 inaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;\n- \u00b7 an  inability  to  successfully  integrate,  or  a  delay  in  the  successful  integration  of,  assets  or businesses we acquire;\n- \u00b7 a  decrease  in  our  liquidity  resulting  from  using  a  portion  of  our  available  cash  or  borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;\n- \u00b7 a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;\n- \u00b7 the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n- \u00b7 the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n- \u00b7 the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired business; and\n- \u00b7 the  incurrence  of  other  significant  charges,  such  as  impairment  of  goodwill  or  other  intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.",

The  senior  notes  were  issued  to  repay  amounts  owed  by  the  pipeline  companies  to  fund  the  cost  of construction of the Bakken Pipeline system.",

        "page_content": "In March 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the 'D.D.C.') ordered the U.S. Army Corps  of  Engineers  ('Army  Corps'),  which  granted  permits  and  an  easement  for  the  Bakken  Pipeline system,  to  conduct  a  full  environmental  impact  statement  ('EIS'),  and  further  requested  briefing  on whether an easement necessary for the operation of the Bakken Pipeline system should be vacated while the EIS is being prepared.\n\nOn July 6, 2020, the D.D.C. ordered vacatur of the easement to cross Lake Oahe during the pendency of an EIS and further ordered a shut down of the pipeline by August 5, 2020. The D.D.C. denied a motion to stay that order. Dakota Access and the Army Corps appealed the D.D.C.'s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  (the  'Court  of  Appeals').  On  July  14,  2020,  the  Court  of  Appeals issued an administrative stay while the court considered Dakota Access and the Army Corps' emergency motion for stay pending appeal. On August 5, 2020, the Court of Appeals stayed the D.D.C.'s injunction that required the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. The Court of Appeals denied a stay of the D.D.C.'s March order, which required the EIS, and further denied a stay of the D.D.C.'s July order, which vacated the easement. On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals upheld the D.D.C.'s order vacating the easement while the Army Corps prepares the EIS. The Court of Appeals reversed the D.D.C.'s order to the extent it directed that the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil. In the D.D.C., briefing has been completed for a renewed request for an injunction. The pipeline remains operational.\n\nIf the pipeline is temporarily shut down pending completion of the EIS, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown. It is also expected that MPLX would contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit and/or return the pipeline into operation. If the vacatur of the easement permit results in a permanent shutdown of the pipeline, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds (including the one percent redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes) and any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under  the  Contingent  Equity  Contribution  Agreement  were  approximately  $230  million  and  we  had  an investment  of  $465  million  in  MarEn  Bakken  Company  LLC,  which  includes  our  9.19  percent  direct interest in Dakota Access.\n\n## Tesoro High Plains Pipeline\n\nIn early July 2020, MPLX received a Notification of Trespass Determination from the Bureau of Indian Affairs  ('BIA')  relating  to  a  portion  of  the  Tesoro  High  Plains  Pipeline  that  crosses  the  Fort  Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. The notification covered the rights of way for 23 tracts of land and demanded the  immediate  cessation  of  pipeline  operations.  The  notification  also  assessed  trespass  damages  of approximately $187 million. MPLX appealed this determination, which triggered an automatic stay of the requested pipeline shutdown and payment. On October 29, the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs issued an order vacating the BIA's trespass order and requiring the Regional Director for the BIA Great Plains Region to issue a new decision on or before December 15 covering all 34 tracts at issue. On December 15, the  Regional  Director  of  the  BIA  issued  a  new  trespass  notice  to  THPP  consistent  with  the  Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs order vacating the prior trespass order. The new order found that THPP was in trespass  and  assessed  trespass  damages  of  approximately  $4MM  (including  interest).  The  order  also required THPP to immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue. The new order was appealed, and was upheld by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs. THPP has complied with the Regional Director's December 15, 2020 notice. On February 12, 2021, landowners filed suit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  North  Dakota,  requesting,  among  other  things,  that decisions by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs and the Interior Board of Indian Appeals be vacated as to the award of damages to plaintiffs.\n\nMPLX continues to work towards a settlement of this matter with holders of the property rights at issue.\n\n## Environmental Proceedings\n\nItem 103 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when  a  governmental  authority  is  a  party  to  the  proceedings  and  such  proceedings  involve  potential monetary sanctions, unless we reasonably believe that the matter will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary  sanctions,  exclusive  of  interest  and  costs,  of  less  than  $300,000.  The  following  matters  are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. We do not currently believe that the eventual outcome of any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.",

The NOVs were issued from 2011 to 2019 and allege violations of air quality regulations and the idled Martinez refinery's air permit. While we are negotiating a settlement of the allegations with the BAAQMD through two separate enforcement actions, we cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of these matters.\n\nOn July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice ('DOJ') lodged a complaint on behalf of the EPA and a Consent  Decree  in  the  U.S.  Court  for  the  Western  District  of  Texas.  Among  other  things,  the  Consent Decree required that the Martinez refinery meet certain annual emission limits for NOx by July 1, 2018. In February 2018, TRMC informed the EPA that it would need additional time to satisfy requirements of the Consent Decree. In the fourth quarter of 2019, TRMC and the United States entered into an agreement to amend the  Consent  Decree  to  resolve  these  issues.  In  light  of  the  actions  to  strategically  reposition  the Martinez  refinery  to  a  renewable  diesel  facility,  we  are  renegotiating  the  Consent  Decree  modification. Subject to final approval by the court, we expect that the renegotiated Consent Decree modification will no longer require the installation of a Selective Catalytic Reduction system to control NOx emissions from the now-idled fluid catalytic cracking unit, but will result in an increased civil penalty.\n\n## Gathering and Processing\n\nIn November 2020, we received an offer from the EPA to settle multiple alleged violations of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants by the Chapita, Coyote Wash, Island, River Bend and Wonsits  Valley  Compressor  Stations  in  Utah.  The  proposed  settlement  consists  of  an  injunctive  relief package,  mitigation  project  and  proposed  penalty  in  excess  of  $300,000.  We  continue  to  negotiate  a settlement of the allegations and cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of this matter.\n\n## ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot applicable.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAll statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are  inherently  uncertain.  See  'Disclosures  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements'  and  Item  1A.  Risk Factors  for  a  discussion  of  the  factors  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial  condition  should  also  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  information  included  under  Item  1. Business,  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,  Item  6.  Selected  Financial  Data  and  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and Supplementary Data.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n## Business Update\n\nThe  outbreak  of  COVID-19  and  its  development  into  a  pandemic  in  March  2020  have  resulted  in significant  economic  disruption  globally.  Actions  taken  by  various  governmental  authorities,  individuals and  companies  around  the  world  to  prevent  the  spread  of  COVID-19  through  social  distancing  have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe.\n\nThis has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity, including a dramatic reduction in airline flights  and  a  decrease  in  motor  vehicle  use.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  a  decline  in  the  demand  for  the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell, which coupled with a decline in the price of crude oil for most of 2020 resulted in a significant decrease in the price and volume of our production and sales of refined petroleum products.\n\nDuring 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.\n\nWe have been and continue to actively respond to the impacts that these matters are having on our business. Our response has focused on establishing three strategic short-term priorities:\n\n## Strengthen Competitive Position of Assets\n\nWe  are  committed  to  positioning  our  assets  so  that  we  are  a  leader  in  operational,  financial,  and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With  our  investments  we  are  focused  on  high  returning  projects  that  we  believe  will  enhance  the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.\n\n## Improve Commercial Performance\n\nWe are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to  be  more  dynamic  amidst  changing  market  conditions,  and  achieving  technology  improvements  to advance our commercial performance.\n\n## Lower Cost Structure\n\nWe are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and driving operational improvements. In response to the pandemic, in March of 2020, we committed to immediately reducing our capital spending and operating expenses. We accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our  capital  spending  levels  by  over  $1.4  billion  from  our  initial  2020  plans.  We  also  reduced  our  2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of $950 million.\n\nIn  connection  with  these  three  strategic  short-term  priorities,  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020  we  announced strategic  actions  to  lay  a  foundation  for  long-term  success,  including  plans  to  optimize  our  assets  and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond. These actions included indefinitely idling the Gallup refinery, initiating  actions  to  strategically  reposition  the  Martinez  refinery  to  a  renewable  diesel  facility  and  the approval  of  an  involuntary  workforce  reduction  plan.  In  connection  with  these  strategic  actions,  we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",

        "page_content": "In addition to these measures to address our operations, throughout the year we took action to address our liquidity as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Share repurchases were temporarily suspended. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions.\n- \u00b7 On April 27, 2020, we entered into an additional $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which  expires  in  2021,  to  provide  incremental  liquidity  and  financial  flexibility  during  the commodity  price  and  demand  downturn.  In  February  2021,  we  elected  to  terminate  this  credit agreement as we no longer believe the facility is necessary as an additional source for liquidity, and we do not intend to replace it.\n- \u00b7 On April 27, 2020, we closed on the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes. Proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down certain amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.\n- \u00b7 During June 2020, we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.\n- \u00b7 On September 23, 2020, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement, which provides for a  $1.0  billion  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  that  matures  in  September  2021,  and  which replaced a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\n- \u00b7 At  December  31,  2020,  we  had  $6.73  billion  available  on  our  variable  credit  facilities,  net  of commercial paper borrowings of $1.02 billion.\n\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides. However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC has been and will likely continue to be significant. We believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of COVID-19 to the extent possible and will strive to continue to do so, but there can be no guarantee the measures will be fully effective.\n\n## Other Strategic Updates\n\nThe Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable fuels facility began ramping operations at the end of 2020 and is on-track  to  reach  full  production  by  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  2021.  At  full  capacity,  the  facility  is expected  to  produce  184  million  gallons  per  year  of  renewable  diesel  from  corn  and  soybean  oil.  MPC intends to sell the renewable diesel into the California market to comply with the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  also  progressed  activities  associated  with  the  conversion  of  the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock  suppliers,  and  beginning  detailed  engineering  activities.  As  envisioned,  the  Martinez  facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.  On February 24, 2021, MPC's board of directors approved these plans.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of its outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to  effect  the  repurchases,  which  could  include  open  market  repurchases,  negotiated  block  transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected  through  Rule  10b5-1  plans.  The  timing  and  amount  of  repurchases  will  depend  upon  several factors,  including  market  and  business  conditions,  and  repurchases  may  be  initiated,  suspended  or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  1,473,843  MPLX  common  units  were  repurchased  at  an average cost per unit of $22.29. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $33 million and $967 million of repurchase authorization remained outstanding on the program as of December 31, 2020.",

Net  income  attributable  to  MPC  decreased  $12.46 billion, or $19.10 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a loss in our Refining & Marketing segment, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $8.43 billion and impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion during the period primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices, and restructuring expenses of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction.\n\nThe loss from operations in our Refining & Marketing segment is primarily due to decreases in refined product sales volumes, prices and margins during 2020 and includes a charge of $561 million for the twelve months  ended  December  31,  2020  to  reflect  a  LIFO  liquidation  for  our  crude  oil  and  refined  product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers which were liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in increased cost of revenues and decreased income from operations. These results were partially offset by increased income from discontinued operations, which relates to Speedway, in  2020  compared to 2019 largely due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes. In addition, as of August 2, 2020, MPC ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations.\n\nRefer  to  the  Results  of  Operations  section  for  a  discussion  of  financial  results  by  segment  for  the  three years ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## MPLX\n\nWe received  limited  partner  distributions  of  $1.79  billion  and  $1.82  billion  from  MPLX  and  Andeavor Logistics LP ('ANDX') during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nWe owned approximately 647 million MPLX common units at December 31, 2020 with a market value of $14.02 billion based on the December 31, 2020 closing unit price of $21.65. On January 28, 2021, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6875 per common unit, which was paid February 12, 2021. As a result, MPLX made distributions totaling $714 million to its common unitholders. MPC's portion of this distribution was approximately $445 million.\n\nOn July 31, 2020, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) ('WRSW'), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, entered into a Redemption Agreement (the 'Redemption Agreement')  with  MPLX,  pursuant  to  which  MPLX  transferred  to  WRSW  all  of  the  outstanding membership interests in Western Refining Wholesale, LLC, ('WRW') in exchange for the redemption of MPLX  common  units  held  by  WRSW.  The  transaction  effected  the  transfer  to  MPC  of  the  Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of ANDX. Beginning in the  third  quarter  of  2020,  the  results  of  these  operations  are  presented  in  MPC's  Refining  &  Marketing segment.\n\nAt  the  closing,  per  the  terms  of  Redemption  Agreement,  MPLX  redeemed  18,582,088  MPLX  common units  held  by  WRSW.  The  number  of  redeemed  units  was  calculated  by  dividing  WRW's  aggregate valuation  of  $340  million  by  the  simple  average  of  the  volume  weighted  average  New  York  Stock Exchange prices of an MPLX common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on July 27, 2020. The transaction resulted in a minor decrease in MPC's ownership interest in MPLX.\n\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.",

Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  22  for  information  on  our  new  bank revolving credit facilities.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTS\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nRefining  &  Marketing  segment  income  from  operations  depends  largely  on  our  Refining  &  Marketing margin,  refining  operating  costs,  refining  planned  turnarounds,  distribution  costs,  depreciation  expenses and refinery throughputs. Our total refining capacity was 2,874 mbpcd, 3,067 mbpcd and 3,021 mbpcd as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nOur Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison",

        "page_content": "with other industry participants, we calculate Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Gulf  Coast  crack  spread  uses  three  barrels  of  LLS  crude  producing  two  barrels  of  USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD;\n- \u00b7 The Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and\n- \u00b7 The  West  Coast  crack  spread  uses  three  barrels  of  ANS  crude  producing  two  barrels  of  LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel.\n\nOur refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.\n\nFuture crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.\n\nThe  following  table  provides  sensitivities  showing  an  estimated  change  in  annual  net  income  due  to potential changes in market conditions.\n\n|                                                                 | (In millions, after-tax)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Blended crack spread sensitivity (a)  (per $1.00/barrel change) | $  838                     |\n| Sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change)     | 396                        |\n| Sweet differential sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change)    | 381                        |\n| Natural gas price sensitivity (d) (per $1.00/MMBtu)             | 275                        |\n\nIn  addition  to  the  market  changes  indicated  by  the  crack  spreads,  the  sour  differential  and  the  sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the selling prices realized for refined products;\n- \u00b7 the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;\n- \u00b7 our refinery yields;\n- \u00b7 the cost of products purchased for resale;\n- \u00b7 the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;\n- \u00b7 the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices: and\n- \u00b7 the  potential  impact  of  LIFO  liquidation  charges  due  to  draw-downs  from  historic  inventory levels.\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. At December 31, 2020, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.",

        "page_content": "Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs  and  refining  planned  turnaround  costs  in  addition  to  committed  distribution  costs.  Changes  in operating  costs  are  primarily  driven  by  the  cost  of  energy  used  by  our  refineries,  including  purchased natural  gas,  and  the  level  of  maintenance  costs.  Refining  planned  turnarounds,  requiring  temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with MPLX, as discussed below, which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.\n\nThe  following  table  lists  the  refineries  that  had  significant  planned  turnaround  and  major  maintenance activities  for  each  of  the  last  three  years  and  only  reflects  the  activity  for  the  acquired  refineries  after October 1, 2018.\n\n|   Year | Refinery                                                                                          |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2020 | Canton, Catlettsburg, El Paso, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Kenai, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City    |\n|   2019 | Catlettsburg, Gallup, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles, Martinez, Robinson and St. Paul Park |\n|   2018 | Canton, Detroit, Galveston Bay and Martinez                                                       |\n\nWe  have  various  long-term,  fee-based  commercial  agreements  with  MPLX.  Under  these  agreements, MPLX,  which  is  reported  in  our  Midstream  segment,  provides  transportation,  storage,  distribution  and marketing  services  to  our  Refining  &  Marketing  segment.  Certain  of  these  agreements  include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include  commitments  to  pay  for  100  percent  of  available  capacity  for  certain  marine  transportation  and refining logistics assets.\n\n## Midstream\n\nOur  Midstream  segment  transports,  stores,  distributes  and  markets  crude  oil  and  refined  products, principally  for  our  Refining  &  Marketing  segment.  The  profitability  of  our  pipeline  transportation operations  primarily  depends  on  tariff  rates  and  the  volumes  shipped  through  the  pipelines.  The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges.  The  profitability  of  our  light  product  terminal  operations  primarily  depends  on  the  throughput volumes  at  these  terminals.  The  profitability  of  our  fuels  distribution  services  primarily  depends  on  the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining  &  Marketing  segment  and  our  refining  logistics  assets  and  fuels  distribution  services  are  used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment.\n\nAs  discussed  above  in  the  Refining  &  Marketing  section,  MPLX,  which  is  reported  in  our  Midstream segment,  has  various  long-term,  fee-based  commercial  agreements  related  to  services  provided  to  our Refining  &  Marketing  segment.  Under  these  agreements,  MPLX  has  received  various  commitments  of minimum throughput, storage and distribution  volumes  as  well  as  commitments  to  pay  for  all  available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume  of  refined  products  that  we  transport,  store,  distribute  and  market  is  directly  affected  by  the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the  fall  and  winter  months.  As  with  crude  oil,  other  transportation  alternatives  and  system  maintenance levels influence refined product movements.\n\nOur Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability  of  NGL  transportation  and  fractionation  capacity  and  a  variety  of  additional  factors  that  are beyond  our  control.  Our  Midstream  segment  profitability  is  affected  by  prevailing  commodity  prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third -party processing plants, purchasing",

These changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income  from  discontinued  operations,  which  represents  Speedway.  See  Segment  Results  for  additional information.\n\nTotal revenues and other income decreased $42.83 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n\n- \u00b7 decreased sales and other operating revenues of $41.37 billion primarily due to decreased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, or 14 percent, and lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.55 per gallon, or 31 percent, largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 decreased income from equity method investments of $1.25 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices; and\n- \u00b7 decreased net gain on disposal of assets of $208 million mainly due to the absence of $259 million of  non-cash  gains  related  to  obtaining  equity  investments  in  Capline  Pipeline  Company  LLC ('Capline LLC') and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019. This decrease was  offset  by  net  gains  on  disposal  of  assets  in  2020  largely  due  to  the  sale  of  three  asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.\n\nTotal costs and expenses decreased $26.12 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n\n- \u00b7 decreased  cost  of  revenues  of  $33.50  billion  primarily  due  to  reduced  travel  and  business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $561 million to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the LIFO liquidation charge;\n- \u00b7 impairment expense of $8.43 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and long-lived assets of $7.39 billion  and  $1.03  billion,  respectively,  primarily  driven  by  the  effects  of  COVID-19  and  the decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the  repositioning  of  the  Martinez  refinery  compared  to  impairment  expense  of  $1.20  billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;\n- \u00b7 decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses;\n- \u00b7 restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for additional information; and\n- \u00b7 increased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses.\n\nNet interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for further details.\n\nProvision  for  income  taxes  decreased  $3.21  billion  primarily  due  to  decreased  income  before  taxes  of $16.85  billion.  The  effective  tax  rate  of  18  percent  in  2020  is  lower  than  the  U.S.  statutory  rate  of  21 percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating",

Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset  by  permanent  tax  differences  related  to  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests.  See Item 8.

We capitalized interest of $158 million in 2019 and $80 million in 2018. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for further details.\n\nProvision for income taxes on continuing operations increased $20 million primarily due to non-deductible goodwill impairments partially offset by decreased income from continuing operations $464 million. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The effective tax rate  of  21  percent  in  2018  is  consistent  with  the  U.S.  statutory  rate  of  21  percent,  as  permanent  benefit differences  related  to  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interest  were  offset  by  state  and  local  tax expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further details.\n\nNoncontrolling interests decreased $214 million mainly due lower MPLX net income primarily as a result of the $1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019.",

Changes in fuel sales volumes were primarily due to the effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  which  resulted  in  restricted  travel,  social  distancing  and  reduced business  operations.  In  addition,  fuel  sales  volumes  decreased  as  a  result  of  an  agreement  between Speedway and Pilot Travel Centers ('PTC'), effective October 1, 2019, in which PTC supplies, prices and sells  diesel  fuel  at  certain  Speedway  and  PTC  locations  with  both  companies  sharing  in  the  diesel  fuel margins.\n\nBeginning  August  2,  2020,  in  accordance  with  ASC  360,  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment,  we  ceased recording  depreciation  and  amortization  for  Speedway's  property,  plant  and  equipment,  finite-lived intangible  assets  and  right  of  use  lease  assets.  As  a  result,  Speedway  depreciation  and  amortization  was $244 million and $413 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe  Speedway  fuel  margin  increased  to  34.52  cents  per  gallon  in  2020  compared  with  24.34  cents  per gallon in 2019.\n\n## 2019 Compared to 2018\n\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $133 million primarily due to higher fuel and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the Andeavor retail operations. These increases were partially  offset  by  increases  in  operating  expenses  and  depreciation  primarily  related  to  the  locations acquired from Andeavor.\n\nThe  Speedway  fuel  margin  increased  to  24.34  cents  per  gallon  in  2019  compared  with  21.22  cents  per gallon in 2018.",

Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of $9.75 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018.

This was a decrease of $1.06 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.02 due to lower refinery throughput, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity. Net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020\n\nDistribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.08 billion and $5.13 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively,  and  include  fees  paid  to  MPLX  of  $3.46  billion  and  $3.22  billion  for  2020  and 2019,  respectively.  On  a  per  barrel  basis,  distribution  costs,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization, increased $0.85 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs.\n\nRefining  planned  turnaround  costs  increased  $92  million,  or  $0.23  per  barrel,  due  to  the  timing  of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput.\n\nDepreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.38, primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs.\n\nWe purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs  were  $606  million  in  2020  and  $356  million  in  2019  and  are  included  in  Refining  &  Marketing margin. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs, partially offset by a decrease in our RIN obligations.\n\n## 2019 Compared to 2018\n\nRefining & Marketing segment revenues increased $24.6 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher  refined  product  sales  volumes,  which  increased  1,032  mbpd,  largely  due  to  the  acquisition  of Andeavor on October 1, 2018, partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of $.09 per gallon.\n\nRefinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2019 and net refinery throughputs increased 838 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from Andeavor.\n\nRefining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $202 million primarily due to a full year of direct dealer sales and an increase in Refining & Marketing margin on a per barrel basis partially offset by  higher  operating,  distribution  and  depreciation  and  amortization  costs.  The  increases  in  costs  and expenses  were  primarily  due  to  increased  sales  and  production  volumes  following  the  Andeavor acquisition.\n\nRefining  &  Marketing  margin  was  $14.77  per  barrel  for  2019  compared  to  $14.50  per  barrel  for  2018. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of $4.46 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to an approximate $5.35 billion benefit from increased throughput volume, mainly attributed to  the  Andeavor  acquisition,  partially  offset  by  narrower  sour  and  sweet  crude  oil  differentials.  Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances and direct dealer fuel margin. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $370 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting in a capture rate of 96 percent in 2019 compared to 92 percent in 2018.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $6.42 billion. This was an increase of $2.28 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.67. Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.13 billion and $3.52 billion, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.22 billion and $2.28 billion, for 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was an increase of $1.61 billion,  or  $0.28  per  barrel.  Excluding  depreciation  and  amortization,  refining  operating  costs  and distribution costs increased primarily due to the inclusion of costs for the refining operations acquired from Andeavor.  The  per  barrel  increases,  among  other  items,  reflect  the  addition  of  Andeavor's  West  Coast",

During 2019, we recorded a $0.01 per barrel adjustment to reduce depreciation and amortization, which reflects the cumulative effects related to a measurement period adjustment arising from the finalization of purchase accounting.\n\nWe purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $356 million in 2019 and $316 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase  in  our  RIN  obligations  resulting  from  the  acquisition  of  Andeavor,  partially  offset  by  lower weighted average RIN costs.\n\n## Supplemental Refining & Marketing Statistics\n\n|                                                  | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Refining & Marketing Operating Statistics        |        |        |        |\n| Refined product export sales volumes  (mbpd) (a) | 340    | 397    | 334    |\n| Crude oil capacity utilization percent (b)       | 82     | 96     | 96     |\n| Refinery throughputs ( mbpd ):                   |        |        |        |\n| Crude oil refined                                | 2,418  | 2,902  | 2,081  |\n| Other charge and blendstocks                     | 165    | 210    | 193    |\n| Net refinery throughput                          | 2,583  | 3,112  | 2,274  |\n| Sour crude oil throughput percent                | 49     | 48     | 52     |\n| Sweet crude oil throughput percent               | 51     | 52     | 48     |\n| Refined product yields ( mbpd ):                 |        |        |        |\n| Gasoline                                         | 1,314  | 1,560  | 1,107  |\n| Distillates                                      | 905    | 1,087  | 773    |\n| Feedstocks and petrochemicals                    | 244    | 315    | 288    |\n| Asphalt                                          | 81     | 87     | 69     |\n| Propane                                          | 51     | 55     | 41     |\n| Heavy fuel oil                                   | 28     | 49     | 38     |\n| Total                                            | 2,623  | 3,153  | 2,316  |",

Accounts payable decreased primarily  due  to  lower  crude  payable  prices.  Current  receivables  decreased primarily due to lower crude and refined product receivable prices and refined product volumes. Inventories decreased mainly due to decreases in refined product, crude and materials & supplies inventories.\n\nFor 2019, changes in working capital were a net $357 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases  in  energy  commodity  prices  and  volumes  on  working  capital.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for additional information on our long-term debt.\n- \u00b7 Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $1.95 billion in 2019 and $3.29 billion in 2018. See the 'Capital Requirements' section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.\n- \u00b7 Cash  used  in  dividend  payments  totaled  $1.51  billion  in  2020,  $1.40  billion  in  2019  and  $954 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases in 2019. The increase in 2019 was primarily  due  a  net  increase  in  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  due  to  the  approximate  239.8 million shares issued in connection with the Andeavor acquisition and a $0.28 per share increase in  our  base  dividend,  partially  offset  by  a  reduction  of  shares  resulting  from  share  repurchases. Dividends per share were $2.32 in 2020, $2.12 in 2019 and $1.84 in 2018.\n- \u00b7 Distributions  to  noncontrolling  interests  increased  $342  million  in  2019  compared  to  2018, primarily due to increases in MPLX units outstanding and MPLX's distribution per common unit. Distributions to noncontrolling interests included ANDX's distribution per common unit paid in the  first  and  second  quarter  of  2019,  prior  to  the  merger  of  ANDX  and  MPLX,  and  the  fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\n## MPC, Excluding MPLX\n\nWe control MPLX through our ownership of the general partner, however, the creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC's general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements. The assets of MPLX can only  be  used  to  settle  its  own  obligations  and  its  creditors  have  no  recourse  to  our  assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, share repurchases were temporarily suspended, which has helped preserve our liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The timing and amount of future repurchases  will  depend  upon  several  factors,  including  market  and  business  conditions,  and  such repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nOn August 2,  2020,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  our  company-owned  and operated  retail  transportation  fuel  and  convenience  store  business,  to  7-Eleven  for  $21  billion  in  cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. This transaction is expected to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion. The company expects to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\n\nAdditionally, we have recorded an income tax receivable within other current assets in our balance sheet of approximately $2.1 billion which is expected to be received during the second half of 2021.\n\nWe established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2 billion in commercial paper  outstanding,  with  maturities  up  to  397  days  from  the  date  of  issuance.  We  do  not  intend  to  have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.02 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program, which matures on various dates in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nOn September 23, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. This revolving credit agreement provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and replaces a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement that provided for a $1.0 billion unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  that  was  scheduled  to  mature  in  April  2021.  In  February  2021,  we elected  to  terminate  this  credit  agreement.  This  facility  provided  MPC  additional  liquidity  and  financial flexibility  during  the  then  ongoing  commodity  price  and  demand  downturn.  We  no  longer  believe  the facility  is  necessary  as  an  additional  source  for  liquidity,  and  we  do  not  intend  to  replace  it.  No  early termination fees were incurred by MPC in connection with the termination of this credit agreement.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, we closed on the issuance of $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in  a  public  offering,  consisting  of  $1.25  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  4.500%  unsecured  senior notes due May 2023 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% unsecured senior notes due May 2025. MPC used the net proceeds from this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its five-year revolving credit facility.\n\nThe  MPC  credit  agreements  and  our  trade  receivables  facility  contain  representations  and  warranties, affirmative  and  negative  covenants  and  events  of  default  that  we  consider  usual  and  customary  for agreements of these types. The financial covenant requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. Other covenants restrict us and/or certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPC credit agreements and our trade receivables facility, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.37 to 1.00.\n\nOur intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of February 1, 2021, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows.\n\n| Company   | Rating Agency     | Rating                  |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| MPC       | Moody's           | Baa2 (negative outlook) |\n|           | Standard & Poor's | BBB (negative outlook)  |\n|           | Fitch             | BBB (negative outlook)  |\n\nThe ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies.

In addition, a downgrade of our  senior  unsecured  debt  rating  to  below  investment-grade  levels  could,  under  certain  circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.\n\nSee Item 8.

The net proceeds were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under the MPLX term loan agreement, to repay the $1.0  billion  floating  rate  senior  notes  due  September  2021,  to  redeem  all  of  the  $300  million  aggregate principal  amount  of  MPLX's  6.250%  senior  notes  due  October  2022  and  to  redeem  the  $450  million aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.375%  senior  notes  due  May  2024,  including  the  portion  of  such  notes issued by ANDX. The remaining proceeds were used for general business purposes.\n\nThe  MPLX  credit  agreement  contains  certain  representations  and  warranties,  affirmative  and  restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The financial covenant requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal  quarters  of  no  greater  than  5.0  to  1.0  (or  5.5  to  1.0  for  up  to  two  fiscal  quarters  following  certain acquisitions).  Consolidated  EBITDA  is  subject  to  adjustments  for  certain  acquisitions  completed  and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX was in compliance with the covenants, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.8 to 1.0.\n\nOur intention  is  to  maintain  an  investment-grade  credit  profile  for  MPLX.

The  2021  capital investment plan for MPC and MPLX and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below.\n\n| (In millions)                             | 2021 Plan   | 2020     | 2019     | 2018     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Capital expenditures and investments: (a) |             |          |          |          |\n| MPC, excluding MPLX                       |             |          |          |          |\n| Refining & Marketing                      | $  1,050    | $  1,170 | $  2,045 | $  1,077 |\n| Midstream - Other                         | 50          | 221      | 360      | 70       |\n| Corporate and Other (b)                   | 150         | 80       | 100      | 77       |\n| Total MPC, excluding MPLX                 | $  1,250    | $  1,471 | $  2,505 | $  1,224 |\n| MPC discontinued operations - Speedway    | $  150      | $  277   | $  561   | $  440   |\n| Midstream - MPLX (c)                      | $  1,000    | $  1,177 | $  2,930 | $  2,560 |\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nThe Refining & Marketing segment's forecasted 2021 capital spending and investments is approximately $1.05  billion.  This  amount  includes  approximately  $800  million  of  growth  capital  focused  on  on-going projects, such as the first phase of the Martinez facility conversion, the STAR project, and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs. Maintenance capital is expected to be $250 million.\n\nMajor  capital  projects  completed  over  the  last  three  years  have  prepared  us  to  increase  our  diesel production,  process  light  crude  oil,  increase  our  export  capabilities  and  meet  the  transportation  fuel regulatory mandate (Tier 3 fuel standards). In addition, the STAR investment project at our Galveston Bay refinery is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022.\n\n## Midstream\n\nMPLX's capital investment plan includes $800 million of organic growth capital and approximately $200 million  of  maintenance  capital.  This  growth  plan  is  focused  on  investments  in  projects  that  deliver  the highest  returns  as  we  continue  to  optimize  our  assets.  These  investments  are  focused  on  crude  oil  and natural gas logistics systems to transport products from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast and increase our",

This provides for additional flexibility and competitive advantages in how we operate our  assets  as  these  projects  further  enhance  our  full  value  chain  capture.  Other  investments  include  the addition  of  approximately  400  MMcf/d  of  processing  capacity  at  two  gas  processing  plants,  one  in  the Marcellus region which is expected to be completed in 2021, and one in the Southwest region, which is expected to be completed in 2022.\n\nMajor capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure to support MPLX's producer customers, primarily in the Marcellus, Utica and Permian regions and development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects.\n\nThe  remaining  Midstream segment's  forecasted  2021  capital  spend,  excluding  MPLX,  is  approximately $50 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliates.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nThe  2021  capital  forecast  includes  approximately  $150  million  to  support  corporate  activities.  Major projects over the last three years included upgrades to information technology systems.\n\n## Speedway\n\nSpeedway's 2021 capital forecast for the first  quarter  of  approximately  $150  million  is  focused  on  new store growth in existing and new markets, commercial fueling/diesel expansion, food service through store remodels and equipment replacement/store maintenance.\n\nMajor  capital  projects  over  the  last  three  years  included  converting  recently  acquired  locations  to  the Speedway brand and systems, building new store locations, remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core  markets  and  building  out  our  network  of  commercial  fueling  lane  locations  to  capitalize  on  diesel demand growth.\n\n## Dividends\n\nOn January 29, 2021, we announced our board of directors approved a $0.58 per share dividend, payable March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2021.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  share  repurchases  were  temporarily  suspended,  which  has helped  preserve  our  liquidity  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  timing  and  amount  of  future repurchases  will  depend  upon  several  factors,  including  market  and  business  conditions,  and  such repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors  has  approved  $18.0  billion  in  total  share  repurchase  authorizations  and  we  have  repurchased  a total of $15.0 billion of our common stock, leaving approximately $3.0 billion available for repurchases as of December 31, 2020. Under these authorizations, we have acquired 327 million shares at an average cost per  share  of  $46.05.  The  table  below  summarizes  our  total  share  repurchases.  See  Item  8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.\n\n| (In millions, except per share data)   | 2020   | 2019     | 2018     |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Number of shares repurchased           | -      | 34       | 47       |\n| Cash paid for shares repurchased       | $  -   | $  1,950 | $  3,287 |\n| Average cost per share                 | $  -   | $  58.87 | $  69.46 |\n\nWe may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans.\n\n## MPLX Unit Repurchases\n\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of MPLX's outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions,  tender  offers,  accelerated  unit  repurchases  or  open  market  solicitations  for  units,  some  of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\n\nWe  have  incurred  and  may  continue  to  incur  substantial  capital,  operating  and  maintenance,  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely  affected.  We  believe  that  substantially  all  of  our  competitors  must  comply  with  similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  age  and  location  of  its  operating  facilities,  marketing  areas, production  processes  and  whether  it  is  also  engaged  in  the  petrochemical  business  or  the  marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.\n\nLegislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers.\n\nOur  environmental  expenditures,  including  non-regulatory  expenditures,  for  each  of  the  last  three  years were:\n\n| (In millions)             | 2020   | 2019     | 2018   |\n|---------------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Capital                   | $  121 | $  528   | $  360 |\n| Compliance: (a)           |        |          |        |\n| Operating and maintenance | 469    | 547      | 493    |\n| Remediation (b)           | 40     | 56       | 31     |\n| Total                     | $  630 | $  1,131 | $  884 |\n\nWe accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of  associated  costs  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  As  environmental  remediation  matters  proceed toward  ultimate  resolution  or  as  additional  remediation  obligations  arise,  charges  in  excess  of  those previously accrued may be required.\n\nNew or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. It is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.\n\nOur  environmental  capital  expenditures  accounted  for  6  percent,  12  percent  and  11  percent  of  capital expenditures,  for  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively,  excluding  acquisitions.  Our  environmental  capital expenditures are expected to approximate $39 million, or 2 percent, of total planned capital expenditures in 2021. Actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result  of  improved  technology  or  changes  in  regulatory  requirements  and  could  increase  if  additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.\n\nFor more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1.

        "page_content": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\n\n## Fair Value Estimates\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair  value  of  assets  and  liabilities:  the  market  approach,  the  income  approach  and  the  cost  approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service  capacity  of  an  asset.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  current  replacement  cost.  The  cost  approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.\n\nThe  fair  value  accounting  standards  do  not  prescribe  which  valuation  technique  should  be  used  when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.\n\nValuation  techniques  that  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  are  favored.  Assets  and  liabilities  are classified  in  their  entirety  based  on  the  lowest  priority  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement.  The  assessment  of  the  significance  of  a  particular  input  to  the  fair  value  measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the  best  information  available.  See  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  20  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.\n\nSignificant uses of fair value measurements include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;\n- \u00b7 assessment of impairment of intangible assets:\n- \u00b7 assessment of impairment of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 assessment of impairment of equity method investments;\n- \u00b7 recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and\n- \u00b7 recorded values of derivative instruments.",

Significant judgment is involved in performing these  fair  value  estimates  since  the  results  are  based  on  forecasted  financial  information  prepared  using significant assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Future operating performance .  Our  estimates  of  future  operating  performance  are  based  on  our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity,  our  planned  utilization  rate,  end-user  demand,  capital  expenditures  and  economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.\n- \u00b7 Future volumes . Our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas  liquid  processing  volumes  are  based  on  internal  forecasts  prepared  by  our  Refining  & Marketing  and  Midstream  segments  operations  personnel.  Assumptions  about  the  effects  of COVID-19 on our future volumes are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic, which is difficult to forecast.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved .  We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  market  and  economic  conditions,  operational  risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Future capital requirements . These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.\n\nAssumptions about the effects of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and  contingent  upon  the  duration  of  the  pandemic  and  its  impact  on  the  macroeconomic  environment, which is difficult to forecast. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections.\n\nThe need to test  for  impairment  can  be  based  on  several  indicators,  including  a  significant  reduction  in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline  throughput  volumes,  a  significant  reduction  in  natural  gas  or  natural  gas  liquids  processed,  a significant  reduction  in  refining  margins,  other  changes  to  contracts  or  changes  in  the  regulatory environment.  The  following  sections  detail  our  critical  accounting  estimates  related  to  impairment assessments for long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments.\n\n## Long-lived Asset Impairment Assessments\n\nLong-lived  assets  used  in  operations  are  assessed  for  impairment  whenever  changes  in  facts  and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, and the plant level  or  pipeline  system  level  for  Midstream  segment  assets.  If  the  sum  of  the  undiscounted  estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value. The Company's consolidated long-lived asset balance was $43 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment as a result of decreases to the Refining & Marketing  segment  expected  future  cash  flows.  The  cash  flows  associated  with  these  assets  were significantly  impacted  by  the  effects  of  COVID-19  and  commodity  price  declines.  We  assessed  each refinery  asset  group  for  impairment  by  comparing  the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash  flows  to  the carrying  value  of  each  asset  group.  Of  the  16  refinery  asset  groups,  only  the  Gallup  refinery's  carrying value exceeded its undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows. It was determined that the fair value of the Gallup refinery's property, plant and equipment was less than the carrying value. As a result, we recorded a charge of $142 million in the first quarter of 2020 to impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurements for the Gallup refinery assets represent Level 3 measurements.",

        "page_content": "During the second quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment, except the Gallup refinery which had been impaired in the first quarter, as a result of continued macroeconomic developments impacting the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. All of these refinery asset groups undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the carrying value by at least 17 percent.\n\nOn  August  3,  2020,  we  announced  our  plans  to  evaluate  possibilities  to  strategically  reposition  our Martinez  refinery,  including  the  potential  conversion  of  the  refinery  into  a  renewable  diesel  facility. Subsequent  to  August  3,  2020,  we  progressed  activities  associated  with  the  conversion  of  the  Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers,  and  beginning  detailed  engineering  activities.  As  envisioned,  the  Martinez  facility  would  start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. As a result of the progression of these activities, we identified assets that would be repurposed and utilized in a renewable diesel facility configuration and assets that would be abandoned since they had no function in a renewable diesel facility configuration. This change in our intended use for the Martinez refinery is a longlived asset impairment trigger for the assets that would be repurposed and remain as part of the Martinez asset group. We assessed the asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash  flows  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  group  and  the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash  flows exceeded the Martinez asset group carrying value. We recorded impairment expense of $342 million for the abandoned assets as we are no longer using these assets and have no expectation to use these assets in the future.  Additionally,  as  a  result  of  our  efforts  to  progress  the  conversion  of  Martinez  refinery  into  a renewable  diesel  facility,  MPLX  cancelled  in-process  capital  projects  related  to  its  Martinez  refinery logistics operations resulting in impairments of $27 million in the third quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded the evaluation of our intended use of MPLX terminal assets near the Gallup refinery and determined that the assets were abandoned, resulting in an impairment charge of  $67  million.  Following  this  conclusion,  we  revised  the  estimate  of  the  salvage  value  for  the  Gallup refinery asset group resulting in an additional $44 million impairment charge. These charges are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for our long-lived asset impairment tests utilized significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows, allocation of certain Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to the individual refineries, the estimated useful lives of the asset groups, and the salvage values of the refineries. The determinations of expected future cash flows and the salvage values of refineries require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may determine the carrying values of additional refinery asset groups exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of their refinery asset groups, which would result in future impairment charges.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, MPLX identified an impairment trigger relating to asset groups within its Western  Gathering  &  Processing  ('G&P')  reporting  unit  as  a  result  of  significant  changes  to  expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices. MPLX assessed each asset group within the Western G&P reporting unit for impairment. It was determined that the fair value of the East Texas G&P asset group's underlying assets was less than the carrying value. As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges  totaling  $350  million  related  to  its  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangibles,  which  are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income. Fair value of MPLX's PP&E was  determined  using  a  combination  of  an  income  and  cost  approach.  The  income  approach  utilized significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group. The cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which  is  an  income  approach.  Key  assumptions  included  management's  best  estimates  of  the  expected future  cash  flows  from  existing  customers,  customer  attrition  rates  and  the  discount  rate.  Fair  value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the",

The fair value measurements for the asset group fair values represent Level 3 measurements.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments\n\nUnlike long-lived assets, goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing at the reporting unit level. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  without  exceeding  the  recorded  amount  of  goodwill.  As  of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $8.26 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, which was associated with four of our eight reporting units. An additional reporting unit, Speedway, has goodwill of $4.4 billion and is reported within assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, its development into a pandemic and the decline in commodity prices during the first quarter of 2020 had significant effects on our business. See 'Business Update' in Item 1. Business above. Due to these developments, we performed impairment assessments during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed further below.\n\nPrior to performing our goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2020, we had goodwill totaling approximately $20 billion associated with eight of our 10 reporting units. As part of this assessment, we recorded  goodwill  impairment  of  $7.33  billion  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  related  to  our  Refining  & Marketing and MPLX's Eastern Gathering & Processing reporting units. The Refining & Marketing and Eastern Gathering & Processing reporting units recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5.52 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively, which fully impaired both reporting units' historical goodwill balances. These goodwill impairment expenses are primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19, the decline in commodity prices and the slowing of drilling activity which has reduced production growth forecasts from MPLX's producer customers. For the remaining six reporting units with goodwill, we determined that no significant adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. The impairment assessment performed as of March  31,  2020  resulted  in  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  units  exceeding  their  carrying  value  by percentages ranging from approximately 8.5 percent to 270.0 percent. MPLX's Crude Gathering reporting unit had goodwill totaling $1.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and MPLX's fair value estimate for this reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit carrying value by 8.5 percent. The operations that make up this reporting unit were acquired by MPLX when it acquired ANDX. We accounted for the October 1, 2018 acquisition of Andeavor (through which we acquired control of ANDX), using the acquisition method of accounting, which required Andeavor assets and liabilities to be recorded at the acquisition date fair value. As such, given the short amount of time from when fair value was established to the date of the impairment test, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value within this reporting unit is not unexpected. An increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2020. No other reporting units had fair values exceeding carrying values of less than 20 percent.\n\nPrior  to  performing  our  annual  impairment  assessment  as  of  November  30,  2020,  MPC  had  goodwill totaling  approximately  $8.26  billion  associated  with  four  reporting  units.  Additionally,  a  fifth  reporting unit, Speedway, is reported in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and has $4.4 billion of goodwill. Management performed a qualitative assessment for three reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values. A quantitative assessment was last performed on these reporting units either on November 30, 2019 or March 31, 2020 and these reporting units' fair values exceeded carrying values by a range of approximately 90 percent to 270 percent. A quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units which resulted in  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  units  exceeding  their  carrying  value  by  percentages  ranging  from approximately 9 percent to 42 percent. The reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 9 percent, our Crude Gathering Reporting unit, had goodwill totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit is consistent with prior assessments. An increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of November 30, 2020.\n\nSignificant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted by future margins on products produced or sold, future volumes, and capital requirements, were to decline, the overall reporting units' fair values would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying",

As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\n\n## Equity Method Investment Impairment Assessment\n\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than  its  carrying  value,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  value  or  the  investee's  inability  to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded $1.32 billion of equity method investment impairment charges to income from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of income. The impairment charges primarily related to MPLX recording an other than temporary impairment totaling $1.26 billion, of which $1.25 billion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C  and  its  investment  in  Ohio  Gathering  Company,  L.L.C.  The  fair  value  of  the  investments  was determined  based  upon  applying  the  discounted  cash  flow  method,  which  is  an  income  approach.  The discounted  cash  flow  fair  value  estimate  is  based  on  known  or  knowable  information  at  the  interim measurement date. The significant  assumptions  that  were  used  to  develop  the  estimate  of  the  fair  value under the discounted cash flow method include management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of these equity method investments represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The impairment was recorded through 'Income from equity method investments.' The impairments were largely due to a reduction in forecasted volumes gathered and processed by the systems operated by the joint ventures. At December 31, 2020,  we  had  $5.42  billion  of  investments  in  equity  method  investments  recorded  on  our  consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the  numerous  assumptions  (e.g.,  pricing,  volumes  and  discount  rates)  that  can  materially  affect  our estimates.  That  is,  unfavorable  adjustments  to  some  of  the  above  listed  assumptions  may  be  offset  by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.\n\nSee  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  17  for  additional  information  on  our equity  method  investments.  See  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  19  for additional  information  on  our  goodwill  and  intangibles,  including  a  table  summarizing  our  recorded goodwill by segment.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn accounting for business combinations, acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are  recorded  based  on  estimated  fair  values  as  of  the  date  of  acquisition.  The  excess  or  shortfall  of  the purchase  price  when  compared  to  the  fair  value  of  the  net  tangible  and  identifiable  intangible  assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these  fair  value  determinations  and,  for  certain  acquisitions,  engage  third-party  consultants  for  valuation assistance.\n\nThe fair  value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  including  contingent  consideration,  as  of  the  acquisition  date  are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project  future  cash  flows  and  apply  an  appropriate  discount  rate;  the  cost  approach,  which  requires estimates  of  replacement  costs  and  depreciation  and  obsolescence  estimates;  and  the  market  approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value.\n\nSee  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  8  for  additional  information  on  our acquisitions.  See  Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Note  20  for  additional information on fair value measurements.",

Substantially  all  of  our  commodity  derivatives  are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity  is  a  VIE.  Our  interests  in  a  VIE  are  referred  to  as  variable  interests.  Variable  interests  can  be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could  potentially  be significant to the VIE. We consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated.\n\nSignificant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We  use  a  primarily  qualitative  analysis  to  determine  if  we  are  deemed  to  have  a  controlling  financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.\n\nChanges in the design or nature of the activities of a VIE, or our involvement with a VIE, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a VIE and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. Such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n\nVariable Interest Entities are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9.\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations\n\nAccounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;\n- \u00b7 the expected long-term return on plan assets;\n- \u00b7 the rate of future increases in compensation levels;\n- \u00b7 health care cost projections; and\n- \u00b7 the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.\n\nWe utilize  the  work  of  third-party  actuaries  to  assist  in  the  measurement  of  these  obligations.  We  have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected  benefit  payment  patterns  of  each  individual  plan.  The  selected  rates  are  compared  to  various similar bond indices for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuaries' discount rate models. These models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit  plan  cash  flows  using  yield  curves  derived  from  Aa  or  higher  corporate  bond  yields.  The  yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used have an average rating of Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.",

Decreasing  the  discount  rates  of  2.55  percent  for  our  pension  plans  and  2.60  percent  for  our  other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $110 million and $42 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $15 million and $3 million, respectively.\n\nThe long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various  assumptions  regarding  inflation  and  returns.  In  addition,  our  long-term  asset  rate  of  return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. We used the  6.00  percent  long-term  rate  of  return  to  determine  our  2020  defined  benefit  pension  expense.  After evaluating  activity  in  the  capital  markets,  along  with  the  current  and  projected  plan  investments,  we decreased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 5.75 percent effective for 2021. Decreasing the 5.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $5 million.\n\nCompensation  change  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience,  anticipated  future  management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.\n\nHealth care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.\n\nWe utilized the 2020 mortality tables from the U.S. Society of Actuaries.\n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 26 includes detailed information about the assumptions  used  to  calculate  the  components  of  our  annual  defined  benefit  pension  and  other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED\n\nAs discussed in Item 8.

        "page_content": "## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## General\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to hedge the risks related to these price  fluctuations.  We  are  also  exposed  to  market  risks  related  to  changes  in  interest  rates  and  foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge  the  risks  related  to  interest  rate  fluctuations;  however,  we  have  used  them  in  the  past,  and  we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future. We are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction.\n\nWe believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls,  does  not  expose  us  to  material  adverse  consequences.  While  the  use  of  derivative  instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 20 and 21 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets  and  statements  of  income.  We  do  not  designate  any  of  our  commodity  derivative  instruments  as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nOur strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. We use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options, as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk. We also do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions.\n\nWe use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated  with  inventories  above  or  below  LIFO  inventory  targets.  We  also  use  derivative  instruments related to the acquisition of foreign-sourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended. In addition, we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to market-based prices. The majority of these derivatives are exchange-traded contracts but we also enter into over-the-counter swaps, options and over-the-counter options. We closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy.\n\n## Midstream\n\nNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional  factors  that  are  beyond  MPLX's  control.  MPLX  may  at  times  use  a  variety  of  commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options, as part of an overall program to economically hedge commodity  price  risk.  A  portion  of  MPLX's  profitability  is  directly  affected  by  prevailing  commodity prices primarily as a result of purchasing and selling NGLs and natural gas at index-related prices. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of drilling by MPLX producer customers, such prices also indirectly affect profitability. MPLX may enter into derivative contracts, which are primarily swaps traded on the OTC market as well as fixed price forward contracts. MPLX's risk management policy does not allow  it  to  enter  into  speculative  positions  with  its  derivative  contracts.  Execution  of  MPLX's  hedge strategy and the continuous monitoring of commodity markets and its open derivative positions are carried out by its hedge committee, comprised of members of senior management.\n\nTo mitigate MPLX's cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of NGLs, it may use NGL derivative swap contracts. A small portion of its NGL price exposure may be managed by using crude oil contracts. To mitigate MPLX's cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, it may use natural gas",

Effects  of  these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe evaluate  our  portfolio  of  commodity  derivative  instruments  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  add  or  revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after December 31, 2020 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur use of fixed or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for additional information on our debt.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 for additional information on the fair value of our debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe  are  impacted  by  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  related  to  some  of  our  purchases  of  crude  oil denominated in Canadian dollars. We did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2020.\n\n## Counterparty Risk\n\nWe are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services, lease assets, or sell natural gas or NGLs. We believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses  through  to  our  customers,  thus  reducing  our  risk,  when  we  are  selling  NGLs  and  acting  as  our producer customers' agent. Our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables or lease receivables. Where exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customer's financial condition  prior  to  entering  into  a  transaction  or  agreement,  establish  credit  terms  and  monitor  the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis. In the event of a customer default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  nonpayment  or  nonperformance  by  counterparties  to  our derivative contracts. Our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date. Outstanding instruments expose us to  credit  loss  in  the  event  of  nonperformance  by  the  counterparties  to  the  agreements.  Should  the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline, our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited  to  a  counterparty  agreeing  to  either  a  voluntary  termination  and  subsequent  cash  settlement  or  a novation of the derivative contract to a third party. In the event of a counterparty default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  Integrated  Framework (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2020  in conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Also  in  our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  opinions  on  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinions.",

        "page_content": "## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe  critical  audit  matters  communicated  below  are  matters  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  that  were  communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  (ii)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Recoverability Tests - Refinery Asset Groups\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements and as disclosed by management, the Company's consolidated long-lived asset balance was $43 billion as of December 31, 2020, which includes the refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is determined, and the carrying value is written down to the determined fair value. During the first and second quarters of 2020, management identified long-lived asset triggers relating to all of their refinery asset groups, except the Gallup refinery in the second quarter as it had been impaired to its estimated salvage value in the first quarter, as a result of decreases to the Refining &  Marketing  segment  expected  future  cash  flows.  The  cash  flows  associated  with  these  assets  were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and commodity price declines in the first quarter and continued  unfavorable  macroeconomic  conditions  in  the  second  quarter.  Management  performed recoverability  tests  for  each  refinery  asset  group  by  comparing  the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. The determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows  for  the  first  and  second  quarter  refinery  asset  group  recoverability  tests  utilized  significant assumptions  including  management's  best  estimates  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows,  allocation  of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to the individual refinery asset groups, the estimated useful life of certain refinery asset groups, and the estimated salvage value of certain refinery asset groups.\n\nThe principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  long-lived asset  recoverability  tests  of  the  refinery  asset  groups  performed  by  management  in  the  first  and  second quarters of 2020 is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash  flows  of  the  refinery  asset  groups;  and  (ii)  the  high  degree  of auditor  judgment,  subjectivity,  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  management's recoverability tests and the significant assumption related to allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refinery asset groups.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's long-lived asset recoverability tests, including controls over the allocation of the undiscounted estimates of pretax cash flows to individual refinery asset groups.",

Evaluating the reasonableness of this significant assumption involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management's allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refinery  asset  groups;  (ii)  evaluating  the  appropriateness,  completeness,  and  accuracy  of  underlying  data used  to  allocate  Refining  &  Marketing  segment  cash  flows  to  individual  refinery  asset  groups;  and  (iii) considering whether the data used in the allocation was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the  audit.  Professionals  with  specialized  skill  and  knowledge  were  utilized  to  assist  in  evaluating  the appropriateness of the Company's undiscounted estimated pretax cash flow model.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Tests - Certain Midstream Reporting Units\n\nAs described in Notes 7 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and as disclosed by management, the  Company's  consolidated  goodwill  balance  was  $8,256  million  as  of  December  31,  2020,  which includes, within the Midstream segment, the goodwill associated with MPLX's Crude Gathering reporting unit of $1.1 billion. As described by management, within the Midstream segment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.81 billion in the first quarter of 2020 related to MPLX's Eastern Gathering & Processing  reporting  unit,  which  fully  impaired  the  reporting  unit's  historical  goodwill  balance. Management annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as of November 30, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. The overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which  MPLX and its  customers  operate,  as  well  as  a  sustained  decrease  in  the  MPLX  unit  price,  were considered triggering events requiring an impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. The fair values of the  reporting  units  were  determined  based  on  applying  both  a  discounted  cash  flow  method,  or  income approach,  as  well  as  a  market  approach.  Significant  assumptions  that  were  used  to  estimate  the  MPLX Eastern  Gathering  and  Processing  and  MPLX  Crude  Gathering  reporting  units'  fair  values  under  the discounted  cash  flow  method  included  management's  best  estimates  of  the  discount  rate,  as  well  as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers' development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  goodwill impairment tests of the Company's Crude Gathering and Eastern Gathering and Processing reporting units of the Midstream segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units; and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumption related to future volumes.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment tests, including controls over the estimation of the fair value of the Crude Gathering and Eastern Gathering and Processing reporting units. These  procedures  also  included,  among  others  (i)  testing  management's  process  for  developing  the  fair value estimates; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches used; (iii) testing the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  underlying  data  used  by  management  in  the  approaches;  and  (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to future volumes. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company's income  and  market  approaches.  Evaluating  the  assumption  related  to  future  volumes  involved  (i) considering whether the assumption used was reasonable considering past performance of each reporting unit, producer customers' historical and future production volumes, and industry outlook reports; and (ii) considering whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\n## Equity Method Investment Impairment Test - MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C.\n\nAs described in Notes 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated equity method investment balance was $5,422 million as of December 31, 2020, which included a balance of $698 million related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.25 billion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. As disclosed by management, equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary",

As a result of the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which MPLX and its customers operate, there was a reduction in forecasted volumes processed by the systems operated by MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. These were considered events requiring an impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. The fair value of the investment was determined based on applying a discounted cash flow method, an income approach. Significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair  value  under  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  include  management's  best  estimates  of  the  expected future  cash  flows,  including  prices  and  volumes,  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  the  long-term growth rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment test of the Company's equity method investment in MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the investment; and (ii) the  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity,  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating management's significant assumption related to future volumes.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Evaluating the assumption related to future  volumes  involved  (i)  considering  whether  the  assumption  used  was  reasonable  considering  past performance  of  MarkWest  Utica  EMG,  L.L.C.,  producer  customers'  historical  and  future  production volumes, and industry  outlook  reports;  and  (ii)  considering  whether  the  assumption  was  consistent  with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nToledo, Ohio February 26, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2010.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\n## Description of the Business\n\nWe are a leading, integrated, downstream energy company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. We operate the nation's largest refining system. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and  internationally,  to  buyers  on  the  spot  market  and  to  independent  entrepreneurs  who  operate approximately 7,100 branded outlets. We also sell transportation fuel to consumers through approximately 1,090 direct dealer locations under long-term supply contracts. MPC's midstream operations are primarily conducted  through  MPLX  LP  ('MPLX'),  which  owns  and  operates  crude  oil  and  light  product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation assets. We own the general partner and a majority limited partner interest in MPLX.\n\nOn August 2,  2020,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  our  company-owned  and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven, Inc. ('7-Eleven') for $21 billion  in  cash,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  levels  of  cash,  debt  and  working  capital  at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. We will retain our direct dealer business.\n\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been presented in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. In addition, we separately disclosed  the  operating  and  investing  cash  flows  of  Speedway  as  discontinued  operations  within  our consolidated statements of cash flow. See Note 5 for discontinued operations disclosures.\n\nPrior  to  presentation  of  Speedway  as  discontinued  operations,  Speedway  and  our  retained  direct  dealer business were the two reporting units within our Retail segment. Beginning with the third quarter of 2020, the  direct  dealer  business  is  managed  as  part  of  the  Refining  &  Marketing  segment.  The  results  of  the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented. See Note 13 for our segment reporting disclosures.\n\nRefer to Note 8 for further information on the Andeavor acquisition, which closed on October 1, 2018, and to Notes 6 and 13 for additional information about our operations.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\n\nAs a result  of  our  agreement  to  sell  Speedway,  the  following  changes  in  our  basis  of  presentation  have occurred:\n\n- \u00b7 In accordance with ASC 205, Discontinued Operations, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue, since we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway  subsequent  to  the  sale  to  7-Eleven.  All  periods  presented  have  been  retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n- \u00b7 Beginning  August  2,  2020,  in  accordance  with  ASC  360,  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment,  we ceased  recording  depreciation  and  amortization  for  Speedway's  property,  plant  and  equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets.\n\nCertain  prior  period  financial  statement  amounts  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  current  period presentation.",

        "page_content": "## 2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Principles Applied in Consolidation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and MPLX. As of December 31, 2020, we owned the general partner and 62 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units. Due to our ownership of the general partner interest, we have determined that we control  MPLX and therefore we consolidate MPLX and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest owned by the  public.  Changes  in  ownership  interest  in  consolidated  subsidiaries  that  do  not  result  in  a change in control are recorded as equity transactions.\n\nInvestments in entities over which we have significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the  equity  method  of  accounting.  This  includes  entities  in  which  we  hold  majority  ownership  but  the minority  shareholders  have  substantive  participating  rights.  Income  from  equity  method  investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees.\n\nDifferences in the basis of the investments and the separate net asset values of the investees, if any, are amortized into net income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets and liabilities, except for any excess related to goodwill. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate an other than temporary loss in value has occurred. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue based on consideration specified in contracts or agreements with customers when we satisfy  our  performance  obligations  by  transferring  control  over  products  or  services  to  a  customer. Concurrent with our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ('ASC 606'), as of  January  1,  2018,  we  made  an  accounting  policy  election  that  all  taxes  assessed  by  a  governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction and collected from our customers will be recognized on a net basis within sales and other operating revenues.\n\nOur revenue recognition patterns are described below by reportable segment:\n\n- \u00b7 Refining & Marketing - The vast majority of our Refining & Marketing contracts contain pricing that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our obligations to deliver product  volumes  are  typically  satisfied  and  revenue  is  recognized  when  control  of  the  product transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to payment  for  the  delivered  product,  the  customer  accepts  the  product  and  the  customer  has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components.\n- \u00b7 Midstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed or  transported.  The  transaction  prices  in  our  Midstream  contracts  often  have  both  fixed components,  related  to  minimum  volume  commitments,  and  variable  components,  which  are primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period end.\n\nRefer to Note 23 for disclosure of our revenue disaggregated by segment and product line and to Note 13 for a description of our reportable segment operations.",

        "page_content": "## Crude Oil and Refined Product Exchanges and Matching Buy/Sell Transactions\n\nWe  enter  into  exchange  contracts  and  matching  buy/sell  arrangements  whereby  we  agree  to  deliver  a particular quantity and quality of crude oil or refined products at a specified location and date to a particular counterparty and to receive from the same counterparty the same commodity at a specified location on the same or another specified date. The exchange receipts and deliveries are nonmonetary transactions, with the exception  of  associated  grade  or  location  differentials  that  are  settled  in  cash.  The  matching  buy/sell purchase and sale transactions are settled in cash. No revenues are recorded for exchange and matching buy/sell transactions as they are accounted for as exchanges of inventory. The exchange transactions are recognized at the carrying amount of the inventory transferred.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  on  hand  and  on  deposit  and  investments  in  highly  liquid  debt instruments with maturities of three months or less.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash consists of cash and investments that must be maintained as collateral for letters of credit issued  to  certain  third-party  producer  customers.  The  balances  will  be  outstanding  until  certain  capital projects are completed and the third party releases the restriction.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nOur receivables primarily consist of customer accounts receivable. Customer receivables are recorded at the invoiced  amounts  and  generally  do  not  bear  interest.  Allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  are  generally recorded when it becomes probable the receivable will not be collected and are booked to bad debt expense. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in customer accounts receivable. We review the allowance quarterly and past-due balances over 180 days are reviewed individually for collectability.\n\nWe mitigate credit risk with master netting agreements with companies engaged in the crude oil or refinery feedstock  trading  and  supply  business  or  the  petroleum  refining  industry.  A  master  netting  agreement generally  provides  for  a  once  per  month  net  cash  settlement  of  the  accounts  receivable  from  and  the accounts payable to a particular counterparty.\n\n## Leases\n\nContracts with a term greater than one year that convey the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of an asset are accounted for as right of use assets.\n\nRight of use asset and lease liability balances are recorded at the commencement date at present value of the fixed lease payments using a secured incremental borrowing rate with a maturity similar to the lease term because our leases do not provide implicit rates. We have elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the present value of the lease payments for all lessee asset classes with the exception of our marine and third-party contractor service equipment leases. The lease component of the payment for the marine and equipment asset classes is determined using a relative standalone selling price. See Note 28 for additional disclosures about our lease contracts.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under  the  LIFO  method.  Costs  for  crude  oil  and  refined  product  inventories  are  aggregated  on  a consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  assessing  if  the  LIFO  cost  basis  of  these  inventories  may  have  to  be written down to market value.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe  use  derivatives  to  economically  hedge  a  portion  of  our  exposure  to  commodity  price  risk  and, historically,  to  interest  rate  risk.  Our  use  of  selective  derivative  instruments  that  assume  market  risk  is limited.  All  derivative  instruments  (including  derivative  instruments  embedded  in  other  contracts)  are recorded at fair value. Certain commodity derivatives are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets on a net  basis  by  counterparty  as  they  are  governed  by  master  netting  agreements.  Cash  flows  related  to derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk and interest rate risk are classified in operating activities with the underlying transactions.",

        "page_content": "## Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges\n\nDerivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges may include commodity derivatives used to hedge price risk on (1) inventories, (2) fixed price sales of refined products, (3) the acquisition of foreign-sourced crude oil, (4) the acquisition of ethanol for blending with refined products, (5) the sale of NGLs, (6) the purchase of natural gas and (7) the purchase of soybean oil. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are recognized immediately in net income.\n\n## Concentrations of credit risk\n\nAll of our financial instruments, including derivatives, involve elements of credit and market risk. The most significant portion of our credit risk relates to nonperformance by counterparties. The counterparties to our financial  instruments  consist  primarily  of  major  financial  institutions  and  companies  within  the  energy industry.  To  manage  counterparty  risk  associated  with  financial  instruments,  we  select  and  monitor counterparties based  on  an  assessment  of  their  financial  strength  and  on  credit  ratings,  if available. Additionally, we limit the level of exposure with any single counterparty.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost  and  depreciated  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one year to 61 years. Such assets are reviewed for impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the  asset  group  and  its  eventual  disposition  is  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  group,  an impairment assessment is performed and the excess of the book value over the fair value of the asset group is recorded as an impairment loss.\n\nWhen items of property, plant and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reported in net income. Gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale.\n\nInterest  expense  is  capitalized  for  qualifying  assets  under  construction.  Capitalized  interest  costs  are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in  the  acquisition  of  a  business.  Goodwill  is  not  amortized,  but  rather  is  tested  for  impairment  at  the reporting unit level annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value. If we determine, based on a qualitative assessment,  that  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  that  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value  is  less  than  its  carrying amount, no further impairment testing is required. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if that assessment  indicates  that  further  impairment  testing  is  required,  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  is determined  using  an  income  and/or  market  approach  which  is  compared  to  the  carrying  value  of  the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value under the income approach is calculated using the expected present value of future  cash  flows  method.  Significant  assumptions  used  in  the  cash  flow  forecasts  include  future  net operating margins, future volumes, discount rates, and future capital requirements.\n\nAmortization  of  intangibles  with  definite  lives  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method,  which  is reflective of the benefit pattern in which the estimated economic benefit is expected to be received over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. Intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying  amount  of  the  asset,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset. Intangibles not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded for the difference.",

        "page_content": "## Major Maintenance Activities\n\nCosts  for  planned  turnaround  and  other  major  maintenance  activities  are  expensed  in  the  period incurred. These types of costs include contractor repair services, materials and supplies, equipment rentals and our labor costs.\n\n## Environmental Costs\n\nEnvironmental  expenditures  for  additional  equipment  that  mitigates  or  prevents  future  contamination  or improves  environmental  safety  or  efficiency  of  the  existing  assets  are  capitalized.  We  recognize remediation  costs  and  penalties  when  the  responsibility  to  remediate  is  probable  and  the  amount  of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of  a  feasibility  study  or  the  commitment  to  a  formal  plan  of  action.  Remediation  liabilities  are  accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably  fixed  and  determinable.  If  recoveries  of  remediation  costs  from  third  parties  are  probable,  a receivable is recorded and is discounted when the estimated amount is reasonably fixed and determinable.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  fair  value  of  asset  retirement  obligations  is  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the  obligations  are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The majority of our recognized asset retirement liability  relates  to  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  for  removal  and  disposal  of  fire-retardant material from certain refining facilities. The remaining recognized asset retirement liability relates to other refining assets, certain pipelines and processing facilities and other related pipeline assets. The fair values recorded for such obligations are based on the most probable current cost projections.\n\nAsset  retirement  obligations  have  not  been  recognized  for  some  assets  because  the  fair  value  cannot  be reasonably estimated since the settlement dates of the obligations are indeterminate. Such obligations will be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates. The asset retirement obligations principally include the hazardous material disposal and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of certain refining, terminal, pipeline and processing assets.\n\nOur practice is to keep our assets in good operating condition through routine repair and maintenance of component parts  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  and  by  continuing  to  make  improvements  based  on technological advances. As a result, we believe that generally these assets have no expected settlement date for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations since the dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  tax bases.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recorded  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  they  will  be  realized.  The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on several factors, primarily our expectation to generate sufficient future taxable income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements\n\nThe fair value of stock options granted to our employees is estimated on the date of grant using the BlackScholes option pricing model. The model employs various assumptions based on management's estimates at the time of grant, which impact the calculation of fair value and ultimately, the amount of expense that is recognized over the vesting period of the stock option award. Of the required assumptions, the expected life of the stock option award and the expected volatility of our stock price have the most significant impact on the  fair  value  calculation.  The  average  expected  life  is  based  on  our  historical  employee  exercise behavior. The assumption for expected volatility of our stock price reflects a weighting of 50 percent of our common stock implied volatility and 50 percent of our common stock historical volatility.\n\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards granted to our employees is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of performance unit awards granted to our employees is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.",

        "page_content": "Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management's estimate of the awards that are expected to vest, using the straight-line attribution method for all service-based awards with a graded vesting  feature.  If  actual  forfeiture  results  are  different  than  expected,  adjustments  to  recognized compensation expense may be required in future periods. Unearned stock-based compensation is charged to equity  when  restricted  stock  awards  are  granted.  Compensation  expense  is  recognized  over  the  vesting period and is adjusted if conditions of the restricted stock award are not met.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe recognize and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess or surplus of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or gain from a bargain  purchase.  For  material  acquisitions,  management  engages  an  independent  valuation  specialist  to assist with the determination of fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if  any,  and  goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling  interest,  if  any,  in  a  business  combination.  The  income  valuation  method  represents  the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using: (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on  management's  estimates  of  revenue  and  operating  expenses;  (ii)  long-term  growth  rates;  and (iii) appropriate discount rates. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market, with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets. The cost valuation  method  is  based  on  the  replacement  cost  of  a  comparable  asset  at  prices  at  the  time  of  the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  which  the  acquisition  occurs,  an  estimate  will  be recorded. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, we will record any material adjustments to the initial estimate based on new information obtained that would have existed as of the date of the acquisition. Any adjustment that arises from information obtained that did not exist as of the date of the acquisition will be recorded in the period of the adjustment. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in connection with each business combination.\n\n## Environmental Credits and Obligations\n\nIn order to comply with certain regulations, specifically the RFS2 requirements implemented by the EPA and the cap-and-trade emission reduction program and low carbon fuel standard implemented by the state of California, we are required to reduce our emissions, blend certain levels of biofuels or obtain allowances or credits to offset the obligations created by our operations. In regard to each program, we record an asset, included in other current or other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet, for allowances or credits owned in excess of our anticipated current period compliance requirements. The asset value is based on the product of the excess allowances or credits as of the balance sheet date, if any, and the weighted average cost of those allowances or credits. We record a liability, included in other current or other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet, when we are deficient allowances or credits based on the product of the deficient amount as of the balance sheet date, if any, and the market price of the allowances or credits at the balance sheet date. The cost of allowances or credits used for compliance is reflected in cost of revenues on the income statement.  Any  gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  or  expiration  of  allowances  or  credits  are  classified  as  other income on the income statement. Proceeds from the sale of allowances or credits are reported in investing activities - all other, net on the cash flow statement.\n\n## 3. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\n## Recently Adopted\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, 'Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement  of  Credit  Losses  on  Financial  Instruments,'  using  the  modified  retrospective  transition method. The amendment requires entities to consider a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, which may result in earlier recognition of losses. The ASU requires the company to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables, and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.",

        "page_content": "We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of refined petroleum products, crude oil and midstream services. We assess each customer's ability to pay through our credit review process. The credit review process considers various factors such as external credit ratings, a review of financial statements to determine liquidity, leverage, trends and business specific risks, market information, pay history and our business strategy. Customers that do not qualify for payment terms are required to prepay or provide a letter of credit. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through timely review of customer payment activity. At December 31, 2020, we reported $5,760 million of accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances of $18 million.\n\nWe are also exposed to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, such as guarantees of joint venture debt. See Note 29 for more information on these off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nWe also adopted the following ASUs during 2020, none of which had a material impact to our financial statements or financial statement disclosures:\n\nASU\n\nEffective Date\n\n| 2018-13   | Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the  Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement   | January 1, 2020   |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 2020-04   | Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate  Reform on Financial Reporting                 | April 1, 2020     |\n\n## Not Yet Adopted\n\n## ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  accounting  for  income  taxes. Amendments include removal of certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740 and simplification in  several  other  areas  such  as  accounting  for  a  franchise  tax  or  similar  tax  that  is  partially  based  on income. The change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We do not expect the application of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4. RESTRUCTURING\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we indefinitely idled our refinery located in Gallup, New Mexico and initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility. We also approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million in 2020.\n\nThe indefinite idling of the Gallup refinery and actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable  diesel  facility  resulted  in  $195  million  of  restructuring  expenses.  Of  the  $195  million  of restructuring  expenses,  we  expect  $130  million  to  settle  in  cash  for  costs  related  to  decommissioning refinery  processing  units  and  storage  tanks  and  fulfilling  environmental  remediation  obligations. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash reserve against our materials and supplies inventory at these facilities of $51 million.\n\nThe involuntary workforce reduction plan, together with employee reductions resulting from our actions affecting the Gallup and Martinez refineries, affected approximately 2,050 employees. We recorded $172 million of restructuring expenses for separation benefits payable under our employee separation plan and certain  collective  bargaining  agreements  that  we  expect  to  settle  in  cash.  Certain  of  the  affected  MPC employees provided services to MPLX. MPLX has various employee services agreements and secondment agreements  with  MPC  pursuant  to  which  MPLX  reimburses  MPC  for  employee  costs,  along  with  the provision  of  operational  and  management  services  in  support  of  MPLX's  operations.  Pursuant  to  such agreements, MPC was reimbursed by MPLX for $37 million of the $172 million of restructuring expenses recorded for these actions.\n\nRestructuring expenses were accrued as restructuring reserves within accounts payable, payroll and benefits payable, other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. We expect cash payments for the majority of these reserves to occur within the next nine months.",

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\n\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $21 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\n\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been presented in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. Additionally, beginning  August  2,  2020,  in  accordance  with  ASC  360,  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment,  we  ceased recording  depreciation  and  amortization  for  Speedway's  property,  plant  and  equipment,  finite-lived intangible  assets  and  right  of  use  lease  assets.  In  addition,  we  separately  disclosed  the  operating  and investing cash flows of Speedway as discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of cash flow.\n\nThe following tables present Speedway results as reported in income from discontinued operations, net of tax,  within  our  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and  liabilities  as presented within assets and liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n| (In millions)                                   | 2020      | 2019      | 2018      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total revenues and other income                 | $  19,920 | $  26,793 | $  22,051 |\n| Costs and expenses:                             |           |           |           |\n| Cost of revenues (excludes items below)         | 17,573    | 24,860    | 20,557    |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   | 244       | 413       | 320       |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses    | 323       | 216       | 142       |\n| Other taxes                                     | 193       | 190       | 151       |\n| Total costs and expenses                        | 18,333    | 25,679    | 21,170    |\n| Income from operations                          | 1,587     | 1,114     | 881       |\n| Net interest and other financial costs          | 20        | 18        | 10        |\n| Income before income taxes                      | 1,567     | 1,096     | 871       |\n| Provision for income taxes                      | 362       | 290       | 198       |\n| Income from discontinued operations, net of tax | $  1,205  | $  806    | $  673    |",

Due  to  our  expected  continuing  involvement  with  Speedway  through  a  fuel  supply agreement,  intersegment  sales  from  our  Refining  &  Marketing  segment  to  Speedway  are  no  longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue.\n\n## Purchase of Speedway's Interest in PFJ Southeast\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Pilot Travel Centers LLC exercised an option to purchase our 29 percent interest in PFJ Southeast LLC ('PFJ'), subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. PFJ has been accounted for as an asset held for sale as of September 30, 2020 and is reported as the equity method investment balance in the above table.\n\n## 6. MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\n\nWe own the general partner and a majority limited partner interest in MPLX, which owns and operates crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation  assets.  We  control  MPLX  through  our  ownership  of  the  general  partner  interest  and,  as  of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 62 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units.\n\n## Javelina Assets Held-for-Sale\n\nOn December 23, 2020, MPLX entered into an agreement with a third party to sell all of its equity interests in MarkWest Javelina Company, L.L.C., MarkWest Javelina Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and MarkWest Gas Services, L.L.C. (collectively, 'Javelina'). Javelina's assets and liabilities have been presented within our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2020. On February 12, 2021, MPLX completed the sale of Javelina.",

        "page_content": "## Unit Repurchase Program\n\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of MPLX's outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions,  tender  offers,  accelerated  unit  repurchases  or  open  market  solicitations  for  units,  some  of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, 1,473,843 common units had been repurchased at an average cost per unit of $22.29. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $33 million and $967 million  remained  outstanding  on  the  program  for  future  repurchases  as  of  December  31,  2020.  As  of December 31, 2020,  MPLX had agreements to acquire  99,406  additional  common  units  for  $2  million, which settled in early January 2021.\n\n## Redemption of Business from MPLX\n\nOn July 31, 2020, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) ('WRSW'), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, entered into a Redemption Agreement (the 'Redemption Agreement')  with  MPLX,  pursuant  to  which  MPLX  transferred  to  WRSW  all  of  the  outstanding membership interests in Western Refining Wholesale, LLC, ('WRW') in exchange for the redemption of MPLX  common  units  held  by  WRSW.  The  transaction  effects  the  transfer  to  MPC  of  the  Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of Andeavor Logistics LP ('ANDX'). Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, the results of these operations are presented in MPC's Refining & Marketing segment.\n\nAt  the  closing,  per  the  terms  of  Redemption  Agreement,  MPLX  redeemed  18,582,088  MPLX  common units (the 'Redeemed Units') held by WRSW. The number of Redeemed Units was calculated by dividing WRW's aggregate valuation of $340 million by the simple average of the volume weighted average NYSE prices of an MPLX common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on July 27, 2020. The transaction resulted in a minor decrease in MPC's ownership interest in MPLX.\n\n## MPLX's Acquisition of ANDX\n\nOn July 30, 2019, MPLX completed its acquisition of ANDX, and ANDX survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX. At the effective time of the ANDX acquisition, each common unit held by ANDX's public unitholders was converted into the right to receive 1.135 MPLX common units. ANDX common units held by MPC were converted into the right to receive 1.0328 MPLX common units. Additionally, as a result  of  MPLX's  acquisition  of  MPLX,  600,000  ANDX  preferred  units  were  converted  into  600,000 preferred units of MPLX ('Series B preferred units'). Series B preferred unitholders are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the board of directors of MPLX's general partner, a fixed distribution of $68.75 per unit, per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, or the first business day thereafter, up to and including February 15, 2023. After February 15, 2023, the holders of Series B preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative, quarterly distributions payable in arrears on the 15th day of  February,  May,  August  and  November  of  each  year,  or  the  first  business  day  thereafter,  based  on  a floating annual rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 4.652 percent.\n\nMPC  accounted  for  this  transaction  as  a  common  control  transaction,  as  defined  by  ASC  805,  which resulted  in  an  increase  to  noncontrolling  interest  and  a  decrease  to  additional  paid-in  capital  of approximately $55 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of 2019, we pushed down to MPLX the portion  of  the  goodwill  attributable  to  ANDX  as  of  October  1,  2018,  the  date  of  our  acquisition  of Andeavor. Due to this push down of goodwill, we also recorded an incremental $642 million deferred tax liability  associated  with  the  portion  of  the  non-deductible  goodwill  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling interest  in  MPLX  with  an  offsetting  reduction  of  our  additional  paid-in  capital  balance.  We  have consolidated ANDX since we acquired Andeavor on October 1, 2018 in accordance with ASC 810.",

MPLX financed the cash portion of the transaction with a $4.1 billion 364-day term loan facility, which was entered into on January 2, 2018. We agreed to waive approximately one-third of the first quarter 2018 distributions on the common units issued in connection with this transaction. The contributions of these assets were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss.\n\nImmediately  following  the  February  1,  2018  dropdown  to  MPLX,  our  IDRs  were  cancelled  and  our economic  general  partner  interest  was  converted  into  a  non-economic  general  partner  interest,  all  in exchange for 275 million newly issued MPLX common units ('GP/IDR Exchange'). As a result of this transaction, the general partner units and IDRs were eliminated, are no longer outstanding and no longer participate in distributions of cash from MPLX.\n\n## Agreements\n\nWe  have  various  long-term,  fee-based  commercial  agreements  with  MPLX.  Under  these  agreements, MPLX provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to us. With certain exceptions, these agreements generally contain minimum volume commitments. These transactions are eliminated in consolidation  but  are  reflected  as  intersegment  transactions  between  our  Refining  &  Marketing  and Midstream  segments.  We  also  have  agreements  with  MPLX  that  establish  fees  for  operational  and management services provided between us and MPLX and for executive management services and certain general  and  administrative  services  provided  by  us  to  MPLX.  These  transactions  are  eliminated  in consolidation  but  are  reflected  as  intersegment  transactions  between  our  Corporate  and  Midstream segments.\n\n## Noncontrolling Interest\n\nAs a result of equity transactions of MPLX and ANDX, we are required to adjust non-controlling interest and additional paid-in capital. Changes in MPC's additional paid-in capital resulting from changes in its ownership interest in MPLX and ANDX were as follows:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                       | 2020    | 2019     | 2018     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Increase due to the issuance of MPLX common units and general  partner units to MPC | $  -    | $  -     | $  1,114 |\n| Increase due to GP/IDR Exchange                                                     | -       | -        | 1,808    |\n| Increase (decrease) due to the issuance of MPLX & ANDX  common units                | (27)    | (51)     | 6        |\n| Tax impact                                                                          | (14)    | (633)    | (571)    |\n| Increase (decrease) in MPC's additional paid-in capital, net of tax                 | $  (41) | $  (684) | $  2,357 |\n\n## 7. IMPAIRMENTS\n\nThe  outbreak  of  COVID-19  and  its  development  into  a  pandemic  in  March  2020  have  resulted  in significant  economic  disruption  globally.  Actions  taken  by  various  governmental  authorities,  individuals and  companies  around  the  world  to  prevent  the  spread  of  COVID-19  through  social  distancing  have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and  in-person  interaction  across  the  globe.  These  actions  have,  in  turn  significantly  reduced  global economic activity and resulted in a decrease in motor vehicle usage and demand for gasoline and a dramatic reduction in airline flights. These macroeconomic conditions and certain global geopolitical events in the first quarter of 2020 contributed to a significant decline in crude oil prices as well as an increase in crude oil  price  volatility.  The  decrease  in  demand  for  refined  petroleum  products  has  resulted  in  a  significant decrease in the price and volume of the refined petroleum products we produce and sell as compared to 2019.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which we operate, the related changes to our expected future cash flows, as well as a sustained decrease in share price were considered triggering events requiring the performance of various tests of the carrying values of our assets. Triggering events requiring the performance of various tests of the carrying value of our Midstream",

These tests resulted in the majority of the impairment charges in 2020, as discussed below.\n\nThe table below provides information related to the impairments recognized during 2020 and 2019, along with the location of these impairments within the consolidated statements of income.\n\n| (In millions)             | Income Statement Line                        | 2020     | 2019     |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Goodwill                  | Impairment expense                           | $  7,394 | $  1,197 |\n| Equity method investments | Income (loss) from equity method investments | 1,315    | 42       |\n| Long-lived assets         | Impairment expense (a)                       | 1,032    | -        |\n| Total impairments         | Total impairments                            | $  9,741 | $  1,239 |\n\n## Goodwill\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $7.33 billion. See Note 19 for detail  by  segment.  The  goodwill  impairment  within  the  Refining  &  Marketing  segment  was  primarily driven  by  the  effects  of  COVID-19  and  the  decline  in  commodity  prices.  The  impairment  within  the Midstream  segment  was  primarily  driven  by  additional  information  related  to  the  slowing  of  drilling activity, which has reduced production growth forecasts from MPLX's producer customers.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $64 million. The $64 million of goodwill was transferred from our Midstream segment to our Refining & Marketing segment during the third quarter of 2020 in connection with the transfer to MPC of the MPLX wholesale distribution business as  described in Note 6. The transfer required goodwill impairment tests for the transferor and transferee reporting units. Our Refining & Marketing reporting unit that recorded the $64 million impairment expense has no remaining goodwill.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  the  reporting  units  for  the  first  quarter  of  2020  goodwill  impairment  analysis  were determined  based  on  applying  both  a  discounted  cash  flow  method,  or  income  approach,  as  well  as  a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at  the  measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the expected future results  and  discount  rates,  which  range  from  9.0  percent  to  13.5  percent  across  all  reporting  units. Significant assumptions that were used to estimate the MPLX Eastern Gathering and Processing and MPLX Crude  Gathering  reporting  units'  fair  values  under  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  included management's  best  estimates  of  the  discount  rate,  as  well  as  estimates  of  future  cash  flows,  which  are impacted primarily by producer customer's development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements.  Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in underlying  assumptions  and  factors.  As  a  result,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  estimates  and assumptions  made  for  purposes  of  the  interim  goodwill  impairment  test  will  prove  to  be  an  accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the individual reporting units' overall fair values represent Level 3 measurements.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment of goodwill in our Midstream segment. As a result  of  the  merger  of  MPLX  and  ANDX  in  2019  and  subsequent  changes  to  MPLX's  internal organization structure, the number of reporting units within our Midstream segment was reduced from 16 to 7 in conjunction with the annual impairment test, however, this change in structure did not have any impact on  MPC's  operating  segments.  Reporting  units  are  determined  based  on  the  way  in  which  segment management  operates  and  reviews  each  operating  segment.  MPLX  performed  a  goodwill  impairment assessment  prior  to  the  change  in  reporting  units  in  addition  to  performing  an  impairment  assessment immediately  following  the  change  in  their  reporting  units.  Significant  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the reporting units'  fair  value  include  the  discount  rate  as  well  as  estimates  of  future  cash  flows,  which  are impacted primarily by producer customers' development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements. After MPLX performed its evaluations related to the impairment of goodwill, we recorded an impairment  of  $1,156  million  prior  to  the  change  in  reporting  units  and  additional  impairment  of  $41 million subsequent to the change in reporting units. The remainder of the reporting units fair values were in",

The impairment was primarily driven by the updated guidance related to the slowing  of  drilling  activity  which  has  reduced  production  growth  forecasts  from  MPLX's  producer customers.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  the  reporting  units  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019  goodwill  impairment  analysis  was determined  based  on  applying  both  a  discounted  cash  flow  or  income  approach  as  well  as  a  market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the expected future results and  discount  rates,  which  range  from  9.0  percent  to  10.0  percent.  Fair  value  determinations  require considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and  factors.  As  a  result, there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  estimates  and  assumptions  made  for  purposes  of  the  annual  goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the individual reporting units' overall fair values, and the fair values of the goodwill assigned thereto, represent Level 3 measurements.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nDuring  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  recorded  equity  method  investment  impairment  charges  totaling $1.315 billion, of which $1.25 billion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. and its investment in Ohio Gathering  Company,  L.L.C.  The  impairments  were  largely  due  to  a  reduction  in  forecasted  volumes gathered and processed by the systems operated by the equity method investments. The fair value of the investments were determined based upon applying a discounted cash flow method, an income approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant  assumptions  that  were  used  to  develop  the  estimate  of  the  fair  value under the discounted cash flow method include management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value of these equity method investments represents a Level 3 measurement.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, two joint ventures in which MPLX has an interest recorded impairments, which impacted the amount of income from equity method investments during the period by approximately $28 million. For one of the joint ventures, MPLX also had a basis difference which was being amortized over the life of the underlying assets. As a result of the impairment recorded by the joint venture, MPLX also assessed this basis difference for impairment and recorded approximately $14 million of impairment expense during the fourth quarter related to this investment.\n\n## Long-lived Assets\n\nLong-lived  assets  (primarily  consisting  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  intangible  assets  other  than goodwill, and right of use assets) used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  assets  may  not  be  recoverable  based  on  the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for Midstream segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is determined, and the carrying value is written down to the determined fair value.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment as a result of decreases to the Refining & Marketing  segment  expected  future  cash  flows.  The  cash  flows  associated  with  these  assets  were significantly  impacted  by  the  effects  of  COVID-19  and  commodity  price  declines.  We  performed recoverability  tests  for  each  refinery  asset  group  by  comparing  the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash flows  to  the  carrying  value  of  each  asset  group.  Only  the  Gallup  refinery's  carrying  value  exceeded  its undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows. It was determined that the fair value of the Gallup refinery's property, plant and equipment was less than the carrying value. As a result, we recorded a charge of $142 million in the first quarter of 2020 to impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurements for the Gallup refinery assets represent Level 3 measurements.",

        "page_content": "During the second quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment, except the Gallup refinery as it had been impaired  to  its  estimated  salvage  value  in  the  first  quarter,  as  a  result  of  continued  unfavorable macroeconomic conditions impacting the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. We performed  recoverability  tests  for  each  refinery  asset  group  by  comparing  the  undiscounted  estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. All of these refinery asset groups' undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded their carrying value by at least 17 percent.\n\nThe determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for the first and second quarter refinery asset group recoverability tests utilized significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the  expected  future  cash  flows,  allocation  of  certain  Refining  &  Marketing  segment  cash  flows  to  the individual refinery asset groups, the estimated useful life of certain refinery asset groups, and the estimated salvage value of certain refinery asset groups.\n\nOn  August  3,  2020,  we  announced  our  plans  to  evaluate  possibilities  to  strategically  reposition  our Martinez  refinery,  including  the  potential  conversion  of  the  refinery  into  a  renewable  diesel  facility. Subsequent  to  August  3,  2020,  we  progressed  activities  associated  with  the  conversion  of  the  Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers,  and  beginning  detailed  engineering  activities.  As  envisioned,  the  Martinez  facility  would  start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. As a result of the progression of these activities, we identified assets that would be repurposed and utilized in a renewable diesel facility configuration and assets that would be abandoned since they had no function in a renewable diesel facility configuration. This change in our intended use for the Martinez refinery is a longlived asset impairment trigger for the assets that would be repurposed and remain as part of the Martinez asset group. We assessed the asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash  flows  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  group  and  the  undiscounted  estimated  pretax  cash  flows exceeded the Martinez asset group carrying value. We recorded impairment expense of $342 million for the abandoned assets as we are no longer using these assets and have no expectation to use these assets in the future.  Additionally,  as  a  result  of  our  efforts  to  progress  the  conversion  of  Martinez  refinery  into  a renewable  diesel  facility,  MPLX  cancelled  in-process  capital  projects  related  to  its  Martinez  refinery logistics operations resulting in impairments of $27 million in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded the evaluation of our intended use of MPLX terminal assets near the Gallup refinery and determined that the assets were abandoned, resulting in an impairment charge of  $67  million.  Following  this  conclusion,  we  revised  the  estimate  of  the  salvage  value  for  the  Gallup refinery asset group resulting in an additional $44 million impairment charge. These charges are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe determinations of expected future cash flows and the salvage values of refineries, as described earlier, require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and  factors.  As  a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may determine the carrying values of certain of our refinery asset groups exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of their refinery asset groups, which would result in future impairment charges.\n\nDuring  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  identified  an  impairment  trigger  relating  to  asset  groups  within MPLX's Western Gathering and Processing ('G&P') reporting unit as a result of significant changes to expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices. We assessed each asset group within the Western G&P reporting unit for impairment. It was determined that the fair value of the East Texas G&P  asset  group's  underlying  assets  were  less  than  the  carrying  value.  As  a  result,  MPLX  recorded impairment  charges  totaling  $350  million  related  to  its  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangibles, which  are  included  in  impairment  expense  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Fair  value  of property, plant and equipment was determined using a combination of an income and cost approach. The income approach utilized significant assumptions including management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group. The cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based",

Fair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates  and  assumptions  made  for  purposes  of  the  impairment  analysis  will  prove  to  be  an  accurate prediction  of  the  future.

ACQUISITIONS\n\n## Acquisition of Andeavor\n\nOn  October  1,  2018,  we  acquired  Andeavor.  Under  the  terms  of  the  merger  agreement,  Andeavor stockholders had the option to choose 1.87 shares of MPC common stock or $152.27 in cash per share of Andeavor  common  stock.  The  merger  agreement  included  election  proration  provisions  that  resulted  in approximately 22.9 million shares of Andeavor common stock being converted into cash consideration and the remaining 128.2 million shares of Andeavor common stock being converted into stock consideration. Andeavor  stockholders  received  in  the  aggregate  approximately  239.8  million  shares  of  MPC  common stock and approximately $3.5 billion in cash in connection with the Andeavor acquisition. The fair value of the MPC shares issued was determined on the basis of the closing market price of MPC's common shares on the acquisition date. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded using cash on hand.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, all Andeavor equity awards, with the exception of non-employee director units, were converted to MPC equity awards. The converted equity awards continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Andeavor equity awards immediately prior to the acquisition. We recognized $203 million of purchase consideration to reflect the portion of the fair value of the  time-based  converted  equity  awards  attributable  to  pre-combination  service  completed  by  the  award holders. The non-employee director units were accelerated in full and cancelled and the holders of such units received an amount of cash equal to the number of shares of Andeavor common stock subject to such non-employee director units multiplied by the cash consideration per share.\n\nOur financial results reflect the results of Andeavor from October 1, 2018, the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe components of the fair value of consideration transferred are as follows:\n\n|                                                | (In millions)   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Fair value of MPC shares issued                | $  19,766       |\n| Cash payment to Andeavor stockholders          | 3,486           |\n| Cash settlement of non-employee director units | 7               |\n| Fair value of converted equity awards          | 203             |\n| Total fair value of consideration transferred  | $  23,462       |\n\nThe purchase consideration allocation resulted in the recognition of $17.3 billion in goodwill, of which $1.0 billion is tax deductible due to a carryover basis from Andeavor. Our Refining & Marketing, Midstream and former Retail segment recognized $5.2 billion, $8.1 billion and $3.9 billion of goodwill, respectively. The  recognized  goodwill  represents  the  value  expected  to  be  created  by  further  optimization  of  crude supply, a nationwide retail and marketing platform, diversification of our refining and midstream footprints and  optimization  of  information  systems  and  business  processes.  See  Note  7  for  information  regarding impairments recorded in 2020 and 2019.\n\nWe recognized  $47  million  in  acquisition  costs.  Additionally,  we  recognized  various  other  transactionrelated costs, including employee-related costs associated with the Andeavor acquisition. All of these costs are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The employee-related costs are primarily due to  pre-existing  Andeavor  change  in  control  and  equity  award  agreements  that  create  obligations  and accelerated equity vesting upon MPC notifying employees of significant changes to or elimination of their responsibilities.\n\nAndeavor's results have been included in MPC's financial statements for the period subsequent to the date of  the  acquisition  on  October  1,  2018.  Andeavor  contributed  revenues  of  approximately  $11.3  billion including Speedway for the period from October 1 through December 31, 2018. We do not believe it is",

Goodwill  is  tax  deductible  and  represents  the  value  expected  to  be  created  by geographically expanding our retail platform and the assembled workforce. The terminal is accounted for within the Refining & Marketing segment and the retail stores were accounted for within our former Retail segment.\n\nThe amount of revenue and income from operations associated with the acquisition from the acquisition date  to  December  31,  2019  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  In addition,  assuming  the  acquisition  had  occurred  on  January  1,  2018,  the  consolidated  pro  forma  results would not have been materially different from the reported results.\n\n## Acquisition of Express Mart\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  Speedway  acquired  78  transportation  fuel  and  convenience  store locations from Petr-All Petroleum Consulting Corporation for total consideration of $266 million. These stores are located primarily in the Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo markets in New York and operate under the Express Mart brand.\n\nBased on the final fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, $97 million of the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment, $9 million to inventory, $2 million to intangibles and $158 million to goodwill. Goodwill is tax deductible and represents the value expected to be created by geographically expanding our retail platform and the assembled workforce.\n\nThe amount of revenue and income from operations associated with the acquisition from the acquisition date  to  December  31,  2018  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  In addition,  assuming  the  acquisition  had  occurred  on  January  1,  2017,  the  consolidated  pro  forma  results would not have been materially different from the reported results.",

        "page_content": "## Acquisition of Mt. Airy Terminal\n\nOn September 26, 2018, MPLX acquired an eastern U.S. Gulf Coast export terminal ('Mt. Airy Terminal') from Pin Oak Holdings, LLC for total consideration of $451 million. At the time of the acquisition, the terminal included tanks with 4 million barrels of third-party leased storage capacity and a dock with 120 mbpd of capacity. The Mt. Airy Terminal is located on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, near several Gulf Coast refineries, including our Garyville Refinery, and numerous rail lines and pipelines. The Mt. Airy Terminal is accounted for within the Midstream segment. In the first quarter of 2019, an adjustment to the initial purchase price was made for approximately $5 million related to the final settlement of the acquisition. This reduced the total purchase price to $446 million and resulted in $336 million of property, plant and equipment, $121 million of goodwill and the remainder being attributable to net liabilities assumed.\n\nGoodwill represents the significant growth potential of the terminal due to the multiple pipelines and rail lines  which  cross  the  property,  the  terminal's  position  as  an  aggregation  point  for  liquids  growth  in  the region  for  both  ocean-going  vessels  and  inland  barges,  the  proximity  of  the  terminal  to  our  Garyville refinery and other refineries in the region as well as the opportunity to construct an additional dock at the site. All of the goodwill recognized related to this transaction is tax deductible.\n\nThe  amount  of  revenue  and  income  from  operations  associated  with  the  acquisition  from  the  terminal acquisition  date  to  December  31,  2018  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial statements.  In  addition,  assuming  the  terminal  acquisition  had  occurred  on  January  1,  2017,  the consolidated pro forma results would not have been materially different from the reported results.\n\n## 9. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\n## Consolidated VIE\n\nWe  control  MPLX  through  our  ownership  of  its  general  partner.  MPLX  is  a  VIE  because  the  limited partners  do  not  have  substantive  kick-out  or  participating  rights  over  the  general  partner.  We  are  the primary beneficiary of MPLX because in addition to our significant economic interest, we also have the ability, through our ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact MPLX. We therefore consolidate MPLX and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest owned by the public. We also record a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to MPLX's Series A preferred units.\n\nThe creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC's general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements,  except  as  noted.  MPC  has  effectively  guaranteed  certain  indebtedness  of  LOOP  LLC ('LOOP')  and  LOCAP  LLC  ('LOCAP'),  in  which  MPLX  holds  an  interest.  See  Note  29  for  more information. The assets of MPLX can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets, except as noted earlier.",

We have determined that Crowley Coastal Partners is a VIE based on the terms of the existing financing arrangements for Crowley Blue Water Partners and Crowley Ocean Partners and the associated debt guarantees by MPC and Crowley. Our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2020 was $424 million, which includes our equity method investment in Crowley Coastal Partners and the debt  guarantees  provided  to  each  of  the  lenders  to  Crowley  Blue  Water  Partners  and  Crowley  Ocean Partners. We are not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the ability to control the activities that significantly influence the economic outcomes of the entity and, therefore, do not consolidate the entity.\n\n## MPLX VIEs\n\nFor those entities that have been deemed to be VIEs, neither MPLX nor any of its subsidiaries have been deemed to be the primary beneficiary due to voting rights on significant matters. While we have the ability to  exercise  influence  through  participation  in  the  management  committees  which  make  all  significant decisions,  we  have  equal  influence  over  each  committee  as  a  joint  interest  partner  and  all  significant decisions require the consent of the other investors without regard to economic interest and as such we have determined that these entities should not be consolidated and apply the equity method of accounting with respect to our investments in each entity.\n\nSherwood Midstream has been deemed the primary beneficiary of Sherwood Midstream Holdings due to its controlling  financial  interest  through  its  authority  to  manage  the  joint  venture.  As  a  result,  Sherwood Midstream consolidates Sherwood Midstream Holdings.",

See Note 17 for ownership percentages and investment balances related to our non-consolidated VIEs.\n\n## 10.

We obtain utilities, transportation services and purchase ethanol from certain of our equity affiliates.\n\n## 11.  EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nWe compute basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to MPC less income allocated  to  participating  securities  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  of  common  stock outstanding.  Since  MPC  grants  certain  incentive  compensation  awards  to  employees  and  non-employee directors that are considered to be participating securities, we have calculated our earnings (loss) per share using  the  two-class  method.  Diluted  income  (loss)  per  share  assumes  exercise  of  certain  stock-based compensation awards, provided the effect is not anti-dilutive.",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. In connection with the announced sale, we reassessed our organizational structure and management  of  segments.  As  a  result  of  this  assessment,  we  have  made  the  following  changes  for  all periods presented:\n\n- \u00b7 Speedway's  results  are  presented  separately  as  discontinued  operations.  See  Note  5  for  related disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Refining  &  Marketing  intersegment  sales  to  Speedway  that  were  previously  eliminated  in consolidation  are  reported  as  third  party  sales  as  we  will  continue  to  supply  fuel  to  Speedway following its disposition.\n- \u00b7 The retained direct dealer business results, previously included in the Retail segment, are reported within the Refining & Marketing segment.\n- \u00b7 As a result of the above, we no longer present a separate Retail segment, which had included these two businesses.\n- \u00b7 Corporate costs are no longer allocated to Speedway under discontinued operations accounting.\n\nWe  have  two  reportable  segments:  Refining  &  Marketing  and  Midstream.  Each  of  these  segments  is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.\n\n- \u00b7 Refining & Marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services  provided  largely  by  our  Midstream  segment.  We  sell  refined  products  to  wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon \u00ae branded outlets, through long-term supply contracts with  direct  dealers  who  operate  locations  mainly  under  the  ARCO \u00ae brand  and  to  approximately 3,800 Speedway locations.\n- \u00b7 Midstream - transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges; gathers, processes and transports natural gas; and gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. The Midstream segment primarily reflects the results of MPLX.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired Andeavor and its results are included in each of our segments from the date of the acquisition. Also, on February 1, 2018, we contributed certain refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. The results of these new businesses are reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, 2018, resulting in a net reduction to Refining & Marketing segment results and a net increase to Midstream segment results of the same amount. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to February 1, 2018.\n\nSegment income from operations represents  income  (loss)  from  operations  attributable  to  the  reportable segments. Corporate administrative expenses, except for those attributable to MPLX, and costs related to certain  non-operating  assets  are  not  allocated  to  the  Refining  &  Marketing  segment.  In  addition,  certain items that affect comparability (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ('CODM')) are not allocated to the reportable segments. Assets by segment are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM and thus are not reported in our disclosures.",

INCOME TAXES\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act') was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act  contained  a  net  operating  loss  ('NOL')  carryback  provision,  which  allowed  MPC  to  carryback  our 2020  taxable  loss  to  2015  and  later  years.  The  five-year  NOL  carryback  is  available  for  all  businesses producing taxable losses in 2018 through 2020. Based on the NOL carryback, as provided by the CARES Act, we recorded an income tax receivable of $2.1 billion in other current assets to reflect our estimate of the tax refund we expect to receive from our 2020 federal tax return. The refund is expected to be received during the second half of 2021.\n\nIn the absence of the CARES Act NOL legislation, businesses would account for taxable losses as deferred tax assets and could realize the deferred tax asset by offsetting the losses against taxable income earned in future periods. Due to the corporate tax rate change from 35 percent to the current 21 percent under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, taxpayers may recover taxes paid in tax years before 2018 at a 35 percent federal income  tax  rate.  The  limitation  on  the  percentage  of  taxable  income  that  may  be  offset  by  the  NOL, formerly 80 percent of income, was eliminated for years beginning before 2021.\n\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of:\n\n| (In millions)                  | 2020          | 2019    | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|---------|--------|\n| Current:                       |               |         |        |\n| Federal                        | $  (2,267)  $ | (52)  $ | 674    |\n| State and local                | 69            | 28      | 54     |\n| Foreign                        | 9             | 1       | 22     |\n| Total current                  | (2,189)       | (23)    | 750    |\n| Deferred:                      |               |         |        |\n| Federal                        | 90            | 742     | (119)  |\n| State and local                | (347)         | 56      | 149    |\n| Foreign                        | 16            | 9       | (16)   |\n| Total deferred                 | (241)         | 807     | 14     |\n| Income tax provision (benefit) | $  (2,430)  $ | 784     | $  764 |",

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, state and local operating loss carryforwards were $228 million  and  $11  million,  respectively,  which  includes  a  mix  of  indefinite  carryforward  ability  and expiration periods ranging from 2021 through 2042.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $11 million of valuation allowances have been recorded related to income  taxes.  A  federal  valuation  allowance  was  established  for  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  of $2 million, primarily due to the expected realizability of foreign tax credits. A state and local valuation allowance  was  established  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  of  $9  million,  based  on  expected realizability of state and local tax operating losses.\n\nMPC  is  continuously  undergoing  examination  of  its  U.S.  federal  income  tax  returns  by  the  Internal Revenue  Service  ('IRS').  Since  2012,  we  have  continued  to  participate  in  the  Compliance  Assurance Process  ('CAP').  CAP  is  a  real-time  audit  of  the  U.S.  Federal  income  tax  return  that  allows  the  IRS, working in conjunction with MPC, to determine tax return compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing the return. This program provides us with greater certainty about our tax liability for years under examination by the IRS. While Andeavor also underwent continual IRS examination, it did not participate in the CAP for tax periods prior to October 1, 2018.\n\nAndeavor  and  its  subsidiaries'  IRS  audits  have  been  completed  through  the  2015  tax  year.  We  believe adequate provisions have been established for potential tax in periods not closed to examination. Further, we are routinely involved in U.S. state income tax audits. We believe all other audits will be resolved with the amounts provided for these liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, our federal income tax returns remain subject to examination for years 2016 through 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we have various state and local income tax returns subject to examination for years 2006 through 2019, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity in unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n| (In millions)                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| January 1 balance                           | $  32  | $  211 | $  19  |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior years  | 12     | 2      | -      |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior years | (18)   | (2)    | (5)    |\n| Settlements                                 | (3)    | (19)   | -      |\n| Statute of limitations                      | -      | (160)  | (12)   |\n| Acquired from Andeavor                      | -      | -      | 209    |\n| December 31 balance                         | $  23  | $  32  | $  211 |\n\nIf the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 were recognized, $14 million would affect our effective income tax rate. There were $9 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 for which it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits would significantly decrease during the next twelve months. For tax years 2009 and 2010, Andeavor had asserted a federal income tax claim for $159 million from the income tax effect of the receipt of the ethanol blender's excise tax credit, for which the tax benefit was not recorded. The statute of limitations for the IRS appeal process expired during the fourth quarter 2019 since the ability to obtain a refund was remote.",

See Note 29 for indemnification information.\n\nInterest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded as part of the provision for income taxes. Such interest and penalties were net expenses (benefits) of $(19) million, $(2) million and $1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $(5) million and $7 million of interest and penalties were accrued related to income taxes.\n\n## 16.  INVENTORIES\n\n|                        | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (In millions)          | 2020           | 2019           |\n| Crude oil              | $  2,588       | $  3,472       |\n| Refined products       | 4,478          | 5,359          |\n| Materials and supplies | 933            | 973            |\n| Total                  | $  7,999       | $  9,804       |\n\nThe LIFO method accounted for 88 percent and 90 percent of total inventory value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no excess of replacement or current cost over our stated LIFO cost as of December 31, 2020. Current acquisition costs were estimated to exceed the LIFO inventory value by $787 million at December 31, 2019\n\nThe cost of inventories of crude oil and refined products is determined primarily under the LIFO method. During 2020, we recorded a $561 million charge to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product  inventories.  The  costs  of  inventories  in  the  historical  LIFO  layers  which  were  liquidated  were higher than current costs, which resulted in the charge to cost of revenues. There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories in 2019 and 2018. .\n\n## 17.  EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\n## The Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC\n\nEffective  October  1,  2019,  The  Andersons,  Inc.  and  MPC  contributed  jointly  owned  equity  interests  in three  ethanol  entities  into  a  new  legal  entity,  The  Andersons  Marathon  Holdings  LLC  ('TAMH'). Concurrently, The Andersons, Inc. contributed a wholly-owned ethanol facility to TAMH. In accordance with ASC 845, we derecognized the historical cost of our equity method investments in the legacy entities amounting to $123 million and recognized the new equity method investment in TAMH at fair value. We used a combination of market, income and cost approaches to determine the fair value of our ownership interest in TAMH with more reliance on the market and income approaches. The estimated cash flows used in the income approach were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital estimate and the market approach  utilized  EBITDA  and  capacity  multiples  for  similar  companies  and  transactions.  This  is  a nonrecurring fair value measurement and is recognized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimated the fair value of our ownership interest to be $175 million. The excess of the estimated fair value of our ownership interest over the carrying value of the derecognized net assets resulted in a $52 million non-cash net  gain  recorded  as  a  net  gain  on  disposal  of  assets  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of income.\n\n## Capline LLC\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we executed agreements with Capline Pipeline Company LLC ('Capline LLC') to contribute our 33 percent undivided interest in the Capline pipeline system in exchange for a 33 percent ownership interest in Capline LLC. In connection with our execution of these agreements, Capline LLC initiated a binding open season for southbound service from Patoka, Illinois to St. James,  Louisiana  or  Liberty,  Mississippi  with  an  additional  origination  point  at  Cushing,  Oklahoma. Service from Cushing, Oklahoma is part of a joint tariff with Diamond pipeline.",

        "page_content": "In  accordance with ASC 810, we derecognized our undivided interest amounting to $143 million of net assets and recognized the Capline LLC ownership interest we received at fair value. We used an income approach to determine the fair value of our ownership interest under a Monte Carlo simulation method. We estimated  the  fair  value  of  our  ownership  interest  to  be  $350  million.  This  is  a  nonrecurring  fair  value measurement and is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Monte Carlo simulation inputs include ranges of tariff rates, operating volumes, operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions. The estimated  cash  flows  were  discounted  using  a  Monte  Carlo  market  participant  weighted  average  cost  of capital estimate. None of the inputs to the Monte Carlo simulation are individually significant. The excess of the estimated fair value of our ownership interest over the carrying value of the derecognized net assets resulted  in  a  $207  million  non-cash  net  gain  recorded  as  a  net  gain  on  disposal  of  assets  in  the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n\nAs the Capline system is currently idled, Capline LLC is unable to fund its operations without financial support from its equity owners and is a VIE. MPC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, due to our inability  to  unilaterally  control  significant  decision-making  rights.  Our  maximum  exposure  to  loss  as  a result  of  our  involvement  with  Capline  LLC  includes  our  equity  investment,  any  additional  capital contribution commitments and any operating expenses incurred by Capline LLC in excess of compensation received for performance of the operating services.",

Commodity derivatives are covered under master netting agreements with an unconditional right to offset. Collateral deposits in futures commission merchant accounts covered by master netting agreements related to Level 1 commodity derivatives are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nLevel 2 instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices,  such  as  liquidity,  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability. Commodity  derivatives  in  Level  2  are  OTC  contracts,  which  are  valued  using  market  quotations  from independent price reporting agencies, third-party  brokers  and  commodity  exchange price curves that are corroborated with market data.\n\nLevel  3  instruments  include  embedded  derivatives  in  commodity  contracts.  The  embedded  derivative liability relates to a natural gas purchase agreement embedded in a keep -whole processing agreement. The fair  value  calculation  for  these  Level  3  instruments  at  December 31, 2020 used significant unobservable inputs including: (1) NGL prices interpolated and extrapolated due to inactive markets ranging from $0.47 to $1.09 per gallon with a weighted average of $0.59 per gallon and (2) the probability of renewal of 100 percent for the first and second five-year term of the natural gas purchase agreement and the related keepwhole  processing  agreement.  Increases  or  decreases  in  the  fractionation  spread  result  in  an  increase  or decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability.",

Our  fair  value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term duration of the instruments and the expected insignificance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.  The  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facilities  and  term  loan  facility,  which  include  variable interest rates, approximate fair value. The fair value of our fixed and floating rate long-term debt is based on prices from recent trade activity and is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying and  fair  values  of  our  debt  were  approximately  $31.1  billion  and  $34.9  billion  at  December  31,  2020, respectively, and approximately $28.3 billion and $30.1 billion at December 31, 2019, respectively. These carrying and fair values of our debt exclude the unamortized issuance costs which are netted against our total debt.\n\n## 21. DERIVATIVES\n\nFor  further  information  regarding  the  fair  value  measurement  of  derivative  instruments,  including  any effect of master netting agreements or collateral, see Note 20. See Note 2 for a discussion of the types of derivatives  we  use  and  the  reasons  for  them.  We  do  not  designate  any  of  our  commodity  derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. The fair value amounts below are presented on a gross basis and do not reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms  of  our  master  netting  arrangements  including  cash  collateral  on  deposit  with,  or  received  from, brokers. We offset the recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty in our financial statements when a legal right of offset exists. As a result, the asset and liability amounts below will not agree with the amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n| (In millions)                              | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Balance Sheet Location                     | Asset               | Liability           |\n| Commodity derivatives                      |                     |                     |\n| Other current assets                       | $  88               | $  91               |\n| Other current liabilities (a)              | -                   | 7                   |\n| Deferred credits and other liabilities (a) | -                   | 56                  |",

        "page_content": "## MPC Revolving Credit Agreements\n\nOn August 28, 2018, in connection with the Andeavor acquisition, MPC entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a $5.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in 2023. The five-year credit agreement became effective on October 1, 2018.\n\nOn September 23, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. This revolving credit agreement provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and replaces a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, MPC entered into an additional 364-day revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2021. In February 2021, we elected to terminate this credit agreement. This facility provided us with additional liquidity and financial flexibility during  the  then  ongoing  commodity  price  and  demand  downturn.  There  were  no  borrowings  under  this credit  facility,  and  we  determined  that  the  incremental  borrowing  capacity  of  the  facility  was  no  longer necessary. We do not intend to replace this facility. We incurred no early termination fees as a result of the early termination of this credit agreement.\n\nMPC has an option under its $5.0 billion five-year credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to, among other conditions, the consent of the lenders whose commitments  would  be  increased.  In  addition,  MPC  may  request  up  to  two  one-year  extensions  of  the maturity date of the five-year credit agreement subject to, among other conditions, the consent of lenders holding a majority of the commitments, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate  on  the  then-effective  maturity  date.  The  five-year  credit  agreement  includes  sub-facilities  for swing-line loans of up to $250 million and letters of credit of up to $2.2 billion (which may be increased to up to $3.0 billion upon receipt of additional letter of credit issuing commitments).\n\nBorrowings under the MPC credit agreements bear interest, at our election, at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (both as defined in the MPC credit agreements), plus an applicable margin. We are charged various fees and expenses under the MPC credit agreements, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the commitments and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and the commitment fees payable under the MPC credit agreements fluctuate based on changes, if any, to our credit ratings.\n\nThe  MPC  credit  agreements  contain  certain  representations  and  warranties,  affirmative  and  restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type, including  a  financial  covenant  that  requires  us  to  maintain  a  ratio  of  Consolidated  Net  Debt  to  Total Capitalization (each as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The covenants also restrict, among other things, our ability and/or the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets or enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPC credit agreements.\n\n## Trade Receivables Securitization Facility\n\nThe trade receivables facility consists of our wholly-owned subsidiaries selling or contributing on an ongoing  basis  all  of  their  trade  receivables,  together  with  all  related  security  and  interests  in  the  proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, MPC Trade  Receivables  Company  LLC  ('TRC'),  in  exchange  for  a  combination  of  cash,  equity  and/or borrowings  under  a  subordinated  note  issued  by  TRC.  TRC,  in  turn,  has  the  ability  to  sell  undivided ownership interests  in  qualifying  trade  receivables,  together  with  all  related  security  and  interests  in  the proceeds  thereof,  without  recourse,  to  the  purchasing  group  in  exchange  for  cash  proceeds.  The  trade receivables facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $750 million, provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group, including outstanding letters of credit, may not exceed the lesser of $750 million or the balance of qualifying trade receivables at any one time.\n\nTo the extent that TRC retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received under the facility, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of TRC with those of MPC. The receivables sold or contributed to TRC are available  first  and  foremost  to  satisfy  claims  of  the  creditors  of  TRC  and  are  not  available  to satisfy  the  claims  of  creditors  of  MPC.  TRC  has  granted  a  security  interest  in  all  of  its  assets  to  the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.",

        "page_content": "Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  undivided  percentage  ownership  interests  in  qualifying  receivables  under  the trade receivables facility are reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group. TRC pays floating-rate interest charges and usage fees  on  amounts  outstanding  under  the  trade  receivables  facility,  if  any,  unused  fees  on  the  portion  of unused commitments and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the trade receivables facility.\n\nThe receivables purchase agreement and receivables sale agreement contain representations and covenants that  we  consider  usual  and  customary  for  arrangements  of  this  type.  Trade  receivables  are  subject  to customary criteria, limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by TRC pursuant to the trade receivables facility. In addition, further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the trade receivables facility are subject to termination, and TRC may be subject to default fees, upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that are included in the receivables purchase agreement, all of which we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the receivables purchase agreement and receivables sale agreement.\n\n## MPLX Credit Agreement\n\nUpon the completion of the merger of MPLX and ANDX on July 30, 2019, the MPLX bank revolving credit facility was amended and restated to increase the borrowing capacity to $3.5 billion and to extend the maturity date to July 30, 2024. The ANDX revolving and dropdown credit facilities were terminated and all outstanding balances were repaid and funded with borrowings under the amended and restated MPLX $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility.\n\nThe MPLX credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to approximately $300 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $150 million. The revolving borrowing capacity may be increased by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase.\n\nBorrowings under the MPLX credit agreement bear interest, at MPLX's election, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) plus an applicable margin. MPLX is charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the commitments and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and the commitment fees  payable  under  the  MPLX  credit  agreement  fluctuate  based  on  changes,  if  any,  to  MPLX's  credit ratings.\n\nThe  MPLX  credit  agreement  contains  certain  representations  and  warranties,  affirmative  and  restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain  acquisitions).  Consolidated  EBITDA  is  subject  to  adjustments  for  certain  acquisitions  completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. The covenants also restrict, among other things, MPLX's ability and/or the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX was in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPLX credit agreement.",

        "page_content": "## 26.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\n\nWe  have  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  substantially  all  employees.  Benefits under  these  plans  have  been  based  primarily  on  age,  years  of  service  and  final  average  pensionable earnings. The years of service component of these formulae was frozen as of December 31, 2009. Certain of  the  pensionable  earnings  components  were  frozen  as  of  December  31,  2012.  Benefits  for  service beginning January 1, 2010 and beginning on January 1, 2016 are based on a cash balance formula with an annual percentage of eligible pay credited based upon age and years of service or at a flat rate of eligible pay, depending on covered employee group. Substantially all of our employees also accrue benefits under a defined contribution plan.\n\n| (In millions)                                          | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash balance weighted average interest crediting rates | 3.00 % | 3.18 % | 3.00 % |\n\nWe  also  have  other  postretirement  benefits  covering  most  employees.  Retiree  health  care  benefits  are provided  through  comprehensive  hospital,  surgical,  major  medical  benefit,  prescription  drug  and  related health  benefit  provisions  subject  to  various  cost  sharing  features.  Retiree  life  insurance  benefits  are provided to a closed group of retirees. Other postretirement benefits are not funded in advance.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Andeavor  acquisition,  we  assumed  a  number  of  additional  qualified  and nonqualified  noncontributory  benefit  pension  plans,  covering  substantially  all  former  Andeavor employees. Benefits under these plans are determined based on final average compensation and years of service  through  December  31,  2010  and  a  cash  balance  formula  for  service  beginning  January  1, 2011. These plans were frozen as of December 31, 2018. Further, as of December 31, 2019, the qualified plans were merged with our existing qualified plans in which the actuarial assumptions were materially the same between the plans. We also assumed a number of additional postretirement benefits covering eligible employees. These benefits were merged with our existing benefits beginning January 1, 2019.\n\n## Obligations and Funded Status\n\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3,369 million and $3,013 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe following summarizes our defined benefit pension plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\n\n|                                 | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (In millions)                   | 2020           | 2019           |\n| Projected benefit obligations   | $  3,671       | $  3,220       |\n| Accumulated benefit obligations | 3,369          | 3,013          |\n| Fair value of plan assets       | 2,621          | 2,531          |",

        "page_content": "## Expected Long-term Return on Plan Assets\n\nThe overall expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is determined based on an asset rate-ofreturn modeling tool developed by a third-party investment group. The tool utilizes underlying assumptions based on actual returns by asset category and inflation and takes into account our asset allocation to derive an  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  those  assets.  Capital  market  assumptions  reflect  the  long-term capital market outlook. The assumptions for equity and fixed income investments are developed using a building-block approach, reflecting observable inflation information and interest rate information available in  the  fixed  income  markets.  Long-term  assumptions  for  other  asset  categories  are  based  on  historical results, current market characteristics and the professional judgment of our internal and external investment teams.\n\n## Assumed Health Care Cost Trend\n\nThe following summarizes the assumed health care cost trend rates.\n\n|                                                                                     | December 31,   | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                                     | 2020           | 2019           | 2018           |\n| Health care cost trend rate assumed for the following year:                         |                |                |                |\n| Medical: Pre-65                                                                     | 6.00 %         | 6.20 %         | 6.80 %         |\n| Prescription drugs                                                                  | 7.00 %         | 8.10 %         | 9.50 %         |\n| Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate  trend rate): |                |                |                |\n| Medical: Pre-65                                                                     | 4.50 %         | 4.50 %         | 4.50 %         |\n| Prescription drugs                                                                  | 4.50 %         | 4.50 %         | 4.50 %         |\n| Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate:                                 |                |                |                |\n| Medical: Pre-65                                                                     | 2028           | 2027           | 2027           |\n| Prescription drugs                                                                  | 2028           | 2027           | 2027           |\n\nIncreases in the post-65 medical plan premium for the Marathon Petroleum Health Plan and the Marathon Petroleum Retiree Health Plan are the lower of the trend rate or four percent.\n\n## Plan Investment Policies and Strategies\n\nThe investment policies for our pension plan assets reflect the funded status of the plans and expectations regarding our future ability to make further contributions. Long-term investment goals are to: (1) manage the assets in accordance with the legal requirements of all applicable laws; (2) diversify plan investments across asset classes to achieve an optimal balance between risk and return and between income and growth of  assets  through  capital  appreciation;  and  (3)  source  benefit  payments  primarily  through  existing  plan assets and anticipated future returns.\n\nThe investment goals are implemented to manage the plans' funded status volatility and minimize future cash contributions. The asset allocation strategy will change over time in response to changes primarily in funded status, which is dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, the independent actions of our investment committee, required cash flows to and from the plans and other factors deemed appropriate. Such changes in asset allocation are intended to allocate additional assets to the fixed income asset class should the funded status improve. The fixed income asset class shall be invested in such a manner that its interest rate sensitivity correlates highly with that of the plans' liabilities. Other asset classes are intended to provide  additional  return  with  associated  higher  levels  of  risk.  Investment  performance  and  risk  is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset and liability studies. At December 31, 2020, the primary plan's targeted asset allocation was 50 percent equity, private equity, real estate, and timber securities and 50 percent fixed income securities.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets  are  measured  at  fair  value.  The  following  provides  a  description  of  the  valuation  techniques employed for each major plan asset category at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include a collective fund serving as the investment vehicle for the cash reserves and cash held by third-party investment managers. The collective fund is valued at net asset value ('NAV')",

Cash and cash equivalents held by third-party investment managers are valued using a cost approach and are considered Level 2.\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity  investments  includes  common  stock,  mutual  and  pooled  funds.  Common  stock  investments  are valued  using  a  market  approach,  which  are  priced  daily  in  active  markets  and  are  considered  Level  1. Mutual and pooled equity funds are well diversified portfolios, representing a mix of strategies in domestic, international  and  emerging  market  strategies.  Mutual  funds  are  publicly  registered,  valued  at  NAV  on  a daily basis using a market approach and are considered Level 1 assets. Pooled funds are valued at NAV using a market approach and are considered Level 2.\n\n## Fixed Income\n\nFixed income investments include corporate bonds, U.S. dollar treasury bonds and municipal bonds. These securities  are  priced  on  observable  inputs  using  a  combination  of  market,  income  and  cost  approaches. These securities are considered Level 2 assets. Fixed income also includes a well diversified bond portfolio structured as a pooled fund. This fund is valued at NAV on a daily basis using a market approach and is considered  Level  2.  Other  investments  classified  as  Level  1  include  mutual  funds  that  are  publicly registered, valued at NAV on a daily basis using a market approach.\n\n## Private Equity\n\nPrivate  equity  investments  include  interests  in  limited  partnerships  which  are  valued  using  information provided  by  external  managers  for  each  individual  investment  held  in  the  fund.  These  holdings  are considered Level 3.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nReal estate investments consist of interests in limited partnerships. These holdings are either appraised or valued using the investment manager's assessment of assets held. These holdings are considered Level 3.\n\n## Other\n\nOther investments include two limited liability companies ('LLCs') with no public market. The LLCs were formed to acquire timberland in the northwest U.S. These holdings are either appraised or valued using the investment manager's assessment of assets held.

In  2020,  we  made  contributions  totaling  $3  million  to  our  funded  pension  plans.

The  risks  of  participating  in  this multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n- \u00b7 If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\n- \u00b7 If  we  choose to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\n\nOur participation in this plan for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is outlined in the table below. The 'EIN' column provides the Employee Identification Number for the plan. The most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2020 and 2019 is for the plan's year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded. The 'FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented' column indicates a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject. There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of 2020, 2019 and 2018 contributions. Our portion of the contributions does not make up more than five percent of total contributions to the plan.\n\n|                                                                   |           | Pension  Protection Act Zone  Status   | Pension  Protection Act Zone  Status   | FIP/ RP Status Pending/   | MPC Contributions  (   | In millions   | )    | Surcharge Imposed   | Expiration Date of Collective -  Bargaining   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------|------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Pension Fund                                                      | EIN       | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | Implemented               | 2020                   | 2019          | 2018 | Surcharge Imposed   | Agreement                                     |\n| Central States,  Southeast and  Southwest Areas  Pension Plan (a) | 366044243 | Red                                    | Red                                    | Implemented               | $  5                   | $  4          | $  4 | No                  | January 31, 2024                              |\n\n## Multiemployer Health and Welfare Plan\n\nWe contribute to one multiemployer health and welfare plan that covers both active employees and retirees.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## Description of the Plans\n\nEffective  April  26,  2012,  our  employees  and  non-employee  directors  became  eligible  to  receive  equity awards under the Amended and Restated Marathon Petroleum Corporation 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan  ('MPC  2012  Plan').  The  MPC  2012  Plan  authorizes  the  Compensation  and  Organization Development Committee of our board of directors ('Committee') to grant non-qualified or incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), cash awards and performance awards to our employees and non-employee directors. Under the MPC 2012 Plan, no more than 50 million shares of our common stock may be delivered and no more than 20 million shares of our common stock may be the subject of awards that are not stock options or stock appreciation rights. In the sole discretion of the Committee, 20 million shares of our common stock may be granted as incentive stock options. Shares issued as a result of awards granted under these plans are funded through the issuance of new MPC common shares.\n\nPrior to April 26, 2012, our employees and non-employee directors were eligible to receive equity awards under the Marathon Petroleum Corporation 2011 Second Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan ('MPC 2011 Plan').\n\nIn connection with the Andeavor acquisition in October of 2018, we converted the outstanding option and equity  incentive  awards  (other  than  awards  held  by  non-employee  directors  of  Andeavor,  which  awards were  paid  out  in  connection  with  the  acquisition)  under  the  Andeavor  plans  to  awards  that  provide  for rights to acquire (in the case of options) or be settled in or otherwise determined in reference to shares of MPC  common  stock  in  place  of  shares  of  Andeavor  common  stock  (in  the  case  of  equity  incentive awards). As part of that conversion, we used an exchange ratio for the respective share prices of Andeavor common stock and MPC common stock to ensure that the award holders' economic opportunity remained constant,  and  for  converted  awards,  which  included  a  performance  component,  performance  was determined  at  the  time  of  the  conversion  and  the  awards  became  subject  to  a  time-based  vesting  only design. The converted awards otherwise continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of their award agreements and the applicable Andeavor plan under which such awards were granted.\n\n## Stock-Based Awards under the Plans\n\nWe expense all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nWe grant stock options to certain officer and non-officer employees. All of the stock options granted in 2020 were granted under the MPC 2012 Plan. Stock options awarded under the MPC 2011 Plan and the MPC 2012 Plan represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock at its fair market value, which is the closing price of MPC's common stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years from the date they are granted, and vest over a requisite service period of three years. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions.\n\n## Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\nWe grant restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. In general, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees vest over a requisite service period of three years. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted to officers are subject to an additional one year holding period after the three-year vesting period. Restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such  stock;  however,  dividends  are  accrued  and  when  vested  are  payable  at  the  dates  specified  in  the awards. The non-vested shares are not transferable and are held by our transfer agent. The fair values of restricted stock are equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date. Restricted stock units granted  to  non-employee  directors  are  considered  to  vest  immediately  at  the  time  of  the  grant  for accounting purposes, as they are non-forfeitable, but are not issued until the director's departure from the board of directors. Restricted stock unit recipients do not have the right to vote any shares of stock and accrue dividend equivalents which when vested are payable at the dates specified in the awards.",

        "page_content": "## Performance Units\n\nWe grant performance unit awards to certain officer employees. Performance units are dollar denominated. The  target  value  of  all  performance  units  is  $1.00,  with  actual  payout  up  to  $2.00  per  unit  (up  to  200 percent of target). Performance units issued under the MPC 2012 Plan have a 36-month requisite service period. The payout value of these awards will be determined by the relative ranking of the total shareholder return ('TSR' ) of MPC common stock compared to the TSR of a select group of peer companies, as well as the Standard & Poor's 500 Energy Index fund over an average of four measurement periods. These awards will be settled 25 percent in MPC common stock and 75 percent in cash. The number of shares actually distributed  will  be  determined  by  dividing  25  percent  of  the  final  payout  by  the  closing  price  of  MPC common stock on the day the Committee certifies the final TSR rankings, or the next trading day if the certification  is  made  outside  of  normal  trading  hours.  The  performance  units  paying  out  in  cash  are accounted for as liability awards and recorded at fair value with a mark-to-market adjustment made each quarter. The performance units that settle in shares are accounted for as equity awards and do not receive dividend equivalents.\n\n## Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nThe following table reflects activity related to our stock-based compensation arrangements, including the converted awards related to the acquisition of Andeavor:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                 | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Stock-based compensation expense                                              | $  100 | $  153 | $  127 |\n| Tax benefit recognized on stock-based compensation expense                    | 25     | 35     | 31     |\n| Cash received by MPC upon exercise of stock option awards                     | 11     | 10     | 24     |\n| Tax (expense)/benefit received for tax deductions for stock  awards exercised | 16     | (3)    | 14     |\n\n## Stock Option Awards\n\nThe Black Scholes option-pricing model values used to value stock option awards granted were determined based on the following weighted average assumptions:\n\n|                                                                        | 2020     | 2019     | 2018     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Weighted average exercise price per share                              | $  28.78 | $  61.92 | $  67.71 |\n| Expected life in years                                                 | 5.9      | 6.0      | 6.2      |\n| Expected volatility                                                    | 39 %     | 32 %     | 34 %     |\n| Expected dividend yield                                                | 4.7 %    | 3.4 %    | 3.0 %    |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                                | 0.6 %    | 2.4 %    | 2.7 %    |\n| Weighted average grant date fair value of stock option awards  granted | $  7.40  | $  13.65 | $  17.21 |\n\nThe expected life of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be held prior to exercise.

MPLX's primary natural gas lease operations relate to a natural gas gathering agreement in the Marcellus Shale for which it earns a fixed-fee for providing gathering services to a single producer using a dedicated gathering system. As  the  gathering  system  is  expanded,  the  fixed-fee  charged  to  the  producer  is  adjusted  to  include  the additional gathering assets in the lease. The primary term of the natural gas gathering arrangement expires in  2038  and  will  continue  thereafter  on  a  year-to-year  basis  until  terminated  by  either  party.  Other significant natural gas implicit leases relate to a natural gas processing agreement in the Marcellus Shale and  a  natural  gas  processing  agreement  in  the  Southern  Appalachia  region  for  which  MPLX  earns minimum monthly fees for providing processing services to a single producer using a dedicated processing plant.  The  primary  term  of  these  natural  gas  processing  agreements  expires  during  2027  and  2023, respectively, and will continue thereafter on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party.\n\nMPLX did not elect to use the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for lessor arrangements. The tables below represent the portion of the contract allocated to the lease component based on relative standalone selling price. Lessor agreements are currently deemed operating, as MPLX elected the practical expedient to carry forward historical classification conclusions. If and when a modification of an existing agreement occurs and the agreement is required to assessed under ASC 842, MPLX assesses the amended agreement and makes a determination as to whether a reclassification of the lease is required.\n\nOur  revenue  from  implicit  lease  arrangements,  excluding  executory  costs,  totaled  approximately  $273 million and $254 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Under ASC 840, our revenue from implicit lease arrangements, excluding executory costs, totaled approximately $221 million in 2018.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Some of these matters are discussed below. For matters for which we have not recorded a liability, we are unable  to  estimate  a  range  of  possible  loss  because  the  issues  involved  have  not  been  fully  developed through  pleadings,  discovery  or  court  proceedings.  However,  the  ultimate  resolution  of  some  of  these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws  generally  provide  for  control  of  pollutants  released  into  the  environment  and  require  responsible parties  to  undertake  remediation  of  hazardous  waste  disposal  sites  and  certain  other  locations  including presently  or  formerly  owned  or  operated  retail  marketing  sites.  Penalties  may  be  imposed  for noncompliance.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $397 million and $396 million, respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties, if any, that may be imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain states,  under  programs  to  assist  companies  in  clean-up  efforts  related  to  underground  storage  tanks  at presently  or  formerly  owned  or  operated  retail  marketing  sites,  were  $7  million  and  $9  million  at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nGovernmental and other entities in various states have filed lawsuits against energy companies, including MPC. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. We are currently subject to such proceedings in federal or  state  courts  in  California,  Delaware,  Maryland,  Hawaii,  Rhode  Island  and  South  Carolina.  Similar lawsuits  may  be  filed  in  other  jurisdictions.  At  this  early  stage,  the  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters remain uncertain, and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, can be determined.\n\nWe  are  involved  in  a  number  of  environmental  enforcement  matters  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the resolution  of  these  environmental  matters  will  not,  individually  or  collectively,  have  a  material  adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nOur short-term asset retirement obligations were $14 million and $20 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our long-term asset retirement obligations were $183 million and $184 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in deferred credits and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.",

        "page_content": "## Other Legal Proceedings\n\nIn early July 2020, MPLX received a Notification of Trespass Determination from the Bureau of Indian Affairs ('BIA') relating to a portion of the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline ('THPP'), which crosses the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. The notification covered the rights of way for 23 tracts of land and demanded the immediate cessation of pipeline operations. The notification also assessed trespass damages of approximately $187 million. MPLX appealed this determination, which triggered an automatic stay of the  requested  pipeline  shutdown  and  payment.  On  October  29,  the  Assistant  Secretary  -  Indian  Affairs issued an order vacating the BIA's trespass order and requiring the Regional Director for the BIA Great Plains  Region  to  issue  a  new  decision  on  or  before  December  15  covering  all  34  tracts  at  issue.  On December 15, the Regional Director of the BIA issued a new trespass notice to THPP consistent with the Assistant  Secretary  of  Indian  Affairs  order  vacating  the  prior  trespass  order.  The  new  order  found  that THPP  was  in  trespass  and  assessed  trespass  damages  of  approximately  $4  million  (including  interest), which has been paid. The order also required THPP to immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue. THPP has complied with the Regional Director's December 15, 2020 notice. On February 12, 2021, landowners filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, requesting, among other things, that decisions by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs and the Interior Board of Indian Appeals be vacated as to the award of damages to plaintiffs.\n\nMPLX continues to work towards a settlement of this matter with holders of the property rights at issue. Management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nWe are also a party to a number of other lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the  resolution  of  these  other  lawsuits  and  proceedings  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWe have provided certain guarantees, direct and indirect, of the indebtedness of other companies. Under the terms of most of these guarantee arrangements, we would be required to perform should the guaranteed party  fail  to  fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  specified  arrangements.  In  addition  to  these  financial guarantees, we also have various performance guarantees related to specific agreements.\n\n## Guarantees related to indebtedness of equity method investees\n\n## LOOP and LOCAP\n\nMPC and MPLX hold interests in an offshore oil port, LOOP, and MPLX holds an interest in a crude oil pipeline  system,  LOCAP.  Both  LOOP  and  LOCAP  have  secured  various  project  financings  with throughput and deficiency agreements. Under the agreements, MPC, as a shipper, is required to advance funds if the investees are unable to service their debt. Any such advances are considered prepayments of future  transportation  charges.  The  duration  of  the  agreements  varies  but  tend  to  follow  the  terms  of  the underlying debt, which extend through 2037. Our maximum potential undiscounted payments under these agreements for the debt principal totaled $171 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Dakota Access Pipeline\n\nIn connection with MPLX's approximate 9.19 percent indirect interest in a joint venture ('Dakota Access') that  owns  and  operates  the  Dakota  Access  Pipeline  and  Energy  Transfer  Crude  Oil  Pipeline  projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system or DAPL, MPLX entered into a Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement. MPLX, along with the other joint venture owners in the Bakken Pipeline system, has  agreed  to  make  equity  contributions  to  the  joint  venture  upon  certain  events  occurring  to  allow  the entities that own and operate the Bakken Pipeline system to satisfy their senior note payment obligations. The  senior  notes  were  issued  to  repay  amounts  owed  by  the  pipeline  companies  to  fund  the  cost  of construction of the Bakken Pipeline system.\n\nIn March 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the 'D.D.C.') ordered the U.S. Army Corps  of  Engineers  ('Army  Corps'),  which  granted  permits  and  an  easement  for  the  Bakken  Pipeline system,  to  conduct  a  full  environmental  impact  statement  ('EIS'),  and  further  requested  briefing  on whether an easement necessary for the operation of the Bakken Pipeline system should be vacated while the EIS is being prepared.",

        "page_content": "On July 6, 2020, the D.D.C. ordered vacatur of the easement to cross Lake Oahe during the pendency of an EIS and further ordered a shut down of the pipeline by August 5, 2020. The D.D.C. denied a motion to stay that order. Dakota Access and the Army Corps appealed the D.D.C.'s orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  (the  'Court  of  Appeals').  On  July  14,  2020,  the  Court  of  Appeals issued an administrative stay while the court considered Dakota Access and the Army Corps' emergency motion for stay pending appeal. On August 5, 2020, the Court of Appeals stayed the D.D.C.'s injunction that required the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. The Court of Appeals denied a stay of the D.D.C.'s March order, which required the EIS, and further denied a stay of the D.D.C.'s July order, which vacated the easement. On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals upheld the D.D.C.'s order vacating the easement while the Army Corps prepares the EIS. The Court of Appeals reversed the D.D.C.'s order to the extent it directed that the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil. In the D.D.C., briefing has been completed for a renewed request for an injunction. The pipeline remains operational.\n\nIf the pipeline is temporarily shut down pending completion of the EIS, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown. It is expected that MPLX would contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit and/or return the pipeline  into  operation.  If  the  vacatur  of  the  easement  permit  results  in  a  permanent  shutdown  of  the pipeline, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds (including the one percent redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes) and any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under the Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement were approximately $230 million.\n\n## Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners\n\nIn connection with our 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, we have agreed to conditionally guarantee our portion of the obligations of the joint venture and its subsidiaries under a senior secured term loan agreement. The term loan agreement provides for loans of up to $325 million to finance the acquisition of  four  product  tankers.  MPC's  liability  under  the  guarantee  for  each  vessel  is  conditioned  upon  the occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  if  we  cease  to  maintain  an  investment  grade  credit  rating  or  the charter  for  the  relevant  product  tanker  ceases  to  be  in  effect  and  is  not  replaced  by  a  charter  with  an investment grade company on certain defined commercial terms. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under this agreement for debt principal totaled $119 million.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  50  percent  indirect  interest  in  Crowley  Blue  Water  Partners,  we  have  agreed  to provide a conditional guarantee of up to 50 percent of its outstanding debt balance in the event there is no charter agreement in place with an investment grade customer for the entity's three vessels as well as other financial support in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under this arrangement was $115 million.\n\n## Marathon Oil indemnifications\n\nThe separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect our spinoff provide  for  cross-indemnities  between  Marathon  Oil  and  us.  In  general,  Marathon  Oil  is  required  to indemnify us for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil's historical oil and gas exploration and production operations, oil  sands  mining  operations  and  integrated  gas  operations,  and  we  are  required  to  indemnify Marathon Oil for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil's historical refining, marketing and transportation operations. The terms of these indemnifications are indefinite and the amounts are not capped.\n\n## Other guarantees\n\nWe  have  entered  into  other  guarantees  with  maximum  potential  undiscounted  payments  totaling  $99 million as of December 31, 2020, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an equity method investee for certain catastrophic events, in lieu of procuring insurance coverage, a commitment to fund a share of the bonds issued by a government entity for construction of public utilities in the event that other industrial users of the facility default on their utility payments and leases of assets containing general lease indemnities and guaranteed residual values.\n\n## General guarantees associated with dispositions\n\nOver the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related agreements  contain  performance  and  general  guarantees,  including  guarantees  regarding  inaccuracies  in representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  agreements,  and  environmental  and  general  indemnifications that  require  us  to  perform  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  triggering  event  or  condition.

        "page_content": "indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the maximum  potential  amount  of  future  payments  that  could  be  made  under  such  contractual  provisions because  of  the  variability  inherent  in  the  guarantees  and  indemnities.  Most  often,  the  nature  of  the guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the outcome can be based.\n\n## Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n\nCertain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified construction  milestones  are  not  achieved  for  reasons  other  than  force  majeure.  In  certain  cases,  certain producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays that are not due to force majeure.",

All periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n\n|                                                           | 2020 Quarter Ended   | 2020 Quarter Ended   | 2020 Quarter Ended   | 2020 Quarter Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions, except per share data)                      | March 31             | June 30              | September  30        | December  31         |\n| Sales and other operating revenues                        | $  22,204            | $  12,195            | $  17,408            | $  17,972            |\n| Income (loss) from continuing operations                  | (12,155)             | 575                  | (1,057)              | 390                  |\n| Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of  tax     | (10,536)             | 84                   | (980)                | 250                  |\n| Net income (loss)                                         | (10,218)             | 276                  | (609)                | 574                  |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to MPC                     | (9,234)              | 9                    | (886)                | 285                  |\n| Income (loss) from continuing operations per  share (a) : |                      |                      |                      |                      |\n| Basic                                                     | $  (14.74)  $        | (0.28)  $            | (1.93)  $            | (0.06)               |\n| Diluted                                                   | (14.74)              | (0.28)               | (1.93)               | (0.06)               |\n\n2019\n\n|                                                           | Quarter Ended   | Quarter Ended   | Quarter Ended   | Quarter Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (In millions, except per share data)                      | March 31        | June 30         | September  30   | December  31    |\n| Sales and other operating revenues                        | $  25,349       | $  30,239       | $  27,552       | $  28,008       |\n| Income from continuing operations                         | 526             | 1,698           | 1,680           | 558             |\n| Income from continuing operations, net of tax             | 150             | 1,109           | 1,113           | 77              |\n| Net income                                                | 259             | 1,367           | 1,367           | 262             |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to MPC                     | (7)             | 1,106           | 1,095           | 443             |\n| Income (loss) from continuing operations per  share (a) : |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Basic                                                     | $  (0.17)  $    | 1.28            | $  1.28         | $  0.40         |\n| Diluted                                                   | (0.17)          | 1.27            | 1.27            | 0.40            |",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  chief  executive  officer  and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  our  internal  control over financial reporting.\n\n## ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nOn February 24, 2021, we provided notice to terminate our $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement (the 'April 2020 MPC 364-Day Credit Agreement'), dated as of April 27, 2020, by and among MPC, as borrower,  the  banks  party  thereto  and  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank,  N.A.  as  administrative  agent,  which  was scheduled to expire on April 26, 2021. The material terms and conditions of the April 2020 MPC 364-Day Credit Agreement were described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 27, 2020 (the 'Credit Agreement  Form  8-K')  which  description  is  incorporated  by  reference  herein.  That  description  is  also qualified by reference to the full text of the April 2020 MPC 364-Day Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit  10.1  to  the  Credit  Agreement  Form  8-K.  There  were  no  borrowings  under  the  credit  facility established under the April 2020 MPC 364-Day Credit Agreement, and we determined that the incremental borrowing capacity provided by the New MPC 364-Day Credit Agreement was no longer necessary.\n\nCertain parties to the New MPC 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending or commercial banking services  for  us  and  our  affiliates,  for  which  they  have  received,  and  may  in  the  future  receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.",

Seasonal addresses can be entered for your account.\n\nStock Return Performance Graph The following performance graph compares the cumulative total return, assuming the reinvestment of dividends, of a $100 investment in our common stock from Dec. 31, 2015, to Dec. 31, 2020, compared to the cumulative total return of a $100 investment in the S&P 500 Index and an index of peer companies (selected by us) for the same period.

You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'commitment,' 'could,' 'design,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'forecast,' 'goal,' 'guidance,' 'imply,' 'intend,' 'may,' 'objective,' 'opportunity,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'policy,' 'position,' 'potential,' 'predict,' 'principle,' 'priority,' 'project,' 'proposition,' 'prospective,' 'pursue,' 'seek,' 'should,' 'strategy,' 'target,' 'will,' 'would,' or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We have based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them, as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of our planned sale of Speedway and the expected benefits thereof, on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are di/fficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results may di/ffer materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements. In accordance with 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we have included in our attached Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause actual results to di/ffer materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",
