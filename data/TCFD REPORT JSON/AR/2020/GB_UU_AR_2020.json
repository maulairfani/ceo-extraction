        "page_content": "## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's review\n\nWe have responded well to the challenges of a year that has been dominated by the impact of COVID-19 in maintaining service and support so critical to customers in the North West. Our operational performance has been strong, building on the improvements we delivered in the previous regulatory period and providing us with a great start to achieving our targets for the new 2020-25 price review period (AMP7).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis has been an unprecedented year in which we have had to adapt our operations to protect customers, employees and supply chain partners from the impact of COVID-19.\n\nWe responded well to the challenges and delivered our best ever year of operational performance for customers and the environment. Customer satisfaction remains high and we have made a strong start against our customer outcome delivery incentives (ODIs). This year has seen us reduce leakage to its lowest ever level and supply interruptions to customers have been halved. We are on track to achieve the maximum 4 star rating in the Environment Agency's assessment for 2020, and have reduced environmental pollution incidents by around a third.\n\nOur operational performance has been strong against key metrics and we are pleased to have met or exceeded over 80 per cent of our performance commitments for year 1 of AMP7. In those areas where we have fallen short of our target - such as sewer flooding - we are innovating and investing in new technology in order to improve performance and service to customers over the longer term.\n\nWe witnessed further variability in weather conditions now characteristic of climate change. Our region experienced a hot, dry spring that, coupled with people spending more time at home, resulted in a high level of demand for water. We continued to encourage customers to save water through water efficiency programmes, helping them to preserve this precious resource and save money on their bills. Throughout this period we maintained supplies to customers, demonstrating the benefits of our Systems Thinking approach and supported by the investment we made in previous regulatory periods to enhance the resilience of our services.\n\nWe have a deep and strong relationship with the environment and communities of the North West. Our plans ensure we protect and improve the natural environment and for many years we have been at the forefront of addressing climate change. We are proud to be a signatory to the UN's Race to Zero campaign and we are delivering against all of our six carbon pledges. Our\n\npurpose drives us to make a real, positive contribution to the communities we serve through everything we do, and our investment programme plays a significant role in supporting the north west economy.\n\nThis excellent start to the delivery of our AMP7 plans provides a strong platform for us to play our full part in the economic recovery of the communities we serve as the country emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Maintaining excellent service to customers while supporting our employees\n\nOur continued focus on delivering the best service to customers has never been more important. We delivered significant and sustainable improvements over AMP6 and we ended the period as a leading water and wastewater company. The way Ofwat measures customer satisfaction in AMP7 has changed, with C-MeX measuring household customer satisfaction and D-MeX measuring developer satisfaction. Despite a challenging operating environment, customer satisfaction remains high, earning us an outperformance payment for both C-MeX and D-MeX and positioning us in the sector upper quartile for all-round customer satisfaction.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 has led to many customers facing increasing financial hardship. At the start of the pandemic we saw an increase in the number of customers needing affordability support and the initiatives we put in place in AMP6 enabled us to respond swiftly and effectively. We were the first water company to secure support and regulatory approval for an extension to the scale and scope of our social tariff, providing an additional \u00a315 million to help a further 45,000 customers. We had to consider the appropriateness of continuing our normal billing and collection activities and the most suitable means of engagement. As part of our COVID-19 response, we proactively encouraged customers to contact us if they had been impacted financially by the pandemic. We carried out targeted activities aligned to specific customer segments and changes in customer behaviour to engage with customers, ensuring they knew they could talk to us about their water bill, and highlighting alternative ways to pay.\n\nWe could not have delivered such great service to customers during this time without highly engaged and motivated colleagues right across the organisation who demonstrate tremendous resilience and adaptability to deliver for a region hard hit by the pandemic. To keep employees safe, early on in the year we moved 60 per cent of our workforce to home working and the remainder continued working at",

We have continued to work in this way in line with the government roadmap out of lockdown, while defining and shaping the way for future working. Our employee engagement score this year positioned us above the norm for UK high-performing companies a remarkable score given the past year and testimony to the cohesiveness of the United Utilities team./uni00A0\n\n## Transforming into a digital utility\n\nThrough our Systems Thinking approach we make use of technology, automation and machine intelligence to deliver better performance for customers and the environment.\n\nThrough implementation of Dynamic Network Management - an example of the most advanced form of Systems Thinking in the water sector - we are shifting from reactive management of our wastewater network to using a web of sensors that will provide near real-time performance information. This new digital capability will optimise performance in a predictive and preventative way, delivering greater efficiency, improved service to customers and helping to enhance the environment.\n\nWe recognise the benefits to be gained through building digital skills among our workforce, and our purpose-built technical training academy, established in 2014, has provided skills development and certification to over 2,800 colleagues. The focus on digital skills means that we have the in-house ability to develop and deploy breakthrough technologies at pace and efficiently.\n\nWe make extensive use of apps, many of which are developed in-house, to create digital capability for our field and customerfacing teams. Our new voids app, aimed at unbilled but occupied properties, has helped us to earn the maximum customer ODI outperformance payment on voids this year as well as securing future year benefits of a further \u00a324 million over AMP7.\n\n## Delivering a robust financial performance\n\nWe have delivered another year of robust financial performance, supported by the strength of our balance sheet.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share is 56.2 pence, a decrease of 21 per cent but more than covering the dividend for the year. The anticipated decrease is due to lower allowed regulatory revenue in the first year of the new regulatory period, and an increase in infrastructure renewals expenditure due to planned work to optimise the performance of our network, higher depreciation reflecting continued investment in the asset base and a slight increase in the remaining cost base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is partly offset by a decrease in the underlying net finance expense reflecting lower inflation applied to our index-linked debt. We have simplified our approach to alternative performance measures (APMs) this year and are no longer, as a matter of course, adjusting our underlying earnings for restructuring costs, net pension interest, capitalised borrowing costs and prior years' tax matters.

        "page_content": "## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's review\n\nOur balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the sector, with low customer debtor risk, net debt to regulatory capital value within our target range and a pension scheme that is fully funded on a low dependency basis.\n\nGiven the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the recoverability of household debtors has been a key area of focus. It has been an area of focus for us for most of the last decade, during which we have managed the position robustly. This manifests itself in the balance reducing from \u00a3115 million in 2016 to \u00a378 million in 2021. Our net debtor balance as at 31 March 2021 is the lowest it has been for five years and is one of the best managed positions in the sector. Knowing this gives us added confidence as we emerge from the pandemic.\n\nWe have retained our policy of targeting gearing of 55-65 per cent, measured as net debt to regulatory capital value, for this new regulatory period and at 62 per cent, our gearing remains within this target range. During the year, we changed our definition of net debt to exclude the impact of derivatives that are not hedging specific debt instruments. This provides a better reflection of the debt balances we are contractually obliged to repay and is more consistent with the approach taken by credit rating agencies and the\n\nregulatory economics. Our gearing policy is supportive of United Utilities Water Limited's A3 credit rating with Moody's and we have liquidity extending out to August 2023. This provides us with resilience and financial flexibility as we progress through AMP7 and demonstrates our prudent and responsible approach to financial risk management.\n\nWe have eliminated our pension funding deficit on a low-dependency basis and our pension position is in surplus on an IAS 19 basis. Having no pension funding deficit puts us at an underlying advantage versus most other companies in the sector, as well as against many companies in the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE), that continue to make cash contributions into their pension schemes to achieve a fully-funded position. We are proud to have already achieved this, protecting employees past and present and shareholders from the risk of a large pension deficit.\n\nIn November 2020, we published our new sustainable finance framework, which allows us to raise financing based on our strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials. This replaces the green funding we have previously secured through the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is no longer available post-Brexit. We issued our debut\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainable bond in January 2021 and were extremely pleased by the high level of interest. As a result, we secured not only our lowest ever coupon at that particular maturity, but also the lowest ever coupon for any UK corporate at that maturity, locking in financing outperformance.\n\n## Good start to the new regulatory period (AMP7)\n\nWe are performing well against the principal areas of our regulatory contract for AMP7 despite many targets getting tougher.\n\nOur accelerated investment strategy and digital transformation is delivering value across the breadth of our customer ODIs. The \u00a321 million outperformance payment earned this year is ten times the performance we delivered in the first year of AMP6. The net reward earned this year will be reflected in an increase to revenues earned in 2022/23. This provides a great platform for continued delivery against our customer ODIs for the remainder of the AMP and gives us the confidence to target a cumulative outperformance payment of around \u00a3150 million for the 2020-25 period.\n\nThanks to our good performance in AMP6, we started AMP7 at a total expenditure (totex) run rate which supports delivery of our AMP7 scope within our final determination totex allowance. Since accepting our final determination, our investment plan has been extended by a further \u00a3300 million, which we expect to be fully remunerated through regulatory mechanisms, with this expenditure extending our environmental programme, accelerating our digital transformation and exploiting spend to save opportunities. While we continue to seek efficiencies in the delivery of totex, as we have demonstrated through the \u00a3300 million extension to our totex plans, we will invest totex where we are confident we can deliver improved customer or environmental outcomes and better customer ODI performance.\n\nOn financing performance, we have consistently issued debt at efficient rates that compare favourably with the industry average, thanks to our leading treasury management, clear and transparent financial risk management policies, and ability to act swiftly to access pockets of opportunity as they arise. This delivered significant financing outperformance during AMP6 and the rates we have already locked in for AMP7 compare favourably with the price review assumptions.\n\n## ESG at our heart\n\nOur purpose drives us to deliver our services in an environmentally sustainable, economically beneficial and socially responsible manner and what we do creates",

We are also looking to our supply chain partners to adopt these values and objectives via the United Supply Chain (USC) initiative, a fundamental step change as to how we engage with them in AMP7 and into AMP8.\n\nHaving achieved our climate change objectives up to 2020, reducing greenhouse gas emission by 73 per cent, we made six carbon pledges and have made good progress against them all. From October of this year, 100 per cent of our electricity will be sourced from renewable technologies and we have set ambitious science-based scope 3 emissions targets that have been submitted for endorsement by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nOur Catchment Systems Thinking (CaST) approach continues to mature. We have been working with the Environment Agency (EA) and other stakeholders to develop a north west natural capital baseline and once this process is complete, we will engage with other partners across the region to drive a consistent approach to delivering greater natural capital value. This year, we pledged a \u00a3300,000 CaST Fund, for which charities and community groups are able to bid, to boost the idea of working collaboratively to address the challenges facing the environment.\n\nWe are in a unique position to make a real, positive contribution to society and have an ambitious and innovative approach to addressing affordability and vulnerability. We have an extensive range of schemes available to help customers and around 200,000 are currently benefiting from that help. We are providing more customers than ever with access to Priority Services in times of need, with over 133,000 now on our register. We have committed to providing \u00a371 million in financial support over AMP7, and have accelerated payments this year to provide much needed assistance to households struggling as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic, recognising the importance of cash flow to businesses, we took swift action to  accelerate payment terms with suppliers, paying them within seven days where possible.\n\nWe want fantastic people from a range of different backgrounds and life experiences to enable us to deliver a great public service, and we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, reaching and recruiting from every part of our community. We were delighted to be one of the top one per cent of 15,000 companies across Europe in the Financial Times'\n\nStatista Survey for Diversity and Inclusion Leadership and to achieve inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.\n\nWe operate in a manner that aims to maintain high ethical standards of business conduct and corporate governance. We have attained World Class status on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th consecutive year. We were delighted to retain the Fair Tax Mark independent certification which recognises our commitment to paying our fair share of tax and acting in an open and transparent manner in relation to our tax affairs. We continue to focus on our longterm financial resilience, supported by our strong balance sheet and prudent approach to financial risk management, maintaining a responsible level of gearing and wellcontrolled pension position for many years.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe started the new regulatory period as one of the sector's best performers and have delivered further improvements this year, giving us the confidence that we will continue to be able to meet our targets across AMP7. Our transformation to a digital utility is helping us operate more efficiently and deliver better service to customers while protecting and improving the natural environment. Although it remains uncertain how the country will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have proven to be resilient over this period and will continue to rise to the challenges that lie ahead, playing our part in the recovery of the north west economy.\n\n## Grateful to our stakeholders for their support\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to our highly engaged and motivated employees and supply chain partners who have shown great resilience and adaptability in continuing to deliver excellent performance over such a challenging period, and we extend our thanks to customers, shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir David Higgins Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steve Mogford\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nThe strategic report on pages 14 to 109 was approved at a meeting of the board on 26 May 2021 and signed on its behalf by Steve Mogford, Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT AND TCFD DISCLOSURE\n\nThis annual report contains information in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and is an Integrated Report prepared and presented in accordance with the International <IR> Framework published by the International Integrated Reporting Council in December 2013. The board, which is responsible for the integrity of this report, has considered the preparation and presentation of this report and concluded that it has been prepared and presented in accordance with the <IR> Framework.\n\n## MATERIALITY\n\nOur annual report and financial statements aim to meet the information needs of our investors to help them make informed decisions regarding their participation - for example, whether to buy, sell or hold our shares or bonds, whether to engage with management on issues, and how to vote their shares. We have included information that we believe is material to these decisions, which is presented in a way that we believe is fair, balanced and understandable. We engage with - and recognise that this report will be read by - a wide variety of other stakeholders including customers, suppliers, employees, analysts, regulators, community bodies, politicians, non-governmental organisations, and devolved authorities. Where we believe that a topic is material to a large number of them, which is assessed in part through a matrix approach to stakeholder materiality as set out on page 27, we either include it in this report or refer the reader to other reports and information (such as our regulatory reports, customer communications, or corporate responsibility web pages). We believe this approach meets the requirements of company law, the UK Corporate Governance Code, IFRS and the International <IR> Framework, and that we go beyond those requirements where we feel it is particularly helpful to do so and where that can be done without making the report unnecessarily lengthy or difficult to read.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our performance in 2020/21 on pages 52 to 83",

Over the past 20 years we have measured ourselves against national and international benchmarks of responsible business practice, often breaking new ground in the way the water sector approaches challenges such as catchment management schemes and support for vulnerable customers.\n\nThis long-standing commitment to responsible business has provided a solid foundation upon which to evolve existing programmes, develop new initiatives, and respond to the changing world in which we operate.\n\n## What is our approach?\n\nWe will only deliver our purpose and create and maintain value for our stakeholders if we act in a responsible manner. This comes from understanding what matters most to them and balancing these different perspectives in our decision-making.\n\nOur approach isn't just about what we do, but how we do it. A key strength is our commitment to open, honest and transparent reporting about the continuity of our approach, underpinned by a clear purpose and strategic objectives.\n\nIncreasingly, stakeholders assess how companies approach responsible business through the lens of ESG. We believe there is a close relationship between ESG performance and investor value.\n\n## Demonstrating how we act responsibly and create value\n\nBeing a purpose-led business it is up to us to provide the evidence that we are providing great water and more for the North West. Our stakeholders are ultimately the ones who will judge whether we are delivering on our purpose.\n\nHaving tangible, externally recognised measures of our behaviour and performance helps retain the trust of those who take an interest in the way we do business. It enables us to demonstrate\n\nthat we are operating in our stakeholders' interests. We collate, monitor and report on a wide range of performance measures, linked to what stakeholders tell us matter most, and align ourselves to recognised management standards and accreditations to give confidence in the way we are operating. We report these publicly so stakeholders can assess our progress.\n\nAlongside this we actively participate in a range of global ESG ratings, indices and frameworks to benchmark our approach against best practice and emerging sustainability challenges.\n\nAs responsible business practice evolves we look constantly at how we can improve. For instance, we are currently exploring whether embedding multi-capital thinking (manufactured, financial, natural, social, human and intellectual capital) into business processes will add value and better inform our decision-making processes. This includes how we might report publicly against these capitals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the start of each five-year investment cycle, we undertake a study to assess the economic contribution arising from our proposed spend.\n\nWe asked Hatch Regeneris, an independent economics consultancy, to estimate our contribution to the regional economy between 2020 and 2025, concluding this will be around \u00a310.5 billion over the five years. Its report calculated we will support an average of 22,700 jobs through direct, indirect and induced employment effects, which is the people we employ directly, through our supply chain or arising from employee expenditure.\n\nTo put this into context, this equates to one per cent of all jobs and one in every \u00a380 of gross value add (GVA) in the North West (pre-COVID-19 numbers). Our estimated GVA contribution each year of \u00a32.1 billion compares with \u00a32.8 billion GVA for the whole north west civil engineering sector.\n\nAs the economic effects of the pandemic begin to be felt, our investment programme offers a reliable economic contribution and source of employment to the region.\n\nIn February, we submitted proposals to support Defra's green recovery initiative, including plans to accelerate our current investment programme. By bringing expenditure forward, we will support an additional 1,500 to 2,000 jobs in the earlier years, when we can expect to see the worst economic effects of the pandemic.\n\nSuch analysis gives greater insight into the value we bring to the North West and enables us to make more informed, rounded, balanced decisions, shaped by stakeholder research and engagement. In AMP7, we've agreed a target to generate \u00a34 million of natural capital value through catchment schemes - alongside water quality benefits, this work will protect and enhance biodiversity. Our investment in young people not in education, employment and training has already yielded over \u00a39 million of social value through avoided welfare costs.\n\nLooking ahead, we recently assessed the social and economic value that will arise from our commitment to reduce flooding occurrences by 2025. We've estimated that \u00a3200 million of social value will be generated based on the avoided impact of internal flooding, which includes the wellbeing benefits for customers. While further analysis is required, thinking this way offers additional insight into how we value future investments plans.\n\nGenerating value for:\n\nCommunities\n\nCustomers\n\nCustomers\n\nEmployees\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment\n\nShareholders\n\nMedia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur contribution to the regional economy between 2020 and 2025 is estimated to be around \u00a310.5 billion.",

With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of storms, tackling flooding is becoming of greater concern for regional stakeholders. No single organisation can tackle this problem alone; only by working in partnership will the benefits from reducing flooding risk to wider society be realised.\n\nOne example of partnership working is in Thornton, near Blackpool, which is in the low-lying, flat and saturated River Wyre catchment. The area has experienced flooding from multiple sources and water quality issues from misconnections. Because the sewer network is combined, bringing together surface water and sewage from homes and businesses, there is limited capacity for extra water, which then has to be pumped to nearby Fleetwood wastewater treatment works.\n\nThe traditional solution to install concrete storage tanks to reduce the effects of storm flows wasn't cost beneficial or environmentally sustainable.\n\nIn 2019, we engaged with other risk management authorities, catchment partners such as the Rivers Trust, and the community group of the Wyre Flood Forum, to develop a plan to tackle the joint issues in the catchment. We challenged ourselves to examine how to store and purify flood waters through natural flood management and how we could realise multiple benefits through targeted extra investment.\n\nThe scope of the agreed solution included:\n\n- \u00b7 3.3 hectares of wetlands, 1,000m 3 of flood storage and restoring the river to its natural state;\n- \u00b7 1,300m 3 of storage and wetlands habitat constructed in collaboration with McDermott Homes; and\n- \u00b7 an investment of \u00a3220k to the Wyre Rivers Trust.\n\nThis catchment scheme was possible because of strong and effective partnerships. Support came from the EU LIFEfunded Natural Course project. Working with the developer to use land for flood risk management was vitally important,\n\nas was access to alternative funding streams to help realise wider benefits. Looking ahead, we will monitor the wetlands to understand the catchment and assess ecological improvement, with input from local communities.\n\nThe success of this collaboration can be applied to other partnerships across the North West.\n\nGenerating value for:\n\nCommunities\n\nCustomers\n\nStock Code: UU.\n\nCustomers\n\nEnvironment\n\nShareholders\n\nThis catchment scheme was possible because of strong and effective partnerships.",

We consider these stakeholder priorities alongside our own assessment of what has the biggest impact on the company and its ability to create value, and the output is presented in the material issues matrix below.\n\nThis stakeholder materiality assessment informs decisions about what we report in documents such as this annual report. Setting out issues in this way helps ensure we understand key stakeholder priorities and consider their interests in strategic decisionmaking, helping us create long-term value.\n\nIn defining the strategic relevance of an issue to the company, we have adopted the integrated reporting framework definition of materiality, which states: 'a matter is material if it could substantively affect the organisation's ability to create value in the short, medium or long term'. Value, in this context, may be created internally (for the company, investors and employees) and there can be external value (for customers, communities, suppliers and the environment). Value may be financial or non-financial.\n\nOur assessment of the level of interest to stakeholders is based on a balance of views obtained from communities, customers, employees, investors, regulators, and subject matter experts from the company on an ongoing basis, as well as the extensive insights gathered for the regulatory price review process. We will be undertaking a thorough review of our material issues and matrix in the next 12 months.\n\nWe have cross-referenced and aligned these issues with our principal risks and uncertainties, and our approach was reviewed by responsible business consultancy Corporate Citizenship, which commented that 'alignment with United Utilities' way of creating value gives life and credibility to the materiality matrix', and this sends a very distinct message about our business model and what we value.\n\n## Material issues matrix\n\nWe consolidated feedback from our various stakeholder groups, as detailed above, which resulted in 26 material issues. Due to the impact and ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic we have included this as a new material issue. These issues are impacted by factors that may be external, internal or both; for example, the material\n\nE/ffect on our ability to create value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on the potential e/ffect on our ability to create value over the short, medium and long term. Value can be created for United Utilities, investors, regulators, employees, the public, and/or the environment. Value can be /financial and non-/financial.\n\n## OUR PRIORITISATION OF ISSUES\n\nStriking the right balance between different interests and views is not easy. Discussions at board and management level form part of this alongside the use of tools such as our whole-life cost model when considering investment decisions. We are exploring how multicapital approaches might help in our decision-making, and expect a plan of how this can add the most value to be completed this year.\n\nissue of a diverse and skilled workforce has an external dimension of skills and diversity within the region, whereas the training and culture within the company are internal factors.

The requirements for such proposals were further clarified by Ofwat, Defra, the Consumer Council for Water, the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate in November 2020 and January 2021.\n\n## The board's view\n\nThe board believed that the draft investment proposed would help to contribute to the Government's green recovery plans and bring forward benefits for customers and the environment, but it would not present a significant risk to our financial resilience nor compromise our ability to deliver the remainder of our AMP7 plan. The board believed that our proposals were: of high quality; represented strong outcomes for customers and the environment; offered good value for money; could be implemented alongside existing regulatory and statutory commitments; and would be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If our regulators confirm they are supportive, the board will further review its position.\n\n## OUR STRATEGIC THEMES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe best service to customers\n\nAt the lowest sustainable cost\n\nIn a responsible manner\n\nOur AMP 7 dividend policy for the 2020-25 regulatory period was agreed by the board and announced on 29 January 2020. When we announced our full-year results in the early stages of the pandemic in May 2020, we undertook to review the AMP7 dividend policy in light of the uncertainty associated with the impact of the pandemic that existed at that time. In November 2020, the board reaffirmed the AMP7 dividend policy, targeting a growth rate of CPIH inflation each year through to 2025.\n\n## The board's view\n\nOver the summer and autumn of 2020, we had a chance to gain a clearer understanding of the impact of the pandemic on the business, which continued to be robust and supported by a strong balance sheet, along with a stabilised inflation outlook supported by central bank policy and government actions. The board believed that reaffirmation of the AMP7 dividend policy would provide greater certainty for our investors and would be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole.\n\n## OUR APPROACH\n\n## Introduction\n\nThroughout this annual report, we provide examples of how we have thought about the likely consequences of long-term decisions and how we:\n\n- \u00b7 build relationships with stakeholders and balance their needs and expectations with those of the business;\n- \u00b7 understand the importance of engaging with our employees;\n- \u00b7 understand the impact of our operations on the communities in our region and the environment we depend upon;\n- \u00b7 are mindful of the interactions we have with our regulators; and\n- \u00b7 understand the importance of behaving responsibly and being consistent with the company's purpose, vision and values.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe had already committed to achieving science-based targets to reduce our emissions in line with the UK's commitment in the 2008 Climate Change Act (see pages 86 to 97). As part of our carbon strategy the board has made a series of pledges to deliver these targets and to setting further targets across our full value chain, including transitioning to using 100 per cent renewable energy by 2021 and a 100 per cent green fleet by 2028.\n\n## The board's view\n\nDuring the year, we have made a further commitment by setting science-based targets for scope 3 emissions. First, we will reduce our absolute emissions by 25 per cent from the 2020 baseline by 2030, thereby aligning the group to a trajectory needed to limit global warming to 'well below' 2/uni2070C. Secondly, we have set the target that 66 per cent of our construction services suppliers should set their own science-based target by 2025, thereby helping to escalate a carbon focus in the construction services sector. The board believed that committing to our pledges and delivering against the targets set would be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole.\n\n## AMP 7 dividend policy",

We rely on natural watercourses to take wastewater back into the environment after extensive cleaning. We generate renewable energy from the sun and wind, and extract bioresources from wastewater that we break down into biogas (which is used to generate renewable energy) and biosolids (which are treated to provide a high-quality fertiliser for farmers).\n\nCoping with severe dry periods requires action in relation to supply (ensuring we have resilient water resources and infrastructure to move water efficiently around the region) and demand (encouraging and supporting customers to use water more efficiently). In periods of heavy rainfall we need to deal with excess surface water drainage and minimise the risk of sewer flooding, pollution and spills.\n\n## PEOPLE\n\n## Link to risks   5 7\n\nOur people are the face of our company and are essential in delivering our purpose. We believe the most effective decisionmaking comes from a diverse range of people who feel encouraged to share their views, and that having a skilled, engaged and motivated team of employees, suppliers and contractors is fundamental to the performance we deliver.\n\nRewarding employees well has been shown to enhance quality of work, increase employee retention, and reduce absenteeism, as well as providing societal benefits. Employee retention helps ensure efficient and effective training and higher levels of performance.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nWe support thousands of jobs in the North West, including graduate and apprenticeship programmes, helping to secure a legacy for the future in our region. We are an accredited Living Wage Foundation employer, providing our employees with competitive salaries and benefits, an attractive pension offering, and the opportunity to join the employee healthcare scheme and our share incentive plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraditional interventions to flooding, such as storage tanks and enlarging sewers, are costly and subject to space constraints. We are innovating with new sustainable drainage solutions by working with partners to transform hard grey areas into living planted places. We use integrated catchment solutions, working with others to improve the lakes, rivers and coastal waters in our region, and often using the natural environment as part of the solution. We manage our own woodland in a sustainable way to protect water quality, conservation, access, recreation and timber.\n\nOur activities produce various wastes, including sludges, which we manage in a sustainable way with more than 97 per cent going to beneficial uses such as recycling and application to land as a fertiliser. We use recycled products where practical, and are working to reduce our use of plastics and raw materials to minimise our environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, and have been awarded the workplace wellbeing charter.\n\nWe measure employee engagement through an annual survey, and regularly achieve results higher than the UK norm.\n\nWe monitor and measure employee performance through annual reviews, and employees at all levels of the company participate in the bonus scheme, so they benefit from company success. The bonus performance measures are the same for all employees as those for the executive directors, and can be found on page 168.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nMuch of the water we abstract originates on land before running off into the bodies of water. We own and manage large areas of this land, much of which is managed by tenant farmers, or in partnership with other organisations, such as the RSPB and Wildlife Trusts, and we focus on ensuring it is well managed to improve water quality and help protect habitats and species that live there.\n\nOur Systems Thinking approach is central to how we manage water supply. We have an integrated supply zone covering most of our region, our West-East Link Main allows us to transfer water between Manchester and Liverpool, and where there is a potential shortfall we can bring more supplies online to meet demand. Forty-six per cent of households in our region now have water meters installed, and we encourage customers to save water by raising awareness, sharing tips, and providing free water-saving devices.\n\nWe provide comprehensive training and development opportunities, including digital skills to help with our Systems Thinking approach and enable remote working where practical, which has been more important than ever this year with restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe promote diversity and equal opportunity to drive a comprehensive and balanced skill set, and we recruit and promote employees on the basis of merit. We are committed to being an inclusive workplace, supporting employees to reach their full potential whilst feeling valued and included. Employee networks, representing certain groups of employees that may face specific challenges, are overseen by an executive sponsor and support employees through their career progression.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about diversity and inclusion on pages 60 to 62 and 138 to 140",

We serve over seven million people, with over three million household customers making up around two-thirds of our revenue, and over 200,000 businesses. In the non-domestic marketplace, we provide wholesale services to water retailers. As a monopoly provider of essential services, we are regulated by various bodies as set out below.\n\nOur economic regulator (Ofwat) sets the price, service and incentive package that companies must deliver in five-year periods, known as Asset Management Plan periods (AMPs). These packages are based on Ofwat's methodology and priorities, and consideration and scrutiny of company business plans. We must therefore engage constructively with Ofwat on its future priorities and methodology consultations, and submit high-quality plans to help ensure we receive a determination that targets the best outcomes for us to continue creating value for customers and all our stakeholders, and effectively incentivises us to continue improving performance.\n\nTo ensure our plan is robust and balanced, we consult with customers and other\n\n## Our regulators\n\nWe are subject to regulation of our price and performance by economic, quality and environmental regulators, as shown in the diagram.\n\nThese bodies exist to help protect the interests of customers and the environment, but they can have competing interests.

Balancing these interests requires open and continuous dialogue.\n\nstakeholders (including quality and environmental regulators) and factor in long-term planning and resilience needs.\n\nThis was the first year of AMP7, covering the 2020-25 period, and our focus has been on delivering and trying to outperform our final determination through:\n\n- \u00b7 delivering higher customer satisfaction than the other companies in our industry;\n- \u00b7 beating the outcome delivery incentive (ODI) targets for operational performance;\n- \u00b7 delivering our AMP7 scope within our final determination total expenditure (totex) allowance; and\n- \u00b7 raising debt finance at a cost below the industry allowed cost of debt.\n\nSince privatisation, the water industry has invested a significant amount, contributing to improvements in public health and environmental standards, better quality of services, and superior quality drinking water. In its final determinations for AMP7, Ofwat allowed a further \u00a351 billion across the industry to deliver even more improvements.\n\nOur regulators assess our comparative operating performance against the other water and wastewater companies in England and Wales, with the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) assessing performance in water, the Environment Agency (EA) assessing performance in wastewater, and Ofwat assessing customer\n\nThe regulatory framework can change significantly in the long term and we have seen substantial tightening of laws and regulations since privatisation.\n\nWhile much is outside our direct control, maintaining good relationships enables us to engage positively with regulators to influence future policy, aiming to achieve the best outcome for all our stakeholders.\n\nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on pages 22 to 26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10\n\nlarge licensed water and wastewater companies\n\n## 2nd\n\nlargest waste and wastewater company in England and Wales\n\n## \u00a351bn\n\nallowance across the industry to deliver further improvements over the 2020-25 period\n\nsatisfaction.

        "page_content": "## CHALLENGE: DELIVERING A RELIABLE SERVICE IN A CHANGING WORLD\n\nIn an increasingly digitised and instant economy, customers expect more from services now than ever before. This includes the water sector, with high expectations for the reliability of services, the water we supply and the assets we operate.\n\nMany of our assets are ageing compared to other utilities. To meet the expectations of customers and regulators, it is critical that we combine modern technology into our networks and management of customer service. Quick response to issues raised by stakeholders, often through digital means such as social media, is part of this growing expectation.\n\nEnsuring a reliable service in the face of a growing population, changing climate and increasing expectations of service requires integrated long-term thinking and targeting investment to ensure both short and longer-term reliability.\n\n## How we respond\n\nOur culture of innovation and Systems Thinking approach drive us to adapt our assets and the way we operate to use modern technology and the best new ways of working. Examples include sensors across our network that allow remote monitoring and control from our integrated control centre, and our fleet of alternative supply vehicles (ASVs) that can inject treated water directly into supply while we undertake repairs. We have a substantially enhanced social media presence to respond quickly to stakeholders.\n\nOver one million customers now engage with us digitally, whether this is through our website, our mobile app or on social media. Customers rate us 4.7 our of 5 on the App Store and 4.2 our of 5 on Google reviews.\n\nWe monitor the performance and health of our assets, with the help of sensors across the network, and this allows us to be proactive. For example, by monitoring pressure in the water network we can spot issues and fix them before we get a burst, saving costs and sparing customers the impact.\n\n## CHALLENGE: SECURING LONG/hyphen.caseTERM OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE\n\nIt is vital to our operational resilience that we have plans in place to manage future challenges and maintain the provision of our essential services to customers. Our assets must be prepared to cope with a growing population, and comply with increasingly challenging environmental constraints in areas such as water abstraction and wastewater treatment levels. We must build increased resilience to cope with the anticipated impacts of a changing climate in the long term, including reducing the risk of sewer flooding.\n\nBalancing the risk of service interruptions against investment for the future is a constant challenge for water companies. Understanding what matters to stakeholders to plan our investment programme requires in-depth engagement and analysis, especially in the context of longer-term challenges that span more than five years.\n\n## How we respond\n\nIt can take many years and require substantial investment to increase the resilience of existing assets or build new ones, which is why our long-term planning is so important. We have detailed plans in place to anticipate future challenges and understand what we need to do to address these, and we build these needs into our business plans for each five-year regulatory period to ensure we can agree the funding we need to act at the right time. We invested an additional \u00a3250 million over 2015-20, from the outperformance we earned over that period, to improve our operational resilience further.\n\nWhere possible, we design our assets to work in tandem with the natural environment, which provides more sustainable and efficient solutions, such as our innovative Catchment Systems Thinking approach.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are installing over 100,000 sensors across our networks to proactively manage issues and sort them before customers are impacted.\n\nWe balance our capital and maintenance expenditure to ensure affordability and reliability over the short, medium and long term.\n\nWe are targeting a 15 per cent reduction in leakage over the 2020-25 period to further protect the reliability of service and water resources.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nWe have a number of challenging targets for the 2020-25 period that will help improve the reliability of our service, including helping and encouraging customers to use less water. Wider deployment of Systems Thinking will deliver further improvements in the reliability of services.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough innovative approaches we are improving the reliability and resilience of our assets, helping to reduce unplanned service interruptions, and enabling us to be more proactive.\n\nBy monitoring the health and performance of our assets we can ensure we invest at the right time in solutions that offer the lowest whole-life cost.\n\nWe invest in training centres to build technical skills and promote future skills through our education programmes.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nSystems Thinking provides opportunities for us to increase our resilience further. Our Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP) will be progressed through direct procurement for customers in AMP7 and AMP8, addressing our biggest operational risk in a critical pipeline that transports water from the Lake District to Greater Manchester.",

Water management is a key part of this and our industry has a leading role to play. However, the cost of solutions has an impact on customer bills and so we need to balance this goal with the need to maintain affordability and avoid bill shocks.\n\nEnvironmental regulators set stringent consents for our activities to ensure the environment is protected. We take these obligations seriously and work hard to maintain compliance. This requires striking a balance with environmental impacts, such as the use of natural resources and emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nOur region is fortunate to have some of England's finest countryside and wildlife, much of it legally protected being designated as National Parks and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. There is growing realisation, brought further to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic, of the physical and mental health benefits that access to green space has for people and communities.\n\n## How we respond\n\nThe EA assesses water companies' performance across a basket of measures, and we are one of the best-performing companies over the last five years.\n\nOur regulatory framework shapes the way we manage natural resources and our interaction with the environment, and we work with our environmental regulators to agree long-term plans.\n\nA phased, long-term approach to address all of the concerns and interests of our many stakeholders, including environmental regulators, ensures that the necessary work can be delivered without placing too much pressure on customer bills by spreading some of the spend over several years. We work with partners to improve the quality of rivers and bathing waters in our region, providing access to the recreational benefits of the natural environment and boosting the local tourism industry.\n\nOur catchment land is open to the public with millions of visits a year. National lockdowns have increased the popularity of many of our sites and made managing visitor numbers at certain sites difficult. We have worked with local interest groups and local MPs to manage these issues when they arise.\n\n## CHALLENGE: HELPING CUSTOMERS WITH AFFORDABILITY AND VULNERABILITY\n\nThe socioeconomic situation in the UK is still very challenging and water poverty is an important issue. The COVID-19 pandemic, national lockdowns and slowdown of the economy will only make this more difficult for many customers. How we respond will be crucial to securing and maintaining customers' trust and confidence in the sector in the years ahead.\n\nOur region suffers high levels of extreme deprivation. Eighteen per cent of households in the North West are affected by water poverty, higher than the national average, and research indicates that many customers who are behind on water charges are behind on other bills and many have a pay-day loan. Our stakeholders are interested in how we provide support for customers in vulnerable circumstances beyond just financial distress, such as disability, first language not being English, or temporary vulnerability brought on by illness or a life event.\n\n## How we respond\n\nWe have a leading approach to affordability and vulnerability, with the sector's widest range of assistance schemes. We are helping over 200,000 customers through our affordability schemes, and through our assistance schemes 71,000 customers became water debt free this year.\n\nCustomer support has been at the forefront of our activities throughout COVID-19, such as increasing the number of customers eligible for our social tariff, 'Back on Track', and providing the option to request a threemonth payment holiday without affecting credit scores.\n\nWe led the sector in establishing our Priority Services scheme, with dedicated teams providing additional support to customers with physical, mental health, or financial difficulties during an incident. This scheme is now accredited by the British Standards Institute (BSI), and over 128,000 customers are now registered for this support, with more joining every day.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a wide range of schemes that help customers struggling with affordability concerns and other vulnerable circumstances.\n\nInitiatives such as our affordability schemes help us manage our household bad debt expense.\n\nThrough the charity FareShare we have provided support that has enabled 600,000 meals for struggling families in the North West.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nThrough bill reductions and financial support we will help over 300,000 customers out of water poverty by 2025 whilst extending our Priority Services offering to over 210,000 customers, and improving the quality and scale of the support we provide.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomer engagement tells us that they value the natural environment in our region and want us to protect and enhance it, while maintaining affordable bills.\n\nWe use pioneering catchment projects that combine multiple partners and access to other sources of funding to achieve more together for less.\n\nWe provide free public access to our land, much of which is in areas of outstanding beauty, with over nine million visits every year.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nWe are expanding our Catchment Systems Thinking approach, using more natural solutions to create more value for the environment, and we are reviewing our approach to land management to enable multiple benefits from a targeted approach.",

We must plan well into the future to understand what changes we are likely to experience in our region as a result of climate change, and continually adapt to meet the risks and opportunities this presents.\n\nOne of the main opportunities is the potential for water sharing, as our region typically receives more rainfall than the comparatively drier south.\n\nThe main risks from climate change are the impact of prolonged severe dry periods, which constrain water resources, and intense periods of heavy rainfall, which increase the risk of flooding and pollution incidents. We need to ensure we have access to resilient water resources, reduce leakage, and encourage less water use in the future to protect this critical resource. We need to ensure our infrastructure can cope with increased surface water to reduce the risk of flooding.\n\n## How we respond\n\nOur response to climate change risk involves mitigation (minimising our greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (ensuring our services are resilient to a changing climate). Where practical, we generate renewable energy on our sites through solar panels, wind turbines, and the use of bioresources at wastewater treatment works, helping to reduce our emissions. We have reduced our carbon footprint considerably since 2005/06 and have set ambitious science-based targets as part of our continued efforts to reduce emissions. We have committed to six pledges to help us achieve significant further reductions in emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to climate change on pages 86 to 99.\n\nWe have detailed plans that set out how we will adapt to meet the challenges of climate change, and we are targeting a 15 per cent reduction in leakage over AMP7.\n\nWe work with third parties to encourage sustainable drainage solutions to help cope with surface water in periods of heavy rain and are finalising a Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan with key authorities across the region.\n\n## CHALLENGE: MAINTAINING TRUST AND CONFIDENCE\n\nStrong relationships are based on trust. Being open, honest and transparent is key to building and maintaining trust and legitimacy. As well as reporting openly this means setting out commitments and delivering on them. Our stakeholders want to know that we are treating employees fairly, protecting customer data, and paying our fair amount of tax.\n\nThe increasing pace of globalisation means many customers feel disconnected from many large businesses. This has led to growing calls for companies to demonstrate how they are contributing to society as a whole and operating in the public interest.\n\nIn recent years the UK water sector has faced challenges to its legitimacy, amplified by some specific issues at a small number of companies. Consequently, trust has been eroded and questions raised about the ownership structure of the sector, and Ofwat has called for further transparency and disclosure around board leadership and decision-making processes, as well as starting discussion on companies' contribution to public value.\n\n## How we respond\n\nWe have open and transparent reporting around all of our equity and debt financing arrangements, do not use offshore financing vehicles, and we have secured the Fair Tax Mark independent certification for the past two years.\n\nWe have updated our human rights policy which can be found on our website, with links to other related policies, including our modern slavery policy and whistleblowing policy.\n\nCybercrime has been on the increase and, as the holder of customer information, it is a threat we take very seriously through our policies and dedicated data protection team.\n\nWe work with suppliers and contractors whose principles, conduct and standards align with our own. Our key suppliers have committed to United Supply Chain. We are a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code, and fully comply with rules on reporting payments to suppliers.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe help customers use less water, with advice and free water saving gadgets, saving them money as well as this precious resource.\n\nOur renewable energy generation helps to reduce our reliance on purchasing energy and therefore save costs.\n\nWe have reduced our carbon footprint significantly over recent years and are committed to further reducing our emissions.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nWe have a detailed 25-year Water Resources Management Plan, a Drought Plan, and we plan to publish our third adaptation report in 2021 setting out how we aim to adapt to meet the challenges of climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/our-future-plans\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe engage on a continual basis with customers to understand their expectations in relation to service and behaviour, through activities like our quarterly brand tracker.\n\nWe maintain stable credit ratings with key agencies which helps us to retain efficient access to the debt capital markets.\n\nWe set qualitative and quantitative performance targets across all of our stakeholders to evidence how we are delivering on our purpose.\n\n## Our future plans\n\nOperating in a responsible manner is a key driver of trust with our stakeholders. Our continued compliance with the corporate governance requirements of a listed company helps ensure the transparency of our reporting and behaviour.",

As a consequence, more people have turned to food banks to ensure there is food on their tables. Through our work helping vulnerable customers across the region and tackling affordability issues, we have a better understanding of the challenges faced by some of our communities and we wanted to help in some way.\n\nThrough a combination of director salary sacrifice, matched by the company, and employee donations, we have donated \u00a3240,000 to food distribution charity FareShare. The charity helps redistribute surplus food, which would otherwise go to waste, to 250 charities and community groups which provide meals to people in need - including children's breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, homeless shelters and drug and alcohol rehab units. Lockdown has been particularly challenging and FareShare has been especially busy dealing with increased demand. At the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, FareShare Greater Manchester was distributing enough food for around 200,000 meals each week. Two thirds of people accessing FareShare food are children and families.\n\nOur donation helps FareShare meet this increased demand and will provide families with 600,000 meals. Our funds have given FareShare much needed financial support and the money has been used to purchase a brand new long-wheel Mercedes Sprinter delivery van. This will deliver over six tonnes of food per week to frontline charities, schools and foodbanks across Greater Manchester.\n\n- More details on our response to COVID-19 can be found on pages 44 to 45\n\nGenerating value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, FareShare Greater Manchester was distributing enough food for around 200,000 meals each week.",

We have prioritised supporting customers, the wider communities and our colleagues during this difficult time. Recognising the importance of water for public health and sanitation, especially with the emphasis placed on washing hands, we have maintained water supplies and wastewater services throughout the pandemic, keeping our employees safe while they carried out their duties.\n\nOur communication with stakeholders during this time has been more important than ever, whether that has been encouraging customers to get in touch if they have been impacted financially by the pandemic or issuing guidance reinforcing government guidelines to protect employees, suppliers and customers. Our consultation for the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP) was stopped in its tracks by COVID-19.

We have continued to hold scheduled board meetings in a virtual format to ensure that the board's oversight has remained effective. We were able to hold a number of events during the year, including a board strategy day, conducting external board evaluation and providing our major shareholders with the opportunity to virtually meet with the Chairman.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLessons we have learnt from the pandemic will shape how we deliver for stakeholders in the future. We now have an even better understanding of our customers and how we can support them. We have been challenged to think more creatively about how we engage with our stakeholders. The pandemic has accelerated our digital strategy and changed our ways of working in such a way that we do not see a return to how we worked before.\n\nAlthough there remains a degree of uncertainty as to how the UK and the economy will continue to recover after the pandemic, it has taught us that our sustainable and responsible approach to business means we can tackle future challenges as they emerge.\n\n600,000\n\nOur response at a glance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmeals funded via local foodbanks\n\n7, 3 0 0\n\npupils supported via Home Learning Hub during school closures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napprentices and graduates recruited\n\n67\n\n## Staff Outreach Scheme\n\nsupporting colleagues' struggling families\n\n## May 2020\n\nLaunched Staff Outreach Scheme providing financial support to employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMay 2020 Launched our Home Learning Hub\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## June 2020\n\nInnovated to ensure apprentices sat final exams\n\nJune 2020 Extended the scope of our social additional \u00a315m of\n\nEmployees\n\nEnvironment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Apr 2020\n\nTemporarily accelerated payment terms from 14 to 7 days\n\nEmployees\n\nEnvironment\n\ntariff, securing an support",

We review this information as part of our long-term planning and our risk management processes.\n\nOver the next 25+ years we have identified many challenges and opportunities that we are likely to be faced with, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change;\n- \u00b7 Population growth;\n- \u00b7 A more open, competitive market;\n- \u00b7 Water trading;\n- \u00b7 More stringent environmental regulations;\n- \u00b7 Developments in technology; and\n- \u00b7 Combining affordable bills with a modern, responsive service.\n\nThere is a section of our website dealing with our future plans, where we examine the challenges ahead and how we will focus our resources and talents so we can meet them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/our-future-plans\n\nThis includes our 25-year Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP) covering the 2020-45 period, which was developed and published in  2019 following consultation with stakeholders, and our Drought Plan, which was published in 2018 with an amendment appendix in 2018/19. These long-term plans set out the investment needed to ensure we have sufficient water to continue supplying our customers, taking into account the potential impact of climate change, and the actions we will take to manage the risk of a drought. In 2023 we will publish an update to our WRMP and, for the first time, publish a Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (DWMP).\n\nWe create long-term value for stakeholders by:\n\n- \u00b7 Systems Thinking and innovation;\n- \u00b7 long-term planning and responding to challenges and opportunities, including management of water resources;\n- \u00b7 sustainable catchment management;\n- \u00b7 disciplined investment, based on a sustainable whole-life cost modelling approach, to ensure the resilience of our assets and network;\n- \u00b7 investing in our employees to maintain a skilled, healthy and motivated workforce;\n- \u00b7 close collaboration with suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 maintaining a robust and appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.\n\n## Medium-term\n\nOur medium-term planning aligns with delivery of our plans as set out in Ofwat's final determination.\n\nThe majority of the group's activities sit within our regulated water and wastewater business, therefore our medium-term planning predominantly sets out how we will deliver against the final determination (FD) we receive from Ofwat for each five-year period. The business plans we submit focus mainly on the subsequent five-year AMP period whilst providing a high-level view of the following AMP. This provides mediumterm planning visibility of between five and ten years at any one point in time.\n\nIt is important that our ambitions align with those of our regulator, therefore we carefully evaluate all consultation and methodology publications from Ofwat and engage with them to put forward our views and help ensure a balanced approach that creates value for all stakeholders.\n\nOur business plans are designed to help us work towards our long-term plans, build and maintain resilience, and ultimately fulfil our purpose. We engage in extensive research to ensure the plans we put forward are robust and balanced, targeting the best overall outcomes for all our stakeholders.\n\nFollowing scrutiny and challenge from Ofwat, we receive the FD, which sets the price (in terms of total expenditure and customer bills), level of service, and incentive package that we must deliver over the five-year period, and an allowed return we can earn (expressed as a percentage of Regulatory Capital Value).",

The acceleration of our capital programme during the 2015-20 period helped us deliver improvements early and we are adopting the same strategy in this regulatory period with around \u00a3500 million of total expenditure brought forward over years one to three of the five-year period. Our total expenditure for this period will be extended by \u00a3300 million, with this expenditure extending our environmental programme.\n\nOur strategy of delivering the best service to customers at the lowest sustainable cost in a responsible manner helps us create value for our stakeholders by delivering or outperforming the FD. Since 2015 we have published an Annual Performance Report (APR), which reports our regulatory performance in a format that helps customers and other stakeholders understand it and compare it with other companies in the sector. This includes reporting of Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE), which is made up of the base allowed return and any outperformance/underperformance, on an annual and cumulative basis for each five-year period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Short-term planning\n\nIn the short term we set annual, measurable targets but we retain flexibility to enable us to respond to challenges that may arise.\n\nShort-term planning helps us work towards our medium and long-term goals and provides us with measurable targets so that we can continually monitor and assess our progress, which helps us ensure the long-term resilience and sustainability of our business.\n\nBefore the start of each financial year, we develop a business plan for that year, which is reviewed and approved by the board. This sets our annual targets, designed to help deliver further improvements in service delivery and efficiency, and to help move us towards achievement of our five-year goals. Performance against these annual targets determines annual bonuses for executive directors and employees right through the organisation, who are remunerated against the same bonus targets as the executive team.\n\nTo avoid short-term decision-making and ensure management is focused on the long-term performance of the company, as well as these annual targets, executive directors are remunerated through long-term incentive plans that assess three-year performance, measured during the current period through Return on Regulated Equity and a customer basket of measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee details of the 2020/21 annual bonus and vested long-term incentive plans for our executive directors on pages 168 to 170\n\nOur APRs are published in July each year at unitedutilities.com/corporate/about-us/performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation on companies' regulatory performance can be found at discoverwater.co.uk\n\nThe executive directors hold quarterly business review meetings with senior managers across the business to monitor and assess our performance against our annual targets, helping to ensure that we are on track to deliver our targets for the year, and longer term.\n\nIt is vital that we retain flexibility within this short-term planning so we can adapt to meet challenges that may arise during each year, and deliver high quality and resilient services to customers in the most effective and cost-efficient way possible. This may involve bringing enhancements forward to deliver improvements for customers early, investing further into the business to maintain service, or delaying projects to occur later in the regulatory period in order to prioritise expenditure and allow our people to spend their time dealing with any unexpected challenges that arise.\n\nThe challenges presented by COVID-19 are a clear example of why this flexibility is crucial. We enacted our robust contingency plans, enabling us to quickly and efficiently move thousands of our people to home working and introduce additional safeguarding measures for those that remained on sites or in the field, while maintaining reliable water and wastewater services that are critical for public health at this time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our response to the challenges of COVID-19 on pages 44 to 45",

        "page_content": "## OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n## Overview\n\nDuring the 2015-20 period, we reported against a range of operational KPIs that were aligned to our strategic themes to demonstrate how we realise our purpose and deliver on our vision.\n\nOur purpose drives us to create long-term value for all our stakeholders, so between 2020 and 2025 we are measuring our performance by reference to the value we create for each of our stakeholder groups.\n\n## Operational KPIs\n\nOur operational KPIs include one main metric for each stakeholder group, based on the top material issues identified through stakeholder engagement. A description of these operational KPIs, our targets for each, and our performance against these targets can be seen on pages 52 to 72.\n\nOur executive bonuses and long-term incentives are closely aligned to financial and operational KPIs, as highlighted in the remuneration report on pages 168 to 170.\n\n## OUR OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n## Overview\n\nOur KPIs provide a snapshot of our performance across a variety of areas, but these are by no means the only metrics by which we monitor and assess our performance on a regular basis, and we report against other metrics both internally and externally.\n\nAs discussed on pages 22 to 26, we engage with a variety of stakeholders and this gives us a view of what matters most to them. We report on a selection of other metrics on pages 52 to 72 of this report, based on the measures shown to be of highest interest to our stakeholders.\n\nFor example, for customers our KPI is Ofwat's measure, C-MeX, but on page 57 we report on Ofwat's D-MeX measure, the level of customer complaints, vulnerability support, customers lifted out of water poverty, and the impact of water efficiency measures.\n\nOn environmental performance, our KPI is the overall assessment by the Environment Agency and on page 65 we report on more specific environmental performance indicators, such as leakage reduction, climate change, proportion of waste going to beneficial use rather than landfill, and measures of natural capital.\n\n## OUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT /parenleft.caseAPR/parenright.case\n\n## Overview\n\nPerformance against our regulatory contract is monitored and assessed each year, and reported within an Annual Performance Report (APR), as required by Ofwat for all water companies since the start of the current regulatory period in 2015/16, replacing the previous 'regulatory accounts'.\n\nMany of our performance indicators relate to regulatory performance on a high level, and it is within the APR that more detail can be found on the components within these measures, as well as narrative detail about our performance during the year.\n\nThere is financial information contained within the APR. This relates only to the regulated company and its appointed activities, and is calculated and prepared in accordance with the regulatory accounting framework. This differs from IFRS reporting, and a reconciliation to IFRS reporting is provided in our APR. For the purposes of clarification, our financial KPIs relate to our performance at the group level, and are calculated in line with the definitions given in this report.\n\nOur APRs for previous years are available on our external website, and the APR for 2020/21 will be published in July 2021.\n\n## FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXTERNAL ACCREDITATIONS\n\nIn addition to our KPIs and regulatory targets, we monitor our performance against an assortment of ESG metrics that are of interest to our many stakeholders.\n\nWe report against these within this report on page 84 and on our website at unitedutilities.com/corporate/responsibility/our-approach/cr-performance\n\n## Financial KPIs\n\nOur financial KPIs assess both profitability and sustainability of our business from a financial perspective. They are largely the same as the 2015-20 period, with the addition of having low dependency defined benefit pension schemes with nil deficit. This recognises the increasing importance of this strong and secure position for our people, representing a significant driver of relative value.\n\nA description of these financial KPIs and our performance against our targets can be seen on pages 74 to 75.\n\nWe regularly report on numerous corporate responsibility performance measures on our external website.\n\nAll these performance indicators have received an appropriate level of assurance, such as independent third-party verification, regulatory reporting assurance processes or through our own internal audit team.",

This is slightly lower than our target, mainly as a result of much lower community activity as a result of the impact of COVID-19. However, we contributed an additional \u00a32.7 million from our Trust Fund to help those struggling to pay their bills and a further \u00a315 million was made available to help customers reduce their water bill to an affordable amount through extending our social tariff. As we emerge from the pandemic, and events can safely recommence, we expect our community investment to increase.\n\n- \u00b7 2019/20: \u00a32.26 million\n- \u00b7 2018/19: \u00a32.93 million\n- \u00b7 2017/18: \u00a33.65 million\n- \u00b7 2016/17: \u00a33.59 million\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPromoting our support services and campaign messages places us at the heart of communities and builds trust with hard-to-reach groups.\n\nBy working with community partners we can share resources, access new funding opportunities and achieve more together.\n\nProviding access to our land\n\nenables communities to enjoy the physical and mental wellbeing benefits that green spaces can bring, helping reduce the burden on health services.\n\n## READ MORE\n\n## Link to material issue\n\n- Land management and access\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Community investment\n- Trust, transparency and legitimacy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our approach to materiality on page 27\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our principal risks on pages 104 to 107\n\nunitedutilities.com/corporate\n\nCommunities\n\nCustomers",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nOur work puts us at the heart of local communities in the North West, where customers and employees live and work. We understand the impact our work can have on everyday lives across our region, and we seek to play an active role in tackling the issues that matter most to these communities through active engagement and investment, developing strong relationships and building partnerships where we work together to generate solutions. We also look after beautiful landscapes and open our land to the public, which supports the regional tourism industry and offers physical and mental health and wellbeing benefits for communities through access to relaxation and recreation.\n\n## Helping young people\n\nWe are committed to supporting the Government's Kickstart Scheme by providing 250 placements to young people, working with our supply chain. Our new employees will have a dedicated placement manager as well as a Kickstart skills coach, and will also receive job-related and employability skills training to enhance their CVs in order to help secure employment in the future. We work with local schools and training facilities to promote skills for the future, including youth programmes that support young people not in education, employment and training (NEETs) to help improve social mobility in our region and break down barriers in bringing people from all backgrounds into employment. It is estimated this programme has generated over \u00a39 million of social value through avoided welfare costs and new employment. During the school closures brought about by the pandemic lockdowns, our education team created a Home Learning Hub that supported teachers and children across the region, and even extending overseas, with materials for home schooling. Recruitment of apprentices and graduates has continued uninterrupted, with the help of some online challenges, skills sessions and live streamed assessments while face-to-face interaction was limited. We have continued to create our early careers pipeline, welcoming 67 apprentices and graduates in 2020/21.\n\n## Social mobility\n\nIn October we hosted the sector's first Social Mobility Summit, an online event at which more than 100 organisations joined us for the launch of our Opportunity Action Plan - another first for the sector - which aims to identify and share best practice and leading-edge thinking from businesses that are successful in promoting social mobility, including case studies from our own employees reflecting the progress we have already made.\n\n## Charitable support\n\nOur ongoing charitable support, including a voluntary salary reduction by board\n\nmembers at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, has helped provide support to local communities. One of our donations to the FareShare charity has supported them in delivering 600,000 meals to struggling families across the North West via local foodbanks, and will replace one of the charity's delivery vans, helping to ensure 6.4 million meals get to families in need over the next eight years.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nWe build trust with local communities through effective engagement, whether that is around large capital projects or day-today management of our landholdings. Our consultation for the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP) was stopped in its tracks by COVID-19, halfway through the traditional face-to-face exhibitions. We changed approach, developed a virtual consultation, with accessible content advertised through letters and social media, and, as a result, we have seen better engagement. We received over 100 per cent more feedback compared with the traditional approach, with over 8,000 hits to the specific HARP section of the website. Sixty-nine per cent of all feedback has been supportive of the plans. Given the success of this approach, we will continue with virtual consultations for other aspects of this project.\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Access to our land for recreational use\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 restrictions, there has been a marked increase in the number of people visiting our catchment land to enjoy the countryside and benefit from open spaces. While the majority of visitors have respected the countryside, sadly a small minority have not. Our teams have worked hard to address this anti-social behaviour through a variety of methods, including targeted social media campaigns on issues such as moorland fire risk, improved site signage and the creation of local stakeholder groups. We are currently testing several ideas to better connect visitors to the land and to encourage them to behave responsibly.\n\nyoung people to be supported through the Kickstart Scheme\n\n## 250\n\n##

The Government provides a grant of \u00a31,500 per recruit to support skills development.\n\nThe recruits will be found placements in customer service, operational support, office administration, grounds maintenance and labs support, and our supply chain partners will also provide placements to support us to achieve our aim. All will be recruited on a six-month fixed-term contract and will have a dedicated placement manager and a Kickstart skills coach. They will receive job-related and employability skills training supported by our learning and development team.\n\nCustomer services and people director, Louise Beardmore, explained: 'Kickstart is a brilliant initiative that aims to help companies give work opportunities to young people who have borne the brunt of the economic slowdown during COVID-19.\n\n'We know the North West has some of the highest levels of deprivation in the UK and this year life has got even tougher. We're absolutely certain there are some fantastic young people out there who just need a break. For many of the people who apply this will lead to full-time roles, and others will leave us with some great new skills to take to other employers.'\n\nWe already run several schemes to support young people into work. We recruit around 30 apprentices every year from across the North West, and our graduate scheme recruits people from targeted communities based on their diversity and inclusion data. We also have a Youth Programme for young people between 18 and 24 years who are not in education, employment or training. Around 90 per cent of youth programme participants have a disability or long-term health condition and are from an area of low social mobility and high deprivation.\n\nWe have taken part in the Department for Work and Pensions' 'mentoring circles'  initiative which provides mentoring, support and coaching to young unemployed people who are Black, Asian or from ethnic minorities, have a disability or long-term health condition.\n\nGenerating value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKickstart is a brilliant initiative that aims to help companies give work opportunities to young people who have borne the brunt of the economic slowdown during COVID-19.",

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2020/21\n\nOperational performance\n\n## Overview\n\nWe put customers at the heart of everything we do. This relentless focus drove us to deliver significant and continuous improvements over AMP6, ending the period as a leading water and wastewater company. Despite the challenging environment we have continued to operate in during the pandemic, customer satisfaction has remained high. Reliable access to clean water has been more important than ever before, and we have continued to provide a robust service for customers throughout the year. Serving the most economically deprived areas in the country, we are always mindful of the need to help customers who struggle to pay their bills. We reduced typical household bills by 5 per cent this year in real terms, have committed to providing \u00a371 million in financial support to customers over AMP7, and have an extensive range of schemes offering financial assistance and tailored support for customers struggling with affordability and vulnerability. We are delighted to have received a positive recommendation for continued certification to BS 18477:2010, which is the accreditation for our Priority Services scheme and one of our customer ODI measures looking at the quality of services provided to vulnerable customers.\n\n## Customer service\n\nWe have significantly increased the availability and performance of our digital channels with over 1 million customers engaging with us digitally, driving both service improvements and cost efficiencies. Customers rate us 4.7 out of 5 on the App Store and 4.2 out of 5 on Google reviews.\n\nWe have been proactive and used targeted communications with customers to offer\n\n## \u00a315m\n\nextension to our social tariff to support customers affected by COVID-19\n\n## 200,000\n\ncustomers benefiting from our support schemes\n\nsupport to those impacted financially by the pandemic and struggling to pay. We have achieved all of our reputational performance commitments, most notably continued certification to BSI standard for our Priority Services scheme that supports over 133,000 customers, and we were recognised as providing the best customer support initiative at the Utilities and Telecoms Awards for the support provided to customers during the pandemic. We are one of only 14 brands in the UK with the Institute of Customer Service Accreditation with distinction.\n\nFor developers, customer experience is measured in AMP7 by D-MeX, of which there are two elements: quantitative (service level agreement performance); and qualitative (customer satisfaction survey). For 2020/21, we are ranked first in the sector for our quantitative performance, with final qualitative results expected later in the year. We estimate our overall industry position to be fourth. This strong performance reflects the transformation programme we are delivering in this area that continues to deliver tangible and much improved results, benefiting all developers who are building in the North West.\n\n## Operational performance for customers\n\nOur AMP7 business plan includes 46 customer commitments, delivering the outcomes that are important to customers and measured through customer ODIs.\n\nOur performance has been strong across the broad range of our activities with us having met or exceeded over 80 per cent of our performance commitments for the year. We have delivered particularly strong performance in the areas of hydraulic flood risk resilience and pollution, where we have delivered another year of sector-leading performance with no serious pollution incidents for the second consecutive year. We were also able to deliver leakage at its lowest ever level and have more than halved supply interruptions to customers - outperforming our targets on both these key service delivery measures.\n\nWe entered AMP7 knowing that our biggest challenge would be against our internal flooding ODI and this is the measure that has yielded the largest penalty this year. As part of the \u00a3300 million extension to our AMP7 totex plans, we will be investing around \u00a3100 million in Dynamic Network Management (DNM) - a ground-breaking application of Systems Thinking using state of the art sensors and predictive machine intelligence to move to a more proactive management of our wastewater network. This new digital capability is expected to improve service to customers and improve performance against our internal flooding ODI.\n\nWe work hard to encourage customers to save water through water efficiency programmes, helping them to preserve this precious resource and save money on their bills. More customers have spent more time at home during the pandemic and used more water for sanitation, increasing per capita consumption (PCC) measures for 2020/21. Recognising that the long term impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and that there may also be a variety of drivers of changes in behaviour, Ofwat has proposed to assess company performance for this customer ODI at the end of the AMP when fuller facts and evidence of absolute and relative company performance are available.\n\nWe have our own in-house app development capability and this is paying dividends in creating digital capability for our field and customer-facing teams with agility, flexibility and at low cost. Our new voids app which helps us to easily identify unbilled but occupied properties has contributed to a 93,000 reduction in the number of void properties in the year, helping us earn maximum customer ODI reward on voids this year and underpins a further \u00a324 million reward over the AMP.\n\n## Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP)\n\nIn November 2020, we successfully completed the replacement of the Hallbank section of the Haweswater Aqueduct, part of a critical asset that delivers around a third of our total water production to 2.5 million people in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester. Work to replace the majority of the aqueduct is expected to be undertaken using a direct procurement for customers (DPC) approach and we have been preparing for a DPC tender in 2021/22. If the tender process proceeds as planned, contract award is anticipated in 2023, with construction to begin later in the AMP.\n\n## Cash collection\n\nDespite the impact of COVID-19, our overall cash collection has performed well throughout the year. We are encouraged by the continued growth in our direct debit volumes, now at 72 per cent and one of the highest across the industry. Overall, the proportion of customers on a payment plan has continued to increase to 82 per cent despite the challenging economic environment and providing a high level of collection certainty for a significant proportion of the household customer base.\n\nWe are recognised as a leader in credit management and collections across all industries, not just water. In the year we have won three external awards for our credit services, most recently winning the Utilities and Telecoms Team of the Year at the 2020 Credit Awards. Our industry-leading approach to collections and innovative affordability offerings have ensured we were well placed",

        "page_content": "to respond to the challenges brought about by the pandemic.\n\nIn the current year, we have enhanced our credit reference sharing process to include another agency with a greater high street focus. This has further extended our footprint and will facilitate improvements in our collections activity, and is just one example of our comprehensive approach to collections activity, supporting our ability to collect cash from customers who have the ability to pay, but attempt to avoid doing so.\n\n## Affordability\n\nWhen the country first went into lockdown we saw an increase in demand for affordability support. The initiatives we delivered over AMP6 enabled us to respond efficiently and effectively, with our Payment Break scheme giving over 8,000 customers the breathing space they required.\n\nThe nature of the pandemic and the significant impact it is having on customers' lives has meant we have had to consider the appropriateness of continuing our normal billing and collection activities and the most suitable means of engagement. While as an industry we took steps to pause collection activity, our COVID-19 response encouraged customers to contact us if they had been impacted financially by the pandemic and found themselves struggling to pay. We carried out targeted activities aligned to specific customer segments and changes in customer behaviour to engage with customers, actively promoting our range of affordability support, ensuring customers knew they could talk to us about their bill, and highlighting alternative ways to pay. Over the course of the year we sent over 5 million proactive customer communications; a 30 per cent increase on the previous year.\n\nWe have an extensive range of schemes available to help customers and around 200,000 are currently benefiting from that help. Recognising affordability has been even more important during the pandemic, we took swift proactive action and were the first water company to secure support and regulatory approval for an extension to the scale and scope of our social tariff, allowing us to support a broader range of customers whose income has been affected by COVID-19. This augments our support schemes this year with an additional \u00a315 million to help customers keep out of debt and was intended to support an additional 45,000 customers who have been furloughed, are claiming through the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) or are now unemployed, by reducing their water bill to an affordable amount. Through efficient use of the additional \u00a315 million funding secured we\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                   |                                     |                             | Status Against 2025   | Status Against 2025   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Measure                                                           | 2025 target                         | 2020/21  performance        | Annual  performance   | target                |\n| KPI:                                                              |                                     |                             |                       |                       |\n| C-MeX                                                             | Above industry  median              | Above industry  median      |                       |                       |\n| Additional service  measures:                                     |                                     |                             |                       |                       |\n| D-MeX                                                             | Above industry  median              | Above industry  median      |                       |                       |\n| Market Performance  Standards                                     | Upper quartile                      | Second quartile             |                       |                       |\n| Operational Performance  Standards                                | Upper quartile                      | Upper quartile              |                       |                       |\n| Managing complaints:                                              |                                     |                             |                       |                       |\n| Number of household  written complaints  compared to WASCs        | Upper quartile                      | Upper quartile*             |                       |                       |\n| Vulnerability:                                                    |                                     |                             |                       |                       |\n| Number of households  registered for Priority                     | In excess of  220,000 (7%)          | 128,831 (4.1)%              |                       |                       |\n| Services BS18477 'Inclusive service  provision' certification for | Maintain  certification             | Maintained                  |                       |                       |\n| Priority Services Affordability:                                  |                                     |                             |                       |                       |\n| Number of customers   lifted out of water poverty                 | 66,500                              | 71,057                      |                       |                       |\n| Helping customers look   after water in their home                | 10% increase                        | 13.75%                      |                       |                       |\n| Status key: Annual performance                                    |                                     | Against 2025 target         |                       |                       |\n| Met expectation/target                                            |                                     | Confident of meeting target |                       |                       |\n| Close to meeting expectation/target                               | Close to meeting expectation/target | Some work to do             |                       |                       |\n| Behind expectation/target                                         | Behind expectation/target           | Target unobtainable         |                       |                       |\n| Baseline year                                                     |                                     | Baseline year               |                       |                       |\n\nwere able to support 73,000 customers 62 per cent more than originally estimated - preventing customers from falling into debt. This additional support meant that in the year we supported 160 per cent more customers via our Back on Track scheme than the previous year. We promoted the new scheme directly to customers, via partner organisations and the Hardship Hub, to increase overall awareness. The \u00a371 million financial support we have committed to providing over AMP7 is the largest of any water company, and we have accelerated payments this year to provide much needed assistance to households struggling as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nWe continually innovate to further enhance our affordability processes, and we are piloting a first-of-its-kind real-time income verification tool to streamline eligibility for reduced-rate social tariffs. We're proud to be the first water company in the UK to roll out an Open Banking solution for social tariff applications, modernising our income verification. In March 2021 we were the first water company to begin data sharing with the DWP, leveraging the new provisions under the Digital Economy Act, to assist people living in water poverty. We're excited to be able to use these new provisions to continue to proactively provide lower bill support to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Payment Break scheme was used by over 8,000 customers during the early stages of the pandemic. We also donated \u00a33.5 million into our Trust Fund to support financially vulnerable customers.\n\nWe had regulatory approval to extend our social tariff to help even more customers impacted by COVID-19, and, as such, we are currently providing financial assistance to more than 200,000 customers - a significant increase on the previous year. Through our Payment Matching scheme, another 15,000 customers became water debt free in 2020/21.\n\nOur Lowest Bill Guarantee scheme was rolled out in September after a successful pilot to ensure customers who choose to have a meter fitted will not pay more than their current charge method. Customers have saved over \u00a34.6 million as a result.\n\nSince creating the North West Utilities Together group at the start of 2020 with Electricity North West, Cadent and Northern Gas Networks, we have been regularly meeting to discuss ways to help those customers in vulnerable circumstances.\n\nAs part of this, we have once again joined with Electricity North West in the promotion of our Priority Services registers on paper medicine bags in over 200 pharmacies across our region, and have worked with Electricity North West and Cadent to jointly fund a \u00a350,000 refurbishment of a mobile advice centre for Age Concern Central Lancashire.\n\nThe charity launched this new community outreach service in March 2021, one year on from the first national lockdown, in a bid to reach those in need. The mobile advice centre, which is specially designed to be dementia friendly, will offer support and help promote our services to customers in and around the Lancashire area. The three utility companies involved in the collaboration will be giving residents free advice on water and energy efficiency, as well as tips on how to stay safe and warm in their homes.\n\nSuzanne Carr, CEO of Age Concern Central Lancashire, praised the project: '...we are delighted to have formed partnerships with the North West's big three utility companies which in turn means our customers will have access to a full suite of services, and most importantly, will be able to access one-to-one support on a range of important matters from independent living through to seeking help during an energy crisis.'\n\nGenerating value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have worked with Electricity North West and Cadent to jointly fund a \u00a350,000 refurbishment of a mobile advice centre for Age Concern Central Lancashire.",

We have continued to invest in skills training throughout the pandemic and have accelerated our digital strategy to support new ways of working. The health and wellbeing of our employees is paramount and keeping them safe remains our primary concern. During the initial lockdown in 2020, we moved 60 per cent of our workforce to home working and the remainder continued working at our COVID-secure facilities. Around 80 per cent of our employees were designated as key workers, delivering our essential services to customers. We have largely continued with business as usual, operating within COVID-19 guidelines and in line with the government roadmap out of lockdown, while defining and shaping the way we will work post-COVID-19 based on the changes in the last year.\n\n## Protecting colleagues through the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDuring the pandemic, we have facilitated home working for over 3,000 of our employees and are providing support for employees' health, safety and wellbeing while temporarily working at home in extraordinary circumstances. As well as facilitating home working for more than half of our employees, we have introduced a range of measures to ensure those who are still working on sites and in the field are able to do so in a COVIDsecure way. We conducted over 390 COVID-secure risk assessments across all our operational sites and carried out a number of control measures to ensure they met the Government's requirements for COVID-secure workplaces. This included temperature checking stations, extra sanitation provisions, safe desks and oneway procedures in offices to ensure social distancing can be maintained. Additional personal protective clothing has been provided and we have adapted new ways of working for our front line field employees. We adapted the way we carry out our mandatory health surveillance checks to virtual assessments and more recently COVID-secure face-to-face assessments.\n\nWith the involvement of over 200 trained mental health supporters and wellbeing champions across the business, we have supported the wellbeing needs of our colleagues, delivering initiatives to help build resilience across our workforce. This includes delivery of several bitesize webinars on topics such as mental health, stress control, and managing change to around 2,000 people over 20 webinars. We have been encouraged by the take up of the zero suicide alliance e-learning module\n\nwhich now includes a specific module on COVID-19 and isolation, and have produced new resource packs and initiatives to help our workers through winter. Crucially, we engage regularly with managers, providing awareness of the support services available and how to make best use of them and the widely introduced Wellness Action Plans, to enable managers to have wellbeing conversations with their teams.\n\nWe have not furloughed any employees, but we are aware that our employees and their families are not immune from the hardships caused by the economic impacts of COVID-19. Therefore, we have established a staff outreach scheme (SOS) that provides financial support to employees whose families are struggling financially as a direct result of the pandemic.\n\n## Committed to equality, diversity and inclusion\n\nWe want fantastic people to enable us to deliver a great public service now and into the future, so we are determined to make sure we are reaching and recruiting from every part of our community. We are supporting employees to achieve their full potential and feel valued and included, regardless of their gender, age, race, disability, sexual orientation or social background. Our employee diversity networks, including LGBT+, gender equality, ability and multicultural groups, have a growing membership of 730 people, and play a pivotal role in providing insight, raising awareness and giving support to colleagues. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce and so we are delighted to be one of the top 1 per cent of 15,000 companies across Europe in the Financial Times' Statista Survey for Diversity and Inclusion Leadership.\n\nWe are working hard to improve how we attract women into the industry, and developing women within our existing workforce. We are seeing good progress with increasing numbers of female graduates and apprentices in our talent pipeline, and 96 per cent of our current female workforce recommend United Utilities as an employer. Following our 2021 AGM, the measurable targets of 33 per cent female representation on the board and one director of non-white ethnicity will be met. We achieved inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, recognising our commitment to gender equality and transparency.",

        "page_content": "## Training and development\n\nOur technical training academy established in February 2014 has provided skills development and certification to over 2,800 people to date, including programmes for those individuals not in education, employment or training (NEETs). Many people have received multiple training opportunities such that in total, around 11,000 technical training sessions have been delivered over that period. We are the only water company currently governed by Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education), with a 'good' overall rating.\n\n## Ensuring everyone goes home safe and well\n\nOver the last couple of years our health, safety and wellbeing agenda has centred on behaviours and the part they play in accidents and the culture across our organisation. Having spent a number of years focusing on site standards, asset condition, training and personal protective equipment, it was clear from our root cause analysis that behaviours play a key part in many of the accidents we have had. We delivered our 'home safe and well' behavioural safety programme to everyone in the company and we are embedding a culture of looking after ourselves and each other, to ensure we all go home safe and well.\n\nWe are seeing improvements in a number of important performance measures, including the number of accidents, the severity of accidents and an increase in hazard and near miss reporting. Our employee accident frequency rate for 2020/21 was 0.094 accidents per 100,000 hours worked, representing a 15 per cent improvement on performance from the prior year. Our contractor accident frequency remained broadly consistent despite an increased workload at the start of AMP7, with 0.087 accidents per 100,000 hours worked, compared to 0.083 last year. Our aim by 2030 is that no one will be harmed while working on our behalf, and we will actively promote, support and improve their wellbeing.\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                    |                                            |                                            | Status Against 2025   | Status Against 2025   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Measure                                                            | 2025 target                                | 2020/21  performance                       | Annual  performance   | target                |\n| KPI:                                                               |                                            |                                            |                       |                       |\n| Employee engagement                                                | Upper quartile  against UK  utilities norm | Upper quartile  against UK  utilities norm |                       |                       |\n| Employee opinion survey  diversity and inclusion   questions score | UK high  performance  norm                 | UK high  performance  norm                 |                       |                       |\n| Employee opinion survey  learning and development  category score  | UK utilities  high  performance  norm      | UK utilities   high  performance  norm     |                       |                       |\n| Living Wage accreditation                                          | Secure and  retain                         | Secured  accreditation                     |                       |                       |\n| Pension Quality Mark +                                             | Retain  accreditation                      | Retained                                   |                       |                       |\n| Health and safety: AFR employees   (per 100,000 hours)             |                                            |                                            |                       |                       |\n|                                                                    | 0.064                                      | 0.094                                      |                       |                       |\n| AFR contractors   (per 100,000 hours)                              | Year-on-year  improvement  in score        | 0.087                                      |                       |                       |\n| Wellbeing Charter  accreditation                                   | Retain  accreditation                      | Retained                                   |                       |                       |\n\n## Status key:\n\n## Annual performance\n\n## Against 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMet expectation/target\n\nConfident of meeting target\n\nClose to meeting expectation/target\n\nSome work to do\n\nBehind expectation/target\n\nTarget unobtainable\n\nBaseline year\n\nBaseline year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To mark National Inclusion Week, with its theme for 2020 of 'Each One, Reach One', the groups organised training sessions, webinars, interviews and support, and emphasised that it has never been more important to think about the opportunities we all have to connect and inspire each other to make inclusion an everyday reality.\n\nWe have four active employee network groups with a growing membership of 730 people. Each network has a lead and an executive sponsor who supports each network to drive change across the business.\n\nOur Gender Equality Network is open to men and women across the company, and works to support, mentor, develop, inspire and promote all employees.\n\nThe Identity LGBT+ Network provides a social and support network for LGBT+ employees and those who are LGBT+ friendly, helping to create a safe, inclusive and diverse working environment that encourages respect and equality for all.\n\n- Our Ability Network works to bring people with\n\ndisabilities and long-term conditions together. Its aim is to raise the profile of different disabilities so we can recognise and better support our employees and customers living with those conditions.\n\nThe Multicultural Network is about celebrating distinct cultural differences stemming from personal traits such as race, ethnic origin and religion.

It is of great importance we continue to protect and enhance the environment across the North West, and manage our land responsibly to improve the environment in our region for future generations. We delivered a number of environmental improvements over AMP6, including improving 338.5 kilometres of rivers, significantly reducing our carbon footprint, increasing our renewable energy production and ensuring zero emissions energy usage. We have agreed an environmental improvement programme to be delivered in AMP7 that will continue to improve the river, bathing and shellfish water quality for the benefit of customers and visitors to the North West as well as society as a whole. Our investment in AMP7 is expected to result in an improvement in water quality in 1,315 kilometres of rivers in the North West. Having completed the first year of the period, we remain on track for the improvements we have committed to.\n\n## Leakage reduction\n\nWe have beaten our leakage target for the 15th consecutive year and we are now at the lowest ever level of leakage reported in the North West. Our leakage performance improvement has been achieved through a combination of techniques. Alongside satellite technology to geo-locate potential leaks in our network and sniffer dogs to accurately locate the leak, we have deployed 66,000 acoustic loggers since 2019 with a further 29,000 being installed over the next year. We have recruited around 20 per cent additional leakage detection resources, further supported this year by our first intake of apprentices on a bespoke two-year technical training scheme, mitigating the risk of a national shortage in leakage technicians. Over AMP7, we plan to reduce total leakage by at least 15 per cent, with a delivery plan that continues to make best use of available technologies and is flexible to ensure that we can embrace the heightened level of innovation in this area.\n\n## Pollution performance\n\nIn 2020, we had no serious pollution incidents for the second year running, and have reduced total pollution incidents by almost a third. Here, we are seeing the benefits of delivering the action developed as part of our Pollution Incident Reduction Plan which covers a range of interventions, and for the first time we had no wastewater treatment works classed by the Environment Agency as 'failing works', which is something that has only ever been achieved across the sector once before.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change\n\nCarbon reduction ('mitigation') and climate resilience ('adaptation') have influenced both our strategic and operational decisions for over two decades. We have achieved substantial progress over recent years and we have ambitious plans and commitments to go much further.\n\nCarbon reduction - We are signatories to the UN Race to Zero campaign and we are contributing to the UK water industry's commitment to achieve carbon net zero by 2030. In May 2020 we announced six carbon pledges including the use of science-based targets to reduce our carbon footprint. We have successfully reduced our operational emissions by over 70 per cent in recent years, primarily by investing in our own renewable energy generation capabilities and purchasing green energy from the national grid. We continue to deliver on our commitments to peatland restoration and woodland creation, recently establishing two tree nurseries in the North West. We are also committed to delivering our green fleet strategy and have introduced more low-carbon vehicles and charging.\n\nOur portfolio of renewable energy assets is operating satisfactorily and our investment has delivered the returns that we targeted. Having maximised the opportunities to date and established long-term contracts to secure a proportion of our renewable energy out to 2045, we are now looking at how we can recycle our investment in order to achieve further strong returns and take the next steps in our plans to achieve net zero by 2030.",

We are working to further mature our already advanced level of climate risk understanding. We will soon be publishing an overview of our climate risks and plans in our new adaptation report. This will be released in draft for open consultation and engagement before we finalise our submission over the months ahead. Our latest annual statement in support of the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) can be seen on pages 86 to 99, and provides an update on our performance this year.\n\n## Natural capital and biodiversity\n\nWe continue to develop our approach to natural capital and improve our understanding to influence investment decisions, allowing us to assess the full value of our activity. We have a natural capital ODI in AMP7, which encourages assessment of the added natural capital value we deliver by pursuing nature-based and catchment solutions. Understanding this value will help us drive partnership working and our Catchment Systems Thinking (CaST) approach, which seeks to understand the broader needs of a catchment and deliver outcomes across multiple stakeholders. As part of this approach we have worked with stakeholders to develop a north west natural capital baseline to understand the natural assets the North West has, the benefits they provide and the value of them. Once completed, we will engage with other partners across the North West to drive a consistent approach in order to drive greater natural capital value. To facilitate this we are seeking to establish a north west governance group for natural capital.\n\nBiodiversity is a key pillar of natural capital and plays an important part in our CaST approach. As the largest private land owner in the UK, and an organisation delivering significant development in the North West, we have committed to no net loss of biodiversity and delivered significant investment in improving the condition of habitats on our land. We are actively reviewing our approach to how we can best manage and enhance biodiversity.\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                   |                  |                                   | Status Against 2025   | Status Against 2025   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Measure                                                                                           | 2025 target      | 2020/21  performance              | Annual  performance   | target                |\n| KPI:                                                                                              |                  |                                   |                       |                       |\n| EA EPA                                                                                            | Upper   quartile | Upper   quartile (1)              |                       |                       |\n| Leakage reduction                                                                                 | 15% (2)          | On track                          |                       |                       |\n| % waste to beneficial use                                                                         | 98%              | 97.3%                             |                       |                       |\n| Enhancing natural capital   for customers                                                         | \u00a34 million       | Delivery  scheduled from  2022    |                       |                       |\n| Number of trees planted                                                                           | 500,000          | 216,601                           |                       |                       |\n| Better air quality: nitrogen  oxides (NOx) emissions  per GWh of renewable  electricity generated | 1.42   NOx/GWh   | 1.3   NOx/GWh                     |                       |                       |\n| Climate change mitigation:  meeting our science-based  reduction target                           | 14%              | 1% increase                       |                       |                       |\n| Climate change adaptation:  multiple measures                                                     |                  | See TCFD section, pages  86 to 99 |                       |                       |\n\n## Status key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Annual performance                  | Against 2025 target         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Met expectation/target              | Confident of meeting target |\n| Close to meeting expectation/target | Some work to do             |\n| Behind expectation/target           | Target unobtainable         |\n| Baseline year                       | Baseline year               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) For the year 2020, we expect to be awarded the maximum 4 star rating.\n- (2) As measured against a 2017/18 baseline.",

The Lancashire-born couple, both from farming backgrounds, have big plans to bring the community into their venture.\n\nThey're planning to organise walks and provide educational visits for the public on farming, conservation, ecology and water quality as the farm is a gateway site for the main Rivington reservoirs and associated recreational walks.\n\n'An added aim of our management of the farm is to maintain and improve areas for visitors to enjoy', said Gemma. 'As tenants, we have these goals at the forefront of our farming enterprise and land management proposals.'\n\nArron and Gemma can't wait to get started: 'We both worked closely alongside my parents at their family farm for many years', said Gemma, 'but have always dreamed of managing our own family farm. This is our dream come true. We're able to manage our own farm, close to family and friends, in the beautiful area of Rivington. Our children can grow up in a wonderful place of open space and countryside and we have our lives ahead to plan, enjoy and grow.'\n\nGenerating value for:\n\nCommunities\n\nCustomers\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Lancashireborn couple, both from farming backgrounds, have big plans to bring the community into their venture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Retail performance of -0.3 per cent reflects a small overspend this year in adapting to the effects of COVID-19 and tax performance of -0.5 per cent reflects the Government's\n\nreversal of the planned reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 19 per cent to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020 (which will be recovered through the tax sharing mechanism), and the tax impact of our strong financing outperformance.\n\nOur underlying RoRE is higher at 4.8 per cent and is adjusted for the tax impact that will be recovered through the tax sharing mechanism and the additional totex that drives better outcomes against future customer ODIs.\n\nThis is a new measure for the 2020-25 period hence no prior year comparators. These will be provided from 2021/22 onwards.\n\nBy delivering better performance for customers we are able to achieve greater regulatory incentives, aligning improved service with shareholder return.\n\nBy reducing costs in a sustainable way through innovation and efficiency, we can target outperformance of our allowed expenditure without compromising operational performance.\n\nOur strong corporate governance, prudent risk management, and clear and transparent reporting create a lower-risk investment and build trust.",

This has been our best year of operational performance for customers and the environment, manifesting itself in a net reward against our customer ODIs for the year of \u00a321 million. Since accepting our AMP7 final determination, we have increased our totex plan by a further \u00a3300 million, all of which we expect to be remunerated through regulatory mechanisms, and we continue to accelerate our overall AMP7 investment programme to deliver benefits sooner and boost the regional economy as we emerge from the worst effects of COVID-19. We have delivered another robust year of financial performance and we are raising finance effectively, locking in rates favourable to the price review assumptions and leveraging our strong ESG credentials.\n\n## Total expenditure (totex)\n\nOur AMP7 business plan was assessed by Ofwat as being among the most efficient in the sector. Thanks to the strong performance we delivered in AMP6, we started AMP7 at the target totex run rate and we are confident that we can deliver our AMP7 scope within our final determination totex allowance. Our investment strategy delivers long-term sustainable performance improvements and efficiency and our AMP7 totex plans will be extended by around \u00a3300 million, which we expect to be fully remunerated through regulatory mechanisms, with this investment extending our environmental programme, accelerating our digital transformation and exploiting spend to save opportunities.\n\nIn this first year of AMP7, we have invested \u00a3617 million in net regulatory capital expenditure (excluding infrastructure renewals expenditure (IRE)), representing the continued acceleration of our AMP7 investment programme and early expenditure against the \u00a3300 million extension to our original totex plans. This represents a good start to the delivery of our AMP7 programme, benefiting from the early start and transition investment we made in 2019/20 and our ability to continue working, where it was safe to do so, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence, we have been able to deliver this expenditure effectively, maintaining our high performance scores against our Time, Cost and Quality index (TCQi) at over 95 per cent.\n\nWhile we continue to seek efficiencies in the delivery of totex, as we have demonstrated through the \u00a3300 million extension to our totex plans, we will invest where we are confident we can deliver improved customer or environmental outcomes and better customer ODI performance.\n\n## Customer outcome delivery incentives (ODIs)\n\nOur digital transformation and investment strategy are delivering improved performance and we have made a strong start to AMP7, achieving a \u00a321 million net customer ODI reward for 2020/21. This is ten times the net reward we achieved in the first year of AMP6 and is particularly pleasing in light of the tougher targets we have set.\n\nThe earlier 'Customers' section provides more detail on the customer ODIs where we are performing well and others where the targets for AMP7 are challenging. We see opportunities across a number of ODI targets, and our Systems Thinking approach, including new digital capability driven by Dynamic Network Management (DNM), increased use of data and analytics within our retail function, coupled with early investment, have and will continue to help us drive performance improvements.\n\nUnlike AMP6, ODI rewards and penalties in AMP7 will be adjusted in revenues on a two-year lag, therefore any net reward earned this year will be reflected in an increase to revenues earned in 2022/23 through allowed increases in the rates charged to customers in that financial year, in accordance with the regulatory mechanism. Overall, we are targeting a cumulative net ODI reward over the 2020-25 period of around \u00a3150 million, a significant improvement on the \u00a344 million achieved in the previous regulatory period.\n\n## Financing\n\nOn financing performance, we have consistently issued debt at efficient rates that compare favourably with the industry average, thanks to our leading treasury management, clear and transparent financial risk management policies, and ability to act swiftly to access pockets of opportunity as they arise. This delivered significant financing outperformance during AMP6 and the rates we have already locked in for AMP7 compare favourably with the price review assumptions.",

In January 2021, we issued our debut sustainable bond, generating a huge amount of interest for the company and our ESG credentials and delivering a coupon of 0.875 per cent. This is not only our lowest ever coupon at this maturity, locking in financing outperformance, but also the lowest ever coupon for any UK corporate at this maturity.\n\n## ESG performance\n\nWe perform well across a broad range of ESG indices and for 2021 we attained World Class status on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th consecutive year. In April 2021, we were ranked 6th out of 613 global utilities in the Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Rating assessment, positioning us as the leading water utility in the index. We achieved a score of A- from the CDP which evaluates how companies assess climate change-related financial risks and opportunities, including their approach to transparency and disclosure. We were assessed by the Environment Agency (EA) as the best performing company on pollution for the second year in a row with no serious pollution incidents and we expect to be awarded industry-leading 4 star rating in the EA's Environmental Performance Assessment for 2020. From an employee perspective, we achieved a significant improvement in the Workforce Disclosure Initiative, scoring well above the overall average and receiving special recognition in the 'COVID-19 transparency' category at its Workforce Transparency Awards.\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                               |                                |                               | Status              | Status               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Measure                                                                                                       | 2025 target                    | 2020/21  performance          | Annual  performance | Against 2025  target |\n| KPI:                                                                                                          |                                |                               |                     |                      |\n| RoRE                                                                                                          | Assessed  annually             | 4.3%                          |                     |                      |\n| UK Corporate Governance  Code                                                                                 | Maintain   compliance          | Compliant                     |                     |                      |\n| Maintain performance  across a range of trusted  investor indices                                             | Upper quartile                 | Upper quartile                |                     |                      |\n| Credit rating UUW  (Moody's, S&P, Fitch)                                                                      | A3, BBB+, A-                   | A3, BBB+, A- (stable outlook) |                     |                      |\n| Gearing                                                                                                       | 55-65%                         | 62%                           |                     |                      |\n| Maintain sustainable  finance framework                                                                       | Available/ continued  issuance | Available                     |                     |                      |\n| Fair Tax mark                                                                                                 | Retain annual  accreditation   | Retained                      |                     |                      |\n| Sustainable dividend                                                                                          | Grow by CPIH                   | In line with  commitment      |                     |                      |\n| Risk maturity                                                                                                 | Year on year  improvement      | Met  expectation              |                     |                      |\n| Anti-bribery: % of  identified employees  completing required  training                                       | 100%                           | 94%                           |                     |                      |\n| Investor engagement: %  met or offered to meet by  value (active targetable  institutional shareholder  base) | 75%                            | 81%                           |                     |                      |\n\n## Status key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Annual performance                  | Against 2025 target         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Met expectation/target              | Confident of meeting target |\n| Close to meeting expectation/target | Some work to do             |\n| Behind expectation/target           | Target unobtainable         |\n| Baseline year                       | Baseline year               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We were keen to offer a wider range of investors a similar ability to more directly link their investment in us to our environmental and sustainability goals.\n\nIn November we formally launched our sustainable finance framework. Dovetailing well with our longstanding and comprehensive ESG strategy, the framework allows us to more clearly demonstrate how investment in our business makes a positive impact on the North West's environment and society in which we live and operate.\n\n- Our 'use of proceeds' based framework follows market principles set out by the International Capital Market Association and the Loan Market Association, covering issuance in both bond and loan format. Second-party opinion was provided by Sustainalytics and was assessed to be 'credible and impactful'.\n\nOur framework sets out eight eligible categories of environmental and social spend that can be funded, covering a wide range of areas from core activities such as 'sustainable water and wastewater management' to other more targeted areas such as 'clean transportation' and 'access to essential services'.\n\nFollowing two days of engagement with institutional investors, our first sustainable bond was issued in January 2021, becoming, at the time, the lowest ever 8yr+ GBP corporate nominal coupon. The \u00a3300 million bond was oversubscribed by more than three times and attracted notable new investors to the company.\n\nThis additional debt finance option has provided value to both us and investors, and we look forward to giving additional insight into the projects funded through sustainable finance in our allocation and impact reports to be released in 2021.\n\nYou can find out more about our sustainable finance framework on our website: unitedutilities.com/corporate/ investors/credit-investors/sustainable-finance\n\nGenerating value for:\n\nCustomers\n\nEnvironment\n\nShareholders\n\nThe framework allows us to more clearly demonstrate how investment in our business makes a positive impact on the North West's environment and society.",

The average number of days taken to pay our suppliers was 13 days, which is reflective of our efforts to accelerate payment to suppliers by seven days during COVID-19.\n\n- \u00b7 2019/20: 97.35 per cent\n- \u00b7 2018/19: 98.57 per cent\n- \u00b7 2017/18: 95.44 per cent\n- \u00b7 2016/17: 97.40 per cent\n\nWorking on our behalf, suppliers are a face for our business. Ensuring they are motivated to deliver good quality work helps us deliver the best service to customers.\n\nDeveloping innovations with suppliers, and ensuring they deliver goods and services efficiently, contributes to a sustainably low cost for customers.\n\nWorking with responsible suppliers who share our sustainability objectives helps us achieve more in tackling environmental and social issues.\n\n## Link to material issue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- North west regional economy\n- Responsible supply chain\n- Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our approach to materiality on page 27\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our principal risks on pages 104 to 107",

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2020/21\n\nOperational performance\n\n## Overview\n\nOur activities support around 17,700 jobs in the supply chain, and the acceleration of around \u00a3500 million of capital expenditure into the first three years of AMP7 will play a part in helping to generate jobs and income for the north west economy at a critical time as the country emerges from the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Suppliers play an important role in maintaining supply for key parts of our business, and contractors, as well as direct employees, act as the face of our business for many customers and communities. The pandemic has shown the importance of our relationship with our supply chain partners. We have continued to work closely with our supply chain and issued guidance reinforcing government guidelines to protect employees, suppliers and customers while maintaining delivery of critical services.\n\n## 'Better together' through United Supply Chain\n\nIn November 2020 we successfully launched our new approach to responsible supply chain management for AMP7 called United Supply Chain (USC). USC recognises suppliers as an extension of the United Utilities family and suppliers are asked to become signatory to our responsible sourcing principles as a minimum. Those suppliers who are integral to our operations we encourage to become leaders and to work jointly with us to deliver improvements across environmental, social and governance areas and improve value to customers. At the end of March 2021 we had signed 38 per cent of our targeted suppliers to our responsible sourcing principles and continue to pursue the remaining suppliers to reach our target of 100 per cent. Via our partnership with the Supply Chain Sustainability School we have been able to offer both our commercial colleagues and supply chain partners free resources to learn more about the responsible sourcing principles.\n\n## Innovation in action\n\nOur Innovation Lab programme is designed to 'look for ideas where others aren't looking' - in other sectors, other countries and with suppliers that are often small, start-up businesses, just starting on their idea development or business growth journey. It does all this whilst being fully compliant with procurement legislation - allowing for rapid idea testing and idea adoption / contract award - an obstacle that most regulated companies struggle with. The open, collaborative nature means that feedback is given more frequently and ideas get tailored for United Utilities adoption faster than traditional product testing. We have worked with 23 suppliers in this way, and our highest profile success\n\nis with FIDO (tackling leakage detection in our Lab 2 programme). FIDO is becoming known as a disruptor in the global water sector, and we have first mover advantage on new developments.\n\nWe are part-way through our third Innovation Lab programme; we have published four high level problems and encouraged innovative solutions from around the world. Over 120 supplier applications have been reviewed by our experts and we have selected eight suppliers with high potential ideas; with our help, they could offer a performance step change across a range of areas from helping us to reduce our carbon footprint and be more self-sufficient on energy, to predicting asset failures before they occur. All ideas support our Systems Thinking ambitions, most are digitally-centric, and half are new entrants to the UK water sector.\n\n## 1 7, 7 0 0\n\njobs supported by our activities\n\n## 120\n\nsupplier applications reviewed as part of our third Innovation Lab programme\n\n## OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                                                      |                              |                                | Status              | Status               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Measure                                                                                                                              | 2025 target                  | 2020/21  performance           | Annual  performance | Against 2025  target |\n| KPI:                                                                                                                                 |                              |                                |                     |                      |\n| Invoices paid within   60 days                                                                                                       | At least 95%                 | 99.55%                         |                     |                      |\n| Average time taken to   pay invoices                                                                                                 | <28 days                     | 13                             |                     |                      |\n| % suppliers in high risk  categories, as identified  by sustainability risk  assessments, covered by  enhanced due diligence  audits | 5%                           | Delivery  scheduled from  2021 |                     |                      |\n| % of partner and  strategic suppliers that  have sustainability risk  assessment in place                                            | 75%                          | 35%                            |                     |                      |\n| Supplier Relationship  Management score                                                                                              | 90%                          | 69%                            |                     |                      |\n| % of targeted suppliers  signed up to United Supply  Chain                                                                           | 100%                         | 38%                            |                     |                      |\n| CIPS ethical mark                                                                                                                    | Retain annual  accreditation | Retained                       |                     |                      |\n| Savings delivered through  innovation and efficiency                                                                                 | \u00a340 million                  | \u00a33.9million                    |                     |                      |\n\n## Status key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Annual performance                  | Against 2025 target         |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Met expectation/target              | Confident of meeting target |\n| Close to meeting expectation/target | Some work to do             |\n| Behind expectation/target           | Target unobtainable         |\n| Baseline year                       | Baseline year               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

USC is centred on using our responsible sourcing principles to create a high-quality supply chain and provide suppliers with a way of enhancing their performance in the North West and beyond. We believe that operating and procuring in a responsible manner will mitigate risk, build resilience, improve compliance and ultimately deliver better value for customers.\n\nIn November 2020, as part of our launch of USC, we held our first digital supplier event, with senior leaders from across the business sharing their role in helping us to achieve our company's vision of being the best UK water and wastewater company.\n\nA variety of supplier engagement activities followed, and we are now in the process of signing up 100 per cent of all targeted suppliers to our responsible sourcing principles. We will then be surveying suppliers to capture our progress and successes, and to identify new ways that we can work better together.\n\nSince 2016, we have had a strong relationship with the Supply Chain Sustainability School, and the launch of USC has seen them partner us on our journey to embed best practice across our business and broader supply chain. This collaboration allows our suppliers direct access to the latest thinking and training in responsible sourcing. Recent insightful workshops have covered carbon and modern slavery - with the latter leading to us enhancing key internal documents to align to best practice.\n\n'Pride in the workplace' training by The Proud Trust provided education on diversity and inclusion, another key theme of our USC roll-out. Ensuring that learning gained from this training is replicated internally and throughout our supply chain will be key to helping us embed USC.\n\nWe will be showcasing more examples of collaborative working on our USC supplier web pages, as we work to create, adopt and develop better practice across our delivery chain.\n\nGenerating value for:\n\nCustomers\n\nEnvironment\n\nMedia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUSC is centred on using our responsible sourcing principles to create a high-quality supply chain and provide suppliers with a way of enhancing their performance in the North West and beyond.",

Underlying net finance expense makes adjustments to the reported net finance expense, including stripping out fair value movements. Underlying taxation strips out deferred tax (including any tax credits or debits arising from changes in the tax rate from reported taxation) or any exceptional tax.

        "page_content": "Underlying operating profit (1) at \u00a3602 million was \u00a3130 million lower than last year. This principally reflects the \u00a351 million reduction in revenue, and also a \u00a322 million increase in IRE as a result of ongoing work to optimise the performance of our network. Depreciation is \u00a322 million higher, principally reflecting the higher capex programme in AMP6 with a high number of assets commissioned towards the end of the AMP. In the near term we would expect depreciation to flatten out, reflecting the lower AMP7 capex programme. Property rates are \u00a314 million higher this year, largely reflecting a rates refund received last year. We have accrued \u00a36 million of costs in 2020/21 in relation to the Innovation in Water Challenge Scheme mentioned above, along with \u00a313 million of extra COVID-19 related costs (including a \u00a35 million increase in the underlying bad debt charge), which have been absorbed within our cost base and which have not been treated as adjusted items when calculating our underlying operating profit.\n\nReported operating profit was \u00a328 million lower than last year, reflecting the decrease in underlying operating profit partially offset by a decrease in adjusted items. As a result of the changes we have made to alternative performance measures, we will no longer, as a matter of course, adjust for restructuring costs to derive underlying operating profit and therefore we do not have any adjusted items in the year to 31 March 2021, with prior year numbers re-presented for comparative purposes. Adjusted items totalling \u00a3102 million were made in the full year to 31 March 2020, comprising \u00a383 million of accelerated depreciation of bioresources assets that had been taken out of use and \u00a319 million in relation to provisions for the anticipated impact of COVID-19, principally reflecting a higher bad debt charge recognising the higher risk of future non-payment of household customer bills. These adjusted items can also be found on pages 82 to 83 and more detail can be found in our announcement of results for the year to 31 March 2020.\n\nHousehold bad debt is 2.2 per cent of regulated revenue, representing a marginal increase of \u00a35 million on the underlying bad debt cost in the prior year, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty associated with the third lockdown and taking into account expected cash collection into the future, as government support unwinds in the coming months.\n\n## Profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Adjusted items are set out on pages 82 and 83\n\nUnderlying profit before tax (1) was \u00a3460 million, \u00a375 million lower than last year. This reflects the \u00a3130 million reduction in underlying operating profit, and an increase in the share of underlying losses of joint ventures of \u00a33 million, partly offset by a \u00a358 million decrease in underlying net finance expense.\n\nUnderlying profit before tax reflects consistently applied presentational adjustments as outlined on pages 82 to 83. Reported profit before tax increased by \u00a3248 million to \u00a3551 million, reflecting the \u00a328 million reduction in reported operating profit and the \u00a33m increase in the share of underlying losses of joint ventures, more than offset by a \u00a3210 million reduction in reported net finance expense (including fair value movements), a \u00a337 million profit on the disposal of our Tallinn joint venture and the impact in the prior year of our \u00a332 million share of Water Plus losses arising as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Net finance expense\n\nThe underlying net finance expense of \u00a3133 million was \u00a358 million lower than last year, on a consistent basis. Interest of \u00a383 million on non-index linked debt was \u00a313 million lower than last year due to lower rates locked in on debt and associated swaps. The indexation of principal on index-linked debt, including the impact of inflation swaps, amounted to a net charge in the income statement of \u00a354 million, compared with a net charge of \u00a3100 million last year.\n\nReported net finance expense of \u00a379 million was \u00a3210 million lower than last year, principally reflecting a \u00a3151 million increase in the fair value gains on debt and derivative instruments, from a \u00a376 million loss in the prior year to a \u00a374 million gain in the current year, and lower inflation applied to our index-linked debt.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the group completed the disposal of its stake in the Tallinn Water joint venture for consideration of EUR 100.3 million (\u00a385.3 million) and a total recognised profit on disposal of \u00a337 million. Given its material and atypical nature, this profit on disposal has been excluded from underlying results.\n\nFor the year to 31 March 2021, we recognised \u00a314 million losses in the income statement relating to our joint venture Water Plus, comprising \u00a39 million of our share of Water Plus's underlying losses for the year and \u00a35 million of previously unrecognised share of losses. At 31 March 2021 there was a clear expectation that the \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility extended to Water Plus would be converted into additional equity share capital, and as a result share of losses are recognised against this capital, this includes recognition of any previously unrecognised losses. The transaction to convert the \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility was subsequently executed on 23 April 2021.\n\nFor the year to 31 March 2020, we recognised \u00a351 million losses in the income statement relating to our joint venture Water Plus, comprising \u00a314 million of our share of Water Plus' underlying losses and our \u00a332 million share of Water Plus losses arising as a result of COVID-19, as well as a \u00a35 million allowance for expected credit losses. As a result, our long-term interest in Water Plus was written down to \u00a3nil. A further \u00a35 million of our share of Water Plus' underlying losses were not recognised in the income statement.\n\nOur \u00a39 million underlying share of losses of joint ventures in the year to 31 March 2021 comprises a \u00a35 million share of profits from Tallinna Vesi AV, more than offset by a \u00a314 million share of losses from Water Plus.",

The total payments for 2020/21 were around \u00a3258 million and included business rates, employment taxes, environmental taxes and other regulatory service fees such as water abstraction charges, as well as corporation tax.\n\nIn 2020/21, we paid corporation tax of \u00a375 million, which represents an effective cash tax rate on underlying profits of 16 per cent, which is 3 per cent lower than the headline rate of corporation tax of 19 per cent. The key reconciling item to the headline rate of corporation tax continues to be allowable tax deductions on capital investment and also, in the prior year, pension payments - these being deductions put in place by successive governments to encourage such investment and thus reflecting responsible corporate behaviour in relation to taxation.\n\nWe have expressed the effective cash tax rate in terms of underlying profits as this measure excludes fair value movements on debt and derivative instruments and thereby enables a medium-term cash tax rate forecast. We expect the average cash tax rate on underlying profits to remain below the headline rate of tax for the medium term.\n\nAs well as the payments we also received a repayment of corporation tax of \u00a327 million following agreement of routine prior years' UK tax matters.\n\nThe current tax charge was \u00a380 million in 2020/21, compared with \u00a351 million in the previous year. There were current tax credits of \u00a31 million in 2020/21 and \u00a312 million in 2019/20, following agreement of prior years' UK tax matters.\n\nFor 2020/21, the group recognised a deferred tax charge of \u00a318 million, compared with \u00a3158 million for 2019/20. Of the deferred tax charge for 2019/20, \u00a3136 million related to the Government's reversal of the planned reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 19 per cent to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020. Excluding the above change in tax rate related deferred tax adjustment in the prior year and the current year non-taxable profit on the disposal of the joint venture investment in AS Tallinna Vesi, the total\n\neffective tax rate was around 19 per cent for both the current year and the prior year. Subject to any legislative or tax practice changes, we would expect the total effective tax rate to be in line with the headline rate of corporation tax for the medium term.\n\nIn 2020/21, there are \u00a331 million of tax adjustments taken to equity, primarily relating to remeasurement movements on the group's defined benefit pension schemes. As in the prior year the rate at which the deferred tax liabilities are measured on the group's defined benefit pension scheme is 35 per cent, being the rate applicable to refunds from a trust.\n\nAn increase in the headline rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent from 1 April 2023 was announced in the Chancellor's Budget on 3 March 2021. This change has been enacted in May 2021, and will result in a future deferred tax charge currently estimated at around \u00a3380 million.\n\n## Dividend per share\n\nThe board has proposed a final dividend of 28.83 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021. Taken together with the interim dividend of 14.41 pence per ordinary share, paid in February, this results in a total dividend per ordinary share for 2020/21 of 43.24 pence. This is an increase of 1.5 per cent compared with the dividend relating to last year, in line with the group's dividend policy of targeting a growth rate of CPIH inflation each year through to 2025. The inflationary increase of 1.5 per cent is based on the CPIH element included within the allowed regulated revenue increase for the 2020/21 financial year (i.e. the movement in CPIH between November 2018 and November 2019).\n\nThe final dividend is expected to be paid on 2 August 2021 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 June 2021. The ex-dividend date is 24 June 2021.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash generated from continuing operating activities for the year to 31 March 2021 was \u00a3859 million, broadly consistent with \u00a3810 million last year. The group's net capital expenditure was \u00a3639 million, principally in the regulated water and wastewater investment programmes. This excludes infrastructure renewals expenditure which is treated as an operating cost. Cash flow capex differs from regulatory capex, since the latter is based on capital work done in the period, rather than actual cash spent.",

        "page_content": "## Pensions\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, the group had an IAS 19 net pension surplus of \u00a3689 million, compared with a net pension surplus of \u00a3754 million at 31 March 2020. This \u00a365 million decrease is predominantly due to the unwinding of a\n\nspike in credit spreads at 31 March 2020 due to COVID-19 that resulted in a temporary decrease in the valuation of liabilities. The scheme-specific funding basis does not suffer volatility due to credit spread movements to the same extent as it uses a prudent, fixed\n\ncredit spread assumption and is hedged for inflation and interest rates. Any inflation and credit spread movements are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the pension liabilities calculated on a schemespecific funding basis.\n\n## Financing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe group's gross borrowings at 31 March 2021 had a carrying value of \u00a38,452 million. The fair value of these borrowings was \u00a39,855 million. This \u00a31,403 million difference principally reflects the significant fall in real interest rates compared with the rates at the time we raised a portion of the group's indexlinked debt. This difference has increased from \u00a3471 million at 31 March 2020 due primarily to a decrease in credit spreads.\n\nCash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2021 amounted to \u00a3744 million.\n\nNet debt at 31 March 2021 was \u00a37,306 million, compared with \u00a37,361 million at 31 March 2020. This comprises gross borrowings of \u00a38,452 million and derivative liabilities of \u00a3115 million net of cash of \u00a3744 million and derivative assets of \u00a3425 million. This is then adjusted to exclude derivatives with a net liability of \u00a392 million under our revised definition of net debt to exclude the impact of derivatives that are not hedging-specific debt instruments and therefore gives a fairer reflection of the amount we are contractually obliged to repay. This approach is more consistent with that taken by the credit rating agencies and better reflects the regulatory economics.\n\nUnderlying movements in net debt are largely a result of net operating cash inflows offset by our net capital expenditure, dividends, cash interest, indexation interest and tax, and in 2020/21 also reflects the impact of the \u00a385 million sales proceeds from the disposal of our Tallinn JV.\n\nGearing, measured as group net debt divided by UUW's shadow (adjusted for actual spend) regulatory capital value, was 62 per cent at 31 March 2021. This is marginally higher than the 61 per cent as at 31 March 2020 but remains within our target range of 55 to 65 per cent.\n\n## Cost of debt\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, the group had approximately \u00a33.0 billion of RPI-linked debt at an average real rate of 1.3 per cent, and \u00a31.1 billion of CPI or CPIH-linked debt at an average real rate of -0.2 per cent.\n\nA lower RPI inflation charge compared with the same period last year contributed to the group's average effective interest rate of 2.5 per cent being lower than the rate of 3.4 per cent for the year to 31 March 2020. The average underlying interest rate represents the underlying net finance expense adjusted for capitalised borrowing costs and net pension interest income, divided by average notional debt.\n\nThe group has fixed the interest rates on its non index-linked debt in line with its 10-year reducing balance basis at a net effective nominal interest rate of 2.2 to 2.5 per cent for the 2020-25 regulatory period.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nUUW's senior unsecured debt obligations are rated A3 with Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), A- with Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and BBB+ with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and all on stable outlook.

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2020/21\n\nFinancial performance\n\nIn November 2020, we published our new sustainable finance framework, through which we expect to raise financing based on our strong ESG credentials alongside conventional issuance. This replaces the green funding we have previously secured through the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is no longer available postBrexit.\n\nIn January 2021, we issued our debut sustainable bond raising \u00a3300 million, maturing in October 2029 and subsequently swapped to CPI-linkage.\n\nWe remain one of the sector leaders in the issuance of CPI-linked debt in response to Ofwat's decision to transition away from RPI inflation linkage. At 31 March 2021, we have increased the CPI-linkage in our debt portfolio to \u00a31,015 million with a further \u00a350 million of CPIH-linkage, and therefore a perfect match for the regulatory regime.\n\nSince March 2020, we have renewed \u00a350 million of revolving credit facilities with a relationship bank for a further fiveyear term, and extended \u00a3100 million of revolving credit facilities for a further three years, and \u00a3250 million of revolving credit facilities for a further year.\n\n## Interest rate management\n\nLong-term borrowings are structured or hedged to match assets and earnings, which are largely in sterling, indexed to UK price inflation and subject to regulatory price reviews every five years.\n\nLong-term sterling inflation index-linked debt provides a natural hedge to assets and earnings. At 31 March 2021, approximately 41 per cent of the group's net debt was in RPI-linked form, representing around 26 per cent of UUW's regulatory capital value, with an average real interest rate of 1.3 per cent. A further 15 per cent of the group's net debt was in CPI or CPIH-linked form, representing around 9 per cent of UUW's RCV, with an average real rate of -0.2 per cent. The long-term nature of this funding also provides a good match to the company's long-life infrastructure assets and is a key contributor to the group's average term debt maturity profile, which is around 18 years.\n\nOur inflation hedging policy is to target around 50 per cent of net debt to be maintained in index-linked form. This reflects a balanced assessment across a range of factors.\n\nWhere nominal debt is raised in a currency other than sterling and/or with a fixed interest rate, the debt is generally swapped to create a floating rate sterling liability for the term of the debt. To manage exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest costs on nominal debt out to ten years on a reducing balance basis.\n\nHistorically, this has been supplemented by fixing substantially all remaining floating rate exposure across a forthcoming regulatory period around the time of the price control determination. Recognising Ofwat's intention to apply debt indexation for new debt raised during the 2020-25 regulatory period, we have retained the hedge to fix underlying interest costs on nominal debt out to ten years on a reducing balance basis, but have not supplemented this with the additional 'top up' fixing at the start of the new regulatory period.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nShort-term liquidity requirements are met from the group's normal operating cash flow and its short-term bank deposits and supported by committed but undrawn credit facilities. Our \u20ac7 billion EMTN programme provides further support.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, we had liquidity out to August 2023, comprising cash and shortterms deposits (enhanced by new finance raised in the period), plus committed undrawn revolving credit facilities. This gives us flexibility in terms of when and how further debt finance is raised to help refinance maturing debt and support the delivery of our regulatory capital investment programme.\n\nWe consider that we operate a prudent approach to managing banking counterparty risk. Counterparty risk, in relation to both cash deposits and derivatives, is controlled through the use of counterparty credit limits. Our cash is held in the form of short-term money market deposits with prime commercial banks.\n\nWe operate a bilateral rather than a syndicated approach to our core relationship banking facilities. This approach spreads maturities more evenly over a longer time period, thereby reducing refinancing risk and providing the benefit of several renewal points rather than a large single refinancing requirement.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe have responded well to the challenges presented by COVID-19 and delivered another year of strong operational performance, building on the improvements we delivered in AMP6. We are leading the way on customer satisfaction and have made a strong start to our AMP7 customer ODIs, delivering net outperformance of \u00a321 million this year. We have extended our AMP7 totex plans by \u00a3300 million to underpin the delivery of long-term sustainable performance improvements and efficiency, and we continue with our strategy of accelerating investment to bring forward benefits for customers and the environment and contributing to the economic recovery of our region.\n\nThis is a great start to the new regulatory period and provides a strong platform to deliver further good operational performance for the benefit of all stakeholders. This gives us the confidence to target cumulative net outperformance of around \u00a3150 million against our customer ODIs for AMP7.\n\n## 2021/22 full-year guidance\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is expected to be marginally lower in 2021/22, reflecting the November 2020 CPIH of 0.6 per cent offset by the regulatory revenue reduction of 2.0 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Underlying operating costs are expected to be marginally higher yearon-year, reflecting small inflationary increases coming through core costs while IRE is expected to increase, reflecting the additional investment in DNM.\n- \u00b7 Underlying finance expense is expected to be higher year-on-year as higher inflation impacts our index-linked debt.\n- \u00b7 Capex in 2021/22 is expected to be in the range of \u00a3625 million to \u00a3675 million, reflecting the ongoing acceleration of our AMP7 programme and around \u00a350 million of additional capex (of the \u00a3300 million extension to our AMP7 totex plans).\n- \u00b7 Targeting a net customer ODI reward of around \u00a320 million, consistent with targeting a cumulative net AMP7 reward of around \u00a3150 million.",

These measures are linked to the group's financial performance as reported in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, in the group's consolidated income statement, which can be found on page 207. As such, they represent non-GAAP measures.\n\nAdjusted item\n\nRationale\n\nThese APMs have been presented in order to provide a more representative view of business performance. The group determines adjusted items in the calculation of its underlying measures against a framework which considers significance by reference to profit before tax, in addition to other qualitative factors, such as whether the item is deemed to be within the normal course of business, its assessed frequency of recurrence and its volatility which is either outside the control of management and/or not representative of current year performance.\n\nWe have simplified our approach to APMs and are no longer, as a matter of course, adjusting our underlying earnings for restructuring costs, net pension interest, capitalised borrowing costs and prior years'\n\ntax matters. This brings our approach more in line with peers and therefore makes crosscompany comparisons easier. The tables that follow present the prior year APMs both on a re-presented basis using the new definition of APMs and as presented as at 31 March 2020 for comparative purposes.\n\nIn addition, a reconciliation of the group's average effective interest rate has been presented, together with a prior year comparison. In arriving at net finance expense used in calculating the group's effective interest rate, underlying net finance expense is adjusted to add back net pension interest income and capitalised borrowing costs in order to provide a view of the group's cost of debt that is better aligned to the return on capital it earns through revenue.\n\n| Adjustments not expected to recur                                                                                                            | Adjustments not expected to recur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bioresources asset   write down                                                                                                              | A strategic review of the group's bioresources activities was undertaken in the second half of the year ended 31 March 2020,  informed by the PR19 process and the group's zero-carbon commitments.

Our CDP climate change rating improved from B to A- in 2020, demonstrating leadership-level reporting and disclosure. We are one of only two companies in the UK water sector achieving leadership level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Reporting Performance report by EcoAct measures how businesses are acting and reporting on climaterelated sustainability. We have been ranked in the top 20 FTSE 100 list, improving from 17th to 11th position in 2020, and are the highest ranking water company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nWeather is fundamental to how we deliver water and wastewater services so climate change has been, and always will be, of strategic and operational importance. With advances in climate science, our understanding of climate change and how we respond is ever evolving, as is the external policy environment in which we operate.\n\n## Incorporating climate into long-term planning\n\nBuilding on our long-standing approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation, we now integrate consideration of climaterelated risks and opportunities directly into our business planning to influence strategy and behaviours throughout the organisation.\n\nThis year, we've enhanced our understanding of the sensitivity of our business risks to climate change and applied Systems Thinking to embed physical and transitional risks into both operational planning and long-term strategy development.\n\nWe now have a good understanding of the controls required to adapt to a changing climate, and are building our confidence to recognise and manage cascade impacts where multiple weather events in a short time frame can have a cumulative impact.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nTo support strategic planning, we developed three comprehensive scenarios exploring how multiple drivers of change might evolve and interact over time, compared to a baseline scenario. Each one is aligned to a specific emissions pathway, enabling us to test out scenarios where there is: an effective transition to a low carbon world; a climate crisis due to suboptimal climate change mitigation efforts; and a central case where more moderate impacts of climate change are experienced after slow initial progress is followed by a step change in decarbonisation.\n\n## Transparency and disclosure\n\nWe have published carbon and climate change disclosures in our annual report and CDP's Climate Change Programme assessment for over a decade. We report in adherence with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards (2015) and the 2019 UK Governmental Environmental Reporting guidelines.\n\nWe have signed the Statement of Support for the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which was published in June 2017, and we report in line with its recommendations across its four thematic areas.\n\n## Pledges and commitments\n\nWe have made good progress on our six carbon pledges (see page 93), which include science-based emission reduction targets and four specific pledges on how those reductions will be achieved.\n\nPledge 1 is to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42 per cent by 2030. We are on track to achieve this pledge although progress will not be linear year-on-year while we work to reverse the pressures that are driving growth in emissions.\n\nPledge 2 - Over 94 per cent of the electricity we used in 2020/21 came from renewable technologies. From October 2021, we will meet our pledge for 100 per cent.\n\nPledge 3 commits us to 100 per cent green fleet by 2028. We have deployed 27 electric vehicles at operational sites, and are trialling a 44-tonne biogaspowered HGV.\n\nPledge 4 commits us to 1,000 hectares of peatland restoration by 2030. We have proposed five sites for green recovery catchment peatland restoration.\n\nPledge 5 commits us to 550 hectares of woodland creation by 2030. We have planted 9,783 woodland carbon code compliant trees, established two tree nurseries and identified hundreds of potential sites for new and 'replanted' woodlands.\n\nPledge 6 commits us to set a sciencebased target for our scope 3 emissions, which we have done (see page 96).\n\nAn important element of our approach is to encourage others to contribute by making public commitments. We joined the global movement of 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C: Our Only Future', with a commitment to setting science-based targets aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We are signatories to the UN Race to Zero campaign and are proud to be contributing to the UK water industry's commitment to be net zero from 2030.\n\n## CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP REVIEW\n\nCorporate Citizenship, a leading sustainability consultancy, reviewed this disclosure and provides an ISAE assurance against the Principles of Effective Disclosure to ensure that it accords with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at fsb-tcfd.org/ recommendations",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to climate change\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nChief Executive Officer Steve Mogford has ultimate responsibility for the group's preparedness for both adapting to climate change and driving our mitigation strategy. As climate change is a significant causal factor for the group's principal risks (see page 103), the executive team is tasked with managing the risks and mitigating actions, for example by ensuring the company has the necessary financial resources and people with the required skills to achieve its climaterelated objectives.\n\nChief Financial Officer Phil Aspin has executive responsibility for risk management and is supported in this role by the head of audit and risk and the corporate risk manager.\n\nThe group audit and risk board (GARB) reviews the effectiveness and performance of the governance processes along with the identification of emerging trends, including climate change. The work of the GARB feeds into the information and assurance processes of the audit committee and into the board's assessment of risk exposures and strategies to manage these risks.\n\nThere is further board oversight of climaterelated issues through the corporate responsibility committee (see pages 156 to 159). Mitigation and adaptation are priority topics for the committee, which plays an important role in challenging and encouraging consideration of climaterelated issues. It initiated the review of the company's carbon strategy and endorsed the mitigation policy, defining our corporate ambition and objectives. This led to the development of our mitigation strategy and the establishment of an executive-level steering group. This group has delegated responsibility to embed climate-related issues throughout business planning, to bring consistent focus to the delivery of our climate-related commitments, such as the six carbon pledges, and to provide updates to the board and corporate responsibility committee.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe have a strong track record of risk management and of climate change disclosure. We continually mature our capacity and capability to manage risk and uncertainty to build and maintain long-term resilience across the corporate, financial and operational structures of the group.\n\nOur company risk management framework follows an enterprise-wide approach and covers all principal risk areas such as water service, supply chain and programme delivery.\n\nClimate-related risks are identified, assessed and managed in the same way as any othe/r.ss03 risk through our embedded risk management framework which is described on pages 100 to 101. Having been identified, each business risk is assessed in two ways. First, we consider the likelihood of the event occurring based on multiple causal factors; secondly, we examine the full range of potential impacts and their severity should the event occur, from a minimum (best case) to a maximum (worst case) scenario.\n\nWe take a variety of approaches to identify and assess risks, including using risk breakdown structures and tools such as PESTLE to formalise horizon scanning, as well as complex modelling of the physical impacts of climate change on our water resources and wastewater management.\n\nHorizon scanning such as tracking legal and regulatory changes, emerging technologies and comparison of our strategies with other companies is particularly useful when considering transitional risks. We have found risk breakdown structures and detailed modelling are better suited to acute or chronic physical risks.\n\n## Risks sensitive to climate change\n\nClimate change has been identified as a critical cross-cutting driver, so all our 100 event-based risks in our business risk profile were reviewed for their exposure to climate change. Last year we identified seven risks most sensitive to climate change in that their likelihood or the impact will increase with global warming. We have further analysed these risks and now have a good understanding of the controls required to adapt to a changing climate. This is set out on pages 90 to 91. This exercise highlighted a further risk in the potential for cascade impacts where multiple weather events in a relatively short time span can have a more challenging impact.\n\nLooking ahead, we will explore how innovation can help us learn more about the profile of risk events, their causes and consequences and the capacity and capability of our company to manage them. By understanding this, we have the opportunity to be proactive and better prepared by prioritising issues.\n\nBy incorporating longer-term climate change impacts more explicitly in our corporate risk framework, we have raised the profile of climate change adaptation, providing the board enhanced insight to consider our risk appetite and capacity from within existing risk management processes and with the same thresholds for materiality. We have identified where climate risks are not well enough understood or where existing controls might be inadequate to manage the risk in the long term.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\n## Planning horizons\n\nOur planning horizons are illustrated on pages 46 to 49. Climate-related risks are manifesting themselves in the short to medium term and in common with the rest of the water industry, we are also vulnerable to physical climate risks in the long term (ten to 25 years and beyond) as our assets typically have long, even very long, lifespans. Many of our services are based on legacy infrastructure which was designed decades ago to deliver water and wastewater services for the climate we had rather than the one that is ahead of us.\n\n## Already seeing climate change in the North West\n\nFive of the top ten wettest years for the North West since 1880 have occurred since 2000, and all of the ten hottest years have occurred since 2002. A top ten coldest year has not been recorded since 1963. These trends, and their impact on local weather conditions, are impacting our climate sensitive risks already.\n\nFor example, changes in precipitation and temperature have contributed to changing patterns of river flow in our water supply catchments. There has been an increase in winter flows in almost all catchments, with significant upward trends in ten of the 14 river basins, and a reduction in flows in most catchments in spring, most notably for the strategic Vyrnwy catchment where there has been a significant downward trend over the last 20 years.\n\nAnnual average rainfall has not changed significantly, although the year-to-year variability has increased (with more dry and wet years) and some research shows an increase in the probability of heavier rainfall events. The greatest change in seasonal rainfall trends is an increase in winter rainfall, due to an intensification of heavy rainfall events, which leaves us increasingly susceptible to a range of key risks, including sewer flooding, asset flooding and land quality deterioration.\n\nAnnual and monthly temperatures in the North West are already higher than those experienced before 1900, largely due to anthropogenic activity, with the rate of warming accelerating.\n\nApplication of temperature-based estimates show an increase in potential evapo-transpiration in our region. This may influence the water balance, particularly in spring and summer, leading to a sensitivity to drought, and potentially water network failure and water sufficiency events.",

Evaporation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaporation\n\nThe amount of water lost to evaporation has increased, putting increasing pressure on water resources during spring and summer and potentially increasing the demand for outdoor water use.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nAll seven of the risks identified as being sensitive to climate change are physical risks, so we set about quantifying that vulnerability.\n\nPredicting the effects of climate change is complex, with a large amount of uncertainty involved. Focusing on the predominant downsides, we assessed the potential implications for the seven risks in 2050 and 2100 compared to today, using the latest climate research, the Met Office UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). This has four pathways to 2100 depending on concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and we have used what is widely accepted as the most likely pathway, RCP 6.0, which is consistent with peak emissions occurring in 2080. Best and worst case scenarios will be considered in due course.\n\nThe outcomes of the risk assessment were the topic of a special report prepared for a board-level risk review which took place in April 2021. They are presented on pages 90 to 91, together with a summary of assumptions, climate sensitivity and existing controls. In each case the downside effect is quite significant relative to the baseline, and four risks in particular stand out as having the most significant increases in likelihood: water sufficiency event; water network failure; recycling of biosolids to agriculture; and risk of inadequate land management.\n\n## Seasonal variation\n\nSeasonal changes in the North West are projected to be greater than those for England and Wales, with much wetter winters and, under some scenarios, much hotter and drier summers.\n\n## Transitional risks\n\nWe are also vulnerable to risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changing policies, regulation and legislation to address mitigation and adaptation requirements can increase operating costs due to, for example, enhanced emissions reporting. Environmental requirements to meet water quality standards can lead to increased fuel or chemical consumption and legislation such as the Industrial Emissions Directive will result in operational and strategic planning interventions.\n\nOne likely consequence of changing legislation is potential asset redundancy, where the case to move to lower carbon technologies might result in the consolidation of assets on a fewer number of sites.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nWe are a relatively energy-intensive business, typically using around 800 GWh of electricity each year. As well as the risks associated with this dependency we see opportunities in the way we manage energy and have developed an approach to use less, generate more and use our assets and resources smarter while maintaining security of supply.\n\nWe have already invested in innovation and research to minimise the total amount of energy we consume, for instance in pioneering UV LED water treatment. We\n\n## Extreme events\n\nEvidence demonstrates that climate change has exacerbated extreme rainfall and storm events, and will continue to do so, as well as increasing the likelihood of heatwaves.\n\nhave increased renewable generation through bioresources, solar and wind, increasing the amount of self-generated energy from 108 GWh in 2012/13 to 205 GWh in 2020/21.\n\nWe aim to develop more successful innovation projects and that by meeting more of our own energy demands we can rely less on imports from the grid and mitigate the risks of future energy price fluctuations and uncertainty, as well as bolstering our own security of supply.\n\n## Resilience of our organisation to a changing climate\n\nThe main climate-related risks to the resilience of our operational assets are uncertainty of the health of ageing infrastructure and the increasing challenges presented by predictions for climate change and population growth over the long term.\n\nOur Water Resources Management Plan 2019 is an example of how our strategy, to achieve a long-term, best value and sustainable plan for water supplies in the North West, has been developed to ensure that we have an adequate supply to meet demand over the 25 years from 2020 to 2045. This will ensure that our supply system is resilient to drought and other hazards, including climate change (using 'stochastic weather' and scenarios from the latest UK climate projections, UKCP18) and demand (population growth, economic trends and patterns of water use).\n\n## Sea level\n\nBy 2100 under the likely warming scenarios (3\u00b0C-5\u00b0C), sea level at Liverpool is projected to rise between 0.3 and 1.0m.

These scenarios, named 'climate chaos', 'green guardianship' and 'public purpose', are plausible narratives, with associated metrics, of a 2050 future for water and wastewater services in the North West.\n\nThe scenarios recognise climate change as one of the most critical uncertainties and use RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 (GHG concentration pathways adopted by the IPCC) to describe how well climate change has been mitigated in each case.\n\nThe scenarios have provided a simple way to understand the interaction of multiple factors so we can enhance resilience, help manage future uncertainty and shape longterm decisions.\n\n## Climate change mitigation strategy\n\nBefore agreeing our strategy, we developed a matrix to assess and compare our mitigation capabilities with other water companies and brands, to explore principles, priorities and define our objectives. The matrix began with the premise that great carbon management is more than just a number and that our strategy should cover four themes: vision and visibility; ambition and commitment; demonstrating action; and beyond here and now. See figure on page 93.\n\nWe already have a strong track record of sustainability reporting and disclosure, having reported our GHG emissions for nearly 20 years. Through this TCFD section, and improvements in our CDP response, we want our carbon reporting to be open and transparent and recognised as among the best in the UK.\n\nOther aspects of our climate mitigation strategy can be summarised as:\n\n- \u00b7 integrating carbon into strategic and day-to-day business planning;\n- \u00b7 improving our carbon reporting and climate-related disclosure;\n- \u00b7 setting ambitious and comprehensive commitments and greenhouse gas emissions targets to contribute to limiting global temperature rise;\n- \u00b7 reducing emissions across water and wastewater processes, sludge process and disposal, fleet management, fuel use, land use, and waste and resources; and\n\n- \u00b7 collaborating to drive innovation and challenge standards to deliver a lowcarbon future.\n\n## Playing our part\n\nPages 94 to 95 illustrate and describe how there are climate-related risks and opportunities throughout our organisation. Our approach to managing those risks, and taking advantage of the opportunities, involves all our stakeholders across our value chain.\n\n## METRICS AND TARGETS\n\n## Metrics to assess climate risks\n\nThe metrics which determine the magnitude of our climate risks and opportunities relate mainly to the weather, for instance measures such as temperature and rainfall by season. To manage our climate risks effectively we must track and understand patterns of weather, and weather events, and learn how they can affect us operationally, so we can put into place appropriate controls such as those in the risk table on pages 90 to 91.\n\nWe monitor several measures that can affect transitional risks. These include energy pricing (electricity, natural gas, diesel and alternative fuels, such as compressed natural gas and hydrotreated vegetable oil) and carbon pricing through purchasable credits, offsets and certificates (such as REGOs not bundled with electricity). We monitor the marketplace for the availability and pricing of alternative fuelled vehicles, battery storage and for emerging technologies to reduce process and fugitive emissions.\n\n## Operational metrics and targets\n\nWe have key metrics that assess the effectiveness of the controls for our principal risks and therefore determine our capability to adapt to a changing climate and ensure the resilience of our service. For these operational metrics we have set ambitious targets. For instance, to give us headroom in our water supply demand balance we have set short and long-term targets for leakage and per capita consumption (how much customers use) to reduce the demand for water in all climate scenarios. Recognising the need to maintain service to customers, even in extreme weather events, we have also set targets for supply interruptions, sewer flooding and pollution incidents.\n\n| Metric                  | 2020   | 2025   | 2045   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Per capita  consumption | 140    | 135    | 115    |\n| Leakage                 | ---    | \u2193 15%  | \u2193 40%  |\n| Network  interruptions  | ---    | \u2193 50%  |        |\n| Sewer flooding          | ---    | \u2193 20%  | \u2193 70%  |\n| Pollution incidents     | ---    | \u2193 37%  | \u2193 64%  |\n\n## Climate commitments and targets\n\nWe have made several climate-related public commitments, on our own and with other organisations. Having exceeded the emissions targets we set in 2015, last year we made six pledges to reduce our carbon footprint. Central to these is to set and meet science-based targets for all emission scopes (see figure of greenhouse gas emissions by scope on page 97) and we have joined the global movement of 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u02daC: Our Only Future' and the UN Race to Zero campaign.\n\n## Science-based targets\n\nScience-based emission reduction targets are set in line with what climate science says is enough to limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. This requires emissions to halve from 2010 levels by 2030 and to hit net zero by 2050.\n\nThe Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) defines and promotes global best practice in science-based target setting. We have applied the 'SBTi Criteria and Recommendations' guidance to our policies and greenhouse gas accounting standards and have applied for our targets to be validated.\n\nPledge 1 is to meet our science-based target to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42 per cent by 2030 (from the 2019/20 baseline). This ambition is based on the Paris Agreement's highest level of ambition, to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We have a longer-term science-based target for a 100 per cent reduction from the 2019/20 baseline (net zero without purchased offsets) by 2050.\n\nPledge 6 committed us to set a sciencebased target for scope 3 emissions and we describe how this was achieved on page 96 .\n\n## Net Zero 2030 Routemap: Unlocking a net zero future\n\nIn November 2020 the UK water sector launched the 'Net Zero 2030 Routemap: Unlocking a net zero future', understood to be the world's first sector-wide plan for net zero. We have committed to contributing by stating our ambition that our water emissions (scope 1, 2 and a small selection of scope 3) will be net zero from 2030. This routemap allows companies to offset residual emissions (using agreed offsetting principles) whereas science-based targets require absolute emission reductions. This explains the difference between our science-based target to achieve a 42 per cent reduction by 2030 and being net zero from 2030 in line with the water industry ambitions.",

This is helping to greatly reduce our carbon footprint, and we are going much further.\n- 2 Water network - Moving water to where it is needed can require energy for pumping, but we can use gravity to help.

We are working collaboratively with the UK water industry to improve the measurement and control of these process emissions.\n\n4\n\n- 5 Chemicals - There is a carbon impact from producing the chemicals used in water and wastewater processes. We want to find innovative ways to minimise the amount and their impact.\n\n6\n\n7\n\n- Sewage sludge treatment - We have invested in digestion technologies to generate renewable energy from sewage 'waste'. Combined with other renewables we now generate 25 per cent of our electricity needs. At our Manchester Bioresources Centre we are also able to export biogas to the national grid.\n- Sludge disposal to land - Sewage contains valuable nutrients that can provide a renewable fertiliser. Greenhouse gases are released as the biosolids decay but there are also benefits from displacing fertilisers that are not reflected in our accounts.",

We have used the financial control approach so our energy and greenhouse gas emissions reports are aligned with the consolidated financial statements for United Utilities Group PLC. This includes its subsidiaries listed in section A8 on page 260.\n\nOur measurement and reporting is aligned to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2015) and the recommendations of the TCFD. As required, we report under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Reports) Regulations and we apply the 2019 UK Government Environmental Reporting Guidelines, including the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting Guidance (SECR). Our reporting is compliant with the international carbon reporting standard (ISO 14064, Part 1) and assured by the Carbon Reduce programme previously known as Certified Emissions Measurement and Reduction Scheme (CEMARS). We hold a Platinum status certificate as we have demonstrated emission reductions over ten years.\n\nHow we measure our greenhouse gas emissions\n\nA carbon footprint is calculated by converting all emissions of Kyoto Protocol gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e). Emissions are categorised as direct, indirect or avoided emissions.\n\nDirect emissions (scope 1 emissions) are those from activities we own or control, including those from our treatment processes, company vehicles, and burning of fossil fuels for heating.\n\nIndirect emissions, known as scope 2 and 3 emissions, result from operational activities we do not own or control. These include emissions produced as a consequence of electricity we purchase to power our treatment plants (scope 2) and other indirect emissions such as products and services we buy and travel on company business (scope 3).\n\nAvoided emissions are reductions from the purchase, or export, of renewable energy. Gross emissions are the sum of all three scopes. Net emissions are the gross emissions minus reductions from avoided emissions and removals.\n\nThe GHG Protocol recommends using two methods to quantify emissions\n\n- the 'location-based' method which uses average grid electricity emissions factors and the 'market-based' method which is specific to the actual electricity purchased. Following the GHG protocol recommendation we report results using both methods and use the 'market-based' figures to report our headline emissions.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions and energy performance in 2020/21\n\nOur investment in renewable energy generation has resulted this year in a further increase to 205.3 GWh, equivalent to a quarter of the electricity we consumed.\n\nOur net scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for 2020/21 were 127,173 tCO 2 e, 1.5 per cent more than last year. This is due to an increase in fossil fuel use, the volume of wastewater being processed and the subsequent amount of wastewater sludge being produced.\n\nOur scope 3 emissions, covering our new comprehensive inventory, have increased by 4 per cent, due to increased spend in the value chain on goods and services. In the coming years we plan to reduce the reliance on spend-based emissions calculations and will incentivise use of lower emission products, services and suppliers.\n\n## Greenhouse gases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We include scope 1 and 2 emissions only in this measure. We also report the regulated emissions tonnes CO 2 e per megalitre treated (using the location-based method as calculated in the CAW v15), as these are common metrics for our industry. The methodology for this calculation changed from CAW v13 so the figure is not available for 2018/19.\n\n| Greenhouse gas emissions intensity measures                   |               |   2020/21 |   2019/20 | 2018/19   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (gross) per \u00a3m revenue | tCO 2 e       |     78    |     74.7  | 75.8      |\n| Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (net) per \u00a3m revenue   | tCO 2 e       |     70.3  |     67.6  | 69.3      |\n| Regulated emissions per megalitre of treated water            | kg tCO 2 e/Ml |    118.51 |    131.98 | n/a       |\n| Regulated emissions per megalitre of sewage treated           | kg tCO 2 e/Ml |    152.26 |    168.51 | n/a       |",

We are a relatively energy-intensive business, consuming 951 GWh in 2020/21. We have increased the amount of energy generated from renewable sources, such as hydro, solar photovoltaics, wind, biomethane and sewage sludge powered combined heat and power (CHP) generators. In 2020/21 we generated the equivalent of 205 GWh of renewable electricity, an increase of 14 GWh on 2019/20. We exported 37.2 GWh back to the national electricity and gas grids, 4.9 GWh more than the previous year. Overall we reduced our electricity purchase by 4.5 GWh.\n\n## Energy efficiency action taken\n\nOur energy management programme brings together management processes, asset optimisation and data analytics. We have focused on optimisation of existing operations alongside realising opportunities through our capital programme to improve our use of pumps and how we manage wastewater treatment processes.\n\nA focus area for 2020/21 has been our use of pumps. At Watchgate water treatment works, performance analysis of two key pump types led to the tactical refurbishment of the worst performing pumps and changes to the control philosophy - resulting in better efficiency, saving an estimated \u00a340,500 per year, and a longer asset life.\n\nAt Heronbridge water treatment works, analysis of pump operation identified an opportunity to operate two pumps at minimum speed rather than a single pump at maximum speed. Running pumps closer to their best efficiency point reduces energy use and costs and should save approximately \u00a345,000 per year.",

        "page_content": "## Principal risks and uncertainties\n\nOur risk management framework\n\nWe have a robust risk management framework for the identification, assessment and mitigation of risk.\n\n## Our approach to risk and resilience\n\nSuccessful management of risks and uncertainties enables us to deliver on our purpose to provide great water and more for the North West, and be more resilient across our corporate, financial and operational structures. A key objective of our approach is to support the sustainable achievement of the strategic themes that underpin our vision to be the best UK water and wastewater company delivering:\n\n- \u00b7 the best service to customers;\n- \u00b7 at the lowest sustainable cost; and\n- \u00b7 in a responsible manner.\n\nOur risk management framework provides the foundation for the business to anticipate threats to delivering an effective service in these challenging times, and to respond and recover effectively when risks materialise. Key components of the framework include:\n\n- \u00b7 An embedded group-wide risk management process which is aligned to ISO 31000:2018 Risk management guidelines;\n- \u00b7 A board-led approach to risk appetite, based on strategic goals;\n- \u00b7 A strong and well-established governance structure giving the board oversight of the nature and extent of risks the group faces, as well as the effectiveness of risk management processes and controls; and\n- \u00b7 A portfolio of policies, procedures, guidance and training to enable consistent, group-wide participation by our people.\n\nContinuous improvement is a key feature of the framework which incorporates a maturity assessment model to identify areas to enhance. Based on risk management capabilities relative to five levels of maturity, a recent assessment has supported the development of a road map of improvements. These include an update to risk appetite statements, greater focus and analysis of cross-cutting themes and improved escalation of data from operational risk management systems.\n\n## How we identify and assess risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a number of mechanisms in place to identify risk. These include a risk universe, cross-business horizon scanning forums, consultation with third parties and comparison with National Risk Registers.\n\nEach risk is event based and is sponsored by a senior manager who is responsible for the analysis of the corresponding causal factors, consequences and the control effectiveness, taking account of both the internal and external business environment. This process determines the likelihood of the event occurring and the full range of potential impacts from a minimum (best case) to a maximum (worst case). Comparing this position against the desired target state, in combination with the strengths, weaknesses and gaps of the control environment, supports the decisions for further mitigation as appropriate. This ongoing analysis culminates in the biannual business unit risk assessment (BURA) which forms part of the governance and reporting process (as outlined opposite) to ensure consistency of approach and a true reflection of the risk facing the company. It also serves to calibrate the most significant risks from a financial and reputational context and to assess how these relate to our risk appetite.\n\n## Governance and reporting process\n\nThe board ensures that its oversight of risk remains effective, and in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, through a number of established reporting routes.\n\nTwice yearly the board receives an extensive update on the risk profile as part of the full and half-year reporting cycle. This provides an overview of the nature and extent of risk exposure in the context of the group's principal risks (as detailed on pages 104 to 107), and emphasises the most significant event-based risks (summarised on pages 108 and 109) in both their current state relative to the risk appetite, and target state of acceptable exposure. The board is also advised of new and emerging risks (see page 109). In addition to the biannual risk reporting, specific risk topics are reported to the board to support decision-making. The board is therefore able to:\n\n- \u00b7 make decisions on the level of risk it is prepared to manage relative to risk appetite and tolerance in order to deliver on the group's strategy;\n- \u00b7 engage with the business to ensure appropriate controls and mitigation are in place, and test the appropriateness of plans;\n- \u00b7 report externally on the long-term viability of the company in an informed manner; and\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the effectiveness of risk management procedures and internal control systems.",

        "page_content": "## The governance and reporting process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk-specific governance and steering groups manage ongoing individual risks. The operational risk and resilience board provides oversight of asset and operational process risk and resilience capability, escalates risks and issues to the group audit and risk board (GARB) and contributes to the BURA process.\n\nThe executive-led GARB focuses on: the adequacy, effectiveness and performance of governance processes; risk management and internal control; monitoring compliance and assurance activities; identification of emerging themes and trends; and resilience across the group.\n\nThe audit committee is also a fundamental component of the governance structure. Supported by company secretariat and the corporate audit teams, the audit committee reviews the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls before these are agreed by the board.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThe business risk profile consists of approximately 100 event-based risks, each of which relates to one of ten inherent risk areas, which we regard as our principal risks due to their potential to affect the performance, future prospects or reputation of the company. The allocation of event-based risks to principal risks enables the company to consider risks in the context of systems and production lines, in line with our Systems Thinking approach.\n\n## Principal risk heat map\n\nThe heat map provides an indicative view of the current risk exposure (likelihood of occurrence and most likely impact) of each of the principal risks relative to each other.\n\nSeven of the ten principal risks have remained relatively stable in the last 12 months. Water service, Supply chain and programme delivery and Finance have reduced due to the replacement of a section of the Haweswater Aqueduct, the trade deal with the EU and improvement in the economic outlook, respectively.\n\nSee pages 104 to 107 for further details of the principal risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal risks\n\nWater service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Wastewater service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Retail and commercial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupply chain and programme delivery\n\n- 5 Resource\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 7 Health, safety and environmental\n- 8 Security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 9 Conduct and compliance\n- 10 Political and regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK EXPOSURE\n\nAn indication of the current exposure of each principal risk relative to the prior year.\n\nDecreased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStable\n\nIncreased",

        "page_content": "## Principal risks and uncertainties\n\nCommon themes\n\nAs illustrated in the bow-tie diagram below, each of the event-based risks has multiple causes and consequences which in turn lead to financial and/or reputational impact. Preventative and responsive controls are applied to reduce the likelihood of the event occurring and limit the impact if the event were to materialise. New and emerging circumstances in respect of causes, consequences and controls make the profile multifaceted and dynamic. Analysis of the profile highlights common themes, notably associated with the causes and consequences. These common themes can then be considered more holistically to enable a more integrated, Systems Thinking approach to risk mitigation. Analysis of the control environment indicates the strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the mitigation of risk, as well as the interdependencies across the business to manage risk as part of the integrated approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preventative controls\n\n## Responsive controls\n\n## Common causal themes\n\nThe event-based risks include multiple causal factors which individually or in combination could trigger the risk event to occur. Categorisation illustrates six common causal themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Extreme weather/climate change: In the majority of cases our water resources, asset base and operations can cope with extreme weather conditions, although these can become overwhelmed in intense situations. Climate change projections highlight increased temperatures, rainfall, wind and more frequent extreme variations in weather patterns. This means that climate change remains a key focus for us, because of its impact on our capacity and capability for service delivery, and because of the effect on the environment that we strive to protect and enhance. We are committed to the principles set by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) - see pages 86 to 99.\n\n\u00b7\n\nDemographic changes:\n\nDemographic\n\nchanges, including population growth\n\nand evolving age profiles, can impact\n\nthe capacity and capability of water\n\nand wastewater treatment and network\n\nassets; can affect demand on water\n\nresources; and increase uncertainty in\n\nrelation to pension obligations.\n\n- \u00b7 Legislative and regulatory change: Changes in legislation and/or regulation can have implications for the business model, asset base and ways of working. For example: the anticipated post-Brexit changes in law bring an element of uncertainty; and the introduction of competition, whilst positive to customers and markets, can affect ongoing revenue and the asset base.\n\n- \u00b7 Economic conditions: Macro events, such as the financial crisis in 2008 and more recently COVID-19, can have multiple financial implications, including: lower revenue; increased bad debt; increased operational cost; increased cost of borrowing; and a reduction in the Regulatory Capital Value. The events can also impact the wider supply chain with knock-on effects to our service delivery and cost to serve.\n- \u00b7 Asset health: General use, exposure to natural hazards, pressure and load all contribute to the deterioration of assets. In addition, other factors such as technological obsolescence and operating assets beyond their optimal capacity to cope with increased demand (population growth and/or climate change) also affect asset health. Ageing assets therefore provide an underlying and cross-business risk and uncertainty both to efficiency and for the long-term resilience of asset integrity and the associated service capability.\n- \u00b7 Culture: Embedded through processes, reward mechanisms, values and behaviours, corporate culture is important to maintain high performance and cuts across the majority of risks in the profile. In an increasingly challenging business environment, our focus is to continue to embed a culture of innovation, customer service and behaving in a responsible manner at the same time as being open and transparent.\n\n## Common consequence themes\n\nEach consequence is analysed for the financial and reputational implications relative to multiple stakeholders. Categorisation of the consequences illustrates four common impact themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer: Customers are impacted through our service offering, the quality of their experience when dealing with us, and how our operational and capital schemes affect them in the community.\n- \u00b7 Environment: Our assets, operations and capital programmes can have a significant impact on the environment in both rural and urban settings. As a major land owner and operator of a large fleet of vehicles, the way we manage these also has environmental implications.\n- \u00b7 Investors: The vast majority of risks in the profile have financial implications that could affect shareholder investment in the short and long term. Reputational impact associated with ethics, environmental protection and efficiency is also relevant for investors' interest in the company.\n- \u00b7 Employees: Our employees are fundamental to delivering our service requirements as well as our strategic objectives. Equally, our employees can be affected by multiple risks across the business, but primarily in relation to employment and health, safety and wellbeing risks.",

Asset inspections, regular maintenance and cleaning are undertaken across our water assets, supported by a prioritised replacement regime. Water resources management, production planning, pressure/flow management and leak detection are undertaken to maintain supply and minimise interruptions.

Compounding issues include unauthorised third party discharges into the sewer network, changing demographics and extreme weather. Whilst generally designed to cope with the vast majority of storms, high intensity rainfall can overwhelm the system. Legal and regulatory change potentially increases standards or imposes restrictions which will require time and investment to maintain compliance.\n\nPotential impacts include: regulatory non-compliance; interruptions to drainage services; pollution incidents (including odour nuisance and sewer flooding); and inability to dispose of sludge to land.\n\n## Control and mitigation\n\nThe sewer network is managed through a combination of the drainage and wastewater management plans and the wastewater network operating model which include asset condition surveys to identify defects, sewer rehabilitation projects, customer campaigns and sewer cleaning programmes. Integrated drainage area studies and the adoption of a pollution incident reduction plan aim to make further enhancements.

Key factors include unexpected and/or higher costs associated with an operational incident, fluctuations in commodity prices and our exposure to movements in interest rates and inflation. A reduction in credit ratings, the over payment of tax and a worsening of the pension scheme funding position are also factors. Contributing factors include the macroeconomy, the political and regulatory environments relative to the water sector, and our internal financial structure.\n\nPotential impacts include cash flow implications, reduced profit and ultimately the solvency of the company in extreme cases.\n\n## Control and mitigation\n\nWe arrange long-term refinancing with staggered maturity dates and maintain significant liquidity to minimise the effect of short-term downturns. Counterparty credit exposure and settlement limits exist to reduce any potential future impacts. These are based on a number of factors, including the credit rating and the size of the asset base of the individual counterparty. The group employs hedging strategies to manage the impact of market fluctuations for inflation, interest rates and energy prices. Sensitivity analysis is carried out as part of the business planning process, influencing the various financial limits employed. Continuous monitoring of the markets takes place, including movements in credit default swap prices and movements in equity levels.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)\n- \u00b7 Underlying operating profit\n- \u00b7 Gearing (net debt : RCV)\n\n## Most significant event-based risks\n\n- \u00b7 Financial outperformance *\n- \u00b7 Credit ratings *\n- \u00b7 Pension deficit *\n- \u00b7 Fair payment of tax *\n\n## HAZARD/hyphen.caseBASED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health, safety and environmental\n\nThe potential harm to employees, contractors, the public or the environment.\n\n## Main strategic theme\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk exposure\n\nThe nature and scale of our operations presents multiple hazards to employees, contractors, the public and the environment. These include confined spaces, excavations, explosive atmospheres or high volume asset failures (e.g. dams or aqueducts), and polluting sewage and chemicals if accidentally or uncontrollably released.\n\nPotential impacts include: serious injury or loss of life; catastrophic damage to property/infrastructure; and damage to, or destruction of, wildlife, fish or natural habitats. Environmental hazards, notably extreme weather, can affect our operational assets and service delivery.\n\n## Control and mitigation\n\nWe have a strong health, safety and environmental culture supported by strong governance and management systems certified to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 respectively. We actively seek to improve health, safety and wellbeing across the group through targeted improvements and benchmarking against our peers and seek to protect and improve the environment through the responsible delivery of our services. This includes helping to support rare species and habitats through targeted engagement and activity, as well as our commitment to reducing our carbon emissions by designing out waste from our operations, generating our own energy and looking at ways to reduce our use of raw materials. Due to the impact the environment can have on our services, extreme weather and climate change is being integrated into our risk, planning and decision-making processes.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\n- \u00b7 EA performance assessment\n- \u00b7 Accident frequency rates\n\n## Most significant event-based risks\n\n- \u00b7 Disease pandemic *\n- \u00b7 Process safety *\n- \u00b7 Personal safety\n- \u00b7 Carbon commitments\n- \u00b7 Failure of above-ground assets (flooding)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Security\n\nThe potential for malicious activity (physical or technological) against people, assets or operations.\n\n## Main strategic theme\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk exposure\n\nAs the supplier of essential services and the owner and operator of critical national infrastructure, security is of paramount importance against an ever evolving and increasingly sophisticated threat through physical, technological, chemical or biological means. This could originate from rogue independent actors, nation states, organised crime, disgruntled employees, or as a result of commercial espionage.\n\nPotential impacts include the loss or compromise of commercially sensitive data, the disruption of business activity and/or damage or destruction of systems, assets or infrastructure with a knock-on impact to service delivery and community infrastructure.\n\n## Control and mitigation\n\nSecurity measures and awareness training combined with strong governance and inspection regimes aim to protect infrastructure, assets and operational capability. We work closely with our industry peers, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Defra. We liaise with these organisations to shape the sector approach to security, understand how to better protect our business, and be compliant with the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive. Ongoing system and network integration improves operational resilience and we maintain robust incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery procedures. We maintain insurance cover for loss and liability, and the instrument of appointment (licence) of the regulated business also contains a 'shipwreck' clause that, if applicable, may offer a degree of recourse in the event of a catastrophic incident.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber incidents\n\n## Most significant event-based risks\n\n- \u00b7 Cybercrime *\n- \u00b7 Terrorism *",

Long-term sustainability, resilience and reputation rely on responsible conduct and compliance across our business and extended supply chain.\n\nFailure to comply with legal obligations could lead to financial penalties, reputational harm and loss of customer and investor confidence. Fines of up to 10 per cent of group turnover could be imposed, particularly in the areas of environmental, health and safety, competition, and information and data security. Ultimately sanctions could include, in extreme circumstances, revocation of the instrument of appointment (licence) and the imposition of a special administration regime.\n\n## Control and mitigation\n\nWe place high importance and focus on corporate responsibility.

Depending on the circumstances, financial impacts will include loss of revenue, additional or extra cost, fines, regulatory penalties and compensation. Reputational impact relative to our multiple stakeholders is also assessed, reported and considered as part of the mitigation.\n\n1\n\n## Failure of significant water supply systems\n\nRisk exposure: The Haweswater Aqueduct (HA) is a key asset with current low resilience due to deterioration, potentially resulting in water quality issues and/or supply interruptions to a large proportion of our customer base.\n\nControl/mitigation: Capital projects for asset replacement (including HARP), as well as extensive programmes of asset monitoring, surveys and maintenance.\n\n5\n\n## Failure to treat wastewater\n\nRisk exposure: Inadequate capacity and capability of wastewater treatment works, leading to environmental permit breaches.\n\nControl/mitigation: Improved Effective Operations and Maintenance (EO&M) programme and operating procedures including proactive maintenance, operative training and compliance audits.\n\n9\n\n## Upstream competition (bioresources)\n\nRisk exposure: Competition in the bioresources market leading to a loss of business and reduced operational efficiency.\n\nControl/mitigation: Delivering operational efficiency, continued engagement with Ofwat and a strategic review of the bioresources business.\n\nC\n\n## Dam failure\n\nRisk exposure: Uncontrolled release of a significant volume of water from reservoirs due to flood damage, overtopping, earthquake or erosion leading to catastrophic impacts downstream.\n\nControl/mitigation: Each reservoir is regularly inspected by engineers. Where appropriate, risk reduction interventions are implemented through a prioritised investment programme.\n\n2\n\n## Failure of wastewater network (sewer flooding)\n\nRisk exposure: Equipment failure, collapses/bursts or inadequate hydraulic/ operational capacity to cope with extreme weather and population growth, resulting in sewer flooding.\n\nControl/mitigation: Preventative maintenance and inspection regimes, customer campaigns and sewer rehabilitation programmes.\n\n6\n\n## Financial outperformance\n\nRisk exposure: Failure to achieve financial outperformance due to macro economic conditions and efficiency challenges, impacting the cost of debt and delivery of the company business plan.\n\nControl/mitigation: Interest rate and inflation management, ongoing monitoring of markets and regulatory developments, and company business planning.\n\n10\n\n## Failure of the distribution system (leakage)\n\nRisk exposure: Network characteristics, asset condition, extreme weather or third-party damage resulting in the loss of treated water and failure of the leakage target.\n\nControl/mitigation: Management of pressure and flow combined with traditional and innovative leakage detection techniques.\n\nD\n\n## Disease pandemic\n\nRisk exposure: Serious illness in a large proportion of the UK population and consequences to our workforce, the wider supply chain and macroeconomy.\n\nControl/mitigation: The incident management process would be invoked, supported by the Pandemic Response Plan. This includes the implementation of multi-channel communication with non-pharmaceutical interventions as per government guidance.\n\n3\n\n## Cybercrime\n\nRisk exposure: Data and technology assets compromised due to malicious or accidental activity, leading to a major impact to key business processes and operations.\n\nControl/mitigation: Multiple layers of control, including a secure perimeter, segmented internal network zones, access controls, constant monitoring and forensic response capability.\n\n7\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nRisk exposure: Credit ratings below internal targets, due to deterioration in financial and/ or operational performance and/or external factors (such as inflation) resulting in more expensive funding.\n\nControl/mitigation: Continuous monitoring of markets, and the management of key financial risks within defined policy parameters.\n\nA\n\n## Pension deficit\n\nRisk exposure: The potential for the pension scheme funding deficit to increase because of life expectancy rates leading to additional contributions.\n\nControl/mitigation: Constant monitoring combined with hedging against interest rates, inflation and growth asset risk.\n\nE\n\n## Terrorism\n\nRisk exposure: A significant asset to be compromised by terrorist activity leading to loss of supply, contamination and/or pollution.\n\nControl/mitigation: A risk-based protection of assets in line with the Security and Emergency Measures Direction (SEMD) and close liaison with the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), regional counter terrorist units, local agencies and emergency services.",

Effective control points exist with alarms monitored remotely and statutory inspections.\n\n## New and emerging risks\n\nWe continue to review and monitor external and internal business environments to establish and understand risks and issues that are new, developing, growing or becoming more prominent. We do this through a combination of business unit risk assessments, a specific new and emerging risk forum and other horizon scanning forums such as a compliance working group. This enables us to plan our strategy and operations to minimise threats of this nature. Notable new and emerging risks and some possible impacts are set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Post-Brexit supply chain: Despite the agreement of a trade deal with the EU, there remains some uncertainty in relation to the supply of goods and services. We manage the supply chain through category management, with chemicals and critical spares being two categories which are fundamental to the delivery of our service provision. We will continue to monitor how the supply chain emerges and will adapt accordingly through category management and supplier relationship management.\n- \u00b7 Post-Brexit legislative change: PostBrexit uncertainty remains in relation to how European legislation will transition into UK law, for example, data protection laws governing the flow of data and information between the EU and UK. Changes in UK law, such as the Environment Bill, Sewage (Inland Waters) Bill and changes to Public Procurement will all have implications for the water sector.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory change: The political landscape remains challenging for the water sector. There remains uncertainty regarding the introduction of further competition and therefore the associated implications for revenue and the asset base. Looking ahead to Price Review 2024 (PR24), the methodology remains uncertain, particularly in light of the outcome of other water companies' PR19 CMA appeals.\n- \u00b7 Plastics: The current attention on single use plastics and microplastic pollution in water, wastewater effluent discharge and sludge disposal (see biosolids recycling to agriculture) could have implications for our assets and operations.\n- \u00b7 Biosolids recycling to agriculture: The practice of disposing of biosolids to agriculture could be banned (partially or in full) in the UK based on similar actions within Europe.\n- \u00b7 Water scarcity and water trading: Water scarcity is an emerging issue within the UK, which has knock-on implications for us in relation to the proposed strategic transfer of water from the North West to the South East of England, and the associated service, commercial and reputational impacts.\n- \u00b7 COVID-19: To a large degree, COVID-19 has become business as usual, however, the longer-term implications of the economic downturn, with potential corporate failures and high unemployment, could affect cash collection. Continued lower inflation will affect revenues, financing costs and RCV, however, rising inflation will have an upside over the longer term.\n\n## Material litigation\n\nThe group robustly defends litigation where appropriate and seeks to minimise its exposure by establishing provisions and seeking recovery wherever possible. Litigation of a material nature is regularly reported to the group board. Beyond that reported in previous years on the Argentina multiparty 'class action' and the Manchester Ship Canal Company matters (to which there have been no material developments), there is nothing specific to report on material litigation.",

At United Utilities, seven out of the remaining nine directors are independent nonexecutive directors.\n- \u00b7 The company secretary attends all board and committee meetings and advises the Chairman on governance matters. The company secretariat team provides administrative support.\n- \u00b7 The directors' biographies (see pages 112 to 115) include specific reasons why each director's contribution is, and continues to be, important to the company's longterm sustainable success.\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nOver the past year the board's focus has been has been dominated by the group's response to the pandemic and ensuring the safety and support for our employees while maintaining the delivery of services to customers across our region. As a regulated monopoly supplier, with a population of 7.3 million in our region, we need to work hard to meet the high expectations customers have for us, both in terms of the services we provide but also in behaving as a responsible business in the way in which we provide them. To do so is crucial to the long-term success of United Utilities.\n\nDuring the period May to November 2020, the board reviewed the impact of the pandemic on the financial performance of the group, including understanding the ability of some customers facing financial hardship to pay for our services. As a consequence, an extension of UUW's social tariff arrangements were approved, to apply until the end of the 2021/22 financial year. At the same time, the board did not want to jeopardise the great progress made over the last five years in improved\n\n- \u00b7 All directors are subject to annual election at the annual general meeting (AGM) held in July. The board concluded, following the completion of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the board, that each director continues to contribute effectively.\n- \u00b7 The board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of those directors standing for a further term at the forthcoming AGM, as they will be doing in respect of their individual shareholdings.\n\n## Quick link\n\nSchedule of matters reserved for the board\n\nunitedutilities.com/ corporate-governance\n\nA copy of the Financial Reporting Council's 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code can be found at frc.org.uk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperational performance, led by Steve Mogford and his team. Throughout this report you will see examples of our improved operational performance as recognised against the benchmarks set by our regulators. These improvements have given the board greater confidence of achieving regulatory outperformance during AMP7, and support our longerterm plans for the next asset management period.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe past year has challenged the normal interaction of both the board and management. The board were kept fully apprised of management's actions and changes to normal business practices in the early stages of the pandemic. A combination of physical meetings where possible, in conjunction with virtual board and committee meetings, have been held to maintain the integrity of our governance structure. Induction programmes for Kath and Doug were undertaken virtually, I know, in due course, Kath and Doug will welcome the opportunity to visit some of the company's principal operational sites and important capital projects, as will all board members. Informal virtual meetings have been held the evening before board meetings, as a substitute for our usual informal pre-board dinners. The annual board evaluation was externally facilitated this year, by virtual means by Independent Audit Limited (see page 135).\n\nAdditionally, we have held a number of virtual workshops on key topics, including: leakage; digital strategy; diversity and inclusion and, as a direct consequence of the pandemic, considering the options for new ways of working for employees across appropriate parts of our business. These in-depth sessions have provided board members with a greater understanding of these particular challenges and initiatives, and how they are being addressed by management. We held a strategy day in November 2020, enabling the board to spend time debating a number of strategic and long-term business priorities, an action which was identified in the 2019/20 board evaluation. A particular focus for the day, was understanding the plans for the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme and Ofwat's 'direct procurement for customers' approach, through which the programme will be delivered.\n\nHistorically, the company's annual general meeting held in July each year has welcomed a number of shareholders who have been regular attendees, last year of course being the exception. We are hoping that this will be an event in the corporate calendar that can be reinstated in the years to come. We are however, proposing to",

On page 167 we have explained our proposals in relation to code provision 38.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe board has an agreed framework for managing strategic and operational risks in accordance with the agreed risk appetite. The board regularly reviews the position to ensure that management are managing and mitigating risk in accordance with the board's agreed risk appetite. These risks include succession planning for senior management and asset resilience, with particular consideration for the impacts of climate change. The board is directly supported in this by the internal audit and risk management team and indirectly by KPMG during the course of their audit of the financial statements.\n\n## People\n\nI would like to thank Brian May for his excellent work and support during my first full year as Chairman. It was announced in May 2021, that after nearly nine years' on the board, Brian would be stepping down at the conclusion of the AGM in July 2021. Doug Webb, whom we welcomed to the board in September 2020, was recruited as an independent non-executive director, to chair both the audit and treasury committees on Brian's departure. Doug brings to the role, as required by the code, 'recent and relevant financial experience'. Given the complexities of the work of both the audit committee, and the treasury committee particularly in terms of the regulatory operating model, it was felt that a handover period between Brian and Doug covering a full audit cycle would be particularly beneficial. Doug will also become a member of the remuneration committee when Brian steps down from the board.\n\nIn September 2020, along with Doug, we welcomed Kath Cates, as a new independent non-executive director. Kath brings a wealth of experience of regulated businesses from her executive career in financial services. Alison Goligher, who has served as a member of the remuneration committee since 2016, accepted the role as chair of the remuneration committee on Sara Weller's departure from the board at the conclusion of the 2020 AGM.\n\nA combination of physical meetings where possible, in conjunction with virtual board and committee meetings, have been held to maintain the integrity of our governance structure.\n\n2021 is the first annual report presented by the board under the tenure of Phil Aspin as CFO. As demonstrated by his biography, Phil has many years' experience in different financial roles within the business, which has undoubtedly facilitated a smooth transition in a challenging year. Phil succeeded Russ Houlden, who retired from his executive responsibilities in July 2020.\n\n## Investors\n\nWe are in regular contact with our large investors through a regular scheduled programme of meetings attended by either our CEO or CFO, or both. The programme is supported by the activities of our investor relations team who are readily available to address investors' queries. I, too, have had the opportunity to engage with a number of our major investors during the year, their feedback was shared with my board colleagues. ESG, and specifically our progress in terms of diversity and inclusion were areas of particular interest. We have sought to respond by better articulation of our ESG activities throughout this annual report, including our efforts toward improving diversity and inclusion both at board level and across the business, and more information can be found on pages 132 and pages 138 respectively.\n\n## Sir David Higgins\n\nChairman\n\n## UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nReporting on the application of principles and against the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard leadership and company purpose\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudit, risk and internal control\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See page 141\n\nRemuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page\n\n162\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See page 117\n- 2 Division of responsibilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See page 129\n- 3 Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 132",

The S172(1) Statement is on page 28.\n\n## Principle B:\n\nThe board should establish the company's purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy itself that these and its culture are aligned. All directors must act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle B - see page 2.  See pages 125 to 126 and 172 for our reporting against provisions 2 and 5.\n\n## Principle C:\n\nThe board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and measure performance against them. The board should also establish a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed.\n\nApplication of principle C to identify the resource within the business is delegated to management, but monitored by the board through the measurement of\n\nperformance. See page 137 regarding our succession pipeline, and page 141 for the board's approach to risk management and internal control.\n\n## Principle D:\n\nIn order for the company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders, the board should ensure effective engagement with, and encourage participation from, these parties.\n\nEngagement of stakeholders fulfilling the application of principle D, and our reporting against provision 3 is set out on pages 127 to 128 in relation to our engagement with shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n## Principle E:\n\nThe board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the company's values and support its long-term sustainable success. The workforce should be able to raise any matters of concern.\n\nOur application of principle E can be demonstrated by our approach to ensuring the safety of our employees during the pandemic (see page 45) and our reporting against provision 6. The board recognises the importance of a two-way flow of communication and the importance of employees having the facilities to raise matters of concern. See page 126 to 127 in relation to engagement with employees for our reporting against provisions 5 and 6.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n- \u00b7 Sets the strategy of the group, ensuring the long-term success of the group for customers, investors and wider stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Is responsible for challenging and encouraging the executive team in its interpretation and implementation of how it manages the business, and that it is doing so in accordance with the strategic goals the board has set.\n- \u00b7 Has responsibility for ensuring the company's internal control systems (including financial, operational and compliance) and processes are sound and fit for purpose (see pages 154 to 155).\n- \u00b7 Must ensure that the company has the necessary financial resources\n\nand people with the necessary skills to achieve its objectives. It reviews managerial performance annually.\n\n- \u00b7 Approves appointments to and removal from the board and membership of the committees.\n- \u00b7 Applies the principles of the code and reports against the provisions.\n- \u00b7 Has oversight of major capital expenditure projects within UUW that exceed \u00a3150 million, and any project which materially increases the group's risk profile or is not in the ordinary course of the group's business.\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference unitedutilities. com/corporate-governance\n\n## Providing great water and more for the North West\n\nThinking about the 'more'\n\nBoard members, individually and collectively, are cognisant of their statutory duties as set out in the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). In accordance with section 172 of the Act, directors are individually required to act in the way they consider, in good faith, would most likely be to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In doing so, the directors must have regard to the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the interests of, among other matters, employees, customers, suppliers, the community and the environment, and on the company's reputation. By virtue of the long-term nature of the water and wastewater industry, thinking about our stakeholders is an integral part of our decision-making process and underpinned by our regulatory contract. The board's 2020/21 S172(1) Statement can be found on page 28.\n\n## Incorporating sustainability in our stewardship\n\nHistorically, a board's success criteria has primarily been judged on the company's financial performance and while this is still fundamental, boards of companies are now encouraged to adopt a more holistic approach to their stewardship. It is the responsibility of the directors to exercise their judgement, balancing the use of the company's resources to ensure its sustainable long-term success, and at times, the requirements and criteria for assessing our success by our different stakeholder groups will be in competition. Sustainability is a key component of the way in which we manage our business. We set out on page 32 how we create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Our board governance ethos, our culture and the way we operate as a business is to behave responsibly towards all our stakeholders.\n\n## Consideration of our AMP7 dividend policy\n\nDuring the year, the board took the time to review the AMP7 Dividend Policy. In light of the extraordinary circumstances, we wanted to ensure we had a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the financial and operational performance of the business and on the impact of the macroeconomic environment. The board consulted investors and advisers to fully understand their expectations and likely market reactions to different scenarios and indeed the implication of the board taking the extra time to formulate its decisions. Taking all factors into account and with a view to the promotion of the longterm sustainable success of the company, the board confirmed the AMP7 dividend policy in the half-year results in November 2020.",

The corporate responsibility committee takes the lead in overseeing management's development of our climate change mitigation strategy, and reports regularly to the board on the matter. Plans are progressing to drive the group's transition to a low carbon future by minimising our contribution to global warming through a reduction in our carbon emissions. Carbon has been incorporated as a factor to be considered in:\n\n- \u00b7 our investment appraisal and decisionmaking processes;\n- \u00b7 our land management practices to enhance/improve natural capital\n- \u00b7 the innovation that we encourage both within our operations and through working with our partners and suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 our implementation of a 'circular' mindset.\n\nThe board is kept fully informed by management on the impacts of climate change from an operational perspective. Extreme weather events impacting our region and our operations in recent years are increasingly common. When such incidents occur, the CEO keeps board members fully apprised of the impact on\n\noperations via conference call and other forms of communication. The board would be informed of any material points of learning identified in the post-incident review process, and progress with the implementation of material actions. Our reporting against TCFD can be found on pages 86 to 99.\n\n## Working with our regulators responding responsibly to the 'green recovery' in our region\n\nAs a business, we are aware of the importance of our financial contribution to the north west economy. The board was keen to respond to the Government's green recovery challenge and play our part, by putting forward a programme of work that we believe is achievable and which will not generate an unnecessary risk for the company. Consideration of our green recovery proposal is included in the statement by the directors in performance of their statutory duties in accordance with S172(1) of the Act set out on page 28.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe recognise that we need fantastic people to enable us to deliver a great service now and to ensure the long-term sustainable success of the business. We have to reach and recruit from every part of our community and to support our employees to achieve their full potential and feel valued and included, regardless of their gender, age, race, disability, sexual orientation or\n\nsocial background. We acknowledge that it will be a challenge to make significant step changes quickly in the workforce with low levels of attrition, regional variations in demographics and difficulties in recruiting females to STEM roles.\n\nWorking with a specialist inclusion partner we have updated our employee diversity and inclusion plan to drive our changes. We plan to set targets for the next 12 months based on the implementation of enabling activities before moving to comprehensive representation targets once we have understood our employee data and we will assess our progress with a further maturity audit.\n\n## Delivering against our regulatory contract\n\nUnder the current regulatory model, we are a monopoly supplier of water and wastewater services to our domestic customers. Simplistically, the opportunities for improving our financial performance are based on outperforming our five-year contract. Underlying this is a complex set of regulatory key performance indicators, including total expenditure (totex) outperformance, the outcome delivery incentive mechanism (ODI), customer measure of experience (C-MeX) and financing expenditure (see pages 50 to 73) which are managed and monitored by the business.",

The governance structure encompassing the board, its principal committees and the principal management committees (and set out in the diagram below) contributes to ensuring that the group focuses on its strategic themes.\n\nIn line with the code, the board delegates certain roles and responsibilities to its principal board committees. While the board retains overall responsibility, a sub-committee structure allows these committees to probe the subject matters more deeply and gain a greater understanding of the detail. The committees then report back to the board on the matters discussed, decisions taken, and, where appropriate, make recommendations\n\nto the board on matters requiring its approval. The reports of the principal board committees required by the code can be found on the subsequent pages. Minutes of the board and principal board committee meetings (with the exception of the remuneration committee) are tabled at board meetings and the chairs of each of the board committees report verbally to the board on their activities. The Chairman chairs the nomination committee; all other principal board committees are chaired by independent non-executive directors who have particular skills or interests in the activities of those committees.\n\nThe executive team is chaired by the CEO, and its members are the senior managers who have a direct reporting line to the CEO. Our executive team meets monthly; it is responsible for the day-to-day running of the business and other operational matters\n\nand implementing the strategies that the\n\nboard has set. Short biographies of the executive team can be found on our website at unitedutilities.com/executive-team. The diagram below shows the principal management committees and a brief description of their roles. These committees are vital to the implementation of the group's strategic themes. These committees enable senior management to meet to understand, delegate the implementation of appropriate actions, and monitor progress and provide challenge as needs be.

A number of other board meetings and telephone conferences were held during the year, as the need arose. The table below shows the number of scheduled meetings attended and the maximum number of scheduled meetings that the directors could have attended. Only in exceptional circumstances would directors not attend board and committee meetings. Similarly, every effort is made to attend ad hoc meetings either in person or via the use of video or telephone conferencing facilities if needs be. None of our non-executive directors has raised concerns over the time commitment required of them to fulfil their duties. Scheduled meetings are normally held face- to-face, but due to the COVID-19 restrictions, meetings were held remotely via audio or video conference.\n\nOn the evening before most scheduled board meetings all the non-executive directors meet either by themselves, or together with just the CEO, or with the entire board and the company secretary, and this time is usefully spent enabling board colleagues to share views and consider issues impacting the company. This year, these informal pre-board meeting sessions have been held virtually, and were felt to be particularly useful for Kath and Doug as part of their familiarisation with the company and provide time for board members to build relationships on a personal level, contributing to better board dynamics and decision-making.\n\nCorporate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                   | Board meetings 1   | Audit committee   | Remuneration committee   | Nomination  committee   | responsibility committee   | Treasury committee   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Sir David Higgins | 8   8              |                   |                          | 5 5                     |                            |                      |\n| Steve Mogford     | 8   8              |                   |                          |                         | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Phil Aspin        | 4   4              |                   |                          |                         |                            | 2 2                  |\n| Mark Clare        | 8   8              |                   | 5 5                      | 5 5                     |                            |                      |\n| Stephen Carter    | 8   8              | 4 4               |                          | 5 5                     | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Kath Cates        | 4 (2) 4            |                   | 3 3                      | 1 1                     |                            |                      |\n| Alison Goligher   | 8   8              |                   | 5 5                      | 5 5                     | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Brian May         | 8   8              | 4 4               | 5 5                      | 5 5                     |                            | 3 3                  |\n| Paulette Rowe     | 8   8              | 4 4               |                          | 4 (3) 5                 |                            |                      |\n| Doug Webb         | 4 (4) 4            | 4 4               |                          | 1 1                     |                            |                      |\n| Russ Houlden      | 4 (5) 4            |                   |                          |                         |                            | 1 (5) 1              |\n| Sara Weller       | 4 (6) 4            |                   | 2 (6) 2                  | 4 (6) 4                 |                            |                      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Meetings attended\n\nPossible meetings\n\n- (1) Actual number of meetings attended/maximum number of scheduled meetings which the directors could have attended during the financial year ended 31 March 2021.\n- (2)  Kath Cates was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2020.\n\n- (6)  Sara Weller stepped down from the board at the AGM in July 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the first instance, the group's treasury activities are overseen by the treasury committee, which operates under terms of reference and delegated authorities approved by the board.\n\nThe chairman of the audit committee, always an independent non-executive director, has historically chaired the treasury committee, given the synergies with the work of the audit committee and the need for financial expertise. Brian May chairs the committee, the other members of the committee are the CFO and the group treasurer, with the company secretary in attendance at committee meetings. Since his appointment, Doug Webb has attended meetings of the committee, with a view to him taking over as chair when Brian steps down from the board in July 2021.\n\nThe committee's work relates to:\n\n- \u00b7 review of the group's treasury policies in relation to: financing; liquidity; hedging of market risks (interest rates; inflation; currency and electricity hedging); financial counterparty credit risk; credit ratings and capital structure;\n- \u00b7 execution of the financing plan and evaluation of funding opportunities;\n- \u00b7 liquidity management and review of forecasts;\n- \u00b7 execution of hedging transactions and programmes in relation to the management of market risks in accordance with treasury policy parameters;\n- \u00b7 developments in relation to the credit ratings agencies;\n- \u00b7 creditor investor relations;\n- \u00b7 banking relationships;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDashboard of culture metrics\n\nExisting reporting structures for discussion\n\nAlignment with purpose, values and strategic themes\n\n- \u00b7 treasury delegated authorities, internal controls and governance; and\n- \u00b7 reporting to the board on matters relating to the group's treasury activities, including board approval of the annual treasury update and associated financing plan and board delegated authorities.\n\nDuring the year, with the board's endorsement, the committee oversaw the successful execution of a funding programme which raised approximately \u00a3900 million of new term funding, with financial market conditions being closely monitored as policymakers responded to prevailing COVID-19 pandemic related uncertainties. This funding programme has positioned the group well with regard to its circa \u00a32.4 billion financing requirement across the AMP7 regulatory period. The committee evaluated the group's long-term financing strategy beyond the current regulatory period.\n\nThe committee reviewed the group's preparations with regard to the transition of benchmark reference rates from GBP LIBOR to replacement 'risk free rates' (with SONIA replacing GBP LIBOR with effect from the end of 2021), and oversaw the group's management of its interest rate and inflation hedging programmes, including further transitioning the mix of the group's inflation hedging to CPI and CPIH from RPI-linked.\n\nFollowing approval by the treasury committee, the group launched its sustainable finance framework in November 2020, and issued its debut sustainable bond in January 2021 (see page 70). Details of the group's engagement with banks and credit investors can be found on page 128.\n\nAlongside the other committees, the members of the treasury committee undertook a self-evaluation in December\n\n2020. The responses, which were reviewed by Independent Audit Limited, indicated that the committee was effective, and its members had appropriate skills and experience.\n\n## Purpose, values and strategy\n\nOur purpose is to provide great water and more for the North West. Our vision is to be the best UK water and wastewater company through providing the best service to customers, at the lowest sustainable cost and in a responsible manner. In setting the company's purpose, the board took into account information and views from stakeholders, utilising much of the research and engagement that contributed to our 2020-25 business plan submission and feedback obtained from customers as part of the company's brand refresh undertaken during 2019/20. For the year ended 31 March 2021, the board is satisfied that the formulation of our aspirations in terms of our purpose, values and culture have been informed by our stakeholders and we operate our business in such a way that will create long-term value for all.\n\nOur values demonstrate how we behave individually and collectively as the board and how we ask our employees to behave. Our employees are fundamental to delivering our strategy and achieving our purpose. Our values of being customer focused, trustworthy and innovative underpin our culture of behaving as a responsible business in the way we interact with all the stakeholders we serve. We must continually reinforce these values so that the right behaviours cascade throughout the organisation, ensuring our culture of behaving responsibly drives what we do. Key to this is taking action to address any issues where there is\n\nIn addition to the existing reporting, management has developed a dashboard of culture metrics in accordance with the Denison Culture Model, providing a comprehensive overview to support the board in fulfilling its role in monitoring and assessing culture. The dashboard comprises relevant metrics derived from: the annual employee engagement survey; human resources policies in relation to diversity and associated training; whistleblowing reporting; health, safety and wellbeing policies and practices; and other key performance indicators relating to how we behave as a responsible business.\n\nThere are a number of existing reporting structures that allow these cultural indicators to be measured, discussed and challenged by the board and its committees.\n\nThe board was satisfied that policies, practices and behaviours within the business were aligned with the company's purpose, values and strategic themes.",

The panel enhanced the underlying anonymity of the survey for employees and provided more opportunities to provide free text comments. Survey questions were updated to reflect key topics, including: wellbeing; inclusivity; and working differently;\n- \u00b7 additional administrative and communications resource made available for network groups and executive sponsors identified; and\n- \u00b7 panel members sought colleagues' views to contribute to the 'next ways of working' project, the 'home safe and well' project and the 'diversity and inclusion' audit.\n\nU\n\nn\n\ni\n\nt\n\ne\n\nd U\n\nt\n\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\nt\n\ni\n\ne\n\ns G\n\nr\n\no\n\nu\n\np P\n\nL\n\nC\n\nunit\n\ned\n\nutilities.\n\nc\n\nom/\n\nc\n\norporat\n\ne\n\nmisalignment with the company's culture. As well as our engagement survey we run regular employee barometers to ask employees what they are seeing, hearing and feeling. This approach allows us to act quickly if there are any areas of misalignment and take immediate action.\n\n## Culture and employee engagement\n\nOur employees are at the heart of the culture of our business and further insight and evidence, as part of the board's assessment and monitoring of culture, has been gathered, and fed back to the board by Alison Goligher, the current designated non-executive director for engagement with the workforce.\n\n## Employee Voice panel\n\n## The board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Voice panel Chair: Alison Goligher (non-executive director)\n\nEmployee champion groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Health, safety and wellbeing champions\n- \u00b7 Engagement champions\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement group\n\n## Employee networks groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Multicultural\n- \u00b7 GENEq\n- \u00b7 Armed Forces\n- \u00b7 LGBT Identity+\n- \u00b7 Ability\n- \u00b7 Career development forums\n\nMembers of the panel rotate approximately every two years. There is an open invitation to all board members to attend meetings of the panel. When the panel was established, the intention was to hold physical meetings, rotating around different operational and office locations, in order to encourage participation and enable colleagues to get a different perspective on working for the company; and enabling Alison to have first-hand experience of different company sites and gain a view of the company at 'grass-roots' level. However, due to the pandemic, all four meetings were held virtually. This did prove to be particularly beneficial to colleagues in operational roles, who found it much easier to attend panel meetings. Terms of reference were agreed when the panel was established along with the way in which the panel would operate. Such mechanisms will be reviewed in due course, particularly in relation to whether meetings will be held virtually.\n\nSub-groups, made up of panel members, have focused on specific aspects of the business, including cross-networks, culture and the employee engagement survey, providing updates at each meeting. The culture sub-group has focused its energies\n\nEarly careers and managers:\n\n- \u00b7 The Early Careers Board\n- \u00b7 Aspiring managers\n- \u00b7 Apprentices\n- \u00b7 Graduates\n- \u00b7 Bands 3 and 4 managers\n\non obtaining a grass-roots view of changes to ways of working during the pandemic and contributing to the 'next ways of working' project and on the discussion of topical issues relating to culture, such as the focus on racial inequality. As part of the two-way communication, Alison provides updates to the panel from the perspective of the board and the corporate responsibility committee and she similarly provides feedback to the board and the committee on the work of the panel.\n\n## Listening to our employees\n\nEmployees' views are measured annually through the employee engagement survey with the objective of taking any required action to improve how permanent employees feel about the company and understand its direction. Employees are provided with information through briefings and access to online materials, to enable them to understand the financial and economic factors affecting the group's performance. Along with our employee relations team, our CEO holds regular face-to-face meetings with senior trade union representatives to facilitate two-way communication and engagement with the views of employees' representatives.\n\nAlison chairs the Employee Voice panel (the panel) formed from representatives of a number of employee groups and employee networks from within the business and with representatives drawn from across the geographical region. Alison has met the panel virtually four times throughout the year, it was recognised that the panel needed to meet more frequently during such a challenging period.\n\nUnion partners:\n\n- \u00b7 UNISON\n- \u00b7 Unite\n- \u00b7 GMB\n- \u00b7 Prospect",

        "page_content": "The group has a commercial arrangement with a third party for the provision of agency staff and contractors. Engagement and communication in relation to their work with the group for these members of the wider workforce is managed directly by the third party via a dedicated third party account manager who liaises directly with the company's human resources team. If there is any significant change activity, a representative of the third party joins the project team, thereby ensuring consistency when communicating key information to employees, agency staff and contractors.\n\nDuring the year, a virtual all employee engagement day was held which was very well received by those who attended.\n\nSet out on page 34 is the company's approach to our engagement with and creating value for employees, with health, safety and well-being a priority. Furthermore, an explanation of the company's approach to rewarding the workforce can be found in the report of the remuneration committee on page 172.\n\n## Whistleblowing policy\n\nThe following sets out the company's compliance with code provision 6.\n\nAs part of our two-way communication the board has responsibility for reviewing the group's arrangements for individuals to raise matters of concern and the arrangements for the investigation of such matters. The group's whistleblowing policy (the policy) supports the culture within the group where genuine concerns may be reported and investigated without reprisals for whistleblowers. A confidential telephone helpline and a web portal are available to enable employees (including agency workers and contractors) to raise matters of concern in relation to possible incidents of fraud, dishonesty, corruption, theft, security and bribery. Furthermore, employees are encouraged to raise any matters relating to health and safety and any activities of the business that have caused or may cause damage to the environment, such as pollution or other contamination. Both the helpline and web portal are operated by a third party, enabling any concerns to be reported anonymously. The policy states that no employee will be victimised for raising a matter in accordance with the policy. Matters raised with the helpline/portal are in the first instance raised with the relevant director and investigated by senior managers independent of any involvement of the issues being considered. Details of the findings of the investigation and proposed solution are considered by the  whistleblowing committee (whose membership comprises the company secretary, customer services and people director, head of internal audit and commercial director) and which meets\n\nquarterly. The board routinely reviews matters considered by the whistleblowing committee, the outcome of the investigation and the ways in which the matters were brought to a conclusion, thus ensuring that the core value of integrity is upheld and fostering an environment where employees feel it is 'safe to speak up' and to do so without fear of reprisal.\n\n## Board engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders\n\nThe board as a whole accepts its responsibility for engaging with shareholders and is kept fully informed about information in the marketplace through the following channels:\n\n- \u00b7 The investor relations adviser produces an annual survey of investors' views and perceptions about United Utilities, the results of which are presented and discussed by the board;\n- \u00b7 The board receives regular updates and feedback on investor meetings involving the CEO, CFO and/or investor relations team and reports from sector analysts to ensure that the board maintains an understanding of investors' priorities; and\n- \u00b7 The executive and non-executive directors are available to meet with major shareholders and institutional investors. When revising the directors' remuneration policy, the chair of the remuneration committee invited engagement from the company's major shareholders. Feedback from any such engagement would be shared with all board members.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nAs well as current investors, we engage actively with institutional investors who do not currently hold shares in United Utilities, as we are keen to ensure our business is well understood across the investment community, and to hear and discuss the views of all investors.\n\nWe have an active investor relations programme, which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 An invitation to major shareholders to meet with the Chairman;\n- \u00b7 A regular schedule of meetings between the CEO and CFO and representatives from our major shareholders, supplemented with meetings hosted by our investor relations team;\n- \u00b7 Presentations by the CEO and CFO to groups of institutional investors, both on an ad hoc basis and linked to our half and full-year results announcements and at our 'Capital Markets Days';\n\n## INVESTOR DIALOGUE WITH THE CHAIRMAN\n\nDuring the year the Chairman met virtually with representatives from a number of institutional investors. Common themes from these discussions were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 encouraged by the group's early adoption of TCFD disclosures, updates sought on the outcome of science-based target setting to deliver carbon pledges to net zero by 2030;\n- \u00b7 making progress on diversity and inclusion within the business\n- \u00b7 board succession; and\n- \u00b7 comparisons with the group's listed peers.\n- \u00b7 The programme covers a range of major global financial centres, typically including the UK, Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region;\n- \u00b7 Regular feedback is provided to the board on the views of our institutional investors following these meetings; and\n- \u00b7 Close contact is maintained between the investor relations team and a range of City analysts that conduct research on United Utilities.\n\nIn 2020/21, all our investor relations activities were conducted virtually. We met or offered to meet with 81 per cent (2019/20: 82 per cent), by value, of the active targetable institutional shareholder base (after adjusting for shareholders who do not typically meet with companies, such as indexed funds).\n\nFrequent areas of common interest arising in meetings with investors include operational and environmental performance, customer service, capital investment, efficiency initiatives, regulatory performance, regulatory changes and ESG matters. Investors are always keen to observe financial stability and are interested in: the level of gearing versus regulatory assumptions; cost of finance; our debt portfolio and debt maturity profile; future financing requirements; and dividends. Investors are keen to understand how the company is performing relative to the price review allowances and targets each year, along with the potential implications of regulatory change.",

We have historically held our AGM in our region in Manchester, which enables our more local shareholders, many of whom are customers, to attend the meeting. A resolution is being proposed to shareholders at the 2021 AGM to amend the articles of association to allow for 'hybrid' general meetings to be held. There is a considerable amount of information on our website, which provides information on our key social and environmental impacts and performance during the year. Together with the annual and half-yearly results announcements, our annual report and financial statements are also available on our website; these are the principal ways by which we communicate with our retail shareholders. Our company secretariat and investor relations teams, along with our registrar, Equiniti, are on hand to help our retail shareholders with any queries. Information for shareholders can also be found on the inside back cover of this document, with a number of useful website addresses.\n\n## Other stakeholders\n\nThe board has direct contact with other stakeholder representatives, including: Ofwat and YourVoice (the independent customer challenge group). The chair of YourVoice regularly attends parts of UUW board meetings to provide an opportunity for discussion, in-depth customer insight and the sharing of views.\n\nPrior to the AGM in 2019, Sara Weller, the then chair of the remuneration committee, consulted with shareholders, in relation to the revised directors' remuneration policy, which was proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2019 AGM and which was approved by 99.41 per cent of the votes cast.\n\nEngagement with representatives of all our stakeholder groups occurs widely across many aspects of the business, and more information can be found on pages 24 to 26.\n\nFurther information on stakeholder engagement can be found in the report of the corporate responsibility committee on page 156 and in the measures reported on pages 52 to 76.\n\n## Outcome of 2020 AGM\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, votes were cast in relation to approximately 69 per cent of the issued share capital (2019: 67 per cent; 2018: 65 per cent). All 18 resolutions proposed by the board were passed by the required majority; there were no significant votes cast against the board's recommendations.\n\nVotes cast in favour of the reappointment of the board directors were as follows:\n\n| Sir David Higgins   | 98.64%   | Alison Goligher   | 98.90%   |\n|---------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|\n| Steve Mogford       | 99.84%   | Brian May         | 99.03%   |\n| Mark Clare          | 99.03%   | Paulette Rowe     | 99.23%   |\n| Stephen Carter      | 99.09%   |                   |          |\n\n## Relations with banks and credit investors\n\nRunning a water and wastewater business, by its very nature, requires a long-term outlook. Our regulatory cycle is based on five-year periods, and we raise funding to build and improve our water and wastewater treatment works and associated network of pipes for each five-year cycle and beyond. We are heavily reliant on successfully raising long-term funding from banks and credit investors to fund our capital investment programme and refinance upcoming debt maturities.\n\nThis requires long-term support from our credit investors who invest in the company by making term funding available in return for receiving interest on their investment and repayment of principal on maturity of the loans or bonds. We arrange term debt finance in the debt capital markets (with maturities typically ranging from seven years to up to 50 years at issue). Debt finance is primarily raised via the group's London listed multi-issuer Euro Medium Term Note Programme, which gives us access to the sterling and euro public bond markets and privately arranged note issues. Committed credit facilities are arranged with our relationship banks on a bilateral basis. Additionally, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is the financing arm of the European Union (EU), remains a significant lender to United Utilities Water, currently providing around \u00a31.1 billion of loan funding supporting past capital investment programmes.\n\nGiven that the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, we are unlikely to obtain future funding from the EIB under its existing mandate, with our existing loan portfolio with the EIB entering into 'run-off' in line with the scheduled maturities of each loan. A greater proportion of the group's term finance is therefore likely to come from the\n\ndebt capital markets, and during the year the group raised a total of \u00a3725 million of term funding in the sterling public bond market, including our first sustainable bond of \u00a3300 million with a maturity date of October 2029, and paying a coupon of 0.875 per cent. The bond was issued under the group's sustainable finance framework established in November 2020.\n\nThe group currently has gross borrowings of circa \u00a38,452 million. Given the importance of debt funding to our group, we have an active credit investor programme coordinated by our group treasury team, which provides a first point of contact for credit investors' queries and maintains a dedicated area of the company's website. One-to-one meetings are held with credit investors through a programme aimed at the major European fund managers known to invest in corporate bonds that may be existing holders of the group's debt or potential holders. Regular mailings of company information are sent to keep credit investors informed of significant events. The treasury team has regular dialogue with the group's relationship banks and the EIB and the credit rating agencies. More information can be found on our website at unitedutilities.com/corporate/ investors/credit-investors\n\nRating agency services continue to be provided to the group by Moody's Investors Service Limited, Fitch Ratings Ltd and S&P Ratings UK Limited under contracts signed at the beginning of 2020 for an initial threeyear term. Debt capital markets issuance by the group has therefore been made on a solicited basis by all three rating agencies during the 2020/21 financial year.",

They should demonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and promote a culture of openness and debate. In addition, the chair facilitates constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all nonexecutive directors, and ensure that directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.\n\nThe external board evaluation (see page 135) tested and confirmed the Chairman's application of principle F. Sir David was independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in provision 10, his biography is on page 112.\n\n## Principle G:\n\nThe board should include an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive (and, in particular, independent non-executive) directors, such that no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the board's decision-making. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and the executive leadership of the company's business.\n\nThe external board evaluation (see page 135) tested and confirmed the application of principle G, concluding that the skills and experience of executive and independent non-executives were appropriate with the board working together as a cohesive unit, but maintaining the clear division of responsibility between the board and the\n\n## Chairman of the board\n\nThe role and behaviour of the Chairman is fundamental to the effective operation and decision-making of the board and in creating an atmosphere where open and frank discussion is facilitated and encouraged.

See pages 112 to 115 for our reporting against provision 10; and the governance structure of the board and its principal committees on page 120.\n\n## Principle H:\n\nNon-executive directors should have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. They should provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management to account.\n\nAs part of the annual review of conflicts of interest, the board was satisfied that, after taking into account the other commitments of directors, board members have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities and principle H had been applied (see page 129). The board demonstrated constructive challenge and offered strategic guidance and advice to management in relation to the review of the AMP7 dividend policy (see page 28), and the appropriate time period applicable to the company's long-term viability statement (see page 142).\n\n## Principle I:\n\nThe board, supported by the company secretary, should ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs in order to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nThe external board evaluation tested and confirmed the application of principle I, the views of board members was sought on whether the necessary support and information was provided effectively and efficiently, see page 135.\n\nIt is the role of the Chairman, supported by the company secretary, to drive forward the business agenda of board meetings to ensure that the board is kept abreast of the regulatory drivers and strategic needs of the business.\n\nIt is the role of the Chairman, supported by the company secretary, to ensure that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The Chairman and company secretary hold regular meetings to discuss agenda items and board materials. Board\n\npacks are distributed electronically five days before the meeting. Ensuring board materials are of an appropriate length, on what can be particularly complex and technical issues, is a constant challenge.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and time commitment\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with provision 7.\n\nThe company's articles of association contain provisions which permit unconflicted directors to authorise conflict situations. Each director is required to notify the Chairman of any potential conflict or potential new appointment or directorship. Additionally, the board reviews the position of each director annually. No changes were recorded that would impact the independence of any of the directors. No conflicts of interest had arisen during the year.\n\nThe board does not specify the precise time commitment it requires from its non-executive directors in taking on the role as they are expected to fulfil it and manage their diaries accordingly. The board is content that none of its directors is overcommitted and unable to fulfil their responsibilities as a board director for United Utilities. Each individual's circumstances are different, as is their ability to take on the responsibilities of a non-executive directorship role. Should a director be unable to attend meetings on a regular basis, not be preparing appropriately or not contributing appropriately to board discussions, the Chairman would be responsible for discussing the matter with them and agreeing a course of action.\n\nDuring the year, permission was sought from the board to take on additional nonexecutive responsibilities by: Brian May appointed as a non-executive director at Ferguson plc; Mark Clare appointed as a non-executive director and chairman designate at Aggreko plc and as a nonexecutive director of Wickes Group plc; Alison Goligher as a non-executive director of Technip Energies NV and Kath Cates as a non-executive director of TP ICAP Group Plc.\n\nExecutive directors are not normally allowed to take on more than one non-executive position, a non-executive role is considered to be beneficial from a developmental perspective. In March 2021, although not a statutory directorship, Phil Aspin accepted a position on the UK Accounting Standards Endorsement Board (UKEB).",

We endeavoured to ensure a smooth induction (see page 134), albeit virtually, for our new independent non-executive colleagues Kath Cates and Doug Webb, both of whom joined the board in September 2020.\n\nThe nomination committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of the board succession plan, which addresses both contingency planning needs and requirements in the short to medium term, and incorporates a reasonable degree of certainty on timescales for key board\n\n- \u00b7 The company secretary attends all meetings of the committee.\n- \u00b7 The customer services and people director has responsibility for human resources, she regularly attends meetings and is responsible for engaging with executive search recruitment advisers.\n- \u00b7 The CEO is not a member of the committee, but from time to time is invited to attend.

The committee's role is to ensure that the board and senior management have the appropriate balance of skills and experience to support the group's strategic objectives and that any developmental needs are met. Board members and senior managers need to be in tune with the culture of the company and be supportive of the company's ESG credentials which are embedded in the way the business is operated and will be ever more important.\n\nHistorically, independent non-executive directors at United Utilities have served a term of between seven and nine years; a pattern that has facilitated the refreshing of the board in recent years almost on an annual basis, along with ensuring a high degree of continuity. Notwithstanding this, the specifics of each of the nonexecutive directors' time of departure have been driven by their own personal circumstances. Serving beyond a nine-year term is identified in the code as being one of the reasons that could affect a nonexecutive director's independence. For this reason, we say a fond farewell to Brian May, the chair of audit committee, at the annual general meeting. In accordance with our succession plans, Brian will be succeeded in this important board position by Doug Webb, whom the board is satisfied as having recent and relevant financial expertise. Two-thirds of board members are independent non-executive directors, fulfilling provisions 10 and 11 of the code. Biographies of board directors can be found on pages 112 to 115.\n\nDiversity and inclusion is high on the board agenda with the board's focus on the matter both across the entire workforce, and in terms of the board's own members. The board diversity policy (see page 133) is taken into account during every candidate selection process. Ultimately, we do strive to appoint the person we believe is best matched to the role in terms of what they have to offer the company and to make a positive contribution to the board conversation and board dynamics. Diversity in its broadest sense and in terms of outlook and interest is essential to ensuring we have a variety of views to contribute to discussions and the decision-making process. The board is committed to ethnic diversity, and its membership is in line with the board diversity policy, reflecting the recommendations of the Parker Review Committee, that there should be at least one director of non-white ethnicity by 2021.\n\nThe annual board and committee evaluation (see page 135) was externally facilitated in December 2020/January 2021 by Independent Audit Limited.",

Information on the company's approach to diversity and inclusion is set out on pages 138 to 140.\n\n## Principle K:\n\nThe board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to the length of service of the board as a whole and membership regularly refreshed.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle K. Biographies of the board can be found on pages 112 to 115. An overview of directors' areas of expertise is set out in the skills matrix on page 133 and the length of service of board members on page 131. Board biographies include our reporting against provision 18.\n\n## Principle L:\n\nAnnual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate whether each director continues to contribute effectively.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle L. Details of the board evaluation and disclosure against provision 23 can be found on pages 116 and 135.\n\n## What has been on the committee's agenda during the year?\n\n## Board succession\n\nIn line with the board succession plan, and the approximate timescales therein, the process of the appointment of Kath Cates was undertaken to fill the vacancy when Sara Weller stepped down from the board at the end of the 2020 AGM. Doug Webb was recruited with the knowledge that Brian May was approaching nine years' service on the board. The committee is supported during any recruitment process by the customer services and people director, Louise Beardmore, as part of her human resources responsibilities. The executive search firm Lygon Group were engaged as part of the recruitment process.\n\nThe succession planning matrix tool and skills matrix (see opposite) for board directors is used to support the planning process for board appointments. The succession planning matrix highlights the code governance requirements; existing directors' terms of appointment and a forecast/anticipated time frame when an individual might leave the business; the projected strategic needs of the business and resulting preferred experience of any potential new board member; existing potential internal successors to a role (where identified) and those who could act as an interim should the need arise. A candidate suitable for the role of CEO would need to demonstrate that their management approach would fit with the company's culture of behaving responsibly.\n\nThe committee would seek to consult with the incumbent CEO, given his unique knowledge and perspective of the group, on his view of the needs of the business going forward. Neither the Chairman nor the CEO would be involved in the appointment process of their successor.\n\nOther than providing executive search services on previous occasions Lygon Group have no other connection with the company.\n\n## Membership of the principal board committees\n\nAlison Goligher took over the role as chair of the remuneration committee when Sara Weller left the board in July 2020, Alison had served as a member of the committee since 2016 and chairs the remuneration committee at Meggitt plc. On appointment, Kath Cates joined the remuneration committee, bringing her experience from her existing non-executive appointments. Doug Webb was appointed with a view to taking over as chair of the audit committee and treasury committee when Brian steps down at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM, at which point Doug will also replace Brian on the remuneration committee.\n\nThe board is satisfied that the membership of the audit committee is in accordance with provision 24, and that the membership of the remuneration committee is in accordance with provision 32.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe board diversity policy is to 'ensure the selection process for board appointments provides access to a range of candidates. Any appointments will be made on the basis of merit and objective criteria, and within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, but with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender diversity.' The objective of the policy is for new directors to bring something different to the board table, be it in terms of experience, skills, perspective, interests or other attributes. As referred to above, our board diversity policy would be brought to the attention of any executive search firm used as part of the selection and appointment process for a board position. Feedback would be sought from the search firm in terms of their success in attracting potential candidates in terms of their diversity of attributes. Feedback would also be gathered first hand through the interview process with candidates conducted by other board members and taken into consideration in identifying those suitable for the role in question. As a board, the benefits of diversity and associated benefits to the decision-making process",

When Brian May steps down from the board at the annual general meeting, the measurable targets of 33 per cent female representation on the board and one director of non-white ethnicity will be met. On the board at 31 March 2021, female representation was 30 per cent and BAME was representation 10 per cent. Amongst the workforce BAME representation was 2.5 per cent (15 per cent choose not to disclose) and 9.2 per cent* (*Office for National Statistics, Regional Ethnic Diversity, August 2020) as a comparator, across our region. We recognise the benefits of diversity across our business with initiatives in place to support women in the workplace and tackle the ethnic imbalance of our workforce, thereby aligning with our strategic theme of operating our business in a responsible manner (see page 17).\n\nSkills matrix of board directors\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nSummary of board diversity policy\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure the selection process for board appointments provides access to a range of candidates. Any such appointments will be made on the basis of merit and objective criteria, and within this context should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the policies adopted by the group will promote diversity in the broadest sense among senior managers who will in turn aspire to a board position.\n- \u00b7 In selecting candidates for board positions, only use the services of executive search firms who have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct for executive search firms as recommended by the Davies Report.\n- \u00b7 Adopt measurable objectives from time to time for achieving gender diversity at board level, which shall be to maintain at least 25 per cent, and aspire to 33 per cent, female representation by 2020, and to have at least one director of non-white ethnicity by 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                | Sir David  Higgins   | Steve  Mogford   | Phil   Aspin   | Mark  Clare   | Stephen Carter   | Alison   Goligher   | Brian  May   | Paulette  Rowe   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Finance/accounting             |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Utilities                      |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Regulation                     |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Government                     |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Construction/ engineering      |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Customer-facing                |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| FTSE companies                 |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Digital/Technology             |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| ESG                            |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Current CEO/CFO  of FTSE 350 * |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n| Former CEO/CFO  of FTSE 350    |                      |                  |                |               |                  |                     |              |                  |\n\n- * Excludes UU",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of the effectiveness of the board, board committees and individual directors\n\nOur board evaluation was conducted by Independent Audit Limited (IAL) who were engaged after a competitive tender process; this was the first review undertaken by IAL. Bids were received from six bidders. The tender process was conducted by the company secretary, head of legal and deputy secretary. Prior to this, an external evaluation was last conducted in 2018. In the intervening years the evaluation was facilitated by the company secretary and his team. IAL does not have any other connection with the group. IAL reviewed the accuracy of the content set out in relation to their work.\n\nA summary of IAL's 2020/21 review of responses to the board self-assessment questionnaire is set out below:\n\n| 2020/21 areas of assessment   | Commentary and actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overview                      | IAL found the responses to be, on the whole, very positive. They recommended that the board should  continually challenge itself to ensure it maintained consistency in the areas that were felt to be working  particularly well. The review of responses identified a broad mix of skills, experience, personalities  and diversity in the board composition which should continue to be an aspiration for future board  appointments.                                                                                                            |\n| Board fundamentals            | The review of responses indicated board members felt there was an appropriate mix of skills and  experience with members drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds. The mix of personalities helped  to encourage diversity of thinking. There was a constructive relationship between the non-executive  directors and the executive directors and management team, of which there was good visibility at  board level.                                                                                                                            |\n| Strategy                      | Responses indicated there was a clear understanding of the strategic goals for the core business  and with good visibility of both short and long-term strategy, although it was felt that a better  understanding of the sustainable aspects of strategy was needed. Oversight of the financial  performance of the business was felt to be good. Greater visibility of the people skills, characteristics  and diversity for the future needs of the business was an area to be addressed along with that of  enhancing the oversight of culture. |\n| Managing risk                 | Responses indicated that risk was considered to be well managed and the board had a clear overview  of the principal risks. More opportunity for the discussion of IT risk was cited along with other  emerging risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Support and information       | Respondents felt meetings were well chaired and the board arrangements and administration provided  by the company secretary and his team were effective. On the whole, papers were considered to be  well structured, although better signposting of key issues on more complex topics would be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Committees                    | \u00b7  Overview: responses suggest that committees were well chaired and supported. Agendas were  focused and members were provided with appropriate information. Members had the right skills to  debate issues and provide challenge to management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Committees                    | \u00b7  Audit committee: questionnaire responses indicated that members agreed that the reporting  environment was satisfactory and oversight of internal and external audit was appropriate. Some  respondents indicated the need for better insight on how the key risk and control functions  operated together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Committees                    | \u00b7  Remuneration committee: questionnaire responses indicated that the committee was working well  and the focus of the committee's agenda was appropriate. The committee should consider the  employee's perspective on how remuneration and wider policies align with the values and impact  on culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Committees                    | \u00b7  Nomination committee: respondents agreed there to be a good level of debate and discussion. A  revised skills planning matrix was developed during the year which would aid future non-executive  succession planning. It was suggested that the executive succession pipeline would benefit from a  more structured approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Committees                    | \u00b7  Corporate responsibility committee: given the broad range of ESG activities, respondents felt the  committee should focus on the areas where it could add greater value to the debate and more  feedback should be sought from the board on the committee's activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Individual directors          | IAL reviewed the responses from the questionnaires completed by each director assessing their own  effectiveness and that of the evaluation of the Chairman.

Thereafter a further session was held with IAL who drafted self-assessment questionnaires, which were then shared with the Chairman, committee chairs and company secretary for feedback. Final versions were then issued to board members and the regular committee attendees via IAL's bespoke online platform, Thinking Board\u00ae, in December 2020. The respondents' views were analysed and the reports shared with the Chairman, committee chairs and company secretary and then formally presented at the February 2021 board meeting and respective committee meetings. IAL attended the board strategy day held virtually in November 2020 to observe the board in action. They reviewed the papers for the strategy day along with a more standard set of board papers to assess the quality of materials being provided to the board.\n\n## Part 2\n\nThe evaluation of the effectiveness of individual directors followed in January 2021. Following discussion with the Chairman and company secretary, IAL drafted questionnaires to enable individual director self-assessment. The senior independent director (SID) agreed the form of the questionnaire to assess the effectiveness of the Chairman and a copy of the questionnaire was shared with the Chairman. Questionnaires were again distributed via IAL's online platform, Thinking Board\u00ae, and the results analysed by IAL. A report based on responses to the questionnaire on the effectiveness of the Chairman was sent to the SID, who then discussed the outcome with the other non-executive directors and provided feedback to the Chairman. IAL's report based on the responses from the individual directors was provided to the Chairman who subsequently provided feedback to each of the individual directors.\n\n## Ongoing board development and training\n\nBoard directors regularly receive updates to improve their understanding and knowledge about the business and, in particular, its regulatory environment. As part of the individual director's element of the board evaluation exercise, directors are asked to identify any skills or knowledge gaps they would like to address. Directors made a number of suggestions, as set out above.\n\nConsideration of ESG issues are fundamental to the way in which we operate as a responsible business at United Utilities; such matters are central to board discussions (see the summary of board activity on pages 121 to 123 and the report of the corporate responsibility committee on pages 156 to 159). The board's approach to these matters is reflected in our strategic themes, and our corporate culture of behaving in a responsible manner as reflected throughout the strategic report. Through presentations and discussions with representatives of YourVoice, the independent customer challenge group, whose role is predicated on protecting customer interests in how the group goes about its business, the board is kept informed of customer, in-region environmental affairs and social matters.\n\nIn addition to this less formal approach to board development, during the year the board received briefings from both Slaughter and May (legal and governance matters) and KPMG (governance changes relating to reporting requirements), along with a number of other advisers. Nonexecutive directors completed in-house online training courses on the Competition Act and the Bribery Act. A number of board members attended events organised by Ofwat for non-executive directors.\n\nOur non-executive directors are conscious of the need to keep themselves properly briefed and informed about current issues and to deepen their understanding of the",

        "page_content": "business. During the year, Alison Goligher has again chaired the Employee Voice panel as part of the ongoing work to ensure the board has a direct link to understand the views of employees (see page 126) of the business. Paulette Rowe has contributed to the work on diversity and inclusion (see page 138).\n\n## Induction of new non-executive directors\n\nAn induction programme is arranged for new non-executive directors. The programme for Kath Cates and Doug Webb is set out on page 134. In addition, virtual one-to-one meetings with the Chairman and each of the existing non-executive directors were held. Furthermore, oneto-one meetings were held with the CEO. Ordinarily, on joining the board, nonexecutive directors would meet members of the operational teams and visit some of the key operational sites and capital projects to ensure they get a first-hand understanding of the water and wastewater business. New directors receive a briefing on the key duties of being a director of a regulated water company, including the role of the regulated company's holding company. They are required to meet with representatives of Ofwat prior to appointment.\n\n## Wider succession pipeline and talent management\n\nFor a number of years, we have had a written succession plan for our executive directors and other members of the executive team, which includes outline timescales. The plan identifies an interim internal successor to fill a role in the short term should the need arise, and the longerterm development needs of potential successors to be able to fulfil a role on a more permanent basis. As with all our board appointments, we would always aim to appoint the best person to fulfil a role. It would be common, when recruiting for a senior role, for an external search to be conducted alongside an internal candidate recruitment process.\n\nAny changes that are required to the profile of the management team to reflect the changing needs of the business are considered by the board in the executive succession plan. Succession and development initiatives for senior executives include executive mentoring and coaching and/or participating in an executive business school programme, as appropriate. Leadership development centres have been delivered to identify and validate potential for future director and senior leader positions and develop a number of role-ready diverse candidates to provide the group with leadership capacity in an increasingly complex environment. Senior managers are encouraged to take\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non a non-executive directorship role as part of their personal development, but it is recognised that this is very much a personal commitment for each individual. Along with the wider employee population, we continue to work towards improving the diversity of our succession pipeline as part of our ongoing diversity and inclusion plans.\n\nFifty per cent of our executive team (excluding the CEO and CFO) is made up of women, and as yet there is no ethnic diversity among the team. The gender balance of the direct reports of the executive team is 65 per cent male and 35 per cent female, BAME representation is 1.5 per cent. We are keen to develop our succession pipeline of female senior managers so that, over time, they can be considered for executive board appointments or as potential candidates for non-executive directorships in other companies. Our current talent programme at a senior level is well embedded and we believe a non-executive appointment for senior managers provides an excellent\n\nopportunity for both personal and career development. It is a way of gaining valuable experience that may be applied at United Utilities so long as no conflicts of interest occur. Our graduate and apprentice programmes are thriving and we are focusing more effectively on middle/junior management succession. Our gender pay data can be found on page 139. Historically, our industry has been male dominated, but we have measures in place to increase diversity in broad terms, including gender among our employees. During the year, board directors have a number of opportunities to meet with members of the executive team, both formally when senior managers are required to present at board meetings on matters related to their responsibilities, and on more informal occasions. From time to time, board members have the opportunity to attend events and meet with members of the apprentice and graduate population and other employees identified as potential talent within the business.",

Our stakeholders would expect this and it is more relevant than ever before. We need fantastic people to enable us to deliver a great public service now and into the future, so we are determined to make sure we are reaching and recruiting from every community and supporting employees to achieve their full potential and feel valued and included.\n\n## Our inclusion plan\n\nWorking with a specialist inclusion partner, The Clear Company, we have focused our approach in 2020/21 on five key programmes:\n\n- \u00b7 Leadership development, ensuring managers understand and embrace our inclusion strategy;\n- \u00b7 Encouraging openness to enable us to understand more about our employees to improve the support and services we offer to them;\n- \u00b7 Enhancing our processes and policies to attract and develop diverse talent and remove bias throughout our employee population;\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing awareness of diversity and inclusion through education, debate and discussion; and\n- \u00b7 Facilitating inclusion through encouraging and supporting our active employee networks.\n\nLouise Beardmore, our customer services and people director, sponsors the overall diversity and inclusion plan and tracks its progress against activity-based targets with the executive team. A further maturity audit will be completed in the next 12 months to independently assess progress and inform representation targets.\n\nIn 2021 we were the highest placed water company for our diversity efforts in the Diversity Leaders ranking.\n\n## Ethnicity\n\nWith 2.5 per cent of our workforce identifying as BAME (15 per cent choose not to disclose ethnicity), attracting a future pipeline of talent from across multicultural backgrounds remains a priority.\n\nIn the North West where we operate, BAME representation is 9.2 per cent* (*Office for National Statistics, Regional Ethnic Diversity, August 2020) and there is considerable variability area by area. Fifty-five per cent of permanent roles recruited during 2020/21 were at our biggest employment hub in Warrington in Cheshire, where BAME representation in the area is 2.7 per cent.\n\nIn 2020, we trialled a bespoke approach as part of our apprentice campaign with a specialist diversity recruitment provider. By ring fencing a number of the roles, we were able to target under-represented groups and successfully increase the 2020 intake to include 18 per cent ethnic minority, a 12 per cent increase since the 2019 programme. We adapted our selection processes for this year's graduate programme and increased ethnic minority representation to 21 per cent, a 15 per cent increase since 2019.\n\nWe have become a patron member of the BAME Apprentice Alliance and have an active Multicultural Network which supports colleagues and educates the wider workforce on cultural differences by providing insight and stories from a range of cultural backgrounds.\n\n## Gender\n\nThroughout 2020/21, our workforce profile remained quite static at 66 per cent male and 34 per cent female. This is primarily driven by the limited number of females with the relevant skills available in the market and the legacy of a traditional maleorientated bias in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) careers. Women made up circa 24 per cent of the UK workforce employed in core STEMrelated jobs in 2020 (WISE campaign summary of Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey Data).\n\nWe have focused on creating a strong pipeline of female candidates for future roles, forming strategic recruitment partnerships to source external talent alongside a range of internal programmes. A new Female Pipeline Talent programme was launched in 2020, supporting progression through cross-company mentoring schemes and targeted future progression. We actively encourage all employees to join our award-winning GENEq gender equality network which continues to provide insight, education and support for female colleagues.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of low attrition levels, variable geographical demographics and male-orientated STEM roles, we have seen progress with our targeted diversity and inclusion approach:\n\n- \u00b7 In the last year around 42 per cent of all promotions were achieved by women and 60 per cent of our senior leader external hires were female.\n- \u00b7 Our Aspiring Manager Programme continues to support female progression with 71 per cent of female participants being promoted or moved to a new role.",

This is against a backdrop of females accounting for only 7 per cent of apprentices in the UK engineering, manufacturing and technology sector (Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education).\n\nWe have been recognised externally and named on Bloomberg's 2021 Gender Quality Index, an accepted standard for gender quality transparency. In 2020, United Utilities was named as finalists in both the Northern Power Women Awards and in the 'Women in Water' category at the Water Industry Awards.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nSince our reporting began in 2017, our median gender pay gap is lower than the national average. In 2020, the national median gender pay gap was 15.5 per cent (ONS, November 2020). Our median gender pay gap has increased slightly since our last report in 2019. This is mainly because we needed to recruit people for a number of operational roles that receive extra payments due to the nature of their working patterns and, at the moment, it is mainly men working in these roles.\n\nWe are pleased to report that our mean gender pay gap has reduced. This is partly due to changes in the organisation, which have meant we have had more women progressing into senior roles and more men in lower-paid roles.\n\n## Our mean gender pay gap over time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our mean gender bonus gap over time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: To be eligible for our bonus scheme, employees need to have completed a minimum level of service. This means that some people who start working for us during the year may not be eligible.\n\nHaving challenged our thinking and assessed ourselves against external practices, we are confident that action we are already taking or have planned should result in us being able to reduce our gender pay gap in a way that can be maintained.\n\n## LGBT+\n\nOur LGBT+ network, Identity+ with over 350 members provides a social and support network for LGBT+ staff and those who are LGBT+ friendly. Its work has continued throughout the pandemic to support virtual events both in the company and externally, including celebrating Pride Month in June 2020.\n\nWe are pleased to have partnered with The Proud Trust, a north west-based LGBT+ youth charity. We have sponsored a group youth workers to work with LGBT+ young people in Oldham, a 'cold spot' as\n\ndefined by the social mobility index. We have funded LGBT+ inclusive educational resources, linked to the English national curriculum.\n\nIn 2020, over 200 people participated in Pride in the Workplace training, to help break down barriers and improve confidence to talk about LGBT+ in the workplace. We remain committed to being a Stonewall Diversity Champion. Stonewall are supporting us with a review of our people policies to ensure they are progressive and reflective of societal changes.\n\n## Disability\n\nOur ability network with over 100 members aims to support employees with, or those who support people with, a disability or long-term health conditions.

We are keen to play our part, alongside other north west businesses, organisations and agencies, in tackling the challenge of social mobility, contributing to boosting opportunities and social mobility as part of our national recovery.\n\nWe invited Rt Hon Justine Greening, founder of the Social Mobility Pledge, to co-host a live virtual event with Louise Beardmore, which officially launched our Opportunity Action Plan - the first of its kind in the North West.\n\nWe continue to play our part in driving improvements sector-wide, with partners and external stakeholders. We are active members of the Energy and Utility skills diversity and inclusion forum and have signed the sector pledge. As a member of Water UK, we have led on the creation of a water sector apprenticeship scheme that aims to raise awareness of the sector as an employer and are leading in raising awareness of the importance of social mobility inside and outside of the industry. In 2020, our targeted approach for increasing diversity resulted in 49 per cent of our apprentices coming from areas of low social mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "S\n\n## Financial oversight responsibilities of the board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle M:\n\nThe board should establish formal and transparent policies and procedures to ensure the independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions and satisfy itself on the integrity of financial and narrative statements.\n\nOur application of principle M is formalised in our non-audit services policy and terms of engagement with the auditor as agreed by the committee. The head of internal audit and risk reports to the committee and to the CFO but only on a functional basis, thereby ensuring a direct line of communication between internal audit and the committee. In accordance with provision 25, an explanation of the independence and effectiveness of the external audit process can be found on pages 149 to 150, and the reappointment of the statutory auditor on page 151. The board considered and was satisfied on the integrity of the financial and narrative statements, as advised by the audit committee in accordance with DTR 7.1.3(5).\n\n## Principle N:\n\nThe board should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects.\n\nWe have applied principle N, as confirmed by our disclosure against provision 27, which can be found on page 196 and is supported by our disclosure against provision 25 on page 149.\n\n## Principle O:\n\nThe board should establish procedures to manage risk, oversee the internal control framework, and determine the nature and extent of the principal risks the company is willing to take in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives.\n\nOur risk management framework and principal risks are on pages 100 to 107. Further information on the company's internal audit function and controls can be found on pages 154 to 155 and together set out our application of principle O.\n\n## Board's responsibility for financial oversight\n\nOne of the fundamental roles of the board is to oversee the financial performance of the business. The board is supported in this role by the audit committee whose activities are described on pages 144 to 154. The board reviews the financial performance of the company at every scheduled board meeting, receiving a report from the CFO which provides the board with the up-todate position of the consolidated financial statements, interpretative analysis and other key performance indicators, metrics and ratios. The board takes into account the review by the audit committee of the financial and narrative statements, and the auditor's views on the key risks and judgements identified and given particular focus in their audit work and set out in their report (see page 200), and the information and explanations provided by management in relation to their key judgements and adjustments to APMs. The board considered the review and assurance process undertaken by management, and considered by the audit committee to support the application of principle N. The board concluded that in the 2020/21 annual report and financial statements it has presented a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects, and the board was satisfied on the integrity of the financial and narrative statements. Furthermore, the board approved the accounts and provision of the directors' responsibility statement at its meeting on 26 May 2021, see page 196.\n\n## Oversight of financial aspects of ESG\n\nESG, and behaving responsibly, has been a long-term commitment and part of the board ethos for many years and is embedded in everything we do. It naturally flows through into our approach to the integrity of our financial reporting. Recognising that climate change is a key risk to our provision of water and wastewater services (see page 104), 2020/21 is the second year that we have reported against TCFD. As part of the processes supporting the provision of the 'fair, balanced and understandable' statement, we took into account the existing processes of review and assurance of our TCFD and wider narrative reporting (see above). We intend to further review the assurance processes of ESG matters, particularly those relating to TCFD reporting, ahead of the mandatory reporting requirement which will apply to our 31 March 2022 annual report.\n\n## Board's approach to risk management and internal control\n\nThe board discharges its responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risks that it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives through the risk appetite framework. As a key part of the risk management framework, risk appetite captures the board's desire to take and manage risk relative to the company's obligations, stakeholder interests and the capacity and capability of our key resources.\n\nThe board is responsible for ensuring that the company's risk management and internal control systems are effectively managed across the business and that they receive an appropriate level of scrutiny and board time.\n\nThe group's risks predominantly reflect those of all regulated water and wastewater companies. These generally relate to the failing of regulatory performance targets or failing to fulfil our obligations in any five-year planning cycle, potentially leading to the imposition of fines and penalties, in addition to reputational damage. Climate change is a risk that underpins our core operations  and provision of water and wastewater services to customers (see page 104).\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems\n\nDuring the year, the board reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management systems and internal control systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls. Taking into account the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 100 to 107, the ongoing work of the audit committee in monitoring the risk management and internal control systems (see pages 154 and 155) on behalf of the board, (and to whom the committee provides regular updates), the board:\n\n- \u00b7 is satisfied that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; and\n- \u00b7 has reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems, including all material financial, operational and compliance controls (including those relating to the financial reporting process) and no significant failings or weaknesses were identified.\n\nAfter review, the board concluded that through a combination of the work of the board, the audit committee and the UUW board (which has particular responsibility for operational and compliance controls), the company's risk management and internal controls were indeed effectively monitored throughout the year.",

Similarly, in accordance with the principles of the code, the board concluded, following the recommendation from the audit committee, that it was appropriate to provide the long-term viability statement based on an assessment period of seven years. Assurance supporting these statements was provided by the review of: the group's key financial measures and contingent liabilities; the key credit financial ratios; and the group's liquidity and ongoing ability to meet its financial covenants. As part of the assurance process, the board also took into account the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, and the actions taken to mitigate those risks, and include emerging and more topical risks.\n\nThese principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 104 to 107, as are the risk\n\nmanagement processes and structures used to monitor and manage them. Biannually, the board receives a report detailing management's assessment of the most significant risks facing the company. The report gives an indication of the level of exposure, subject to the mitigating controls in place, for the risk profile of the group, while also highlighting the reputational and customer service impact. This provides the board with information in two categories: group-wide business risks; and wholesale operational risks. The board also receives information during the year from the treasury committee (to which the board has delegated matters of a treasury nature see page 125) including such matters as liquidity policy, the group's capital funding requirements and interest rate management.\n\n## Long-term viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the viability of the group, taking account of the group's current position, the potential impact of the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. This assessment has been performed in the context of the group's prospects as considered over the longer term. Based on this viability assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the seven year period to March 2028.\n\n## Basis of assessment\n\nThis viability statement is based on the fundamental assumption that the current regulatory and statutory framework does not substantively change. The long-term planning detailed on page 48 assesses the group's prospects and establishes its strategy over a 25-year time horizon consistent with its rolling 25-year licence and its published long-term strategy. This provides a framework for the group's strategic planning process, and is key to achieving the group's aim of providing the best service to customers at the lowest sustainable price and in a responsible manner over the longer term, underpinning our business model set out on pages 30 to 46.\n\nIn order to achieve this aim and promote the sustainability and resilience of the business, due consideration is given to the management of risks over the long term that could impact on the business model, future performance, credit ratings, solvency and liquidity of the group. Specifically, risks associated with the possible ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have been incorporated into the baseline position and factored into the various scenarios modelled as part of the group's assessment. An overview of our risk management approach that supports the group's long-term planning and prospects, together with the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business, can be found on pages  104 to 107.\n\nWithin the context of this long-term planning and management of risks, the group's principal business operates within five year regulatory price control cycles. Medium-term planning considers the current price control period, over which there is typically a high degree of certainty, and looks beyond this in order to facilitate smooth transitions between price control periods. This results in the board concluding a recurring period of seven years to be an appropriate period over which to perform a robust assessment of the group's long-term viability.\n\n## Viability assessment: resilience of the group\n\nThe viability assessment is based upon the group's medium-term business planning process, which sits within the overarching strategic planning process and considers:\n\n- \u00b7 The group's current liquidity position - with \u00a31.3 billion of available liquidity at March 2021 providing a significant buffer to absorb short-term cash flow impacts;\n- \u00b7 The group's robust capital solvency and credit rating positions - with a debt to regulatory capital value (RCV) ratio of circa 62 per cent, a robust pension position and current credit ratings of A3/BBB+/A- with Moody's, S&P and Fitch respectively, this provides considerable headroom supporting access to medium-term liquidity where required;\n- \u00b7 The group's expected performance, underpinned by its historical trackrecord; and\n- \u00b7 The current regulatory framework within which the group operates which provides a high degree of cash flow certainty over the regulatory period and the broader regulatory protections outlined below.\n\nThe group has a proven track-record of being able to raise new finance in most market conditions, and expects to continue to do so into the future. This is despite the group no longer having access to future EIB funding following the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the group benefits from a rolling 25-year licence and a regulatory regime in which regulators including the economic regulator, Ofwat - are required to have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice. These include that regulation should be carried out in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted. Ofwat's primary duties provide that it should protect consumers' interests, by promoting effective competition wherever appropriate; secure that the company properly carries out its statutory functions; secure that the company can finance the proper carrying out of these functions - in particular through securing",

The baseline plan against which the viability assessment has been performed incorporates the estimated ongoing impact COVID-19 based on experience to date. This baseline plan is then subject to further stress scenarios and reverse stress testing that takes into account the potential impact of group's principal risks. Such risks include: environmental risks such as the occurrence of extreme weather events and other impacts of climate change, further details of which are included in the group's TCFD disclosures on pages 86 to 99; political and regulatory risks; the risk of critical asset failure; significant cyber security breaches; longer term economic impacts resulting from COVID-19, including unemployment and corporate failures affecting debt collection and lower inflation affecting revenues, financing costs and RCV; and the potential for a restriction to the availability of financing resulting from a capital markets crisis. The UK's withdrawal from the EU and the ending of the transition period has not had a material adverse operational or financial impact on\n\nthe group to date, and is not considered to represent a significant risk to the group's ongoing viability.\n\nThe scenarios considered are underpinned by the group's established risk management processes, taking into account those risks with a greater than 10 per cent (1 in 10) cumulative likelihood of occurrence. The risks associated with COVID-19 are reflected within the baseline position, with further potential downside risks (most notably in relation to bad debt and low inflation) covered by the individual scenarios modelled, and collectively within a combined scenario.\n\nThe assessment has considered the impact of these scenarios on the group's business model, future performance, credit ratings, solvency and liquidity over the course of the viability assessment period. This assessment has demonstrated the group's ability to absorb the impact of all severe but reasonable scenarios modelled, without the need to rely on the key mitigating actions detailed below.\n\nAs part of the assessment, reverse stress testing of two extreme theoretical scenarios focusing on totex overspend and persisting low inflation have been performed to understand the extent to which the group could further absorb financial stress before it reaches a sub-investment grade credit rating. This reverse stress testing demonstrated that these extreme conditions would have to be significantly outside what would be considered 'severe but reasonable' scenarios before the group's long-term viability would be at risk.\n\n## Viability assessment: key mitigating actions\n\nIn the event of more extreme but low likelihood scenarios occurring, there are a number of key mitigations available to the group, the effectiveness of which are underpinned by the strength of the group's capital solvency position.\n\nAs well as the protections that exist from the regulatory environment within which the group operates, a number of actions are available to mitigate more severe scenarios, which include: the raising of new finance, including hybrid debt; capital programme deferral; reduction in other discretionary totex spend; the close-out of derivative asset positions; the restriction of dividend payments; and access to additional equity.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe analysis underpinning this assessment has been through a robust internal review process, which has included scrutiny and challenge from the audit committee and board, and has been reviewed by the group's external auditor, KPMG, as part of their normal audit procedures.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the basis of preparation note to the accounts.",

Much of the work of the committee is necessarily targeted at the regulated activities of UUW, which represent over 98 per cent of group revenues and is a reflection of our commitment to safeguarding the interests of our stakeholders, particularly our shareholders and customers.\n\nThe timing of the pandemic has meant that both the 2020 and 2021 year end audits have been conducted under lockdown rules.   Working practices of the group's financial reporting team and those of KPMG audit team have been adapted, reflecting the lessons learnt from the 2020 audit which was undertaken in the early stages of the pandemic. In addition, through the last year certain changes to internal controls were necessary, reflecting the move to home working, due to the practical difficulties of obtaining\n\nCFO, the company secretary, the head of audit and risk, the group controller, and representatives from the statutory auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG). None of these attendees are members of the committee.\n\n- \u00b7 The representatives from KPMG and the head of audit and risk each have time with the committee and the company secretary to raise freely any concerns they may have without management being present.\n- \u00b7 The committee is authorised to seek outside legal or other independent professional advice as it sees fit, but has not done so during the year.\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference unitedutilities. com/corporate-governance\n\nwet signatures as the usual evidence of approval. Changes were implemented by the treasury, commercial and property teams. Such changes, and the effectiveness thereof, were reviewed by, and agreed with, the internal audit team.\n\nManagement made a number of changes to its alternative performance measures (APMs) to better enable comparability with other companies, rather than reflect the nuances of the regulatory model. The committee concurred with the changes, and in particular that there should be no adjustments to underlying profit relating to COVID-19 at 31 March 2021, recognising that, for the group, operating in the COVID-19 environment had become business as usual. A guide to APMs can be found on page 82.\n\nThe group's purpose is to 'provide great water and more for the North West'. The committee's contribution to achieving the purpose is to ensure that the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are properly protected by overseeing the group's financial reporting and internal control arrangements. The committee uses its collective expertise, with input from the auditor, to provide challenge to the approach and judgements made by management in the treatment of financial matters and the resulting disclosures within the company's financial statements. Transparency and openness are fundamental  to the relationship between management and the committee, something which is reinforced through the cultural framework within which the business operates, with being trustworthy one of our core values.\n\nAs articulated in the code, 'the board should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects'. The board asks the audit committee to advise on whether in fact 'the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy'.\n\nThe committee chose to retain KPMG as auditor following the competitive tender process conducted in December 2019, as reported in the 2019/20 report. The primary factor for the committee in retaining the services of KPMG, was that, in the committee's view, it offered a more compelling case for the provision of a high-quality audit than the other candidates participating in the tender. As set out on page 151, the group has tendered and changed the auditor on a number of occasions since the",

Ian Griffiths  was appointed as the new audit engagement partner for the 2020/21 audit.\n\nAs part of the committee's review of the performance and recommendation on reappointment of auditor, it took into account the annual review published in July 2020 by the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC's) Audit Quality Review Team. The findings, based on a sample of 88 audits from across the seven largest UK firms, reported that 'firms are still not consistently achieving the necessary level of audit quality'. The committee challenged KPMG on the FRC's findings and also reviewed whether the quality improvement proposals outlined to the committee had indeed been implemented in the 2019/20 audit. Following the committee's review of the effectiveness of the 2019/20 audit process, additional proposals were put forward as part of the 2020/21 audit scope (see page 149).\n\nTransparency and openness are fundamental to the relationship between management and the committee, something which is reinforced through the cultural framework within which the business operates\n\nAuditor independence is a key principle, and contributing factor to audit quality. It is reviewed as part of the audit scope and re-examined prior to the accounts being approved and signed by the board. The auditor must be independent of the company. It is the committee's responsibility to ensure that the three-way relationship between the committee, the auditor and the company's management is appropriate and there is no undue influence by any of the parties on the other, thereby ensuring the integrity of the audit process and the annual report and financial statements. Independence is a key focus for the auditor, whose staff must comply with their firm's own ethics and independence criteria which must be consistent with the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019). Information on how the committee assesses the independence of the auditor can be found on page 150. The statutory auditor presents its audit findings to the shareholders as the owners of the business (see page 200).\n\nThe committee has responsibility for ensuring that the group's policy on non-audit services reflects the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019) whereby the only non-audit services that a statutory auditor is permitted to provide to a public interest entity are those required by law or regulation, loan covenant reporting, other assurance services closely linked to the audit and/or reporting accountant services. Assurance on this matter is provided by the auditor.\n\nIn summary, the committee concluded that the statutory audit  process and services provided by KPMG for 2019/20 were satisfactory and effective.\n\nWe continue to be committed to providing meaningful disclosure of the committee's activities and ensuring the committee's agenda is kept abreast of relevant developments. The committee will await the outcome of the BEIS consultation on 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance' and we expect to contribute to the consultation process. We are fully\n\ncommitted to ensuring that the group's audit and governance arrangements reflect best practice and address any new requirements within the expected time frames.\n\nFollowing review of our 31 March 2020 accounts by the FRC (see page 152), we have enhanced a number of disclosures in our financial statements.\n\nThere is an element of overlap between our statutory and regulatory reporting. Engaging the same auditor improves efficiency. It contributes to the integrity of the narrative reporting statements, with the auditor reviewing them in accordance with ISA720 (see page 149). Furthermore, the committee has been provided with greater visibility of the assurance of the nonfinancial information in the annual report.\n\nThe details of the external evaluation of the committee's performance can be found on page 135.\n\nI would like to extend my thanks to my committee colleagues for their work and support during my last year as chair of the committee. Doug Webb will take over the role at the conclusion of the annual general meeting in July 2021. Doug joined the committee on his appointment in September 2020, and at the beginning of the 2021 financial reporting cycle. He has considerable recent and relevant financial experience both as a former FTSE 100 CFO and through his other non-executive appointments. The skills matrix on page 133 summarises the experience of the committee's members.\n\nThis report was approved by the committee at its meeting held on 19 May 2021.\n\n## Brian May\n\nChairman of the audit committee",

The committee's role is to ensure that management's disclosures reflect the supporting detail provided to the committee or challenge them to explain\n\nand justify their interpretation and, if necessary, re-present the information. The committee reports its findings and makes recommendations to the board accordingly. The committee is supported in this role by using the expertise of the statutory auditor, who, in the course of the audit, considers whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and whether adequate accounting records have been kept. In doing so it ensures that high standards of financial governance, in\n\nline with the regulatory framework as well as market practice for audit committees going forward, are maintained. Furthermore, the company's own internal audit team contributes to the assurance process by reviewing compliance with internal processes. The committee's financial reporting cycle, which starts each year in September, is shown below. There were four meetings of the committee held during the year.

        "page_content": "## AUDIT QUALITY\n\n## Additional audit quality processes for the 2020/21 audit\n\nWith a view to further enhancing audit quality, and in response to lessons learnt during the 2019/20 audit, KPMG proposed the following action plan for the 2020/21 audit, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing sight of their interim control findings to the committee early in the audit process and sharing their knowledge and best practice recommendations;\n- \u00b7 Improving the two-way communication and sharing of information and insight between the external and internal audit teams by implementing regular discussion sessions prior to the scheduled committee meetings;\n- \u00b7 Raising audit points in a more timely manner with the financial reporting team during the audit process by holding regular discussions with the external audit team and financial reporting team; and\n- \u00b7 Using a project manager to assist with the delivery of the year end audit cycle.\n\nAs part of its review of the 2020/21 audit in July 2021, the committee will review the effectiveness of the above processes.\n\nHow we assessed whether 'the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy'\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provision 25. The directors' responsibility for preparing the annual report and financial statements is set out on page 196.\n\nThe board delegates to the committee, in the first instance, the review of the annual report and financial statements with the intention of providing advice to the board on whether, as required by the code, 'the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy'.\n\nTo make this assessment, the committee received copies of the annual report and financial statements to review during the drafting process to ensure that the key messages being followed in the annual report were aligned with the company's position, performance and strategy being pursued and that the narrative sections of the annual report were consistent with the financial statements. The significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements include those identified by the auditor in their report on pages 152 to 153.\n\nThe committee received regular updates on the calculation of underlying operating profit measures as one of the principal alternative performance measures (APMs). A guide to APMs can be found on page 82.\n\nManagement enhanced the review processes to provide support to the board in forming its view on whether the accounts and financial statements were fair, balanced and understandable, as it concluded they were and set out on page 141.\n\nMany of our regulatory performance commitments are used by management as key performance indicators and are monitored by our regulators,  who set the methodology against which we report. As part of their role as auditor of UUW's annual performance, KPMG provides assurance on many of these performance commitments along with Jacobs, the technical auditor.\n\nKPMG is required (under ISA720) to consider whether there are any material inconsistencies between the other information presented in the annual report (e.g. the strategic report), and the financial statements, taking into\n\naccount the auditor's knowledge obtained in the audit, or the auditor's understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the other statutory information. The assurance of our greenhouse gas emissions and TCFD disclosures (see pages 88 to 99), is undertaken both by third parties and our internal audit team. Our disclosures against the code are reviewed by the internal audit team and reported to the committee.\n\nAdditionally, the committee was satisfied that all the key events and issues which had been reported to the board in the executive team's monthly board reports during the year, both good and bad, had been adequately referenced or reflected within the annual report.\n\n## How we assessed the effectiveness of the statutory audit process\n\nThe committee, on behalf of the board, is responsible for the relationship with the auditor, and part of that role is to examine the effectiveness of the statutory audit process. Audit quality is regarded by the committee as the principal requirement of the annual audit process.\n\nKPMG presented the strategy and scope of the audit for the forthcoming financial year at the meeting of the committee held in September, highlighting any areas which would be given special consideration (these key audit matters are included in the auditor's report on page 200). KPMG reported against their audit scope at subsequent committee meetings, providing an opportunity for the committee to monitor progress and raise questions, and challenge both KPMG and management.\n\nThroughout the year, management presents their up-to-date view of the key accounting issues and their resulting judgements. KPMG responds informing the committee  whether, in their professional view, the judgements management propose, or have taken, are appropriate. A number of these issues manifest themselves as the significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements. For 2020/21 these are set out on pages 152 to 153, in exercising their professional scepticism, as required by auditors' professional standards, KPMG did not identify any areas of disagreement with management's judgements.\n\nPrivate meetings are held at each committee meeting between the committee and representatives of the auditor without management being present to encourage open and transparent feedback by both parties. KPMG meets with management at regular intervals during the annual audit process.\n\nPrior to the board's approval of the year end financial statements, the committee provides its view to the board",

The independent nature and financial expertise of committee members further contributes to the integrity of the process.\n\nKPMG updated the committee on its ongoing Audit Quality Transformation Plan (AQTP). KPMG's AQTP includes: a more standardised audit approach; holding companies to account for the quality of the information provided in the audit process; providing more feedback to companies on the findings of their audit and providing additional senior-level support to the KPMG audit teams during the audit; all of which are well embedded in the audit process. In planning for  the 2020/21 audit, KPMG provided a report to the committee on the quality interventions that they had implemented during the 2019/20 audit. Each year the committee has challenged KPMG to ensure continuous improvement.\n\nOn completion of the annual audit process the views of those involved in the audit on how well KPMG performed the audit are sought. All members of the committee, key members of the senior management team and those who regularly provide input into the audit committee or have regular contact with the auditor, complete a feedback questionnaire, thereby ensuring a wide range of views are taken into account. The questionnaire, reviewing the 2020 audit process was issued in July 2020.\n\nViews of the respondents were sought in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 The robustness of the external audit process and degree of challenge to matters of significant audit risk and areas of management subjectivity;\n\n- \u00b7 Whether the scope of the audit and the planning process were appropriate for the delivery of an effective and efficient audit;\n- \u00b7 The quality of the delivery of the audit and whether planned quality improvements had been delivered;\n- \u00b7 The expertise of the audit team conducting the audit;\n- \u00b7 That the degree of professional scepticism applied by the auditor was appropriate;\n- \u00b7 The appropriateness of the communication between the committee and the auditor in terms of technical issues;\n- \u00b7 The quality of the service provided by the auditor;\n- \u00b7 Their views on the quality of the interaction between the audit engagement partner, the audit senior manager and the company;\n- \u00b7 Whether the audit process had been kept on schedule, despite the remote working due to COVID-19 restrictions of both the audit and management teams; and\n- \u00b7 Whether the statutory audit contributed to the integrity of the group's financial reporting.\n\nThe feedback was collated and presented to the committee's meeting in September 2020. The committee noted KPMG's quality interventions as part of its AQTP to improve audit quality, including: the additional oversight provided by senior KPMG personnel during the 2019/20 audit; and the enhanced consultation to ensure consistency and challenge management's view of COVID-19. The committee concluded that the statutory audit process and services provided by KPMG were satisfactory and effective, although areas for further enhancement were agreed (see page 149).\n\n## How we assessed the independence of the statutory auditor\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provision 26.\n\nThere are two aspects to auditor independence that the committee monitors to ensure that the auditor remains independent of the company.\n\nFirst, in assessing the independence of the auditor from the company, the committee takes into account the information and assurances provided by the auditor confirming that all its partners and staff involved with the audit are independent of any links to United Utilities. KPMG confirmed that all its partners and staff complied with their ethics and independence policies and procedures which are fully consistent with the FRC's Ethical Standard, including that none of its employees working on our audit hold any shares in United Utilities Group PLC. KPMG is required to provide written disclosure at the planning stage of the audit in the form of an independence confirmation letter. Their letter discloses matters relating to their independence and objectivity, including any relationships that may reasonably be thought to have an impact on its independence and the integrity and objectivity of the audit engagement partner and the audit staff. The audit engagement partner must change every five years and other senior audit staff rotate at regular intervals.\n\nSecondly, the committee develops and recommends to the board the company's policy on non-audit services and associated fees that are paid to KPMG. In accordance with the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019), an auditor is only permitted to provide certain non-audit services to public interest entities (i.e. United Utilities Group PLC) that are closely linked to the audit itself or that are required by law or regulation, as such services could impede their independence. Permitted non-audit services fees paid to the statutory auditor are subject to a fee cap of no more than 70 per cent of the average annual statutory audit fee for the three consecutive financial periods preceding the financial period in which the cap applies.\n\nThe 70 per cent non-audit services fee cap has been applied to the group for the year ended 31 March 2021. The average of audit fees is \u00a3430,000 (calculated as the average of the audit fees for the three preceding financial years (2020: \u00a3474,000; 2019: \u00a3437,000; 2018: \u00a3379,000). Non-audit services fees during the year were \u00a3119,500, (2020: \u00a377,000; 2019: \u00a365,000) so well below the cap of \u00a3301,000 (70 per cent of \u00a3430,000). In 2021, fees for non-audit services represent 27.8 per cent of the average audit fees on which the cap is",

        "page_content": "based. The committee revised the non-audit services policy incorporating the 70 per cent fee cap as described above with effect from 1 April 2017. The company's non-audit services policy reflects the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019). Permitted services (which remain subject to the 70 per cent cap, apart from the regulatory audit) can be approved by the CFO subject to a cap of \u00a310,000 applied for individual items. Individual items in excess of \u00a310,000 require the approval of the committee. Auditor-provided permitted services include the non-audit fees paid to the statutory auditor  for: the interim review; the regulatory audit; agreed-upon procedures for regulatory reporting and the Euro Medium Term Note Programme and Law Debenture Trust compliance work.\n\nFees for non-audit services paid to KPMG include the cost of the UUW regulatory assurance work they undertake, which is separate to the regulatory audit. While this work could be performed by a different firm, the information is in fact more granular breakdowns of data that form part of the statutory audit, and by KPMG undertaking the work it reduces duplication and saves considerable cost.\n\nDuring the year, the committee agreed additional fees of \u00a3100,000 in relation to the additional audit work impacted by\n\nCOVID-19 as part of the 2019/20 audit. These fees were agreed subsequent to the finalisation of the 2019/20 accounts are therefore included in the audit fees disclosed for 2020/21.\n\nTaking into account our findings in relation to the effectiveness of the audit process and in relation to the independence of KPMG, the committee was satisfied that KPMG continues to be independent, and free from any conflicting interest with the group.\n\n## Statutory auditor reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2022\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provision 26.\n\nThe 2020/21 year-end audit has been KPMG's tenth consecutive year in office as auditor; they were reappointed after the committee conducted a formal tender process in December 2019 and as reported by the committee in 2020. Prior to this, a formal tender was last undertaken in 2011, and resulted in the appointment of KPMG who thereafter presented their report to shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2012. An audit tender review was held in September 2015. The diagram shown below shows the historical tendering and rotation of the role of statutory auditor. The company, as a public interest entity, is required to\n\n## ROTATION OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR TO THE GROUP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconduct a competitive tender process every ten years, and rotate auditors after 20 years at most. As a matter of good practice, the committee continually keeps under review the performance of the auditor.\n\nThe 2020/21 audit has been the first year for Ian Griffiths as audit engagement partner. The audit engagement partner changes at least every five years.\n\nUnited Utilities has complied fully with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nAt its meeting on 19 May 2021, the committee recommended to the board that KPMG be proposed for reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2022 at the forthcoming AGM in July 2021. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the committee's choice of auditor; the recommendation is free from third-party influence and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.",

These queries were quickly resolved to the FRC's satisfaction and their review was closed. To provide greater clarity, the group has provided enhanced, voluntary disclosure on these and other matters in this year's financial statements. In their correspondence, the FRC states\n\nthat their review provides no assurance that the company's accounts are correct in all material respects; the FRC's role is not to verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. The FRC last reviewed and corresponded with the company in relation to the 31 March 2016 accounts.\n\n## Going concern and long-term viability\n\nThe committee challenged and scrutinised management's detailed assessment of the group's long-term viability and its ability to continue as a going concern. In doing\n\n## Significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements\n\n## Significant issues considered\n\nHow these were addressed by the committee\n\nImpact of COVID-19 - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in higher levels of estimation uncertainty and considerably more judgement being required in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020. During the year ended 31 March 2021, the committee has considered how the situation has developed in order to revisit these significant estimates and judgements.\n\nCapitalisation of fixed assets (see pages 201, 216 and 225 to 226 and 256) - fixed assets represents a subjective area, particularly in relation to costs permitted for capitalisation and depreciation policy.\n\nRevenue recognition and allowance for doubtful receivables (see pages 201, 215 to 216, 227 to 228 and 255) - due to the nature of the group's business, the extent to which revenue is recognised and doubtful customer debts are provided against is an area of considerable judgement and estimation. This has particularly been the case in the current and prior year, where the economic impacts of COVID-19 have been highly uncertain, though compared with the prior year these judgements and estimates have been increasingly informed by the availability of more data in relation to consumption of services and customer payment patterns under the conditions brought about by the pandemic.\n\nRetirement benefits (see pages 202, 230 to 231, 248 to 253 and 258) - the group's defined benefit retirement schemes are an area of considerable judgement, the performance and position of which is sensitive to the assumptions made. The group employs the services of an external actuary to determine the calculation of the net retirement benefit surplus and determine the appropriate assumptions to make.\n\nThe committee sought from management an understanding of changes to the methodology and assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit scheme surplus, including an expansion of the corporate bond population used in deriving the discount rate, the application of an inflation risk premium in determining the RPI inflation assumption, and a reduction in the long-term rate of improvement assumed in the mortality assumptions adopted. Having challenged the rationale for making these changes and considered how they compare with market practice and the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, the committee concluded that the resulting assumptions were appropriate and balanced in estimating the level of defined benefit obligations and therefore the net retirement benefit surplus.\n\nThe impacts of the pandemic on the issues considered are outlined below, where applicable. Broadly, with the passage of time and as more data relating to the key areas impacted by the pandemic has become available, the level of estimation uncertainty has fallen compared with the prior year when the pandemic was still in its early stages.\n\nThe committee assessed the reasonableness of the group's capitalisation policy and the basis on which expenditure is determined to relate to enhancement or maintenance of assets and, having considered the work performed by KPMG in this area, deemed both to be appropriate;\n\nThe committee challenged the controls around ensuring the accuracy of capital accruals making up part of the total amount of fixed assets capitalised during the year, and satisfied itself that controls in this area were adequate; and\n\nThe committee reviewed the recovery of the capital overhead rates that it had approved in the year ended 31 March 2020 for the five-year regulatory period ending 31 March 2025. The committee concluded that the rates remain appropriate, noting that it is early in this period and therefore the continuing appropriateness of the rates used will be kept under review.\n\nThe committee reviewed the approach taken by management in estimating the impact of changing consumption patterns for both household and non-household customers during periods of lockdown, and the implications this has for estimating the amount of unbilled revenue to recognise for customers with water meters. The committee noted that the level of estimation required has reduced throughout the year, as more meter reads covering periods of changing consumption patterns have been performed. The committee satisfied itself that management's approach to estimating the level of revenue to recognise has been robust and has been appropriately adapted as more data has become available; and\n\nThe committee reviewed management's assessment of the impact the pandemic appears to have had on the level of doubtful debt and credit note provisioning, recognising that the situation remains uncertain as government support schemes are set to unwind in future periods. The committee challenged management's judgement around the appropriate period over which to consider cash collection history in assessing the level of expected future credit losses, and concurred that the judgement around the period chosen was appropriate.\n\nthis the committee took into account the risks facing the business, and its ability to withstand a number of severe but reasonable scenarios. Having considered management's assessment, the committee approved the long-term viability statement set out on page 142.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance report\n\n## Audit committee\n\n## Internal controls and risk management systems\n\nThe main features of the group's internal controls and risk management systems are summarised below:\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is a key element of the group's corporate governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and internal control to the audit committee, the board and to senior management. It supports the organisation's vision and objectives by evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business policies and processes, systems and key internal controls. In addition to reviewing the effectiveness of these areas and reporting on aspects of the group's compliance with them, internal audit makes recommendations to address any key issues and improve processes and, as such, provides an indication of the behaviours being exhibited by employees in the areas under review. Once any recommendations are agreed with management, the internal audit function monitors their implementation and reports to the committee on progress made at every meeting.\n\nA five-year strategic audit planning approach is applied. This facilitates an efficient deployment of internal audit resource in providing assurance coverage over time across the whole business, as well as greater variation in the nature, depth and breadth of audit activities. This strategic approach supports the annual audit plan, which is then endorsed by management, and which the committee reviews, challenges and approves. The plan focuses the team's work on those areas of greatest risk to the business. Building on the strategic planning approach, the development of the plan considers risk assessments, issues raised by management, areas of business and regulatory change, prior audit findings and the cyclical review programme. The purpose, scope and authority of internal audit is defined within its charter which is approved annually by the audit committee. As set out in the charter, internal audit perform their work in accordance with the mandatory aspects of the International Professional Practice Framework of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors; and with integrity (honestly, diligently and responsibly) and objectively (without conflicts of interest).\n\nInternal audit, led by the head of audit and risk, covers the group's principal activities and reports to the committee and functionally to the CFO. The head of audit and risk attends all scheduled meetings of the audit committee, and has the opportunity\n\nto raise any matters with the members of the committee at these meetings without the presence of management. He is also in regular contact with the chair of the committee outside of committee meetings.\n\nThe in-house team is expanded as and when required with additional resource and skills co-sourced from external providers. The committee keeps the relationship with co-source providers under review to ensure the independence of the internal audit function is maintained and there is a documented process to manage possible conflicts of interest with the co-sourced resource. Ensuring that any co-source resource remain independent in the course of its work is crucial to the integrity of its work. During the year, PwC was reappointed as co-source resource provider following a competitive tender process (see page 155).\n\nThe internal audit function liaises with the statutory auditor, discussing relevant aspects of their respective activities which ultimately supports the assurance provided to the audit committee and board. During the year, the committee reviewed the current operating model, in particular the balance of in-house versus co-sourced resource, and concluded that, while minor improvements were identified, the current approach was satisfactory.\n\n## Assessing the effectiveness of the internal audit function\n\nThe effectiveness of the internal audit function's work is continually monitored using a variety of inputs, including the ongoing audit reports received, the audit committee's interaction with the head of audit and risk, an annual review of the department's internal quality assurance report, a quarterly summary dashboard providing a snapshot of the progress against the internal audit plan tabled at each committee meeting as well as any other periodic quality reporting requested.\n\nAn annual stakeholder survey in the form of a feedback questionnaire is circulated to committee members, senior management and other managers who have regular contact with the internal audit function, including representatives from the auditor KPMG and the co-source audit provider PwC. The responses were anonymous to encourage open and honest feedback, and were consistently favourable, as were previous surveys.\n\nPeriodically, the quality and effectiveness of the internal audit function is also assessed externally, with the most recent review being undertaken in early 2019. The committee has received regular updates during the year from the head of audit and risk on the impact of the pandemic on the schedule of work of the internal audit\n\nteam, due to remote working and social distancing measures. Some re-phasing of the original work was undertaken, with the team keeping on track with re-planned work. Only one audit, which required access to a third party's site, was deferred, with agreement by the committee, to the 2021/22 audit plan.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, the committee concluded that the internal audit function was an effective provider of assurance over the organisation's risks and controls and appropriate resources were available as required.\n\n## Risk management systems\n\nThe committee receives updates and reports from the head of audit and risk on key activities relating to the company's risk management systems and processes at every meeting. These are then reported to the board, as appropriate. The group designs its risk management activities to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe CFO has executive responsibility for risk management and is supported in this role by the head of audit and risk and the corporate risk manager and his team. The group audit and risk board (GARB) is a sub-committee of the executive team. The GARB meets quarterly and reviews the governance processes and the effectiveness and performance of these processes along with the identification of emerging trends and themes within and across the business. The work of the GARB then feeds into the information and assurance processes of the audit committee and into the board's assessment of risk exposures and the strategies to manage these risks.\n\nSupplementing the more detailed ongoing risk management activities within each business area, the biannual business unit risk assessment process (BURA) seeks to identify how well risk management is embedded across the different teams in the business. The BURA involves a highlevel review of the effectiveness of the controls that each business unit has in place to mitigate risks relating to activities in their business area, while identifying new and emerging risks and generally to facilitate improvements in the way risks are managed. The outcome of the BURA process is communicated to the executive team and the board. This then forms the basis of the determination of the most significant risks that the company faces which are then reviewed by the board. The group utilises risk management software to underpin the company's risk management process. The maturity of the risk management framework and its application across the business is assessed on an annual basis against a defined",

        "page_content": "maturity model. This assessment provides an objective appraisal of the degree of maturity in how the risk management system is being applied and the quality of each risk in terms of quantification and management. The results of the maturity assessment are reported to the GARB, and actions agreed with business units.\n\nAn external assessment of the risk management process last took place in 2017/18.\n\nThe committee received a 'deep dive' session on the risk management process. This provided an explanation of the process of identification and assessment of risk along with the governance mechanisms in place prior to the reporting of the risk profile to the board.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe committee reviews the group's internal control systems and receives updates on the findings of internal audit's investigations at every meeting, prior to reporting any significant matters to the board. Internal control systems are part of our 'business as usual' activities and are documented in the company's internal control manual which covers financial, operational and compliance controls and processes. Internal control systems are the responsibility of the CFO, with the support of the GARB, the financial control team and the internal audit team, although the head of audit and risk and his team are directly accountable to the audit committee.\n\nConfirmation that the controls and processes are being adhered to throughout the business is the responsibility of managers, but is continually tested by the work of the internal audit team as part of its annual plan of work which the committee approves each year as well as aspects being tested by other internal assurance providers. Compliance with the internal control system is monitored annually by the completion of a self-assessment checklist by senior managers in consultation with their teams. The results are then reviewed and audited on a sample basis by the internal audit team and reported to the committee.\n\n## Anti-fraud and anti-bribery\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for reviewing the group's procedures for detecting fraud, and the systems and controls for preventing other inappropriate behaviour. In the first instance of an incident being reported, a summary of the allegations is passed to the fraud and whistleblowing committee (consisting of the company secretary, customer services and people director, commercial director and head of internal audit and risk) to decide on the appropriate course of action and investigation and by whom.\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT CO/hyphen.caseSOURCE COMPETITIVE TENDER\n\nDuring the year, the committee led and supervised a formal tender process for the internal audit co-source resource. The contract with the incumbent, PwC, was due to expire on 31 March 2021. The request for proposal was issued in December 2020. Five proposals were received, which were evaluated on a weighting of 85 per cent technical and 15 per cent commercial. After initial analysis, three proposals progressed to the presentation stage in front of the tender review panel made up of audit committee members and senior members of the finance team. Taking into account both technical and commercial scores, PwC achieved the highest score and was re-appointed.\n\nDuring the year, the audit committee was kept fully apprised in regular updates on the progress and findings of investigations of cases of alleged fraud and any remedial actions taken. A number of employees have been selected and received specialist training in order to conduct investigations of cases of alleged fraud.\n\nIn line with the group's anti-fraud culture and zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud, a fraud incident forum has been established to identify and understand potential threats, and optimise the group's response and mitigation and ensure consistency across the business.\n\nThe company has an anti-bribery policy to prevent bribery being committed on its behalf, which all employees must follow, and processes in place to monitor compliance with the policy. Employees in certain roles are required to complete antibribery training materials. As part of the anti-bribery programme, employees must comply with the group's hospitality policy. The hospitality policy permits employees to accept proportionate and reasonable hospitality for legitimate business purposes only. Our employees and representatives of our suppliers must comply with the group's sustainable supply chain charter which explains that we will not tolerate corruption, bribery and anti-competitive actions and we expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and in particular never to offer or accept any undue payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of inducing any person or entity to act contrary to their prescribed duties.\n\nAs part of the internal control selfassessment checklist (part of the group's internal control processes), senior managers in consultation with their teams are required to confirm, among other things, that they have complied with the group's anti-bribery and hospitality policies. The anti-bribery programme is monitored and reviewed biannually by the committee. Our United Supply chain approach sets out that we do not tolerate corruption, bribery and unfair anticompetitive actions on our own behalf or that of our suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe anti-bribery policy is available at unitedutilities.com/corporate/about-us/ governance\n\nThe United Supply chain approach is available at unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/governance/ suppliers/delivering-value/ united-supply-chain",

It considers the approach to be comprehensive and thoughtful, ranging from enhanced support for vulnerable customers through extension of the company's social tariff and the prominent promotion of its payment break scheme, to the help offered to suppliers through accelerated payment terms and the unrelenting focus on employee health and wellbeing.\n\nIt has been encouraging to see that the company is already well advanced in its thinking about working patterns in a postpandemic environment, positioning it as the 'next ways of working'. The committee recognises there are many implications associated with changed working patterns and it looks forward to the opportunity to comment on plans as they develop. The committee debated the broader impact of\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference unitedutilities. com/corporate-governance\n\nCOVID-19 for the company's approach to responsible business, concluding that it was premature to draw lasting conclusions as the pandemic was still with us.\n\nAs a result of the lockdown, there has been a marked increase in the number of visitors to United Utilities' recreation sites which, regrettably, has resulted in an increase in anti-social behaviour. The committee welcomed a paper on the company's approach to land management which set out clearly the risks and opportunities that come with being custodians of land in some of the most highly valued parts of the North West, such as the Lake District.\n\nIn response to growing investor interest in ESG - environmental, social and governance - the committee was pleased to comment on the company's sustainable finance framework ahead of its first successful sustainable bond issuance. The fact that the bond was three times oversubscribed reveals the level of investor focus on ESG. To help this community better understand the company's approach, an investor guide to ESG at United Utilities was published in 2020 to provide a helpful summary of the material issues the company is managing. It is also the fifth consecutive year that my report to shareholders has been structured under ESG headings.\n\nThe creation of the sustainable finance framework was a further example of the company's long-standing commitment to responsible business. While the committee is clear, on behalf of the board, that the company is making real progress, we believe that judgement is best left to others. It is both pleasing and reassuring that the company continues to perform well across a broad range of ESG indices. In the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, in which the company has participated almost longer than any other, it was again ranked world class - for the 14th consecutive year.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the sector has transitioned from AMP6 to AMP7, and the company took the opportunity to review its approach to responsible business. As it exited AMP6, it reported that over 75 per cent of the stretching targets first set in 2015 to measure responsible business progress had been achieved. With AMP7 underway, the committee supported an evolution in its approach to frame the company's responsible business efforts around its purpose 'to provide great water and more for the North West', with particular emphasis on the value the company creates for its stakeholders.\n\nThe committee endorsed a new set of measures and targets out to 2025 that are aligned to each stakeholder the company",

        "page_content": "## MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe terms of reference remained unchanged for the committee. Its main duties are to:\n\n- \u00b7 consider and recommend to the board the broad corporate responsibility (CR) policy, taking into account the company's desired CR positioning;\n- \u00b7 keep under review the group's approach to CR and ensure it is aligned with the group strategy;\n- \u00b7 review CR issues and objectives material to the group's stakeholders and identify and monitor the extent to which they are reflected in group strategies, plans and policies;\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the status of the company's reputation and examine the contribution the group's CR activities make towards protecting and enhancing this;\n- \u00b7 monitor and review compliance with the board's CR policy and scrutinise the effectiveness of the delivery of the CR policy requirements;\n- \u00b7 develop and recommend to the board CR targets and key performance indicators and receive and review reports on progress towards the achievement of such targets and indicators;\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the steps taken by the company to support customers in vulnerable circumstances; and\n- \u00b7 review all approved specific giving where the aggregate financial contribution exceeds \u00a3100,000 over the period of the proposed funding and to review all community giving expenditure annually.\n\nIt has been encouraging to see that the company is already well advanced in its thinking about working patterns in a post-pandemic world.\n\ncreates value for and reflects what matters to them. We welcomed the intention to include these measures in a revised section of the annual report (see pages 50 to 73), reporting openly and transparently on them to help stakeholders to determine if the company is purpose led. This means that a 'golden thread' from purpose, through to vision and strategy, and then to measurement, will be clearly evident.\n\nIn what has been a challenging year, it has mattered more than ever that the company has engaged with its stakeholders on topics relevant to them. At every meeting, the committee discusses the company's approach to stakeholder engagement, ranging from national political and regulatory stakeholders through to the devolved administrations in the North West and regional NGOs. For example, it was good to hear of the favourable response to the company's first virtual caseworker event from the staff in regional MP offices.\n\nThe pandemic has drawn attention to many issues, with three of particular interest to the committee. First, it is evident that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on socially and economically deprived communities, of which there is a greater proportion in the North West than the rest of the country. The committee focused on the affordability and vulnerability support offered by the company.\n\nSecond, inequality in society has been brought into sharp focus, whether that is through the Black Lives Matter movement or increasing youth unemployment. In response, the company presented its refreshed diversity and inclusion strategy, marking a step change in its efforts to address the issue, and the committee welcomed United Utilities' first social mobility summit, hosted virtually, where it convened over 150 regional businesses to debate how best to tackle inequality, setting out its own intentions in its Opportunity on Tap plan.\n\nThe third issue has been the climate and nature emergencies. The committee reviewed the company's progress on its climate change adaptation plan and how its stewardship of 56,000 hectares of land will pay a critical role in both mitigating climate change (for example through planting trees and restoring peatland) and adapting to the impacts that are already occurring, such as slowing the flow of water to reduce flood risk.\n\nChanges to the Corporate Governance Code in 2018 means that the committee now examines some additional responsible business topics on behalf of the board, in particular in relation to employees. Two papers were presented to the committee on progress in relation to work of the Employee Voice panel and how it has established an important role in contributing to the company's plans.\n\nAs the contribution that businesses make to society is examined ever more closely, especially as we think about a post-pandemic world, I am confident that the company, with its long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility and its determination to fulfil its purpose, will continue to build legitimacy amongst the opinions of customers, regulators, government and other stakeholders.\n\nAs a listed company, United Utilities complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code and continues to drive for the highest standards of board leadership, transparency and governance.\n\n## Stephen Carter\n\nChair of the corporate responsibility committee",

As a result of excess visitor numbers due to COVID-19 lockdowns, efforts were underway to stabilise the current situation and reduce the impact of visitor behaviour. Alongside this, the company had begun a comprehensive review of its strategy, including: overall ambition and direction; processes; governance; funding; partnerships; stakeholder engagement; communications and culture.\n\n## Waste and circular economy\n\nThe committee discussed conclusions reached by the company that business benefits could be gained through circular economy thinking. This will involve engagement across the company and with partners and suppliers in four areas: water and wastewater; energy; materials; and restoration of natural systems. As an example, the committee heard about scope to work more closely with housebuilding companies on water efficiency. A pilot will be undertaken in the Carlisle area with government agencies, customers and other stakeholders to explore opportunities.\n\n## Social\n\n## Next ways of working\n\nTwo updates were provided to the committee on plans for employee working patterns post-pandemic. The first phase of work will develop a 'flexibility framework' and common principles to optimise and hardcode the benefits of the current ways of working. The second phase considers the medium-term workforce strategy, assessing the impact from disruptors such as technology and automation, changing demographics and changing employee expectations. The committee debated the impact on line management, measuring productivity, and the development of skills, and observed how other factors such as diversity and inclusion were shaping working patterns.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nA refreshed and updated strategy was discussed by the committee. It agreed that to attract great people to deliver a great public service, the company had to reach out and recruit from every part of society and support employees to achieve their full potential and feel valued and included. Five key work streams had been identified: leadership development; encouraging openness; people policies and processes; increasing awareness; and enabling inclusion. The committee welcomed the company's strong performance in the FT Diversity Index, indicating efforts to engage on diversity and inclusion were being recognised.\n\n## Gender pay report\n\nThe committee commented on the draft gender pay report for 2020 and welcomed that employee feedback had been sought in shaping the report. Progress against the action plan and commitments would continue to be monitored as part of the wider diversity and inclusion strategy.\n\n## Affordability and vulnerability: lower income groups\n\nAs a standing item, the committee was provided with an update on the company's performance in assisting customers on low incomes, focusing on free meter options and how the company is responding through planned initiatives.\n\n## Human rights policy\n\nThe committee approved an updated Human Rights policy. Analysis by the company's working group on its risk assessment showed movement in the likelihood and severity of some risks but this did not change the most salient issues: forced/child labour (modern slavery); health and safety; data protection and privacy; and access to clean water and sanitation. Material updates to the policy included the addition of a clause concerning the company's expectations of personnel, business partners and other relevant parties and a statement that the company has a mechanism by which to report concerns safely and in confidence.\n\n## Governance\n\n## CR committee terms of reference\n\nFollowing review, the committee concluded that no further changes were needed to its terms of reference at the current time. The emergence of recent trends, such as the greater emphasis on purpose, were accommodated by the existing terms.\n\n## CR committee evaluation\n\nThe committee reviewed the external evaluation results and, in particular, points raised about the visibility of ESG and how its elements are brought together. It noted that ESG was already represented in the committee's section of the annual report and, through the standing item on reputation, it reviewed company efforts to promote its ESG credentials and encouraged it to do more.\n\n## Employee Voice\n\nTwice a year the committee reviews progress on employee and board engagement. During lockdown, the company adopted a 'virtual' Employee Voice panel which covered key topics such as reward strategy and the scope of the 'next ways of working' programme, with members providing feedback on the company's response to COVID-19. The committee heard of the work of the Employee Voice networks and sub-groups, discussions on the employee opinion survey, and feedback on the culture in United Utilities. The committee considered further opportunities for the employee voice to be heard and was advised that the management conference was to be replaced with an all-employee conference. The committee noted that the company was satisfied that activities and progress enabled it to demonstrate compliance with the code.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and reputation\n\nEngagement and reputation remained a standing agenda item allowing time to examine the relationship between responsible business and reputation. Each paper provided an update on national and regional political and regulatory engagement, and interaction with people and organisations representing regulatory, social and environmental interests. The committee was keen to understand the company's stakeholder approach during COVID-19 and discussed the virtual consultation approach for the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme. It welcomed the favourable response to the company's first virtual MP caseworker event. The committee was presented with an update on current reputational risks under active management.",

The committee welcomed the outcome that the company had met over 75 per cent of the targets it had set in 2015.\n\n## Cross cutting\n\n## United Supply Chain\n\nThe committee was updated on the company's new approach to suppliers in AMP7, called United Supply Chain (USC), with its aim to embed responsible sourcing principles. This had taken into account best practice in other sectors, with the aim of providing a consistent approach to suppliers, with customers positioned as a common theme. Adherence will be monitored through the company's established supplier relationship management mechanism.\n\n## Sustainable finance framework\n\nA paper setting out the design for the company's sustainable finance framework was presented to the committee. It included: categories of green/ sustainable projects eligible for funding; the governance around identifying and selecting projects; tracking the net proceeds to eligible projects and preallocation investment; and publishing reports annually until full allocation, with external verification. The committee endorsed the approach, concluding that it aligned well with the company's responsible business and ESG credentials.\n\n## Value framework - multi-capitals\n\nAn update was provided to the committee on a project related to embedding the company's purpose into business processes.

As is outlined elsewhere in this annual report, our focus throughout the past year has been on protecting colleagues, supporting customers, and maintaining our essential water and wastewater services across the North West. Thanks to the extraordinary hard work and dedication of our employees, many of whom are key workers, we have continued to deliver high quality services to our customers and support the interests of our other stakeholders.\n\n## The year in focus\n\nAs a remuneration committee we are always mindful of the extent to which the remuneration of the executives aligns with the experience of our stakeholder groups. We have taken a close interest in the actions that have been taken to protect our employees and support their wellbeing\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead about how our remuneration approach complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code on page 162\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead  our At a glance summary: executive directors' remuneration on pages 164 to 166\n\nRead  our Annual report on remuneration on pages 167 to 181\n\n- Read  our Directors' remuneration policy on pages 182 to 188\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference unitedutilities. com/corporate-governance\n\nduring this difficult year. As outlined on pages 126 to 127, my role as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement has enabled me to gain a firsthand understanding of the various initiatives that have been put in place and the feedback received from employees, which I have then been able to share with the committee for consideration. The committee has received regular updates on relevant matters affecting the workforce from our customer services and people director and head of reward at each meeting.\n\nIn the initial days and weeks of the pandemic, we made important changes to support the safety of our front-line colleagues, introducing safeguarding measures such as conducting risk assessments across all our sites. We implemented a range of measures to help and support over 3,000 employees who transitioned to home-working during the period. Recognising the broader impact of the pandemic on our employees and their families, we introduced a staff outreach scheme, offering one-time grants to employees whose families faced COVID-19 related financial challenges, to supplement our existing group-wide health and wellbeing schemes. No government support was accessed, no employees were furloughed or had their pay or benefits reduced, we have continued to recruit people through our graduate and apprentice programmes, and we are currently supporting the Government's Kickstart Scheme providing jobs for 16 to 24 year olds who are at risk of long term unemployment.\n\nThe team has performed extremely well in these challenging circumstances, with high levels of customer satisfaction and resilient services in times of significantly increased demand. In serving some of the most economically deprived areas in the country, we have been alert to the need to help customers who struggle to pay their bills and have extended our ongoing charitable support and community engagement programmes. As part of our commitment to Ofwat, we reduced average household bills by 5 per cent in real terms this year and acted swiftly to increase the number of households eligible for our social tariff alongside the extensive support we already provide to customers struggling with affordability, which now covers over 200,000 customers. We worked with our suppliers across the region to provide enhanced payment terms to aid cash flows, and accelerated our capital expenditure to bring forward benefits and help support 17,700 jobs in the supply chain.\n\nAgainst this background our performance in this first year of the new regulatory period has been strong, with outperformance of the regulatory contract and positive ODI rewards resulting in good outcomes for shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation of the directors' remuneration policy during 2020/21\n\nSalary\n\nRecognising the difficulty being experienced by many customers in our region, all members of the board, including the executive directors, volunteered a 20 per cent reduction to their salary/fees for the three-month period to August 2020, and agreed that giving the money to the foodbank charity FareShare would be an effective way to support vulnerable groups within our communities. Further details on our relationship with FareShare are shown on page 43.\n\nWhilst our policy is that executive directors normally receive a salary increase broadly in line with the increase awarded to the general workforce (which was 2.3 per cent in the year), in recognition of the wider economic environment, all members of the board agreed that they would not receive scheduled increases during 2020/21. Salaries will next be reviewed in September 2021.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nEmployees throughout the company participate in the same bonus scorecard as the executive directors, to ensure a shared focus on the business plan at all levels. As outlined in the Strategic Report we have seen another strong year of customer service, operational and financial performance, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and periods of significantly increased demand.\n\nWe are leading the way on customer satisfaction and have made a strong start to our AMP7 customer ODIs delivering net outperformance this year, demonstrating resilient performance across most of the targets set for us by the regulators. While our written customer complaints performance for the year has fallen below our targets, in part reflecting the higher level of complaints during the dry spring in 2020 and our focus on collecting cash from those customers who are able to pay, but choose not to, we still expect our relative performance to be upper quartile compared with the other water and wastewater companies.\n\nUnderlying operating profit was down compared to last year as expected, and largely reflecting lower revenues arising from the new price control.\n\nThe efficient and effective delivery of the capital programme is reflected in our Time, Cost and Quality index (TCQi) score which remains high at 95.3 per cent.\n\nOverall company results have led to an annual bonus out-turn for the executive directors of around 82 per cent of maximum (compared to the 2019/20 outcome of around 71 per cent of maximum) and a company-wide bonus pool totalling around \u00a318 million (compared to around \u00a317 million in the prior year),\n\nreflecting the exceptional efforts and high levels of performance of the workforce during the very challenging year.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\nThe outcome of the Long Term Plan (LTP) awards which were granted in 2018 will be confirmed in the summer of 2021, with an estimated vesting outcome of around 90 per cent. This reflects the continued delivery of high standards of customer service set in recent years, the achievement of just under the stretch level of sustainable dividend performance, and full vesting under the relative total shareholder return condition due to a return of 48 per cent over the performance period (compared to the stretch target of 26 per cent). As outlined in last year's report and as noted on page 169, as a result of Ofwat transitioning from SIM to C-MeX, the committee used its discretion to amend the customer service element of the award to be based on the new C-MeX measure and written complaints. The final outcome of this element will not be known until the volume of written complaints received by other companies are available later in 2021 and the overall vesting level can be confirmed. The awards for the executive directors will vest only after the completion of a two-year holding period, during which the shares will remain subject to withholding provisions. The committee believes that this approach aligns the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders and customers.\n\nDuring 2018/19, the committee consulted with shareholders on changing the structure of the LTP, so future awards would be based on two equally weighted components: Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE) and a customer basket of measures. These changes were approved at the 2019 AGM and applied with respect to the 2020 awards onwards. LTP awards are normally granted in June each year, but due to the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and particular concerns at the time about the possible extent of the disruption caused, the committee delayed the 2020 grants until November to allow more time to settle the targets, details of which are set out on page 170. Stretching targets have been set for RoRE based on the allowed return over the period (as set out in the final determination) and the expected returns to be generated through financial and operational performance. In respect of the customer basket, the committee finalised the selection of measures having taking into account the feedback received from customer research and focus groups (as to which areas of service/performance they considered the highest priority) and the performance commitments agreed with Ofwat, thereby ensuring that the measures reflect the views of our stakeholders.\n\n## Executive director changes\n\nRuss Houlden retired from the board and as chief financial officer on 24 July 2020 and left the company on 31 July 2020. Russ' departure was treated in line with the remuneration policy for retirees and in line with the approach set out in last year's remuneration report. Following a rigorous selection process, we were delighted to appoint Phil Aspin to the role as successor. Phil's salary was set at \u00a3400,000 on his appointment, with a pension contribution aligned to the workforce rate. Other details of his package are set out on page 167.\n\n## Agenda for 2021/22\n\nAs a committee, we have always sought to fully embrace the changing landscape and implement remuneration arrangements that are transparent and well-aligned to our purpose, vision and strategy, and this continues to guide our approach for the current year and beyond.\n\nNo significant changes are proposed to the operation of the policy for 2021/22. Details of the measures and targets for the annual bonus plan and 2021 LTP awards are set out on page 171.\n\nWe have a regular programme of engagement with shareholders each year in advance of our AGM and were pleased that towards the end of 2020 the company had the opportunity to speak with Glass Lewis about our approach to executive remuneration.\n\nThe next directors' remuneration policy will be subject to approval by shareholders in 2022 and we will engage with shareholders about any potential changes to the policy at the appropriate time.\n\nWe continue to use our Employee Voice panel meetings as opportunities to discuss directly with employees our executive pay approach and its alignment with that of the workforce, as well as hearing the general views, concerns and comments from our workforce. Listening to the views of all the company's key stakeholders plays a vital role in formulating and implementing a successful remuneration policy, and the committee is grateful for all inputs received.\n\nThis is my first report as chair of the remuneration committee, having been on the board and a member of the committee since 2016.  I was delighted to be appointed committee chair in July 2020, taking over from Sara Weller, and I would like to express my personal thanks and that of the whole committee to Sara for her guidance and stewardship over last eight years.\n\nI hope we will continue to receive your support this year for the remuneration resolution at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Alison Goligher\n\nChair of the remuneration committee",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance report\n\nCode principle - remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle P:\n\nRemuneration policies and practices should be designed to support strategy and promote longterm sustainable success. Executive remuneration should be aligned to company purpose and values, and be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the company's longterm strategy.\n\nWe describe how our remuneration approach aligns with our business strategy on page 164.\n\n## Principle Q:\n\nA formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and determining director and senior management remuneration should be established. No director should be involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n\nThis is detailed in the committee's terms of reference which are available on the company website. The committee consults with shareholders when changes to policy are being considered.\n\n## Principle R:\n\nDirectors should exercise independent judgement and discretion when authorising remuneration outcomes, taking account of company and individual performance, and wider circumstances.\n\nThe shareholder approved directors' remuneration policy outlines the ways in which the committee may exercise discretion.\n\nThe following table summarises how our shareholder approved remuneration policy fulfils the factors set out in provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLARITY\n\nThe committee is committed to providing transparent disclosures to shareholders and the workforce about executive remuneration arrangements and, to this end, the directors' remuneration report sets out the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors in a clear and transparent way. Our AGM allows shareholders to ask any questions on the remuneration arrangements, and we welcome any queries on remuneration practices from shareholders throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PREDICTABILITY\n\nPayouts under the annual bonus and LTP schemes are dependent on the performance of the company over the short and long-term, and a significant proportion of executive director remuneration is performance-linked. These schemes have strict maximum opportunities, with the potential value at threshold, target and maximum performance scenarios provided in the directors' remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROPORTIONALITY\n\nPayments from variable incentive schemes require strong performance against challenging conditions over the short and longer term. Performance conditions have been selected to support group strategy and consist of both financial and nonfinancial metrics.\n\nThe committee retains discretion to override formulaic outcomes in both schemes to ensure that they are appropriate and reflective of overall performance.\n\n## SIMPLICITY\n\nOur remuneration arrangements for executive directors, as well as those throughout the group, are simple in nature and understood by all participants, having been operated in a similar manner for a number of years. Executive directors receive fixed pay (salary, benefits, pension), and participate in a single short-term incentive (the annual bonus) and a single long-term incentive (the Long Term Plan).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK\n\nThe committee has designed incentive arrangements that explicitly do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking. The committee retains overarching discretion in both the annual bonus and LTP schemes to adjust payouts where the formulaic outcomes are not considered reflective of underlying business performance and individual contributions. Robust withholding and recovery provisions apply to variable incentives.\n\n## ALIGNMENT TO CULTURE\n\nPerformance measures used in our variable incentive schemes are selected to be consistent with the company's purpose, values and strategy. The use of annual bonus deferral, LTP holding periods and our shareholding requirements provide a clear link to the ongoing performance of the group and ensure alignment with shareholders, which continues after employment.",

This is a different approach in comparison to the 2.3 per cent increase applying to the general workforce in the year. Steve requested a voluntarily reduction of his salary by 20 per cent for three months with the value saved being donated to charity. See page 43.\n\nOn his appointment as Chief Financial Officer on 24 July 2020, Phil Aspin's salary was set at \u00a3400,000. In setting it at this level, which was lower than that received by Russ Houlden, the committee demonstrated its intent to reposition executive remuneration packages, whilst taking into account relevant external benchmarks. It is expected that future salary increases for Phil will be in line with the normal policy i.e. broadly in line with increases applied across the wider workforce in normal circumstances. The next salary review for the executive directors will be in September 2021.\n\n## Pensions\n\nSteve Mogford has a contractual entitlement to receive a cash allowance of 22 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension. In accordance with code provision 38, his pension arrangements will be aligned to those of the wider workforce as part of the next directors' remuneration policy, expected to be put to shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Phil Aspin receives a cash allowance of 12 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension which aligns with the workforce rate, and again illustrates the committee's intention to reposition the overall executive remuneration package. For employees, the company doubles any contributions that employees make up to a maximum of 14 per cent of salary.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFor executive directors, benefits include: a car allowance of \u00a314,000; health, life cover and income protection insurance; travel costs; and communication costs. No material changes are expected to benefits during the year commencing 1 April 2021.\n\n## External appointments\n\nSteve Mogford was senior independent director of G4S PLC during the year ended 31 March 2021 for which he received and retained an annual fee of \u00a397,000. He stepped down from the G4S PLC board in April 2021. Phil Aspin was appointed as a member of the UK Accounting Standards Endorsement board by BEIS with effect from 15 March 2021 for which he will receive an annual fee of \u00a314,000.",

Fifty per cent of any bonus is deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan. These awards vest after three years and are subject to withholding provisions. There are no service or additional performance conditions attached.\n\nThe table below provides details of share awards made on 16 June 2020 to the executive directors as at that date in respect of deferred share bonus payments for the 2019/20 financial year.\n\n| Executive director   | Type of award      | Basis of award   | Number of shares   | Face value of award (\u00a3'000)   | End of deferral period   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Steve Mogford        | Conditional shares | 50% of bonus     | 38,742             | \u00a3353                          | 16.6.2023                |\n| Russ Houlden         | Conditional shares | 50% of bonus     | 24,469             | \u00a3223                          | 16.6.2023                |\n\n## Annual bonus in respect of financial year ended 31 March 2021 (audited information)\n\nThe performance measures, targets and outcomes in respect of the executive directors' annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2021 are set out below. As disclosed in last year's report the annual bonus for 2020/21 was wholly aligned to the group bonus scorecard with no specific personal performance element, although when determining the overall outcomes and whether any discretion should be exercised the committee took in to account the personal contributions of each individual. The table on page 164 summarises how the performance measures are linked to our business strategy.\n\nVesting\n\n| Measure                                                 | % weighting  of measure

As they were executive directors when they were granted in 2018 the awards for Steve Mogford and Russ Houlden will normally vest in April 2023, following an additional two-year holding period. The unvested shares will remain subject to withholding provisions during this two-year holding period. Phil Aspin was not an executive director when his award was granted and so in line with the remuneration policy this historic award will vest once the final outcome is confirmed. Under the shareholding guidelines he will be required to hold the vesting shares.\n\nNote that the final outcome for the customer service excellence measure (which forms one-third of the award) will not be known until the customer service scores for the other water and wastewater companies are published in late summer 2021. The values of the 2018 LTP awards in the single total figure of remuneration table are therefore estimated and will be restated in next year's report once the final outcome is known.\n\nThe table below shows how the long-term incentive amount in respect of the 2018 LTP was calculated:\n\nAchieved\n\n| Estimated vesting (% of award)                                                          |

Shareholders approved the new policy at the 2019 AGM.\n\nWhilst LTP awards are normally granted in June each year, due to the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and particular concerns at the time about the possible extent of the disruption caused, the committee delayed the 2020 LTP award grants until November to allow more time to settle the targets.\n\nStretching targets were set for the RoRE measure taking into account the allowed return over the period (as set out in the final determination) and the expected returns to be generated through financial and operational performance. When determining the measures that should form the customer basket component of the awards the committee took in to account feedback received from customer research and focus groups (as to which areas of service and performance they considered the highest priority) and the performance commitments agreed with Ofwat in the final determination for the regulatory period, thereby ensuring that the measures selected reflected the views and priorities of key stakeholders. The committee is pleased that alongside focusing on areas of performance that will have meaningful and tangible outcomes for customers, the measures chosen reflect its commitment to recognising evolving expectations in regard to environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nDetails about the 2020 LTP performance measures and targets are shown in the following table. Performance is measured over the three-year period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2023. The table on page 164 summarises how these performance measures are linked to our business strategy.\n\nTargets\n\n(1)\n\n| Measure                                                                |

Further details about the measures used and the stretching targets set will be provided in next year's directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Annual bonus in respect of the financial year commencing 1 April 2021\n\nThe maximum bonus opportunity for the year commencing 1 April 2021 will remain unchanged at 130 per cent of base salary.\n\nThe annual bonus will operate in broadly the same way as that for 2020/21, except the calculation approach for the written complaints measure will be different compared to previous years. Complaints were previously reported using the SIM complaints and unwanted contacts methodology which is now discontinued. Water companies now report all complaints to the Consumer Council for Water on the basis of 10,000 connected properties and so the targets for 2021/22 have been set on this basis. This means that comparing the written complaints targets from 2020/21 with those agreed for 2021/22 is not a like-for-like comparison, but the committee is satisfied that the targets set are stretching when taking account of previous performance and expected relative performance versus the other water and wastewater companies.\n\nThe table below summarises the measures, weighting and targets for the 2021/22 bonus. Targets that are considered commercially sensitive will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2021/22 annual report on remuneration.\n\nTargets\n\n| Measure                                                | Threshold  (25% vesting)   | Target (50% vesting)   | Stretch  (100% vesting)   | Weighting  (% of award)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Underlying operating profit (1)                        | Commercially sensitive     | Commercially sensitive | Commercially sensitive    | 25.0%                     |\n| Customer service in year                               |                            |                        |                           |                           |\n| C-MeX ranking out of the 17 water companies            | 8th position               | 6th position           | 4th position              | 10.0%                     |\n| Written complaints (per 10,000 connected properties)   | 20.50                      | 20.25                  | 20.00                     | 10.0%                     |\n| Maintaining and enhancing services for customers       |                            |                        |                           |                           |\n| Outcome delivery incentive (ODI) composite             | Commercially sensitive     | Commercially sensitive | Commercially sensitive    | 35.0%                     |\n| Time, cost and quality of capital programme (TCQi) (2) | 85.0%                      | 90.0%                  | 95.0%                     | 20.0%                     |\n| Total                                                  |                            |                        |                           | 100%                      |\n\n## 2021 LTP awards with a performance period ending 31 March 2024\n\nAwards are expected to be made in late June 2021 and the award level for executive directors will remain unchanged at 130 per cent of base salary.\n\nStretching targets will be set for the RoRE measure taking into account the allowed return over the period (as set out in the final determination) and the expected returns to be generated through financial and operational performance.\n\nIn respect of the customer basket, the committee will again finalise the selection of measures in consideration of customer priorities and performance commitments agreed by Ofwat in the final determination for the regulatory period.",

At each of its meetings the committee receives an update on notable matters affecting pay and benefits among the wider workforce since its previous meeting, and at least annually the committee formally reviews and discusses a report detailing all elements of the workforce's pay and benefits.\n\nThe committee has mechanisms through which it hears from and engages with the workforce on executive pay. As chair of the committee, insights related to remuneration that arise via Alison Goligher in her role as designated non-executive director for workforce engagement can be quickly and appropriately considered, and a formal report is presented to the committee at least annually in this respect. Alison hosts sessions with the Employee Voice panel which cover topics including the alignment of our executive pay approach with that of the wider workforce, providing valuable opportunities for open discussions and feedback. See pages 126 and 127 for further details.\n\nThe figures below show how the percentage change in the CEO's salary, benefits and bonus earned in 2019/20 and 2020/21 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components for a group of employees.

The headline salary increase for employees was 2.3 per cent.\n- (6) Russ Houlden stepped down from the board on 24 July 2020. Sir David Higgins was appointed to the board on 13 May 2019. Sara Weller stepped down from the board on 24 July 2020. To enable a meaningful year-on-year comparison their salary/fees reflect hypothetical full-year earnings, however we do not believe a year-on-year comparison of bonus outcomes for Russ Houlden is appropriate given his date of departure.\n- (7) Phil Aspin was appointed to the board on 24 July 2020. Kath Cates and Doug Webb were appointed to the board on 1 September 2020.\n- (8) Calculated using the fees and taxable benefits shown in the table on page 178. The fees for the non-executive directors were not changed in 2020/21 and reflect a voluntary reduction of 20 per cent for three months which was donated to charity. See page 43  for further details.\n- (9) The fee increase shown for Sir David Higgins reflects 2020/21 being his first full year as Chairman. In the prior year his fees were associated with his role as a non-executive director and chairman designate.\n- (10)  The fee increase for Alison Goligher reflects her appointment as remuneration committee chair with the associated fee effective from 24 July 2020.",

The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the regulations which provide for three different approaches to determine the pay ratio (Options A, B and C).\n\nThe data in the tables below has been calculated using Option A which is considered to be the most accurate methodology and uses the same calculation basis as required for the CEO's total remuneration as shown in the single figure table on page 167.\n\n- \u00b7 We identified all employees who received base salary during the year ended 31 March 2021 and who were still employed on that date.\n- \u00b7 The calculations were carried out using their total pay and benefits received in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021, including bonuses earned by reference to performance in the financial year and paid in June following the end of the financial year.\n- \u00b7 For employees who were employed on a part-time basis, or who were not employed for the full year, their remuneration has been annualised to reflect the full-time equivalent.\n- \u00b7 No other estimates or adjustments have been used in the calculations and no other remuneration items have been omitted.\n\nPay ratios\n\n| Financial year   | Method   | P25   | P50   | P75   |\n|------------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|\n| 2020/21          | Option A | 85:1  | 64:1  | 51:1  |\n| 2019/20 (1)      | Option A | 79:1  | 60:1  | 48:1  |\n\nAlong with the ratios comparing total remuneration, the committee keeps under review the ratios for salary and salary plus annual bonus, and tracks how these change over time. With a significant proportion of the remuneration of the CEO linked to company performance and share price movements over the longer term, it is expected that the headline ratios will depend primarily on the Long Term Plan (LTP) outcome, and, accordingly, may fluctuate from year to year. Participation in the LTP is currently limited to around 60 executives and senior leaders, with none of the individuals identified as P25, P50 and P75 in this group. On the other hand, employees at all levels participate in the annual bonus scheme, and so the committee considers this ratio as well as the ratio comparing only salary, to provide helpful additional context.\n\n|                                                             | Pay ratios   | Pay ratios   | Pay ratios   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pay ratios for different elements of remuneration (2020/21) | P25          | P50          | P75          |\n| Total remuneration (as above)                               | 85:1         | 64:1         | 51:1         |\n| Salary plus annual bonus                                    | 52:1         | 38:1         | 30:1         |\n| Salary                                                      | 26:1         | 19:1         | 15:1         |\n\nThe table below shows the total remuneration, salary plus annual bonus, and salary at each of the three quartiles.\n\n|                          | \u00a3'000   | \u00a3'000   | \u00a3'000   | \u00a3'000   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                          | CEO     | P25     | P50     | P75     |\n| Total remuneration       | 2,940   | 34      | 46      | 58      |\n| Salary plus annual bonus | 1,560   | 30      | 42      | 52      |\n| Salary                   | 736     | 29      | 39      | 50      |\n\nThe committee notes that there has been a small increase in the statutory CEO pay ratios this year, with the ratio of CEO total remuneration to the median employee (P50), for example, increasing from 60:1 to 64:1. This increase is driven primarily by a higher payout under the annual bonus and higher expected vesting under the LTP than recorded last year, and is partially offset by the voluntary salary reduction taken by the CEO for three months during the year. Having considered both the statutory and additional ratios, the committee is satisfied that the changes are related to appropriate differences in the structure of remuneration at different levels of the workforce, with 'at risk' performance-linked pay elements forming a greater proportion of the overall remuneration package at the most senior levels. See page 165 for further details. The committee will continue to consider the pay ratios in the context of other important metrics such as the gender pay gap and employee engagement levels.",

In recognition that some faced financial challenges as a result of their overall household income being affected, the company set up a staff outreach scheme to enable such employees to confidentially claim up to \u00a35,000 in financial support which does not require repayment. To date, around 90 employees have accessed the scheme. We also introduced a winter payment allowance, where employees could apply for a smaller value award if their utility costs when working from home during the pandemic were greater than the savings they were making from not travelling to their workplace. Whilst employees would normally have received a company contribution towards a Christmas celebration with their team, we instead arranged for all employees to receive a digital voucher which they could put towards their own festive celebrations. Alternatively, employees could opt to donate this to the FareShare initiative and around 1,500 employees opted to do so.\n\nIn relation to executive pay the following table summarises the key decisions made by the committee.\n\n| Element of remuneration                  | Committee decision                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board member salaries and fees           | Each board member volunteered to donate 20 per  cent of their salary/fees during the three-month  period to August 2020.

The shareholding guideline includes a post-employment shareholding requirement, under which executive directors must continue to hold the lower of 200 per cent of salary in shares or their shareholding on departure, for two years after ceasing employment with the group. As the only current executive director in role before 19 May 2020, Steve Mogford must retain shares vesting from share awards relating to performance periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020 if not doing so would take his shareholding below the guideline. Phil Aspin (and future executive directors) must retain shares vesting from all share awards (including in-flight awards) if not doing so would take his shareholding below the guideline. The committee has put in place nominee arrangements for relevant vesting share awards to enable the post-employment shareholding requirements to be enforced.\n\nDetails of beneficial interests in the company's ordinary shares as at 31 March 2021 held by each of the executive directors and their connected persons are set out in the charts below along with progress against the target shareholding guideline level. Steve Mogford continues to exceed the target shareholding guideline level of 200 per cent of salary. Phil Aspin is expected to reach the minimum guideline by 24 July 2025 (within five years of his appointment to the board).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the executive directors' shareholdings and share plan interests are given in the table below and in the appendix on page 189.\n\n|                      | Share-  holding  guideline  (% of  salary)   | Number  of shares  required  to meet  share-  holding  guide-   | Number of  shares owned  outright (including  connected  persons)   | Number of  shares owned  outright (including  connected  persons)   | Unvested shares  not subject to  performance  conditions  (2)   | Unvested shares  not subject to  performance  conditions  (2)   | Total shares  counting towards  shareholding   | guidelines (3)   | Share-  holding  as %  of base salary at   31 March   | Share-  holding  guideline  met at   31 March   | Unvested shares  subject to  performance  conditions (4)   | Unvested shares  subject to  performance  conditions (4)   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Director             |                                              | line (1)                                                        | 2021                                                                | 2020                                                                | 2021                                                            | 2020                                                            | 2021                                           | 2020             | 2021 (1)                                              | 2021                                            | 2021                                                       | 2020                                                       |\n| Steve Mogford (5)(6) | 200%                                         | 169,758                                                         | 110,630                                                             | 70,178                                                              | 331,476                                                         | 289,524                                                         |                                                | 286,331 223,646  | 337%                                                  | Yes                                             | 390,702                                                    | 381,010                                                    |\n| Russ Houlden (6)(7)  | 200%                                         | 107,216                                                         | 0                                                                   | 14,195                                                              | 208,838                                                         | 182,219                                                         | 110,684                                        | 110,791          | 206%                                                  | n/a                                             |                                                            | 108,160 240,605                                            |\n| Phil Aspin (5)       | 200%                                         | 87,594                                                          | 11,439                                                              | n/a                                                                 | 4,299                                                           | n/a                                                             | 13,736                                         | n/a              | 31%                                                   | No                                              | 79,794                                                     | n/a                                                        |",

The company does not make regular purchases of shares into the Trust nor employ a share purchase hedging strategy, and shares are bought to satisfy the vesting of share plans. The rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan do not permit awards to be satisfied by newly issued shares and must be satisfied by market purchased shares. The rules of the Long Term Plan permit the awards to be satisfied by newly issued shares but the company has decided to satisfy awards by market purchased shares.\n\nShould the company's method of satisfying share plan vestings change (i.e. issuing new shares) then the company would monitor the number of shares issued and their impact on dilution limits set by the Investment Association in respect of all share plans (10 per cent in any rolling ten-year period) and executive share plans (5 per cent in any rolling ten-year period).  No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## Company performance and CEO remuneration comparison\n\nThe total shareholder return (TSR) chart below illustrates the company's performance against the FTSE 100 over the past ten years. The FTSE 100 is an appropriate comparator as the company is a member of the FTSE 100 and it is a widely published benchmark for this purpose. The chart shows the growth in the value of a hypothetical \u00a3100 holding invested in the company over the ten-year period. The chart also shows the CEO's single total figure remuneration over the ten years ended 31 December 2021 for comparison. The table below the TSR chart shows the remuneration data for the CEO over the same period. Steve Mogford was the CEO over the whole period.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                        | 2012    | 2013    | 2014   | 2015   | 2016      | 2017   |       | 2018 2019   | 2020      | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|\n| CEO single figure of remuneration  (\u00a3'000) | 1,421   | 1,549   | 2,378  | 2,884  | 2,760 (1) | 2,233  | 2,221 | 2,448 (2)   | 2,654 (3) | 2,940    |\n| Annual bonus payment (% of  maximum)       | 72.0    | 84.4    | 78.2   | 7 7.4  | 54.5      | 83.7   | 74.9  | 79.0        | 70.7      | 81.8     |\n| LTP vesting (% of maximum) (4)             | n/a (5) | n/a (5) | 93.5   | 97.5   | 33.6      | 54.5   | 55.4  | 64.4        | 87.3 (3)  | 89.6 (6) |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) This includes the payout from the 2013 Long Term Plan (LTP) as well as \u00a31.028 million in respect of Steve Mogford's one-off Matched Share Investment Scheme that ended on 5 January 2016 (vested at 100 per cent).\n- (2) The payout from the 2016 LTP, which vested on 1 April 2021 after the end of a two-year holding period, has been updated to reflect the additional dividends accruing on this award and the closing share price on the date of vesting of 928.4 pence per share.\n- (3) The payout and vesting percentage for the 2017 LTP have been restated to reflect the additional dividend equivalents accruing on the award, the final vesting outcome and updated share price.

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance report\n\nAppendix 1: Directors' remuneration policy (abridged)\n\nThis appendix to the directors' remuneration report sets out an abridged version of the remuneration policy for the company which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 26 July 2019. The policy took effect from the data of approval and is intended to apply until the 2022 AGM.\n\nIn the interests of clarity, the report includes some minor annotations to additionally show, where appropriate, how the policy will be implemented in 2021/22. A full version of the shareholder approved policy can be found in the annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nThe company's remuneration arrangements are designed to promote the long-term success of the company. The company does not pay more than is necessary for this purpose. The committee recognises that the company operates in the North West of England in a regulated environment and therefore needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration reflects both the practices of the markets in which its executives operate, and stakeholder expectations of how the company should be run.\n\nThe committee monitors the remuneration arrangements to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between risk and reward and that the long-term performance of the business is not compromised by the pursuit of short-term value. There is a strong direct link between incentives and the company's strategy, and if the strategy is delivered within an acceptable level of risk, senior executives will be rewarded through the annual bonus and long-term incentives. If it is not delivered, then a significant part of their potential remuneration will not be paid.\n\nThe committee understands that listening to the views of the company's key stakeholders plays a vital role in formulating and implementing a successful remuneration policy over the long term. The committee thus actively seeks the views of shareholders and other key stakeholders to inform the development of the remuneration policy, particularly where any changes to policy are envisaged.\n\nAlthough employees are not consulted directly on executive remuneration policy, employee engagement surveys are carried out annually and regular discussion takes place with union representatives on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements. The committee takes into account the general base salary increase and remuneration arrangements, including pension provision, for the wider employee population when determining remuneration policy for the executive directors. Processes are in place for the committee to review and consider any remuneration-related matters that may arise from the activities undertaken by the board to take account of the 'employee voice'.\n\n## POLICY TABLE FOR DIRECTORS\n\nBase salary\n\nPurpose and link to strategy: To attract and retain executives of the experience and quality required to deliver the company's strategy.\n\n## Operation\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nNormally reviewed annually, typically effective 1 September.\n\nSignificant increases in salary should only take place infrequently, for example where there has been a material increase in:\n\n- \u00b7 the size of the individual's role;\n- \u00b7 the size of the company (through mergers and acquisitions); or\n- \u00b7 the pay market for directly comparable companies (for example, companies of a similar size and complexity).\n\nOn recruitment or promotion to executive director, the committee will take into account previous remuneration, and pay levels for comparable companies, when setting salary levels. This may lead to salary being set at a lower or higher level than for the previous incumbent.\n\nCurrent salary levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nExecutive directors will normally receive a salary increase broadly in line with the increase awarded to the general workforce, unless one or more of the conditions outlined under 'Operation' is met.\n\nWhere the committee has set the salary of a new hire at a discount to the market level initially, a series of planned increases can be implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to individual performance.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone",

The policy for the Chairman is determined by the remuneration committee (of which the Chairman is not a member).\n\nFees are reviewed annually taking into account the salary increase for the general workforce and the levels of fees paid by companies of a similar size and complexity. Any changes are normally effective from 1 September. Additional fees are paid in relation to extra responsibilities undertaken, such as chairing certain board subcommittees, and to the senior independent non-executive director.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, if there is a temporary yet material increase in the time commitments for non-executive directors, the board may pay extra fees on a pro rata basis to recognise the additional workload.\n\nNo eligibility for bonuses, long-term incentive plans, pension schemes, healthcare arrangements or employee share schemes.\n\nThe company repays any reasonable expenses that a non-executive director incurs in carrying out their duties as a director, including travel, hospitality-related and other modest benefits and any tax liabilities thereon, if appropriate.\n\n## Notes to the policy table - selection of measures and targets\n\nPerformance measures for the annual bonus are selected annually to align with the company's key strategic goals for the year and reflect financial and operational performance. 'Target' performance is typically set in line with the business plan for the year, following rigorous debate and approval of the plan by the board. Threshold to stretch targets are then set based on a sliding scale on the basis of relevant commercial factors.\n\nOnly modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels, with rewards at stretch requiring substantial outperformance of the business plan. Details of the measures used for the annual bonus are given in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nThe current Long Term Plan (LTP) measures were selected by the committee following an extensive review and shareholder consultation in 2018/19. These measures are considered to align with the company's key strategic goals and be closely linked to the creation of longterm shareholder value. LTP targets are set taking into account a number of factors, including reference to market practice, the company business plan and analysts' forecasts where relevant. The LTP will only vest in full if stretching business performance is achieved.\n\n## ANNUAL BONUS AND LONG/hyphen.caseTERM INCENTIVES /endash.case FLEXIBILITY, DISCRETION AND JUDGEMENT\n\nThe committee will operate the company's incentive plans according to their respective rules and consistent with normal market practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including flexibility in a number of regards.\n\nThese include making awards and setting performance criteria each year, dealing with leavers, and adjustments to awards and performance criteria following acquisitions, disposals, changes in share capital and to take account of the impact of other merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe committee retains discretion within the policy to adjust the targets, set different measures and/or alter weightings for the annual bonus plan, pay dividend equivalents on vested shares up to the date those shares can first reasonably be exercised and, in exceptional circumstances, under the rules of the long-term incentive plans to adjust performance conditions to ensure that the awards fulfil their original purposes (for example, if an external benchmark or measure is no longer available). All assessments of performance are ultimately subject to the committee's judgement. Any discretion exercised, and the rationale, will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.\n\nAll historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company and remain outstanding remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.\n\nCurrent fee levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nThe value of benefits may vary from year to year according to the cost to the company.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNon-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any performance-related arrangements.",

        "page_content": "## SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES\n\nThe committee believes that it is important for each executive director to build and maintain a significant investment in shares of the company to provide alignment with shareholder interests. Shareholding guidelines are therefore operated and the details of how these are currently applied are provided in the annual report on remuneration. With effect from 19 May 2020 the guidelines were updated to include post-employment shareholding requirements as outlined on page 176.\n\n## EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS\n\nThe company recognises that its executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies outside the company and exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which would be of benefit to the company. Any external appointments are subject to board approval (which would not be given if the proposed appointment was with a competing company, would lead to a material conflict of interest or could have a detrimental effect on a director's performance). Directors will be allowed to retain any fees received in respect of such appointments.\n\n## SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT\n\nExecutive directors' service contracts are subject to up to one year's notice period when terminated by the company and at least six months' notice when terminated by the director.\n\nThe policy on payments for loss of office is set out on the next page.\n\nThe Chairman and other non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather than service contracts. Their appointments may be terminated without compensation at any time. All non-executive directors are subject to re-election at each AGM.\n\nCopies of executive directors' service contracts and non-executive directors' letters of appointment are available for inspection at the company's registered office during normal hours of business and will be available at the company's AGM. Copies of non-executive directors' letters of appointment can be viewed on the company's website.\n\n## APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION\n\nThe remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company's approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.\n\n## Buy-out awards\n\nThe committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements (on a one-time basis or ongoing) when it considers these to be in the best interests of the company (and therefore shareholders). Any such payments would be limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.\n\n## Maximum level of variable pay\n\nThe maximum level of long-term incentives that may be awarded to a new executive director will be limited to the maximum Long Term Plan limit of 200 per cent of salary per annum on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the maximum level of overall variable pay that may be offered will be 330 per cent of salary (i.e. 130 per cent annual bonus plus 200 per cent Long Term Plan) per annum on an ongoing basis. These limits are in addition to the value of any buyout arrangements which are governed by the policy above.\n\nIn the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other previously awarded entitlements would continue, and be disclosed in the next annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Base salary and relocation expenses\n\nBase salary levels for new executive directors will be set in accordance with the policy, taking into account the experience of the individual recruited. The committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new appointee at a discount to the market level initially, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following years to bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to individual performance in the role.\n\nThe committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.\n\n## Annual bonus performance conditions\n\nWhere a new executive director is appointed part way through a financial year, the committee may set different annual bonus measures and targets for the new executive director from those used for other executive directors (for the initial part-year only).\n\n## Appointment of non-executive directors\n\nFor the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time. Non-executive directors' fees are set by a separate committee of the board; the Chairman's fees are set by the remuneration committee.",

Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former executive directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period. A robust line on reducing compensation is applied and payments to departing employees may be phased to mitigate loss. Our policy is shown in the table below:\n\n## Provision\n\n## Summary terms\n\n| Compensation for loss of office                            | \u00b7   | An executive director's service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further  payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of termination, on the occurrence  of certain contractually specified events such as gross misconduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                            | \u00b7   | No termination payment if full notice is worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                                                            | \u00b7   | Otherwise, a payment in respect of the period of notice not worked of basic salary, plus pension and  car allowance for that period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                                            | \u00b7   | Half of the termination payment will be paid within 14 days of date of termination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                                            | \u00b7   | The other half will be paid in monthly instalments over what would have been the second half of  the notice period.

Any statutory entitlements or compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment would be paid as necessary. Outstanding savings/ shares under all-employee share plans would be transferred in accordance with the terms of the plans as approved by HMRC.\n\n## Change of control\n\nOn a change of control, executive directors' incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the rules of the applicable plans. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 Bonus payments will take into account the extent to which the performance measures have been satisfied between the start of the performance period and the date of the change of control, and the value will be prorated to reflect the same period.\n- \u00b7 Deferred bonuses will generally vest on the date of a change of control, unless the committee permits (or requires) awards to roll over into equivalent shares in the acquirer.\n- \u00b7 Long Term Plan awards will generally vest on the date of a change of control taking into account the extent to which any performance condition has been satisfied at that point. Time prorating will normally apply unless the committee determines otherwise.",

The CFO is supported by a specialist team of tax professionals with many years of tax experience within the water sector and led by the Head of Tax.\n\nThe Head of Tax has day-to-day responsibility for managing the group's tax affairs and engages regularly with key stakeholders from around the group in ensuring that tax risk is proactively managed. Where appropriate, he will engage with both external advisers and HMRC to provide additional required certainty with the aim of ensuring that any residual risk is typically low. All significant tax issues are reported to the board regularly.\n\nConsistent with the group's general risk management framework, all tax risks are assessed for the likelihood of occurrence and the negative financial or reputational impact on the group and its objectives, should the event occur. In any given period, the key tax risk is likely to be the introduction of unexpected legislative or tax practice changes which lead to increased cash outflow which has not been reflected in the current regulatory settlement. The group is committed to actively engaging with relevant authorities to actively manage any such risk.\n\nIn any given year, the group's effective cash tax rate on underlying profits may fluctuate from the standard UK rate mainly due to the available tax deductions on capital investment. These deductions are achieved as a result of utilising tax incentives, which have been explicitly put in place by successive governments precisely to encourage such investment. This reflects responsible corporate behaviour in relation to tax.\n\nUnder the regulatory framework the group operates within, the majority of any benefit from reduced tax payments will typically not be retained by the group but will pass to customers; reducing their bills. For 2020/21, the impact of tax deductions on capital investment alone reduced average household bills by around \u00a320.\n\nThe group's principal subsidiary, United Utilities Water Limited (UUW), operates solely in the UK and its customers are based here. All of the group's profits are taxable in the UK (other than profits relating to the group's 35 per cent holding in Tallinn Water which are fully taxable in Estonia on distribution).\n\nWe completed the sale of our investment in Tallinn Water in March this year. In addition, the group's other remaining overseas subsidiary company, a dormant company resident in Thailand, where the group had historic trading operations, was formally dissolved in February this year.\n\nEvery year, the group pays significant contributions to the public finances on its own behalf as well as collecting and paying further amounts for its 5,000 strong workforce. Details of the total payments for 2021 of around \u00a3258 million are set out below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All our issued shares are fully paid.\n\nAt 26 May 2021, our directors had been notified of the following interests in the company's issued ordinary share capital in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority:\n\n|                             |   Per cent of issued share capital | Direct or indirect nature of holding   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Lazard Asset Management LLC |                               9.93 | Indirect                               |\n| BlackRock Inc.              |                               5.13 | Indirect                               |\n| Norges Bank                 |                               2.97 | Direct                                 |\n\nAt our AGM held on 24 July 2020, our shareholders authorised the company to purchase, in the market, up to 68,188,841 of our ordinary shares of 5 pence each. We did not purchase any shares under this authority during the year. We normally seek such an authority from our shareholders annually. At our 2021 AGM, we will again seek authority from our shareholders to purchase up to 68,188,841 of our ordinary shares of 5 pence each with such authority expiring at the end of our AGM held in 2022.\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, Ocorian Corporate Services (UK) Limited was the trustee that administered our executive share plans and had the ability to exercise voting rights at its discretion which related to shares that it held under the trust deed constituting the trust. In the event of a takeover offer which could lead to a change of control of the company, the trustee must consult with the company before accepting the offer or voting in favour of the offer. Subject to that requirement, the trustee may take into account a prescribed list of interests and considerations prior to making a decision in relation to the offer, including the interests of the beneficiaries under the trust.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the participants in our all-employee share incentive plan (ShareBuy) would be able to direct the trustee of ShareBuy, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, how to act on their behalf.\n\nDetails of the amount of interest capitalised by the group during the financial year can be found in note 6 to the financial statements on page 221. In line with current UK tax legislation, the amount is fully deductible against the group's corporation tax liability, resulting in tax relief of \u00a35.8 million.\n\nThere are no other disclosures to be made under Listing Rule 9.8.4.\n\nWe have in place contractual entitlements for the directors of the company and of its subsidiaries to claim indemnification by the company in respect of certain liabilities which might be incurred by them in the course of their duties as directors. These arrangements, which constitute qualifying third-party indemnity provision and qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision, have been established in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and have been in force throughout the financial year. They include provision for the company to fund the costs incurred by directors in defending certain claims against them in relation to their duties as directors of the company or its subsidiaries. The company maintains an appropriate level of directors' and officers' liability insurance.",

However, the wide definition of donations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 covers activities which form part of the necessary relationship between the group and our political stakeholders. This can include promoting United Utilities' activities at the main political parties' annual conferences, and occasional stakeholder engagement in Westminster. The group incurred expenditure during the year of \u00a35,801 (2020: \u00a323,627; 2019: \u00a39,388) as part of this process. At the 2020 AGM, an authority was taken to cover such expenditure. A similar resolution will be put to our shareholders at the 2021 AGM to authorise the company and its subsidiaries to make such expenditure.\n\nAs the provider of services to 7 million people across the North West, customers can sometimes contact their constituency MP and ask that they raise an issue with the company on their behalf. In 2020/21, we received 379 contacts from MPs offices covering topics such as flooding and planning. As part of our work to build constructive relationships with all our stakeholders, we encourage MPs and members of their offices to work closely with us to address constituency concerns and arrange case worker events to discuss such issues in detail. In 2020, this was a virtual event in which over 40 MP representatives accepted to join us. For those unable to participate in the live event, a link was sent so it could be viewed when convenient. There are two devolved administrations in the North West - the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the Liverpool City Region (LCR) - we engage regularly with both, as well as the region's local authorities, on a range of topics of shared interest, such as tackling flooding risk and enhancing the North West's natural capital. Our sponsorship of the All Party Political Groups for Greater Manchester and LCR helps bring MPs and peers of all parties together with key leaders to help maximise future investment in these areas for the benefit of local communities.\n\nIn addition, the company's activities to engage with political stakeholders on matters relevant to the water industry and its operating footprint in the North West extend to its membership of trade associations. This is described in the section below.\n\nWe are members of a small number of trade associations. Some of these have a national focus, such as Water UK, the representative body of the UK water industry, which considers industry-wide priorities such as development of markets, customer trust, resilience, and legislation and regulation, and the Confederation of British Industry, which provides a policy-making voice for firms at a regional, national and international level. Others focus on specific professions such as the 100 Group representing the views of the finance directors of FTSE 100 and large UK private companies and the GC 100, the voice of general counsel and company secretaries in FTSE 100 companies. The company is a member of regional bodies, such as the North West Business Leadership Team which encourages engagement across the public and private sectors to promote the sustainable economic development and long-term wellbeing of the North West. Our total contribution to these associations in 2020/21 was \u00a3420,403 (2019/20: \u00a3400,916).\n\nIn the past 12 months, the company has been involved in several engagements with political stakeholders through its membership of trade associations. Through Water UK, the company has supported efforts to interact with parliamentary bodies, such as select committees and chairs of other specific committees, to provide information on topics such as water efficiency labelling for white goods and the performance of combined sewer overflows in relation to river water quality. The company has supported Water UK in its effort to encourage the Government to ensure its forthcoming Environment Bill supports the sector's objectives to deliver resilient water services now and into the future.\n\nThrough our membership with both the CBI, in particular as a member of its North West regional council, and the North West Business Leadership Team, we have engaged with regional political stakeholders, such as local authorities and metro mayors, to explore how the business community can work more effectively with the public sector to drive economic growth in the region and tackle some of the North West's pressing social issues. For example, we have participated in consultations and discussions as part of the unlocking regional growth/ levelling up agenda, bringing together views of industry and regional government on opportunities and barriers.\n\nOur policies on employee consultation and on equal opportunities for all employees can be found  on pages 32 and 34. Applicants with disabilities are given equal consideration in our application process, and disabled colleagues have equipment and working practices modified for them as far as possible and where it is safe and practical to do so. Importance is placed on strengthening employees' engagement (see page 24). The effect of our regard towards employees in relation to the decisions taken during the financial year is included in our S172(1) Statement on page 28.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to own shares in the company through the operation of an all employee share incentive plan (ShareBuy).\n\nInformation on our average number of employees during the year, can be found in note 3 on page 219.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. In addition the group financial statements are required under the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU).\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;\n- \u00b7 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU;\n- \u00b7 assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is\n\nnecessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors' report, directors' remuneration report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nApproved by the board on 26 May 2021 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n## Sir David Higgins\n\nChairman\n\n## Phil Aspin\n\nChief Financial Officer",

The impacts of a changing climate mean that we need to protect our assets so that we continue to provide our essential services (see TCFD section on pages 86 to 99).\n\nSome of our critical assets also require maintenance, and sometimes replacement, as they age and the risk of service failure grows. The Haweswater Aqueduct is the region's most significant source of water, supplying 2.5 million customers in parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester with over 500 million litres of water every day. Inspections of the aqueduct undertaken after 60 years of continuous use revealed that urgent action was needed to replace one section of the aqueduct as well as a significant longer-term replacement programme.\n\nLast year, we successfully replaced the Hallbank section of the aqueduct, laying 2.5 kilometres of new pipe, which required reconfiguring our regional water supply system. This complex construction project was completed ahead of schedule and there was no interruption to water supplies.\n\nOur focus has turned to the work to replace the majority of the aqueduct. Called HARP, the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme, it is expected to be undertaken using a direct procurement for customers (DPC) approach and we have been\n\npreparing for a DPC tender in 2021/22. If the tender process proceeds as planned, contract award is anticipated in 2023, with construction to begin later in the AMP. To encourage participants to engage with the DPC process, we held a series of physical and virtual engagement events providing market participants with details about the scheme and, importantly, the opportunity to question us and shape the approach. Nearly 200 people representing over 70 companies tabled 80 questions over two virtual events.\n\nThe project will replace six separate tunnel sections, totalling 50 kilometres in length and will require nine planning applications to seven different planning authorities. As we describe on page 44, as a result of COVID-19 we have adopted a virtual consultation approach, which is proving to be more successful than traditional methods.\n\nAs one significant project to deliver more resilient water supplies gathers momentum, another is nearing completion. The \u00a3300 million West Cumbria water supplies project is on track to connect customers in the county with water from Thirlmere reservoir rather than from other local sources where environmental requirements mean we can no longer use them. Later in 2021, potable water will flow through a new treatment works and 100 kilometres of new pipework so that over 200,000 customers will receive their water from a new source.",

Key audit matters: including our assessment of risks of material misstatements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The effect of these matters is that,  as part of our risk assessment, we  determined that the recoverability of  trade receivables has a high degree  of estimation uncertainty in particular  because of the potential effects of the  COVID-19 pandemic, with a potential  range of reasonable outcomes greater  than our materiality for the financial  statements as a whole. The financial  statements (see pages 215 to 216  accounting policies) disclose the  sensitivity estimated by the group. The risk has increased in the current year  due to the likelihood of cash collection  profiles changing as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic, particularly when government  assistance is withdrawn. This will introduce  further uncertainty into the estimation. Subjective classification: The group has a substantial capital  programme which has been agreed with  the Water Services Regulation Authority  (Ofwat) and therefore incurs significant  annual expenditure in relation to the  development and maintenance of both  infrastructure and non-infrastructure assets. The determination of in-year project costs | probable on the date of initial recognition; \u00b7  Methodology choice:  assessed the appropriateness  of the customer debt provisioning policy based on  historical cash collections, credits, re-bills and write- off information, and estimates of future economic  scenarios and their impact on credit losses; \u00b7  Sensitivity analysis:  considered the sensitivity of the  key assumptions; and \u00b7  Assessing transparency:  assessed the adequacy  of the group's disclosures of its revenue recognition  and customer debt provisioning policies, including  the judgement involved in recording revenue and  estimation uncertainty of the doubtful debts provision. Our results: \u00b7  We found the amount of the revenue recognised to be  acceptable (2020: acceptable); and \u00b7  We considered the level of doubtful debt provisioning  to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\nMateriality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a319 million (2020: \u00a322 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before tax of \u00a3476.5 million, normalised to exclude net fair value gains or losses on debt and derivative instruments disclosed in note 6, of which it represents 4.1 per cent (2020: 4.5 per cent). The group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised group profit before tax.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a39 million (2020: \u00a312 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 0.0 per cent (2020: 0.3 per cent).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality was set at 75 per cent (2020 : 75 per cent) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a314.25 million (2020 : \u00a316.5 million) for the group and \u00a36.75 million (2020 : \u00a315 million) for the parent company.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nWe agreed to report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a30.5 million (2020: \u00a30.5 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nOf the group's 34 (2020: 34) reporting components, we subjected five (2020: six) to full scope audits for group purposes and one (2020: one) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter was not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for group purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.\n\nThe work on all five components (2020: five of the six) was conducted by the group team.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.\n\nFor the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a38 million to \u00a317.5 million (2020: \u00a32.5 million to \u00a320 million) having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the group across the components.\n\nThe group team visited none (2020: none) of the component locations to assess the audit risk and strategy. During the course of the audit we held video and telephone conference meetings with each of five (2020: seven) components.\n\nS\n\nt\n\nock C\n\node: UU\n\n.\n\n## Normalised group profit before tax\n\n\u00a3476.5m (2020: \u00a3493.8m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group revenue\n\n## Group profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group total assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Full scope for Group audit purposes 2021\n- Specified risk-focused audit procedures 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Full scope for Group audit purposes 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Specified risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Residual components\n\n## Group normalised profit before tax",

Going concern\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group's and the company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the group's and company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely affect the group's and company's available financial resources and metrics related to the possible failure of the Haweswater water system resulting in a one-off totex impact.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by assessing the directors' sensitivities over the level of available financial resources and covenant thresholds indicated by the group's financial forecasts taking account of severe, but plausible, adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing key assumptions in the forecasts: critically assessed assumptions in base case and downside scenarios relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics such as inflation rate growth compared to market forecasts, forecast bonus payments compared to historical bonus payments and forecast dividend payments compared to group dividend policy. This included assessing whether downside scenarios applied assumptions which are mutually consistent, using our assessment of the possible range of each key assumption and our knowledge of inter-dependencies;\n- \u00b7 Funding assessment: considered the availability of existing debt arrangements and committed loan facilities, including testing compliance with covenants and expected maturity dates;\n- \u00b7 Historical accuracy of managements forecasts: compared historical budgets to actual results to assess the directors' track record of budgeting accurately;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating directors' intent : evaluated the achievability of the actions the directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise, including assessment of mitigating actions within their control; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the matters covered in the going concern disclosure: considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities. We assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's or company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n\n- \u00b7 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the accounting policies to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the group and company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in the accounting policies to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 142 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in operation.\n\n## 5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations ability to detect\n\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the group's high level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 Reading board/audit committee/risk committee minutes; and\n- \u00b7 Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors including Long Term Plan awards.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition, the risk that group management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries, and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements such as revenue recognition and provisions for household customer debt, capitalisation of costs relating to the capital programme and valuation of retirement benefit obligations.\n\nFurther detail in respect of the above accounting estimates and judgements is set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included journals relating to revenue or treasury posted to unexpected or unrelated accounts; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required",

        "page_content": "by auditing standards), from inspection of the group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, pension legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: Ofwat, Environment Agency, Drinking Water Inspectorate, health and safety, anti-bribery, employment law, regulatory capital and liquidity and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the group's activities and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. We have nothing to report on the other information in the annual report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the annual report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- \u00b7 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' confirmation within the long-term viability statement on pages 142 to 143 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation in the long-term viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the long-term viability statement, set out on pages 142 to 143 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.  As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the group's and company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 196, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nU\n\n## 9. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. Further detail can be found in note A7.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese group and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and these group financial statements were also in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, accounting for the transfer of assets from customers and the revaluation of infrastructure assets to fair value on transition to IFRS.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results, ultimately, may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and that there are no material uncertainties to disclose.\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting the directors have reviewed the resources available to the group in the form of cash and committed facilities as well as consideration of the group's capital adequacy, along with a baseline plan that incorporates the expected impacts of COVID-19. The directors have considered the magnitude of potential impacts resulting from uncertain future events or changes in conditions, and the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that the directors would consider undertaking. The baseline position has been subjected to a number of severe but reasonable downside scenarios in order to assess the group's ability to operate within the amount and terms (including relevant covenants) of existing facilities. These scenarios consider: the potential impacts of increased totex costs, including a significant one-off totex impact arising in the assessment period; lower CPIH inflation; elevated levels of bad debt; outcome delivery incentive penalties; and the impact of these factors materialising on a combined basis. Mitigating actions were considered to include: deferral of capital expenditure; a reduction in other discretionary totex spend; the close-out of derivative asset balances; and the deferral or suspension of dividend payments.\n\nConsequently, the directors are satisfied that the group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, and that the severe but reasonable downside scenarios considered indicate that the group will be able to operate within the amount and terms (including relevant covenants) of existing facilities. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Adoption of new and revised standards\n\nThe following standards, interpretations and amendments, effective for the year ended 31 March 2021, are relevant to the group but have had no material impact on the group's financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 'Definition of a Business' (issued on 22 October 2018; and\n- \u00b7 Amendments were made to IAS 1 and IAS 8 'Definition of Material' (issued on 31 October 2018).\n\nThe IASB issued its revised Conceptual Framework in March 2018 which is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. It is not a standard and does not override any standard, but its principles apply to arrangements not covered by IFRS standards. No arrangements have been identified by the group which require a change in accounting treatment under the revised Conceptual Framework.\n\n## Early adopted new and revised standards\n\n'Phase Two' - IBOR reform\n\nIn January 2021, the Secretary of State for BEIS and the EU endorsed the IASB-published amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' in respect of interest rate benchmark reform, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 with early adoption permitted ('Phase Two' IBOR Reform).\n\nThe amendments address the financial reporting impact from reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and similar benchmark interest rates (IBOR Reform). The Bank of England has asked UK market participants to complete the transition to alternative risk-free rates by the end of 2021, with the industryled Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates having previously recommended the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) as the preferred risk-free rate in sterling markets.\n\nThe group chose to early-adopt the Phase Two reforms for the year ended 31 March 2021, though this has had no impact on the financial statements for the year then ended. When applicable, the group will take the relevant practical expedients from certain requirements in IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had a net balance of \u00a3591.3 million relating to financial instruments, along with an additional \u00a3700.0 million of undrawn committed facilities, still referencing LIBOR. Detail on the derivation of this net balance can be found in note A4, along with further information on the group's transition to alternative benchmarks. This figure is inclusive of \u00a32,117.8 million nominal value of swaps designated within fair value hedging relationships.\n\nThese Phase Two amendments will be applicable on modification of the instruments to be linked to the alternative risk-free rate, as well as when changes to the fair value hedges are required as a result of the reform. The reliefs provided for in this amendment mean that on transition to the new risk-free rate, no one-off charge or credit to the income statement will be recognised, provided the transition has occurred on an economically equivalent basis. The amendments also mean that the group expects no discontinuation of hedge accounting to be required on transition to the new interest rate benchmarks, with modifications to the documentation permitted, provided these are directly related to the IBOR reform.",

        "page_content": "The group has previously adopted 'Phase One' - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Interest rate benchmark reform, which allowed temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by IBOR reform. This temporary relief is expected to cease, on a hedge-byhedge basis, when the designated hedge relationship is amended and application of Phase Two reliefs begins.\n\nAs a result of the relief, the group expects that no material gain or loss will arise from the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative risk-free rate.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying its accounting policies set out in note A7, the group is required to make certain estimates, judgements and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These judgements, estimates and assumptions affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognised during the reporting periods presented. Changes to these estimates, judgements and assumptions could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. As estimates carry with them an inherent level of uncertainty, the group performs sensitivity analysis where this is practicable and where, in management's opinion, it provides useful and meaningful information. This sensitivity analysis is performed to understand a range of outcomes that could be considered reasonably possible based on experience and the facts and circumstances associated with individual areas of the financial statements that are subject to estimates.  Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\n\nAs part of the evaluation of critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, the group has considered the implications of climate change on its operations and activities, further details of which are set out below.\n\nThe following paragraphs detail the estimates and judgements the group believes to have the most significant impact on the annual results under IFRS, including specific considerations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful receivables\n\nAccounting estimate - The group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable has been deemed probable. In estimating the amount of revenue to recognise, where the group considers that the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a transaction, revenue recognition is delayed until such time as collectability is deemed  probable. There are two different criteria whereby management does not recognise revenue for amounts which have been billed to those customers on the basis that collectability is not probable. These are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The customer has not paid their bills for a period of at least two years; and\n- \u00b7 The customer has paid their bills in the preceding two years; however, has previously had bills de-recognised and has more than their current year debt outstanding.\n\nThis two-criteria approach resulted in a \u00a327.1 million reduction in revenue compared with what would have been recognised had no adjustment been made for amounts where collectability is not probable. Had management made an alternative judgement that where customers have paid in the preceding two years, and have more than their current year debt outstanding, the recoverability of the entirety of their debt was deemed to be probable (i.e. the second criteria were disapplied), the required adjustment to revenue would have been \u00a37.9 million lower.\n\nAccounting estimate - At each reporting date, the company and each of its subsidiaries evaluate the estimated recoverability of trade receivables and record allowances for expected credit losses based on experience. Estimates associated with these allowances are based on, among other things, a consideration of actual collection history. The actual level of receivables collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating results positively or negatively. At 31 March 2021, an allowance for expected credit losses relating to household customer debt of \u00a374.9 million was supported by a six-year cash collection projection. Based on a five-year or seven-year cash collection projection the allowance for doubtful receivables would have increased by \u00a31.3 million or reduced by \u00a30.6 million respectively.\n\nAt the prior year balance sheet date, the expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ability of some customers to pay their bills was specifically taken into consideration as part of the expected credit loss assessment for trade receivables. This gave rise to a further \u00a316.7 million incremental increase in the allowance for expected credit losses based on judgements around the likely impact of the pandemic on the non-payment risk profile of the group's customer base on a segmented basis.\n\nA high level of uncertainty remains around how current economic conditions could impact the recoverability of household receivables, particularly in light of further lockdowns during the year. As government support schemes such as furlough unwind, this could result in increased unemployment and therefore further impact the ability of some customers to pay.\n\nIn recognition of this future uncertainty, the allowance for expected credit losses covering the group's household customer base has been determined based on the assumption that cash collection experienced over the last two years continues into the future. This assumption supports the reported household bad debt charge of 2.2 per cent of household revenue and is considered to be a reasonable estimate of future collection. Had the group assumed that future collection was maintained at levels experienced during the last 12 months alone, the charge would have been increased by \u00a32.6 million to 2.4 per cent of household revenue. If the group had assumed that future collection improved to an average of actual collection experienced over the last 3 years, then the bad debt charge would have reduced by \u00a33.8 million to 1.8 per cent of household revenue\n\nAccounting estimate - United Utilities Water Limited raises bills in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the periodic regulatory price review processes. For household water and wastewater customers with water meters, the receivable billed is dependent on the volume supplied, including the sales value of an estimate of the units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the billing date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the last billing through to each reporting date. The estimated usage is based on historical data, judgement and assumptions; actual results could differ from these estimates, which would result in operating revenues being adjusted in the period that the revision to the estimates is determined.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nRevenue recognised for unbilled amounts for these customers at 31 March 2021 was \u00a369.4 million. Had actual consumption been 5 per cent higher or lower than the estimate of units supplied, this would have resulted in revenue recognised for unbilled amounts being \u00a34.8 million higher or lower respectively. For customers who do not have a meter, the receivable billed and revenue recognised is dependent on the rateable value of the property, as assessed by an independent rating officer. Consumption patterns during the year have been significantly impacted by changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, with household consumption having been above levels normally seen due to customers spending more time at home. As the year has progressed, the volume of household meter reads has gradually increased, resulting in the increased consumption during the pandemic period largely being captured in actual bills meaning that the level of estimation has reduced. By 31 March 2021, the system generated accrual had largely aligned to the independent automated meter read (AMR) data. AMR data is captured for around 25 per cent of all measured household customers, and this increase has been extrapolated across the remaining measured household customer base. The reasonableness of this approach has been validated through an assessment of bills raised in the period.\n\nAccounting estimate - Due to temporary business closures required as a result of lockdown measures put in place by the UK Government, the level of non-household consumption has fallen significantly throughout the year ended 31 March 2021. Revenue in relation to wholesale charges billed to non-household retailers is recognised based on a series of settlement statements produced by the Central Market Operating System (CMOS), operated by Market Operator Services Ltd (MOSL). When generating bills in the absence of a current meter read, CMOS uses the 12 months prior to the last meter read to assess expected consumption. Depending on when a meter was last read, the calculated volumetric charge may not be wholly reflective of the consumption during the period estimated due to the impact that COVID-19 has had on different industries in the year. In recognition of this issue, MOSL advised non-household retailers in December 2020 that they should consider the trading status of their customers and amend their Yearly Volume Estimate to adjust the wholesale charges calculated by CMOS. The group has performed its own estimations of the adjustments required to these charges determined by CMOS, and has accrued for an additional \u00a313.9 million of revenue in the year relating to non-household wholesale charges. This adjustment is based on an analysis of volume supplied for each particular end user at a supply point level, and comparing this with estimates in the CMOS system. Had this accrued income simply been based on the estimates calculated by CMOS, revenue would therefore have been \u00a313.9 million lower, though based on the volumetric analysis performed management considers that this position would be overly prudent.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nAccounting judgement - The group recognises property, plant and equipment (PPE) on its water and wastewater infrastructure assets where such expenditure enhances or increases the capacity of the network, whereas any expenditure classed as maintenance is expensed in the period it is incurred. Determining enhancement from maintenance expenditure requires an accounting judgement, particularly when projects have both elements within them. Enhancement spend was 58 per cent of total spend in relation to infrastructure assets during the year. A change of +/- 1 per cent would have resulted in \u00a34.0 million less/more expenditure being charged to the income statement during the period. In addition, management capitalises time and resources incurred by the group's support functions on capital programmes, which requires accounting judgements to be made in relation to the appropriate capitalisation rates. Support costs allocated to PPE represent 37\n\nper cent of total support costs. A change in allocation of +/- 5 per cent would have resulted in \u00a32.1 million less/more expenditure being charged to the income statement during the period.\n\nAccounting estimate - The estimated useful economic lives of PPE and intangible assets is based on management's experience. When management identifies that actual useful economic lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. Due to the significance of PPE and intangibles investment to the group, variations between actual and estimated useful economic lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively. As such, this is a key source of estimation uncertainty. The depreciation and amortisation expense for the year was \u00a3422.3 million. A 10 per cent increase in average asset lives would have resulted in a \u00a339.2 million reduction in this figure and a 10 per cent decrease in average asset lives would have resulted in a \u00a346.0 million increase in this figure.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nAccounting estimate - The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which are independent of the group's finances. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years. Profit before tax and net assets are affected by the actuarial assumptions used. The key assumptions include: discount rates, pay growth, mortality, and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions. It should be noted that actual rates may differ from the assumptions used due to changing market and economic conditions and longer or shorter lives of participants and, as such, this represents a key source of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities in respect of the assumptions used during the year are disclosed in note A5.\n\nAccounting estimate - Included within the group's defined benefit pension scheme assets are assets with a fair value estimated to be \u00a3268.0 million that are categorised as 'level 3' assets within the IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement' hierarchy, meaning that the value of the assets is not observable at 31 March 2021. Estimates of the fair value of these assets have been performed by the investment managers' valuation specialists using the latest available statements of each of the funds that make up the total level 3 asset balance, updated for any subsequent cash movements between the statement date and the year end reporting date.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nAccounting estimate - The model used to fair value the group's derivative financial instruments requires management to estimate future cash flows based on applicable interest rate curves. Projected cash flows are then discounted back using discount factors which are derived from the applicable interest rate curves adjusted for management's estimate of counterparty and own credit risk, where appropriate. Sensitivities relating to derivative financial instruments are included in note A4.\n\n## Joint ventures - Water Plus\n\nAccounting judgement - The group's financial interests in Water Plus Group Limited, a joint venture with Severn Trent PLC, comprise an investment in the ordinary shares of Water Plus, and loans issued to the joint venture in the form of revolving credit facilities and a zero coupon shareholder loan note, further details of which are included in note A6.\n\nPrior to 31 March 2021, it was proposed that existing working capital facilities extended to Water Plus by its shareholders would be restructured, resulting in each shareholder injecting a form of equity capital into the joint venture. United Utilities and Severn Trent would reconfigure an existing revolving credit facility, drawndown to \u00a332.5 million at the reporting date, into share capital, with the subscription price of this capital equalling the value of the cancelled revolving credit facility. On 23 April 2021, the revolving",

        "page_content": "credit facility was formally cancelled and the group completed the purchase of share capital.\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether, at the reporting date, this revolving credit facility forms part of the group's longterm interest in Water Plus whose value would be reduced in accordance with the group's share of joint venture losses in excess of the value of its equity investment when applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures'.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form, management view the revolving credit facility as forming part of the group's long-term interest in Water Plus at the balance sheet date. Timing differences existed between shareholder agreement to provide additional share capital (pre year-end) and the execution of the transaction (post yearend). The group has therefore determined that, in substance, it had an additional long-term interest in the Water Plus group at the reporting date.\n\nIn the year-ended 31 March 2020, the group's long-term interest in Water Plus was reduced to \u00a3nil. \u00a35.3 million of unrecognised losses existed at the balance sheet date. These previously unrecognised losses, together with the group's share of the Water Plus's losses in the year ended 31 March 2021 of \u00a38.9 million, have been allocated against the revolving credit facility at the balance sheet date. The \u00a314.2 million total share of losses has been recognised in the group's income statement for the year-ended 31 March 2021.\n\nHad an alternative judgement been applied such that this  revolving credit facility was not considered to be part of the group's longterm interest in Water Plus, the group's \u00a35.3 million unrecognised share of Water Plus's losses for the prior year and the group's \u00a38.9 million share of Water Plus's losses for the current year would not have been recognised in the income statement resulting in a lower share of losses from joint ventures, and the carrying value of the amount owed by Water Plus in respect of the revolving credit facility would have been higher by this amount. See note A6 for further details.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe group is continually developing its assessment of the impact that climate change has on the assets and liabilities recognised and presented in its financial statements.\n\nThe natural environment within which the group operates is constantly changing, and this influences how its water and wastewater services are to be delivered in the future. In addition, the group has embedded ambitious climate-related targets within its own operations, with this affecting the portfolio of assets required to deliver such services.\n\nThe impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of these financial statements across a number of areas, predominantly in respect of the valuation of the property, plant and equipment held by the group.\n\nAsset life reviews are undertaken regularly for facilities impacted by climate change, environmental legislation or the group's decarbonisation measures. In the prior year, depreciation was accelerated on a material value of bioresources facilities which were deemed to be commercially obsolete and for which no further use was planned, in part as a result of the group's decarbonisation strategy. In the current financial year, depreciation was accelerated totalling \u00a32.3 million at bioresource facilities impacted by changes in environmental legislative requirements.\n\nThe group is exposed to potential asset write-downs following flooding resulting from extreme weather events, the frequency of which are expected to increase as the effects of climate change become more apparent. Following large-scale flooding, items\n\nare identified that have been damaged beyond repair and require immediate accounting write-downs. No such charges were required in the current financial year.\n\nThe group has looked to further enhance the accuracy of its useful life assessment through the introduction of more forward-looking information in asset life reviews. This includes the use of data from the Pioneer strategic asset planning system to assess the economic point of replacement for assets under future investment and performance scenarios.  This information is to be used alongside other decommissioning data to inform useful economic asset lives.\n\nThe group mitigates the exposure that the carrying value of its book asset base has to climate-related risks through strategic planning activities that incorporate defined climate scenarios, climate change mitigation pledges, and long-term climate projections. The group installs permanent flood defences and other resilience measures at the most vulnerable facilities to protect its assets.",

The group's performance is measured against financial and operational key performance indicators which align with its three strategic themes to deliver the best service to customers, at the lowest sustainable cost, in a responsible manner. The board reviews revenue, operating profit and gearing, along with operational drivers at a consolidated level (see pages 50 to 81). In light of this, the group has a single segment for financial reporting purposes and therefore no further detailed segmental information is provided in this note.\n\n## 2 Revenue\n\nThe group's revenue predominantly arises from the provision of services within the United Kingdom, with less than 1 per cent of external revenue and non-current assets being overseas.\n\n2021\n\n|                              | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m      |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Wholesale water charges      | 751.0   | 784.8   |\n| Wholesale wastewater charges | 941.5   | 939.5   |\n| Household retail charges     | 64.1    | 83.8    |\n| Other                        | 51.4    | 51.2    |\n|                              | 1,808.0 | 1,859.3 |\n\n2020\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, revenue has been disaggregated based on what is recognised in relation to the core services of supplying clean water and the removal and treatment of wastewater. Each of these services is deemed to give rise to a distinct performance obligation under the contract with customers, although following the same pattern of transfer to the customer who simultaneously receives and consumes both of these services over time.\n\nWholesale water and wastewater charges relate to services provided to household customers and non-household retailers. Household retail charges relate solely to the margin applied to the wholesale amounts charged to residential customers. These wholesale charges and the applicable retail margin are combined in arriving at the total revenues relating to water and wastewater services provided to household customers. No margin is applied to wholesale water and wastewater services provided to non-household retailers.\n\nOther revenues comprise a number of smaller non-core income streams, including those relating to energy generation and export, and those associated with activities, typically performed opposite property developers, which impact the group's capital network assets, including diversions works to relocate water and wastewater assets, and activities that facilitate the creation of an authorised connection through which properties can obtain water and wastewater services.\n\n## 3 Directors and employees\n\nDirectors' remuneration\n\n|                                 |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fees to non-executive directors |       0.8 |       0.8 |\n| Salaries                        |       1.2 |       1.4 |\n| Benefits                        |       0.2 |       0.3 |\n| Bonus                           |       0.7 |       0.7 |\n| Share-based payment charge      |       1.7 |       1   |\n|                                 |       4.6 |       4.2 |\n\nFurther information about the remuneration of individual directors and details of their pension arrangements are provided in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 167 to 189.\n\nRemuneration of key management personnel\n\n|                                           |   2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Salaries and short-term employee benefits |       6.3 | 6.4       |\n| Share-based payment charge                |       3   | 1.3       |\n|                                           |       9.3 | 7. 7      |\n\nKey management personnel comprises all directors and certain senior managers who are members of the executive team.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 4 Operating profit continued\n\nIncluded within depreciation of property, plant and equipment was \u00a32.3 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from the group's strategic bioresources review. This compares with accelerated depreciation of certain bioresources assets amounting to \u00a382.3 million in the prior year, primarily relating to incineration assets at the group's Mersey Valley Sludge Processing Centre, known as Shell Green. The accelerated depreciation in both years reflects the outcomes of the strategic review, whereby the likelihood of the group deriving future economic benefit from these assets was considered remote in light of improvements in alternative lower-cost and more environmentally friendly processes. In addition to this, in the prior year, inventory spares held for use by these assets were written down to \u00a3nil.\n\nExcluding the impact of this current and prior year accelerated depreciation, the group's depreciation and amortisation expense has increased by \u00a319.5 million in the current year, principally reflecting the higher capital expenditure programme in AMP6 with a higher number of assets commissioned towards the end of the AMP. In the near term this depreciation and amortisation expense is expected to flatten out, reflecting the lower AMP7 capital programme.\n\nDuring the prior year, the group incurred operating costs of \u00a319.2 million in relation to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, comprising \u00a316.7 million in relation to allowances for expected credit losses in respect of household trade receivables, \u00a31.4 million allowances for expected credit losses in respect of non-household trade receivables, and \u00a31.1 million of other operating expenses. The additional allowances for expected credit losses reflected the group's estimate of the potential impact of the pandemic on the recoverability of receivables over and above its existing expected credit loss assessment, and was treated as an adjusting item in arriving at the group's underlying operating profit included in its alternative performance measures. This was possible given the proximity of the group's year end reporting date to the introduction of lockdown measures in the UK.\n\nIncremental costs for the year ended 31 March 2021 arising as a result of the pandemic are estimated to be around \u00a38 million of operating costs, though these have been partially offset by savings realised elsewhere, and around \u00a35 million of additional costs associated with expected credit losses due to the increased risk associated with cash collection as government support schemes are withdrawn. With the passage of time, and with the conditions brought about by the pandemic becoming embedded into normal processes during the current year, the group considers that, for the purpose of presenting an underlying operating profit position, splitting out these costs does not provide meaningful or useful additional information.\n\nProperty rates expenses in the current year include the impact of \u00a31.1 million (2020: \u00a38.1 million) of refunds in relation to rates paid in previous years, and \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a38.2 million) reduction in accrued rates costs. These reductions ensure that the cumulative costs associated with property rates paid by the group are appropriately recorded.\n\nResearch and development expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2021 was \u00a31.0 million (2020: \u00a31.0 million). In addition, \u00a36.2 million (2020: \u00a3nil) of costs have been accrued by United Utilities Water Limited in relation to the Innovation in Water Challenge scheme operated by Ofwat for AMP7, which therefore did not apply in the prior year. These expenses directly offset \u00a36.2 million recognised in revenue during the year intended to fund innovation projects across England and Wales as part of an industry-wide scheme to promote innovation in the sector. The amounts accrued will either be spent on innovation projects that the group successfully bids for or will be transferred to other successful water companies in accordance with the scheme rules.\n\nDuring the year, the group obtained the following services from its auditor:\n\n|                                                             | 2021  \u00a3'000   | 2020  \u00a3'000   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Audit services                                              |               |               |\n| Statutory audit - group and company                         | 170           | 119           |\n| Statutory audit - subsidiaries                              | 508           | 355           |\n|                                                             | 678           | 474           |\n| Non-audit services                                          |               |               |\n| Regulatory audit services provided by the statutory auditor | 71            | 62            |\n| Other non-audit services                                    | 120           | 77            |\n| Total audit and non-audit services                          | 869           | 613           |\n\n5\n\nInvestment income\n\nInterest receivable on short-term bank deposits held at amortised cost\n\n3.8\n\n6.0\n\nInterest receivable on loans to joint ventures held at amortised cost (see note A6)\n\n3.7\n\n4.0\n\nNet pension interest income (see note 18)\n\n1 7. 5\n\n14.0\n\n25.0\n\n24.0\n\n2021\n\n\u00a3m\n\n2020\n\n\u00a3m",

This has been calculated by applying an average capitalisation rate of 2.3 per cent (2020: 3.2 per cent) to expenditure on such assets as prescribed by IAS 23 'Borrowing Costs'.\n\nIn addition to the \u00a3107.2 million finance expense, the allowance for expected credit losses in relation to loans extended to the group's joint venture, Water Plus, has decreased by \u00a33.7 million during the current year. This is primarily due to refinancing of facilities extended to Water Plus, which has resulted in a lower exposure to expected credit in the future (see note A6 for further details).\n\nUnderlying finance expense, which forms part of the group's APMs set out on pages 82 to 83, is calculated by adjusting net finance expense and investment income of \u00a378.5 million (2020: \u00a3289.0 million) reported in the Income statement to exclude the \u00a354.3 million of fair value gains (2020: \u00a392.8 million fair value losses) on debt and derivative instruments included in the above table. In addition, underlying finance expense in the prior year excluded the impact of the \u00a35.0 million allowance for expected credit losses on amounts owed by Water Plus, which was recognised in response to a significant increase in credit risk following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u00a33.7 million credit reducing the expected credit loss allowance in the current year has not been excluded from the calculation of underlying finance expense as it reflects reduced exposure to future credit losses arising as a result of the refinancing of facilities to Water Plus in the normal course of business.",

In the prior year, this included the adjustment arising from a change in the rate at which the deferred tax liabilities are measured, from 17 per cent to 35 per cent. This change in rate reflected a revised judgement as to the most likely method by which the defined benefit pension surplus would be realised. Whereas prior to the year ended 31 March 2020 it was assumed that the surplus could be realised through a reduction in future contributions, from the year ended 31 March 2020 onwards management considers that the most likely method of realisation would be through a refund, which would be taxed at the rate applicable to refunds from a trust (currently 35 per cent).\n\n## 8 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                        | \u00a3m    | \u00a3m    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the company - continuing operations | 453.4 | 106.8 |\n|                                                                                        | 2021  | 2020  |\n|                                                                                        | pence | pence |\n| Earnings per share                                                                     |       |       |\n| Basic                                                                                  | 66.5  | 15.7  |\n| Diluted                                                                                | 66.3  | 15.6  |\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 681.9 million being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2020: 681.9 million).

Due to the nature of the group's operations, many of the group's leases have extremely long terms, ranging from one year to 999 years. The group does not typically lease assets on a short-term basis or enter into leases for low value asset and therefore no material costs were incurred during the year, either individually or in aggregate, in relation to lease contracts with a duration of less than 12 months or for low-value assets.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to \u00a3335.8 million (2020: \u00a3432.6 million). In addition to these commitments, the group has long-term expenditure plans which include investments to achieve improvements in performance required by regulators and to provide for future growth.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no property, plant and equipment or contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.",

The \u00a314.2 million total share of losses recognised in the income statement during the year has been allocated against the fully drawn \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility extended to Water Plus by United Utilities PLC, which is presented within amounts owed by related parties included within trade and other receivables (see note 14). This facility forms part of the group's long-term interest in the Water Plus joint venture given that at 31 March 2021 there was a clear expectation that it would be converted into additional equity share capital, with this transaction subsequently executed on 23 April 2021.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2020, the \u00a346.2 million recognised share of losses comprised \u00a336.7 million which was allocated to the group's equity investment, and \u00a39.5 million which was allocated to the zero coupon shareholder loan notes extended to Water Plus as this forms part of the group's long-term interest in the joint venture. The share of losses recognised against each component of the group's net investment in Water Plus reduced each of them to \u00a3nil at 31 March 2020.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the group completed the disposal of its stake in the Tallinn Water joint venture for consideration of EUR 100.3 million (\u00a385.3 million). The value of this stake at the time it was sold, after recognising a \u00a34.9 million share of profits, receipt of a \u00a36.4 million dividend, and \u00a31.6 million of foreign exchange losses, was \u00a343.7 million. This resulted in a profit on disposal of \u00a340.7 million after taking account of \u00a30.9 million of disposal costs. On disposal, the \u00a34.0 million balance of the accumulated foreign exchange losses making up the cumulative exchange reserve, all of which had accumulated in relation to the Tallinn Water joint venture, was reclassified to profit and loss resulting in a total recognised profit on disposal of \u00a336.7 million.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2020, the group completed the disposal of its overseas investment in the Muharraq sewerage treatment plant. Consideration of \u00a310.9 million was equal to the fair value at which the asset was carried at the point at which it was sold, resulting in no gain or loss on disposal. Prior to this disposal, the group received \u00a31.1 million in repayment of shareholder loans, resulting in a total cash inflow for the year ended 31 March 2020 of \u00a312.0 million in relation to the disposal of this investment.\n\nDetails of transactions between the group and its joint ventures and other investments are disclosed in note A6.\n\n## Company\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the company's investments related solely to its investments in United Utilities PLC, which was recorded at a cost of \u00a36,326.8 million (2020: \u00a36,326.8 million).\n\n## 13 Inventories\n\n| Group                      |   \u00a3m |   \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------|------|------|\n| Properties held for resale |  2.5 |  4.5 |\n| Other inventories          | 15.8 | 12.1 |\n|                            | 18.3 | 16.6 |\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no inventories at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.\n\n## 14 Trade and other receivables\n\n|                                               | Group   | Group   | Company 2020   | Company 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                               | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m        | \u00a3m             |\n| Trade receivables                             | 63.5    | 81.2    | -              | -              |\n| Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings       | -       | -       | 91.9           | 81.3           |\n| Amounts owed by related parties (see note A6) | 113.8   | 147.9   | -              | -              |\n| Other debtors and prepayments                 | 34.3    | 39.1    | -              | -              |\n| Accrued income                                | 104.3   | 74.7    | -              | -              |\n|                                               | 315.9   | 342.9   | 91.9           | 81.3           |\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had \u00a386.7 million (2020: \u00a397.0 million) of trade and other receivables classified as non-current, all of which was owed by related parties (2020: \u00a395.0 million) .\n\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.",

In the year ended 31 March 2020, an allowance for expected credit losses of \u00a318.1 million was recognised in relation to trade and other receivables, reflecting the direct impact of COVID-19 estimated at the onset of the pandemic In the year ended 31 March 2021, a further charge of around \u00a35 million was recognised due to increased risk associated with cash collection as government support schemes are withdrawn.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the group had no trade receivables that were past due and not individually impaired.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the ageing of net trade receivables that were past due and individually impaired:\n\n| At 31 March 2021                     | Aged   less than one  year   \u00a3m   | Aged   between one  year and two  years   \u00a3m   | Aged   greater than  two years   \u00a3m   | Carrying   value   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Gross trade receivables              | 61.9                              | 35.3                                           | 44.4                                  | 141.7                   |\n| Allowance for expected credit losses | (19.9)                            | (16.5)                                         | (43.9)                                | (80.4)                  |\n| Net trade receivables                | 42.0                              | 18.8                                           | 0.5                                   | 61.3                    |\n\n|                                      | Aged                            | Aged                                  | Aged                                | Aged                  |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| At 31 March 2020                     | Aged   less than one  year   \u00a3m | between one  year and two  years   \u00a3m | Aged   greater than  two years   \u00a3m | Carrying   value   \u00a3m |\n| Gross trade receivables              | 72.8                            | 31.6                                  | 43.4                                | 146.9                 |\n| Allowance for expected credit losses | (19.3)                          | (15.7)                                | (36.4)                              | ( 71.4)               |\n| Net trade receivables                | 53.5                            | 15.9                                  | 7. 0                                | 76.4                  |\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had \u00a32.2 million (2020: \u00a34.8 million) of trade receivables that were not past due.\n\nThe majority of accrued income balances represent contract assets arising from timing differences between the billing cycle and the usage of water by customers. They therefore typically reverse in subsequent months, with all amounts held in relation to these contract assets at the beginning of the reporting period having subsequently reversed into the income statement during the year. At 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the group had no accrued income that was past due. In instances where the collection of consideration is not considered probable at the point services are delivered, no accrued income balance is recognised, as the criteria to recognise revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 has not been met.\n\n## Company\n\nAt 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the company had no trade receivables that were past due.\n\nThe carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.",

Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law and spread the tax relief due over a pre-determined standard number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment, where the expenditure is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially. Due to the group's continued significant annual capital expenditure, the deductions for capital allowances are expected to exceed depreciation for the medium term and continue to impact future corporation tax payments.\n\nGiven the fully funded nature of the group's defined benefit pension schemes, the retirement benefit obligations primarily relate to deferred taxation on the pensions schemes surplus position. This amount is significantly impacted by financial market conditions and long-term inflation expectations and therefore it is difficult to forecast future movements. However, these movements have no impact on medium-term future corporation tax payments as they only impact year-on-year deferred tax movement.\n\nDeferred tax on retirement benefit obligations can arise where there are year-on-year differences between the contributions paid and the associated amounts charged to the profit and loss account. However, given the fully funded nature of our pension schemes, any such deferred tax movements, together with the associated impact on future corporation tax payments, are not expected to be significant for the medium term.\n\nThe other short-term temporary differences are mainly in relation to the year-on-year movement in financial transactions which are sensitive to fair value movement on treasury derivatives and can therefore fluctuate significantly from year to year. However, these movements have no impact on future corporation tax payments as they only impact the year-on-year deferred tax movement.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no deferred tax assets or liabilities at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.",

The merger reserve arose in the same year on consolidation and represents the capital adjustment to reserves required to effect the reverse acquisition.\n\nThe group recognises the cost of hedging reserve as a component of equity. This reserve reflects accumulated fair value movements on cross-currency swaps resulting from changes in the foreign currency basis spread, which represents a liquidity charge inherent in foreign exchange contracts for exchanging currencies and is excluded from the designation of cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments.\n\nThe group designates a number of swaps hedging non-financial risks in cash flow hedge relationships to give a more representative view of operating costs. Fair value movements relating to the effective part of these swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company's other reserves at 31 March 2021, 31 March 2020 and 1 April 2019, were comprised entirely of a \u00a31,033.3 million capital redemption reserve that arose as a result of a return of capital to shareholders following the acquisition of United Utilities PLC by the company in the year ended 31 March 2009.",

The deferred shares convey no right to income, no right to vote and no appreciable right to participate in any surplus capital in the event of a winding up.\n\n## 24  Contingent liabilities\n\nSince 2016, the group has received indications from a number of groups of property search companies (PSCs) that they intend to claim compensation for amounts paid in respect of CON29DW water and drainage search reports, which they allege should have been provided to them either free of charge or for a nominal fee in accordance with the Environmental Information Regulations. In April 2020, a group of over 100 PSCs, comprising companies within the groups that had previously issued notice of intended claims, served proceedings on all of the water and sewerage undertakers in England and Wales, including United Utilities Water Limited, for an unspecified amount of compensation. This is an industry-wide issue with the litigation currently in its early stages. While the litigation's likely direction and the quantum of any compensation being claimed is uncertain at this stage, based on the information currently available, the likelihood of the claim's success is considered to be low, and any potential outflow is not expected to be material.\n\nThe group has credit support guarantees as well as general performance commitments and potential liabilities under contract that may give rise to financial outflow. The group has determined that the possibility of any outflow arising in respect of these potential liabilities is remote and, as such, there are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in this regard (2020: none).\n\nThe company has not entered into performance guarantees as at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.\n\n## 25  Events after the reporting period\n\nOn 3 March 2021, an increase in the headline rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent from 1 April 2023 was announced in the Chancellor's Budget. This increase was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021 and will result in a future deferred tax charge currently estimated at around \u00a3380 million. As this substantive enactment occurred after the reporting date, no adjustments have been made to current or deferred tax amounts recognised in the financial statements at and for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, the group's board of directors approved a plan to market the group's renewable energy business, United Utilities Renewable Energy Limited, for sale. This process is expected to commence during June 2021 and will involve the sale of assets - primarily property, plant and equipment - with a carrying value of \u00a365.5 million in the group's consolidated statement of financial position at 31 March 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, the group and its joint venture partner, Severn Trent PLC, each subscribed to \u00a332.5 million of additional equity share capital issued by Water Plus. Simultaneously, the fully drawn \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facilities issued by United Utilities PLC and Severn Trent PLC to Water Plus were cancelled. Accordingly, the group's equity investment in the Water Plus joint venture increased by \u00a332.5 million, with the \u00a314.2 million share of joint venture losses recognised against the \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facilities during the year being reallocated against the equity investment to bring its value down to \u00a318.3 million. The replacement of debt financing with equity shortly after 31 March 2021 further supports the accounting judgement taken to treat the fully drawn \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility as part of the group's long-term interest in Water Plus.",

This updated approach is now consistent with that taken by credit rating agencies, and better reflects the underlying regulatory economics. Under this revised definition net debt comprises borrowings, net of cash and short-term deposits and derivatives, but excluding the fair value of group's fixed interest rate swaps, electricity derivatives, and inflation swaps (apart from the principal accretion element). Previously net debt has been defined as borrowings, net of cash and short-term deposits and derivatives.\n\nFair value movements on borrowings and their associated swaps that are included in net debt are not materially opposite in value for the year ended 31 March 2021. The effects of COVID-19 on financial market volatility in the period has impacted the credit spread recognised on the group's fair-value option debt, and material basis spread adjustments have been recorded on the group's cross-currency swaps. Both of these items have been recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, material credit spread adjustments have been recorded with respect to the group's derivatives in fair value hedge relationships, which has been recorded in the consolidated income statement in the period.",

As well as managing our exposure to these risks, these policies help the group maintain compliance with relevant financial covenants, which are in place primarily in relation to borrowings from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and include interest cover and gearing metrics. These policies are reviewed by the treasury committee for approval on at least an annual basis, or following any major changes in treasury operations and/or financial market conditions.\n\nDay-to-day responsibility for operational compliance with the treasury policies rests with the treasurer. An operational compliance report is provided monthly to the treasury committee, which details the status of the group's compliance with the treasury policies and highlights the level of risk against the appropriate risk limits in place.\n\nThe group's treasury function does not act as a profit centre and does not undertake any speculative trading activity.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe group looks to manage its liquidity risk by maintaining liquidity within a board-approved duration range. Liquidity is actively monitored by the group's treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the group had \u00a31,444.1 million (2020: \u00a31,208.1 million) of available liquidity, which comprised \u00a3744.1 million (2020: \u00a3528.1 million) of cash and short-term deposits and \u00a3700.0 million (2020: \u00a3680.0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.\n\nThe group had available committed borrowing facilities as follows:\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n| Group                                              | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Expiring within one year                           | 100.0   | 50.0    |\n| Expiring after one year but in less than two years | 100.0   | 100.0   |\n| Expiring after more than two years                 | 600.0   | 650.0   |\n| Total borrowing facilities                         | 800.0   | 800.0   |\n| Facilities drawn (1)                               | (100.0) | (120.0) |\n| Undrawn borrowing facilities                       | 700.0   | 680.0   |\n\n## Note:\n\n(1)  Facilities expiring after more than two years.\n\nThese facilities are arranged on a bilateral rather than a syndicated basis, which spreads the maturities more evenly over a longer time period, thereby reducing the refinancing risk by providing several renewal points rather than a large single refinancing point.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company did not have any committed facilities available at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nConcentrations of risk may arise if large cash flows are concentrated within particular time periods. The maturity profile in the following table represents the forecast future contractual principal and interest cash flows in relation to the group's financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis. Derivative cash flows have been shown net where there is a contractual agreement to settle on a net basis; otherwise the cash flows are shown gross. This table does not include the impact of lease liabilities for which the maturity profile has been disclosed in note 17.\n\n| Group At 31 March 2021           | Total (1) \u00a3m   | Adjust- ment (2)  \u00a3m   | 1 year or  less \u00a3m   | 1-2 years  \u00a3m   | 2-3 years  \u00a3m   | 3-4 years  \u00a3m   | 4-5 years  \u00a3m   | More than  5 years  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Bonds                            | 11,368.2       |                        | 528.1                | 132.6           | 133.6           | 584.7           | 255.6           | 9,733.6                  |\n| Bank and other term borrowings   | 2,274.8        |                        | 280.4                | 348.7           | 122.4           | 254.3           | 257.3           | 1,011.7                  |\n| Adjustment to carrying value (2) | (5,251.2)      | (5,251.2)              |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Borrowings                       | 8,391.8        | (5,251.2)              | 808.5                | 481.3           | 256.0           | 839.0           | 512.9           | 10,745.3                 |\n| Derivatives:                     |                |                        |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Payable                          | 1,001.2        |                        | 133.4                | 43.1            | 38.0            | 36.0            | 129.2           | 621.5                    |\n| Receivable                       | (1,499.7)      |                        | (186.0)              | (125.6)         | (92.0)          | (99.7)          | (202.3)         | (794.1)                  |\n| Adjustment to carrying value (2) | 188.5          | 188.5                  |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Derivatives - net assets         | (310.0)        | 188.5                  | (52.6)               | (82.5)          | (54.0)          | (63.7)          | ( 7 3.1 )       | (172.6)                  |",

While the opening of the non-household retail market to competition from 1 April 2017 has impacted on the profile of the group's concentration of credit risk, as discussed further below, the group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations that could have an impact on its ability to continue as a going concern or its longer-term viability.\n\nThe group manages its risk from trading through the effective management of customer relationships. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables from household customers are limited due to the customer base being comprised of a large number of unrelated households. However, collection can be challenging as the Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits the disconnection of a water supply and the limiting of supply with the intention of enforcing payment for certain premises, including domestic dwellings.\n\nFollowing the non-household retail market opening to competition, credit risk in this area is now concentrated in a small number of retailers to whom the group provides wholesale water and wastewater services. Retailers are licensed and monitored by Ofwat and as part of the regulations they must demonstrate that they have adequate resources available to supply services. The credit terms for the group's retail customers are set out in market codes.\n\nIn reaction to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes were made to the payment terms set out within the market codes. These changes provided the option for extended credit terms for retailers. However, this has now ended and all outstanding payments have been made. As at 31 March 2021, Water Plus was the group's single largest debtor, with amounts outstanding in relation to wholesale services of \u00a327.2 million (2020: \u00a352.7 million). During the year, sales to Water Plus in relation to wholesale services were \u00a3362.9 million (2020: \u00a3438.3 million). Details of transactions with Water Plus can be found in note A6\n\nUnder the group's revenue recognition policy, revenue is only recognised when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Considering the above, the directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 14).\n\nThe group manages its credit risk from treasury activities by establishing a total credit limit by counterparty, which comprises a counterparty credit limit and an additional settlement limit to cover intra-day gross settlement of cash flows. In addition, potential derivative exposure limits are established to take account of potential future exposure which may arise under derivative transactions. These limits are calculated by reference to a measure of capital and credit ratings of the individual counterparties and are subject to a maximum single counterparty limit.\n\nCredit limits are refreshed annually and reviewed in the event of any credit rating action. Additionally, a control mechanism to trigger a review of specific counterparty limits, irrespective of credit rating action, is in place. This entails daily monitoring of counterparty credit default swap levels and/or share price volatility. Credit exposure is monitored daily by the group's treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.",

At 31 March 2021, the group held \u00a350.7 million (2020: \u00a372.2 million) as collateral in relation to derivative financial instruments (included within short-term bank borrowings - fixed in note A3).\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe group's exposure to market risk primarily results from its financing arrangements and the economic return which it is allowed on the regulatory capital value (RCV).\n\nThe group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage the exposure to these risks.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nThe group earns an economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV.\n\nFor the 2020-2025 regulatory period, from 1 April 2020 the group's RCV is 50 per cent linked to RPI inflation and 50 per cent linked to CPIH inflation, with any new additions being added to the CPIH portion of the RCV.\n\nThe group's inflation hedging policy aims to have around half of the group's net debt in index-linked form (where it is economic to do so), by issuing index-linked debt and/or swapping a portion of nominal debt. This is currently weighted towards RPI-linked form, with circa 75 per cent of the hedge linked to RPI and circa 25 per cent linked to CPI and/or CPIH (from circa 87 per cent RPI-linked and circa 13 per cent CPI-linked as at 31 March 2020).\n\nThe group believes this is an appropriate inflation hedging policy, taking into account a balanced assessment of the following factors: economic hedge of United Utilities Water Limited's (UUW) RCV and revenues; cash flow timing mismatch between allowed cost of debt and the group's incurred cost of debt; the inflation risk premium that is generally incorporated into nominal debt costs; income statement volatility; hedging costs; debt maturity profile mismatch risk; and index-linked hedging positioning relative to the water sector.\n\nAs a result of the evaluation of the above factors, the group continues to identify opportunities to maintain around 50 per cent of the group's net debt being hedged for inflation, which can be evidenced by the increase in the CPI/CPIH-linked hedge proportion over the past few years. Inflation risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee in the operational compliance report.\n\nThe carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group, including the carrying value of the nominal debt swapped to CPI, was \u00a34,093.3 million at 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a34,082.2 million).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity of profit before tax to changes in the RPI and CPI on the group's index-linked borrowings. The sensitivity analysis has been based on the amount of index-linked debt held at the reporting date and, as such, is not indicative of the years then ended. In addition, it excludes the impact of inflation on revenues and other income statement costs as well as the hedging aspect of the group's regulatory assets and post-retirement obligations.\n\n| Increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1% increase in RPI/CPI                                | (35.4)    | (39.6)    |\n| 1% decrease in RPI/CPI                                | 35.4      | 39.6      |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes a 1 per cent change in RPI and CPI having a corresponding 1 per cent impact on this position over a 12-month period. It should be noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI and CPI changes impact on the income statement, and the analysis does not incorporate this factor. The portfolio of index-linked debt is calculated on either a three- or eightmonth lag basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest and principal adjustments impacting the income statement are fixed and based on the annual RPI or CPI change either three or eight months earlier.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no material exposure to inflation risk at 31 March 2021 or 31 March 2020.",

        "page_content": "## A4  Financial risk management continued\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nThe group's policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cash flows. The group currently earns an economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV (see inflation risk section for changes being introduced by Ofwat to inflation indexation from 2020).\n\nFrom 1 April 2020 for the regulatory period to 2025, Ofwat has continued to set a fixed real cost of debt in relation to embedded debt (80 per cent of net debt), but has introduced a debt indexation mechanism in relation to new debt (20 per cent of net debt), where the allowed rate on new debt will vary in line with specific debt indices. The debt indexation mechanism will be settled as an end of regulatory period adjustment.\n\nTherefore, sterling index-linked debt is left unswapped at inception, in accordance with our inflation hedging policy goal to maintain around half of the group's net debt in index-linked form. Conventional nominal debt is hedged as set out below.\n\nWhere conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt is generally swapped at inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest rate swaps. These instruments are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge.\n\nTo manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest rates on nominal debt out to 10 years in advance on a reducing balance basis. As such, at the start of each regulatory period, a proportion of the projected nominal net debt representing new debt for that regulatory period, will remain floating until it is fixed via the above 10-year reducing balance basis, which should approximate Ofwat's new debt indexation mechanism.\n\nThis interest rate hedging policy dovetails with our inflation hedging policy should we need to swap a portion of nominal debt to real rate form to maintain our desired mix of nominal and index-linked debt.\n\nThe group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining its interest rate exposure within a board-approved range. Interest rate risk is reported to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity of the group's profit before tax and equity to changes in interest rates. The sensitivity analysis has been based on the amount of net debt and the interest rate hedge positions in place at the reporting date and, as such, is not indicative of the years then ended.\n\nGroup\n\nCompany\n\n| Increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m    | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| 1% increase in interest rate                          | 130.7     | 122.7     | ( 1 7. 8 ) | (17.5)    |\n| 1% decrease in interest rate                          | (134.7)   | (131.0)   | 1 7. 8     | 1 7. 5    |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes that both fair value hedges and borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged and it excludes the impact on post-retirement obligations. The exposure largely relates to fair value movements on the group's fixed interest rate swaps which manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates. Those swaps are not included in hedge relationships.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDetails regarding the interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to manage interest rate risk are summarised below:\n\n1 year or less\n\n1 to 2 years\n\n2 to 5 years\n\nOver 5 years\n\n| Notional principal amount \u00a3m             |   375.0 | -   |   450.0 |   1,325.0 |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|-----|---------|-----------|\n| Average contracted fixed interest rate % |    1.98 | -   |    1.36 |         2 |\n\nThis table represents the derivatives that are held in fair value hedging relationships, with only the weighted average for the fixed interest elements of the swaps disclosed.\n\nFurther detail on the fair value hedging relationships is provided below:\n\n|                                   | Nominal  amount of  the hedging   | Carrying  amount of  the hedging   | Accumulated  fair value  (gains)/losses  on hedged   | Fair value (gains)/losses* used for calculating hedge ineffectiveness for the year   | ended 31 March 2021 (1) Hedging   | Hedge  ineffective- ness  recognised   | Nominal  amount of  hedging  instruments  directly  impacted by   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   |                                   |                                    |                                                      |                                                                                      |                                   | in the income                          |                                                                   |\n|                                   | instruments                       | instruments                        | items                                                | Hedged items                                                                         | instruments                       | statement                              | IBOR reform                                                       |\n|                                   | \u00a3m                                |                                    |                                                      |                                                                                      |                                   |                                        |                                                                   |\n| Risk exposure                     |                                   | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                                   | \u00a3m                                                                                   | \u00a3m                                | \u00a3m                                     | \u00a3m                                                                |\n|                                   |                                   | 215.9                              |                                                      |                                                                                      |                                   | 2.0                                    | 1,675.0                                                           |\n| Interest rate risk on  borrowings | 2,150.0                           |                                    | 198.6                                                | (88.9)                                                                               | 90.9                              |                                        |                                                                   |\n\n## Note:",

To manage exposure to currency rates, foreign currency debt is hedged into sterling through the use of cross-currency swaps and these are often designated within a fair value accounting hedge. The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining currency exposure within board-approved limits. Currency risk in relation to foreign currency denominated financial instruments is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report. The group and company have no material net exposure to movements in currency rates.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDetails regarding the cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to manage currency and interest rate risk are summarised below:\n\n|                                          | 1 year or less   | 1 to 2 years   |   2 to 5 years |   Over 5 years |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Notional principal amount \u00a3m             | -                | -              |          99.9  |         369.7  |\n| Average contracted fixed interest rate % | -                | -              |           2.71 |           2.29 |\n\nThis table represents the derivatives that are held in fair value hedging relationships, with only the weighted average for the fixed interest rate elements of the swap disclosed.\n\nFurther detail on the fair value hedging relationships is provided below:\n\n|                        | Nominal                             | Carrying  amount of         | Accumulated  fair value             | Fair value (gains)/losses*  used for calculating hedge  ineffectiveness for the year  ended 31 March 2021   | (1)                  | Hedge  ineffective- ness                | Nominal  amount of  hedging  instruments directly  impacted by  IBOR reform   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk exposure          | amount of  the hedging  instruments | the hedging  instruments \u00a3m | (gains)/losses  on hedged  items \u00a3m | Hedged items                                                                                                | Hedging  instruments | recognised  in the income  statement \u00a3m |                                                                               |\n|                        | \u00a3m                                  |                             |                                     | \u00a3m                                                                                                          | \u00a3m                   |                                         | \u00a3m                                                                            |\n|                        |                                     |                             |                                     | (66.2)                                                                                                      |                      |                                         |                                                                               |\n| Foreign currency       |                                     |                             |                                     |                                                                                                             |                      |                                         |                                                                               |\n| and interest rate risk |                                     |                             |                                     |                                                                                                             |                      |                                         |                                                                               |\n| on borrowings          | 469.6                               | 59.9                        | 66.6                                |                                                                                                             | 66.5                 | 0.3                                     | 442.8                                                                         |\n\n## Note:\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nGlobally, financial regulators are requiring that market participants cease using certain financial market benchmark reference rates (i.e. interbank offered rates, IBORs), and transition to the use of alternative nearly risk-free rate (RFR) such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).\n\nWhilst uncertainty around the mechanism to replace IBOR, the timing of the replacement and the method and timing for the calculation of a spread adjustment remained, amendments were included within IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', providing temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements in cases where hedging relationships are directly impacted by the IBOR reform. These reliefs are applied until the uncertainty surrounding the IBOR reform has ended or the hedging relationship has been discontinued.\n\nAt the point of IBOR transition, further amendments are included within IFRS 9 to allow for specific changes to hedge documentation to be made without the requirement to discontinue the hedging relationship, as well as including a practical expedient when financial liabilities and assets are modified to calculate cash flows based on the alternative interest rate, provided the modification has been done on an economically equivalent basis. Given the reliefs provided as part of the phase 2 amendments, the anticipation is that on transition, the risk of significant movements to the income or balance sheet as a result of the transition is low.\n\nThe amount of financial instruments left to transition to alternative benchmarks can be found below. Non-derivative financial instruments are presented at their carrying value, with the derivatives at their nominal value to give the fairest representation of the magnitude of instruments left to transition to RFRs. All of the instruments left to transition reference LIBOR. In addition to the below, the group hold \u00a3700 million of undrawn committed facilities that reference LIBOR.\n\n| Type of financial instrument                         | Amount left to transition to RFR \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities (pay GBP LIBOR) | 729.7                                 |\n| Derivative instruments (pay GBP LIBOR)*              | 2,343.9                               |\n| Derivative instruments (receive GBP LIBOR)*          | (2,482.3)                             |\n| Net position                                         | 591.3                                 |",

        "page_content": "## A4  Financial risk management continued\n\nDuring the financial year, the group adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR fall-backs protocol, embedding fall-back provisions into the interest rate derivatives of compounded SONIA plus a spread, which will automatically replace the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at a future index cessation effective date. On 5 March 2021, following an announcement from the FCA on the future cessation and loss of representativeness of the LIBOR benchmarks, ISDA advised that a LIBOR cessation trigger event had occurred under the protocol, the index cessation effective date for GBP LIBOR will therefore be 1 January 2022. All of the group's derivative counterparties have adhered to the protocol and so from 1 January 2022 all of the group's derivatives will automatically transition from LIBOR to RFRs. The group do not expect to renegotiate interest rate swaps to reference a RFR prior to this date.\n\nFurther detail on the risk management strategy can be found within the interest rate risk section of this note.\n\n## Repricing analysis\n\nThe following tables categorise the group's borrowings, derivatives and cash deposits on the basis of when they reprice or, if earlier, mature. The repricing analysis demonstrates the group's exposure to floating interest rate risk.\n\nOur largest concentration of floating interest rate risk is with index-linked instruments. This has been classified as repricing in one year or less due to the refixing of the interest charge with changes in RPI and CPI.\n\n| Group  At 31 March 2021                                      | Total  \u00a3m   | 1 year or  less  \u00a3m   | 1-2 years  \u00a3m   | 2-3 years  \u00a3m   | 3-4 years  \u00a3m   | 4-5 years  \u00a3m   | More than  5 years  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Borrowings in fair value hedge relationships                 |             |                       |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Fixed rate instruments                                       | 2,895.5     | 388.6                 | -

To the extent that electricity prices remain floating over this period, this exposes the group to volatility in its operating cash flows. The group's policy, therefore, is to manage this risk by fixing a proportion of electricity commodity prices in a cost-effective manner. The group has fixed the price on a proportion of its anticipated net electricity usage out to the end of the regulatory period from 2020 to 2025, partially through entering into electricity swap contracts.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nElectricity swaps have been designated in cash flow hedge relationships. This means that only the impact of any hedging ineffectiveness is recognised through fair value in the income statement, with movements in the effective portion of the hedge being recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nDetails of electricity swaps that have been designated in cash flow hedging relationships are summarised below:\n\n|                        |                |             | Fair value (gains)/          |                 |                    | Amount  reclassified   |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|                        |                |             | losses used for  calculating |                 |                    |                        |\n|                        |                |             | hedge                        | Hedge           |                    | from the cash          |\n|                        |                | Carrying    | ineffectiveness              | ineffectiveness | Cash flow          | flow hedge             |\n|                        | Nominal amount | amount of   | for the year                 | recognised      | hedge reserve      | reserve to             |\n|                        | of the hedging | the hedging | ended 31 March               | in the income   | excluding          | the income             |\n|                        | instrument     | instrument  | 2021 (1)                     | statement       | effects of tax  \u00a3m | statement \u00a3m           |\n| Risk exposure          | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m              |                    |                        |\n| Electricity price risk | 46.5           | 6.5         | (9.3)                        | -               | 7. 8               | -                      |\n\nNote:\n\nDue to the relative low value of the electricity swaps in comparison to that of the derivative portfolio, no maturity profile and fixed price breakdown has been disclosed.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe group's objective when managing capital is to maintain efficient access to debt capital markets throughout the economic cycle. The board therefore believes that it is appropriate to maintain RCV gearing, measured as group consolidated net debt (including derivatives) to regulatory capital value (RCV) of UUW, within a target range of 55 per cent to 65 per cent. As at 31 March 2021, RCV gearing was within the range at 62 per cent (2020: 62 per cent).\n\nAssuming no significant changes to existing rating agencies' methodologies or sector risk assessments, the group aims to maintain longterm issuer credit ratings for UUW of at least A3 with Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and BBB+ with S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and a senior unsecured debt rating for UUW of at least A- with Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Debt issued by UUW's financing subsidiary, United Utilities Water Finance PLC, is guaranteed by UUW and is therefore rated in line with UUW.\n\nTo maintain its targeted credit ratings, the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings methodology and measures used by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The ratings methodology is normally based on a number of key ratios (such as RCV gearing, adjusted interest cover, post maintenance interest cover (PMICR) and Funds from Operations (FFO) to debt) and threshold levels as updated and published from time to time by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The group looks to manage its risk by maintaining the relevant key financial ratios used by the credit ratings agencies to determine a corporate's credit rating, within the thresholds approved by the board. Capital risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\nFurther detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies' credit ratings can be found in the methodology papers published by the rating agencies.",

The assets of these schemes are held in trust funds independent of the group's finances.\n\nThe trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The trustees are required by law to act in the interests of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.\n\nSince 1 April 2018, the majority of active members in the defined benefit sections of the UUPS have been part of a hybrid section comprising both defined benefit and defined contribution elements. Pension benefits relating to pensionable service before 1 April 2018 have not been affected by the transition to this hybrid section, which was introduced as a consequence of increases in future service costs to reduce the overall costs and risk to the group while balancing the interests of employees by maintaining an element of defined benefit pension provision.\n\nThe group operates a series of historic unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes. The costs of these schemes are included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' and the assumptions set out below.\n\nUnder the group's defined benefit pension schemes, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement. Benefits are payable on death and following other events such as withdrawing from active service. No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.\n\nInformation about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the directors' remuneration report.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners as analysed in the table below:\n\n| Group                                     | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total value of current employees benefits | 783.5     | 665.6     |\n| Deferred members benefits                 | 574.4     | 521.9     |\n| Pensioner members benefits                | 1,937.8   | 1,870.1   |\n| Total defined benefit obligation          | 3,295.7   | 3,057.6   |\n\nThe duration of the combined schemes is around 17 years. The schemes' duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are settled, taking account of the split of the defined benefit obligation between current employees, deferred members and the current pensioners of the schemes.\n\nThe estimated profile of cash flows out of the schemes as retirement benefits are paid is as follows:\n\n## UUPS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Funding requirements\n\nThe latest finalised funding valuations of the schemes were carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 March 2018, earlier than originally planned due to the aforementioned changes to the pension scheme, and determined that the schemes were both in a deficit position on a funding basis. The basis on which scheme liabilities are valued for funding purposes differs from the basis required under IAS 19, with liabilities on a funding basis being subject to assumptions at the valuation date that are not updated between revaluations. Funding deficits vary significantly from company to company, but neither the deficits, the assumptions on which they are based, the associated sensitivities, nor the risk exposures are disclosed by many companies and, therefore, meaningful cross-company comparisons are not possible. Conversely, scheme liabilities are valued on a consistent basis between companies under IAS 19 and are subject to assumptions and sensitivities that are required to be disclosed. Consequently, the relative economic positions of companies are comparable only on an IAS 19 basis, subject to normalisation of assumptions used between companies.",

        "page_content": "## A5  Retirement benefits continued\n\nA retirement benefit surplus was recognised as an asset at both 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 as, under both the UUPS and ESPS scheme rules, the group has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus assuming the full settlement of the plans' liabilities in a single event, such as a scheme wind-up.\n\nUnder UK legislation there is a requirement that pension schemes are funded prudently, and that funding plans are agreed by pension scheme trustees. The group had plans in place with the schemes' trustees to address the funding deficits by 31 December 2021 for the UUPS and 30 September 2024 for the ESPS, through a series of deficit recovery contributions. This timescale has been accelerated, with accelerated deficit repair contributions of \u00a397.6 million and \u00a35.4 million made to the UUPS and ESPS respectively in April 2019. These payments represent the final acceleration of deficit repair contributions set out in the schedules of contributions agreed with the schemes' trustees as part of the 31 March 2018 valuation process, and reduce the deficit repair contributions payable, due from the company, to \u00a3nil. Accordingly, no deficit repair contributions were required during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nAs the 2018 valuation basis was consistent with a long-term target for self-sufficiency, the expectation is that the pension schemes will be fully funded on a low dependency basis without additional contributions from the company.\n\nThe group and trustees have agreed long-term strategies for reducing investment risk in each scheme. This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets, such as corporate bonds and gilts, supplemented by swap and gilt long-term hedges of interest and inflation rates, which perform in line with the liabilities so as to hedge against changes in interest and inflation rates.\n\nFollowing further evolution in the group's investment and risk management strategies during the year ended 31 March 2020, both UUPS and ESPS are fully hedged for inflation exposure through external market swaps and gilts. Further details of the derivatives used in reducing investment risk are disclosed in the 'Further reporting analysis' section of this appendix.\n\nThe group expects to make further contributions of \u00a37.5 million in the year ending 31 March 2022, \u00a36.4 million and \u00a30.7 million in respect of current service contributions to UUPS and ESPS respectively, and \u00a30.4 million in respect of expenses to the ESPS.\n\nThe schemes' funding plans are reviewed regularly, and the next funding valuation for UUPS and ESPS is due as at 31 March 2021. The valuation is expected to be finalised by 31 March 2022.\n\n## Impact of scheme risk management on IAS 19 disclosures\n\nUnder the prescribed IAS 19 basis, pension scheme liabilities are calculated based on current accrued benefits. Expected cash flows are projected forward allowing for RPI and CPI and the current member mortality assumptions. These projected cash flows are then discounted by a high-quality corporate bond rate, which comprises an underlying interest rate and a credit spread.\n\nThe group has de-risked its pension schemes through hedging strategies applied to the underlying interest rate and future inflation. Both UUPS and ESPS fully hedge RPI inflation exposure along with underlying interest rates through external market swaps and gilts (including gilt repurchase instruments), the value of which is included in the schemes' assets (net of associated derivative liabilities).\n\nConsequently, the reported statement of financial position under IAS 19 remains volatile due to changes in credit spread and changes in mortality, neither of which have been hedged at the current time. Changes in credit spread have not been hedged primarily due to difficulties in doing so over long durations, while changes in mortality have not been hedged due to this exposure being subject to lower volatility in the short term and relatively high hedging costs.\n\nIn contrast, the schemes' specific funding bases, which formed the basis for regular deficit repair contributions, are unlikely to suffer from significant volatility due to credit spread, because a prudent, fixed credit spread assumption is applied.\n\nPension benefits under the defined benefit element of the UUPS hybrid section, that became effective for pensionable service from 1 April 2018, are linked to CPI rather than RPI.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2021, the discount rate decreased by 0.25 per cent (2020: 0.1 per cent decrease), which includes a 0.85 per cent decrease in credit spreads and a 0.6 per cent increase in gilt yields over the year. The IAS 19 remeasurement loss of \u00a382.7 million (2020: \u00a3154.6 million gain) reported in note 18 has largely resulted from a decrease in credit spreads during the year and an RPI inflation assumption increase of 0.55 per cent (2020: 0.65 per cent decrease). The impact of movements in credit spreads is less pronounced on a scheme funding basis compared with the remeasurement loss recognised on an IAS 19 accounting basis as the discount rate used for valuing obligations utilises a fixed credit spread assumption.\n\n## Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation\n\nA second UK High Court Ruling in the Lloyds Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation case was published on 20 November 2020. The implication of the first court ruling on 26 October 2018 was that GMP will be equalised for males and females and resulted in GMP equalisation past service cost (and corresponding increase in liabilities) of \u00a36.6 million (\u00a35.5 million UUPS, \u00a31.1 million ESPS) being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2019. The second ruling requires schemes to equalise GMP in respect of past transfers out (dating back to 17 May 1990) where those benefits were not equalised under the 2018 judgement. This is not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial statements.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, there has been a further \u00a30.5 million (\u00a30.3 million UUPS, \u00a30.2 million ESPS) increase to the pension liability and past service costs in relation to GMP equalisation as a result of the six-year look-back period previously assumed for back payments no longer being applicable, as it has been concluded that there is no limit for back payments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements - appendices\n\n## A5  Retirement benefits continued\n\nReporting and assumptions\n\nThe results of the latest funding valuations at 31 March 2018 have been adjusted for IAS 19 to assess the position at 31 March 2021, by taking account of experience over the period, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service costs, were measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nMember data used in arriving at the liability figure included within the overall IAS 19 surplus has been based on the finalised actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2018 for both UUPS and ESPS.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe main financial and demographic assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the defined benefit surplus of UUPS and ESPS are outlined below:\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n| Group                      | % p.a.   | % p.a.   |\n|----------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Discount rate              | 2.05     | 2.30     |\n| Pension increases          | 3.35     | 2.80     |\n| Pensionable salary growth: |          |          |\n| ESPS                       | 3.35     | 2.80     |\n| UUPS                       | 2.45     | 1.60     |\n| Price inflation - RPI      | 3.35     | 2.80     |\n| Price inflation - CPI (1)  | 2.75     | 1.60     |\n\n## Note:\n\nThe discount rate is consistent with a high-quality corporate bond rate, with 2.05 per cent being equivalent to gilts plus 75 basis points (31 March 2020: 2.30 per cent being equivalent to gilts plus 160 basis points). To align to emerging market practice and provide a more robust estimate, an exercise was carried out during the year to revisit the population of high quality corporate bonds used in deriving the discount rate. The primary change resulting from this exercise was to expand the corporate bond population used to include those rated at least AA by one or more credit rating agencies, whereas previously the rate was derived based on bonds rated AA by two or more agencies. Overall, the changes resulting from this exercise have not given rise to any material change in the discount rate or fair value of defined benefit obligations as at 31 March 2021 compared with using the same approach as that used in the prior year.\n\nIn September 2019, the Chancellor of the Exchequer highlighted the UK Statistics Authority's proposals to change RPI to align with CPIH (Consumer Prices Index, including housing costs). Plans to reform RPI and bring it in line with CPIH from 2030 were confirmed on 25 November 2020. Broadly CPIH increases are expected to average around 1 per cent per annum below RPI in the long-term (about the same as CPI), so this change could have a significant impact on many pension schemes. In arriving at the company's best estimate for RPI, an inflation risk premium of 0.2 per cent (2020: nil) has been deducted from the breakeven inflation rate for the year ended 31 March 2021. The impact of this is a decrease in the defined benefit obligation of around \u00a3120 million and therefore an increase in the net defined benefit surplus compared with no inflation risk premium being deducted. There is no allowance for any further change in the inflation risk premium post 2030 as a result of RPI reform.\n\nThe assumption for CPI inflation includes a 0.2 per cent inflation risk premium (2020: 0.3 per cent) and is set by deducting a 'wedge' from the RPI inflation assumption to reflect structural differences. For pre-2030 inflation this wedge has been estimated at 0.9 per cent, reducing to 0.1 per cent post-2030 given that RPI and CPI are expected to converge. The impact of this reduction in the post-2030 wedge as a result of the confirmation of RPI reform is a circa \u00a313 million increase to the defined benefit obligation and therefore a decrease in the net defined benefit surplus compared with the wedge remaining at 0.9 per cent after 2030. A reduction in RPI will result in a reduction to pension scheme liabilities; however, as our pension schemes are hedged for RPI inflation, this will result in a comparable reduction to pension scheme assets.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nAt both 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, mortality in retirement is assumed to be in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S2PA year of birth tables, with a scaling factor of 106 per cent and 109 per cent for male pensioners and non-pensioners respectively and 104 per cent and 105 per cent for female pensioners and non-pensioners respectively, reflecting actual mortality experience. At 31 March 2021, mortality in retirement is based on CMI 2020 (2020: CMI 2019) long-term improvement factors, with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent (2020: 1.50 per cent). It is too early at this stage to analytically determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future mortality trends for the schemes' membership, therefore no explicit adjustment to the mortality assumptions have been made in this regard.",

The sensitivity calculations presented below allow for the specified movement in the relevant key assumption, while all other assumptions are held constant. This approach does not take into account the interrelationship between some of these assumptions or any hedging strategies adopted.\n\n- \u00b7 Asset volatility - If the schemes' assets underperform relative to the discount rate used to calculate the schemes' liabilities, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold some growth assets (equities, diversified growth funds and emerging market debt) which, though expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term, create volatility in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes' long-term objectives.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a3142.1/\u00a3151.9 million (2020: \u00a3132.8 million) decrease/increase in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2021, although as long as credit spreads remain stable this will be largely offset by an increase/decrease in the value of the schemes' bond holdings and other instruments designed to hedge this exposure. The discount rate is based on high-quality corporate bond yields of a similar duration to the schemes' liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Price inflation - An increase/decrease in the inflation assumption of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a3144.3/\u00a3136.1 million (2020: \u00a3124.5 million) increase/decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2021, as a significant proportion of the schemes' benefit obligations are linked to inflation. However, nearly all of the schemes' liabilities were hedged for RPI in the external market at 31 March 2021, meaning that this sensitivity is likely to be insignificant as a result. The sensitivity to price inflation allows for the impact of changes to pensionable salary growth and pension increases, which are both assumed to be linked to price inflation.\n- \u00b7 Mortality long-term improvement rate - An increase in the mortality long-term improvement rate from 1.25 per cent to 1.50 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a333.2 million decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a331.1 million decrease based on an increase in the mortality long-term improvement rate from 1.50 per cent to 1.75 per cent).\n- \u00b7 Life expectancy - An increase/decrease in life expectancy of one year would have resulted in a \u00a3152.8 million (2020: \u00a3116.6 million) increase/decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2021. The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and, as such, the schemes' liabilities are sensitive to these assumptions.\n\n## Further reporting analysis\n\nAt 31 March, the fair values of the schemes' assets recognised in the statement of financial position were as follows:\n\n| Group                                        | Schemes'  assets %   | 2021 \u00a3m   | Schemes'  assets %   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Non-equity growth assets                     | 10.2                 | 406.6     | 9.3                  | 356.4     |\n| Gilts (1)                                    | 34.5                 | 1,374.5   | 36.4                 | 1,388.7   |\n| Bonds                                        | 46.5                 | 1,853.4   | 48.0                 | 1,828.1   |\n| Other (1)                                    | 8.8                  | 350.2     | 6.3                  | 238.5     |\n| Total fair value of schemes' assets          | 100.0                | 3,984.7   | 100.0                | 3,811.7   |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligations |                      | (3,295.7) |                      | (3,057.6) |\n| Net retirement benefit surplus               |                      | 689.0     |                      | 754.1     |\n\n## Note:\n\nIncluded within the group's defined benefit pension scheme assets are assets with a fair value estimated to be \u00a3268.0 million that are categorised as 'level 3' assets within the IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement' hierarchy, meaning that the value of the assets is not observable at 31 March 2021.

As the scheme funding basis is more prudent than the IAS 19 measurement basis for the defined benefit obligation, the schemes are more than 100 per cent hedged on an accounting basis.",

This balance comprises \u00a367.5 million outstanding net of a \u00a31.2 million allowance for expected credit losses (2020: \u00a398.0 million outstanding net of a \u00a34.6 million allowance for expected credit losses);\n- \u00b7 \u00a318.3 million (2020: \u00a3nil) outstanding on a \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility provided by United Utilities PLC, with a maturity date of 30 September 2021, bearing a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus a credit margin. This balance comprises \u00a332.5 million outstanding net of the group's \u00a38.9 million share of Water Plus losses for the year ended 31 March 2021 and the group's \u00a35.3 million previously unrecognised share of joint venture losses relating to the year ended 31 March 2020 (2020: \u00a3nil outstanding, with no share of joint venture losses or allowance for expected credit losses allocated against the facility). This facility forms part of the group's long-term interest in the Water Plus joint venture given that at 31 March 2021 there was a clear expectation that it would be replaced with additional equity share capital. This additional share capital was issued by Water Plus on 23 April 2021, with the group's subscription to \u00a332.5 million of new equity shares and the simultaneous cancellation of the revolving credit facility taking place on this same date; and\n- \u00b7 \u00a30.7 million (2020: \u00a3nil) receivable being the \u00a310.3 million (2020: \u00a310.0 million) fair value of amounts owed in relation to a \u00a312.5 million unsecured loan note held by United Utilities PLC, with a maturity date of 28 March 2027, net of a \u00a30.1 million (2020: \u00a30.5 million) allowance for expected credit losses and \u00a39.5 million of the group's share of joint venture losses relating to the year ended 31 March 2020 as the loan note is deemed to be part of the group's long-term interest in Water Plus. This is a zero coupon shareholder loan with a total amount outstanding at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 of \u00a312.5 million, comprising the \u00a310.3 million (2020: \u00a310.0 million) receivable measured at fair value, and \u00a32.2 million (2020: \u00a32.5 million) recorded as an equity contribution to Water Plus recognised within interests in joint ventures.\n\nA further \u00a31.4 million of non-current receivables (2020: \u00a31.4 million) was owed by other related parties at 31 March 2021.\n\nThe \u00a31.3 million (2020: \u00a35.0 million) of allowances for expected credit losses in relation to loans extended to Water Plus (\u00a31.2 million (2020: \u00a34.5 million) and \u00a30.1 million (\u00a30.5 million) recognised against Water Plus's total revolving credit facilities and zero coupon loan notes respectively), is lower than the \u00a35.0 million allowance for expected credit losses recognised at 31 March 2020. This \u00a35.0 million allowance was recognised in the prior year as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that gave rise to a significant increase in credit risk. The \u00a33.7 million release of this allowance during the year is primarily attributable to the group's exposure to expected credit losses in future periods reducing as a result of the \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility being cancelled and replaced with additional equity share capital in April 2021.\n\nDuring the year, United Utilities PLC provided guarantees in support of Water Plus in respect of certain amounts owed to wholesalers. The aggregate limit of these guarantees was \u00a354.1 million (2020: \u00a354.1 million), of which \u00a332.1 million (2020: \u00a332.1 million) related to guarantees to United Utilities Water Limited.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, amounts owed to related parties were \u00a32.4 million (2020: \u00a34.8 million). Included within this amount is \u00a31.1 million (2020: \u00a34.5 million) due to Water Plus for the surrender of consortium relief tax losses. The amounts outstanding are unsecured and will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms.\n\nDetails of transactions with key management are disclosed in note 3.\n\n## Company\n\nThe parent company receives dividend income and pays and receives interest to and from subsidiary undertakings in the normal course of business. Total dividend income received during the year amounted to \u00a3291.9 million (2020: \u00a3284.5 million) and total net interest payable during the year was \u00a324.2 million (2020: \u00a332.9 million). Amounts outstanding at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 between the parent company and subsidiary undertakings are disclosed in notes 14, 16 and 21.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, no related party receivables and payables were secured and no guarantees were issued in respect thereof. Balances will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms. No allowance for doubtful receivables has been made for amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.",

        "page_content": "## A7  Accounting policies\n\nOf the accounting policies outlined below, those deemed to be the most significant for the group are those that align with the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty set out on pages 215 to 217.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries), and incorporate the results of its share of joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained or until the date that control ceases, as appropriate.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used under the relevant local GAAP into line with those used by the group. Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests are presented separately in equity and total comprehensive income where material.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is achieved where the group is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement in an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In the parent company accounts, investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.\n\nOn acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are entities in which the group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled with one or more parties under a contractual arrangement. The group's share of joint venture results and assets and liabilities is incorporated using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the group's share of the profit or loss.\n\nOn losing control of a subsidiary disposed of to a joint venture, the group recognises the gain or loss attributable to measuring the investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of water, wastewater and other services represents the fair value of the consideration receivable in the ordinary course of business for the goods and services provided, exclusive of value added tax and foreign sales tax. Where relevant, this includes an estimate of the sales value of units supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the period end.\n\nThere are two main areas of the group's activities considered to result in revenue being recognised:\n\n- \u00b7 the provision of core water and wastewater services, accounting for more than 97 per cent of the group's revenue; and\n- \u00b7 capital income streams relating to diversions work, and activities, typically performed opposite property developers, that facilitate the creation of an authorised connection through which properties can obtain water and wastewater services.\n\nThe core water and wastewater services, which are deemed to be distinct performance obligations under the contracts with customers, follow the same pattern of transfer to the customer who simultaneously receives and consumes both of these services over time.\n\nRevenue is generally recognised at the time of delivery, with consideration given as to whether collection of the full amount under the contract is considered probable. Should the group consider that the criteria for revenue recognition has not been met for a transaction, revenue recognition would be delayed until such time as collectability is reasonably assured.\n\nPayments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred income. This includes the revenue in respect of connection activities, itself a district performance obligation. The revenue in respect of these activities is released to the income statement over a period of 60 years, which is deemed to be the time over which the performance obligation for providing the connection is satisfied.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit is stated after charging operational expenses but before investment income and finance expense.\n\n## Borrowing costs and finance income\n\nExcept as noted below, all borrowing costs and finance income are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability are included in the initial fair value of that instrument. Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.\n\n## Tax\n\nTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgements to be made regarding the application of tax law and the result of negotiations with, and enquiries from, tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. A current tax provision is only recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation to a taxing authority.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period and is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.\n\nTaxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.\n\nCurrent tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the tax is dealt with in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements - appendices\n\n## A7  Accounting policies continued\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PPE) comprises water and wastewater infrastructure assets and overground assets.\n\nThe useful economic lives of these assets are primarily as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Water and wastewater infrastructure assets:\n- \u00b7 Impounding reservoirs 200 years;\n- \u00b7 Mains and raw water aqueducts 30 to 300 years;\n- \u00b7 Sewers and sludge pipelines 60 to 300 years;\n- \u00b7 Sea outfalls 77 years;\n- \u00b7 Buildings 10 to 60 years;\n- \u00b7 Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and\n- \u00b7 Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.\n\nEmployee and other related costs incurred in implementing the capital schemes of the group are capitalised.\n\nThe group is required to evaluate the carrying values of PPE for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in management's view, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. An impairment review requires management to make uncertain estimates concerning the cash flows, growth rates and discount rates of the cash generating units under review.\n\nCosts associated with a major inspection or overhaul of an asset or group of assets are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the period of time expected to elapse between major inspections or overhauls.\n\n## Water and wastewater infrastructure assets\n\nInfrastructure assets comprise a network of water and wastewater pipes and systems. Expenditure on the infrastructure assets, including borrowing costs where applicable, relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network, is treated as additions. Amounts incurred in maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service are expensed in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Infrastructure assets are depreciated by writing off their cost (or deemed cost for infrastructure assets held on transition to IFRS), less the estimated residual value, evenly over their useful economic lives.\n\n## Other assets\n\nAll other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nHistorical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items, including relevant borrowing costs, where applicable, for qualifying assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate\n\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nFreehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing off their cost, less their estimated residual value, evenly over their estimated useful economic lives, based on management's judgement and experience.\n\nDepreciation methods, residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in other operating costs.\n\n## Transfer of assets from customers and developers\n\nWhere the group receives from a customer or developer an item of property, plant and equipment (or cash to construct or acquire an item of property, plant and equipment) that the group must then use, either to connect the customer to the network, or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both, such items are capitalised at their fair value and included within property, plant and equipment, with a credit of the same amount to deferred grants and contributions. The assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives and the deferred contributions released to revenue over the 60 years, which is the estimated period over which an average connection through which the group provides water and wastewater services is expected to be in place (or where the receipt of property, plant and equipment is solely to connect the customer to the network, the deferred contribution is released immediately to revenue). This accounting treatment has been applied to transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.\n\nAssets transferred from customers or developers are accounted for at fair value. If no market exists for the assets then incremental cash flows are used to arrive at fair value.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. The carrying amount is reduced by any provision for impairment where necessary. On a business combination, as well as recording separable intangible assets already recognised in the statement of financial position of the acquired entity at their fair value, identifiable intangible assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights are included in the acquisition statement of financial position at fair value.\n\nInternal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated intangibles only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'.\n\nIntangible assets, which relate primarily to computer software, are generally amortised over a period of three to 10 years.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nWhere appropriate, assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Value in use represents the net present value of expected future cash flows, discounted on a pre-tax basis, using a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.",

        "page_content": "## A7  Accounting policies continued\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses in respect of non-current assets are recognised in the income statement within operating costs.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the reversal is recognised in the income statement and the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not so as to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised in the group's statement of financial position on the trade date when the group becomes/ceases to be a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Cash and short-term deposits\n\nCash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and in hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. In the consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term deposits, net of book overdrafts.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nInvestments (other than interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and fixed deposits) are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs. Investments classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the net profit or loss for the period. The business model employed in respect of financial assets is that of a hold-to-collect model.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment for irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience of the receivables balance.\n\n## Trade payables\n\nTrade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities and equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nThe group's default treatment is that bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value, being the cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying the effective interest method. The difference between the net cash proceeds received at inception and the principal cash flows due at maturity is accrued over the term of the borrowing.\n\nThe default treatment of measuring at amortised cost, while associated hedging derivatives are recognised at fair value, presents an accounting measurement mismatch that has the potential to introduce considerable volatility to both the income statement and the statement of financial position. Therefore, where feasible, the group takes advantage of the provisions under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' to make fair value adjustments to its borrowing instruments to reduce this volatility and better represent the economic hedges that exist between the group's borrowings and associated derivative contracts.\n\nWhere feasible, the group designates its financial instruments within fair value hedge relationships. To apply fair value hedge accounting, it must be demonstrated that there is an economic relationship between the borrowing instrument and the hedging derivative and that the designated hedge ratio is consistent with the group's risk management strategy.\n\n## Borrowings designated within a fair value hedge relationship\n\nWhere designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value, being the cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They are subsequently adjusted for any change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged at each reporting date, with the change being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or where the hedge relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', changes in the group's own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nDesignation is made where the requirements to designate within a fair value hedge cannot be met at inception despite there being significant fair value offset between the borrowing and the hedging derivative. Where designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value being the cash proceeds received, and are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe group's default treatment is that derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement. The group enters into financial derivatives contracts to manage its financial exposure to changes in market rates (see note A4).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments designated within a cash flow hedge relationship\n\nGains or losses resulting from the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive income and in the cash flow hedge reserve with any remaining gains or losses recognised immediately in the income statement. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. At the maturity date, amounts paid/received are recognised against operating expenses in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements - appendices\n\n## A7  Accounting policies continued\n\nUpon discontinuation of a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income remains in the cash flow hedge reserve if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise the amount is immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Derivatives and borrowings - valuation\n\nWhere an active market exists, designated borrowings and derivatives recorded at fair value are valued using quoted market prices. Otherwise, they are valued using a net present value valuation model. The model uses applicable interest rate curve data at each reporting date to determine any floating cash flows. Projected future cash flows associated with each financial instrument are discounted to the reporting date using discount factors derived from the applicable interest curves adjusted for counterparty credit risk where appropriate. Discounted foreign currency cash flows are converted into sterling at the spot exchange rate at each reporting date. Assumptions are made with regard to credit spreads based on indicative pricing data.\n\nThe valuation of debt designated in a fair value hedge relationship is calculated based on the risk being hedged as prescribed by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. The group's policy is to hedge its exposure to changes in the applicable underlying interest rate and it is this portion of the cash flows that is included in the valuation model (excluding any applicable company credit risk spread).\n\nThe valuation of debt designated at fair value through the profit or loss incorporates an assumed credit risk spread in the applicable discount factor. Credit spreads are determined based on indicative pricing data.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For properties held for resale, cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites, including borrowing costs where applicable.\n\nNet realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations\n\nThe group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, which are independent of the group's finances, for its employees. Actuarial valuations to determine the funding of the schemes, along with future contribution rates, are carried out by the pension scheme actuary as directed by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years. In any intervening years, the trustees review the continuing appropriateness of the funding and contribution rates.\n\nFrom a financial reporting perspective and in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', defined benefit assets are measured at fair value while liabilities are measured at present value, using the projected unit credit method. The difference between the two amounts is recognised as a surplus or obligation in the statement of financial position. Where this difference results in a defined benefit surplus, this is recognised in accordance with IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction', on the basis that the group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus that may exist following the full settlement of plan liabilities in a single event.\n\nThe pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries based on the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary, which are used to estimate the present value of defined benefit obligations. The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary by the company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management. The assumptions are disclosed in note A5.\n\nThe cost of providing pension benefits to employees relating to the current year's service (including curtailment gains and losses) is included within employee benefits expense, while the interest on the schemes' assets and liabilities is included within investment income and finance expense respectively. Remeasurement gains/ losses on scheme assets and liabilities are presented in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn addition, the group operates a defined contribution pension section within the United Utilities Pension Scheme. Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n\n## Share-based compensation arrangements\n\nThe group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, issued to certain employees. The equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Fair value is based on simulation models, according to the relevant measures of performance. The group has the option to settle some of these equity-settled sharebased payments in cash. At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable with the impact of any revision being recognised in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Expenditure that relates to an existing condition caused by past operations that does not contribute to current or future earnings is expensed.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange applicable on that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.\n\nExchange differences arising on investments in equity instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the gains or losses arising from changes in fair value which are recognised directly in equity. To hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into contracts for derivative instruments (see note A4).\n\n## Group companies\n\nOn consolidation, the statements of financial position of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated into sterling at exchange rates applicable at each reporting date. The income statements are translated into sterling using the average rate unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly, in which case the exchange rate at the date the transaction occurred is used. Exchange differences resulting from the translation of such statements of financial position at rates prevailing at the beginning and end of the period, together with the differences between income statements translated at average rates and rates ruling at the period end, are dealt with as movements on the group's cumulative exchange reserve, a separate component of equity. Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.",

        "page_content": "## A7  Accounting policies continued\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of implementation of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' (1 April 1999) as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.\n\n## Grants and contributions\n\nGrants and contributions receivable in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income, which is credited to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives of the related assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. Where a lease is present, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised at the commencement date. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments due over the term of the lease, with the right-of-use asset recognised as property, plant and equipment at cost. This is generally equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe group has elected to apply a practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 whereby for the fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment asset class of leases the lease and non-lease components of the contracts are not separated, and instead are both accounted for as if they were a single lease component. Where non-lease components exist they are embedded within the lease payments, and the group deems that separation of such contracts into their constituent parts for this asset class would generally not be practicable nor have a material effect on the financial statements. IFRS 16 requires that where this practical expedient is applied, it is applied to the entire class of similar assets. The group has not applied this expedient to the remaining lease asset classes. Non-lease components include service charges, maintenance charges, and monitoring charges. For lease asset classes where the expedient has not been applied, nonlease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and are recorded separately within operating costs on a straight-line basis.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the group's incremental rate of borrowing if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. For materially all of the group's leases, the group's incremental rate of borrowing is used. This rate is calculated using a number of inputs, being observable risk-free gilt rates, specific data based on bonds already in circulation for the relevant group company, as well as data from the wider utility sector. Further adjustments for payment profile and the term of the lease are made.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is increased for the accretion of interest (being the unwinding of the discounting applied to future lease payments) and reduced by lease payments made. In addition to this the carrying amount is updated to reflect any remeasurement or lease modifications. Remeasurements are typically required as a result of rent reviews or changes to the lease term. In these cases a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset is made.\n\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets is charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease payments are instead charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\n\nWhere leases have a term of less than 12 months from the commencement date and do not have a purchase option, the group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption available under IFRS 16. The group applies the low value recognition exemption permitted by the standard to leases of assets with a value of less than \u00a32,500. Payments for short-term and low value leases are instead charged to operating costs on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\n\n- Statement of cash flows\n\n## Grants and contributions received\n\nGrants and contributions received arise from transactions with customers, typically property developers, that result in the expansion of the group's water and wastewater network and therefore its fixed asset base. Given that these grants and contributions are used to fund expenditure that results in the enhancement of the group's network assets, the cash inflows are classified within investing activities in the period.\n\n## Interest payments and receipts\n\nIFRS allows interest payments and interest receipts to be classified within operating activities or financing activities/investing activities. The group classifies interest payments and interest receipts within operating activities, with management viewing these in conjunction with other operating cash flows in assessing the ability of the group to maintain its operating capability.\n\n## Support costs\n\nCosts of time and resources incurred by the group's support functions that is capitalised in the period (see page 216) is included in purchase of property, plant and equipment within investing activities. These cash flows represent expenditures that have been made for resources intended to generate future income and cash flows, and the group deem these to therefore meet the definition of an investing activity.\n\n## Cash flows on derivatives\n\nThe cash flows on derivatives as a result of the group's hedging activities are presented together with the cash flows relating to the underlying hedged item to provide a more faithful representation of the substance of the transaction.\n\n## Taxes paid\n\nTaxes paid by the group are presented as cash flows from operating activities. The group deem it impracticable to identify the tax cash flows with respect to individual transactions, which may themselves be presented in investing activities or financing activities, and instead present total tax cash flows as operating activities.\n\n## Dividend receipts\n\nDividends received from joint ventures have been presented in investing activities, with these cash receipts deemed to represent a return on investments previously made by the group.",
