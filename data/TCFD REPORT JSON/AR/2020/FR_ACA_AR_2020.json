In this increasingly complex, evolving and uncertain situation in terms of both people's health and the economy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances can rely on its solid foundations to make it through the current crisis while also playing its role and upholding its responsibilities. Guided by the raison d'\u00eatre adopted by the Group in 2019 of 'Working every day in the interest of our customers and society', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to supporting and helping its customers who have been hardest hit by the crisis and the French economy, while also protecting its employees. Its efforts therefore fall within the framework of its three core values - Customer, Human and Societal - which form the basis of the Credit Agricole Group's P roject. 2\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took action in the light of the health and economic crisis, adopting support measures and contributions to solidarity funds representing close to \u20ac350/uni00A0 million for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, thereby reasserting its role as insurer, investor and responsible business. In particular, the Group supported its business customers by providing a \u20ac239/uni00A0 million non-contractual support programme inspired by its mutualist values. The Group also contributed \u20ac38/uni00A0million to the solidarity fund set up by the public authorities for very small businesses and the self-employed in sectors particularly affected by the crisis. In addition, the Group participated in the exceptional contribution of supplementary health insurers to the expenses related to the management of the Covid-19 epidemic for \u20ac40/uni00A0million. Lastly, the Group contributed to the solidarity fund set up by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole G roup to help the elderly and has set up a solidarity fund for health workers fighting against the spread of the epidemic. As an investor, the Group also allocated \u20ac250/uni00A0million to support economic recovery and boost the healthcare sector.\n\nPHILIPPE DUMONT\n\nChief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nThe No./uni00A0 1 insurer in France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is ranked No./uni00A01 and No./uni00A05 respectively in the two main areas of personal insurance and property and liability insurance in France (1) . With these performances, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has once again illustrated the relevance and effectiveness of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's bancassurance model, having worked for more than 30 years on building up a comprehensive and diversified insurance business. Always serving its customers, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances endeavours to establish a relationship of trust and closeness over the long term, putting their needs at the centre of what we offer, from design through to claims handling, in order to achieve excellence in our relations, which lies at the heart of our Customer Project.\n\nDespite the unprecedented crisis in 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances stepped up the diversification of its operations in its priority business lines, protection of assets and individuals, and unit-linked products in savings and retirement:\n\n- z in property & casualty insurance, the Group achieved further growth with revenues of \u20ac4.8/uni00A0billion in 2020. The Group continued to develop in terms of both the quality of its customer relations and in terms of the number of policies, with a net addition of 508/uni00A0thousand policies in 2020, bringing the total number of policies to 14.6/uni00A0million at the end of the year. The number of products held by our customers increased within our networks in France and internationally, reflecting the Group's growth potential in this business segment;\n- z in personal protection, revenue totalled \u20ac4.2/uni00A0billion, up across all three areas of death & disability insurance, creditor insurance and group insurance;\n- z in savings & retirement, at the end of 2019, the Group began to refocus its activities on unit-linked products, which resulted in 2020 in net inflows of \u20ac4.9/uni00A0billion and an",

Life insurance outstandings totalled \u20ac308/uni00A0billion at end2020, with unit-linked products representing 24.2%, the highest level achieved by the Group. The aim of the inflow policy adopted is to protect the long-term interests of customers against the backdrop of continuing low interest rates. This new policy is based on general wealth management  advice  including  personalised  saving suggestions suited to savers' needs, while also giving them freedom of choice. In order to protect potential future remuneration from euro-denominated contracts, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also added around \u20ac800/uni00A0million to its policyholder participation reserve, representing 5.6% of Euro outstandings.\n\nIntragroup synergies were strengthened further,/uni00A0in particular with Amundi within the framework of the marketing of retirement savings plan as a result of the PACTE  law.\n\nOutside France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances capitalised on the success of its bancassurance model and continued to expand by means of distribution agreements with external partners. The Group strengthened its position outside France in 2020: in Portugal, with the announcement of an agreement with Novo Banco to acquire 25% of non-life insurance company GNB Seguros, thereby increasing the Group's stake in GNB Seguros to 100% of share capital, which also includes a 22-year non-life insurance distribution agreement between Novo Banco and GNB Seguros to distribute GNB Seguros policies in Portugal; in Spain, with subsidiary Abanca Seguros Generales starting to sell its first non-life insurance products in January 2021.\n\nIn addition, as part of its Social Project, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has continued with its social commitment to inclusion with its 10th 'Caregivers' call for projects. The Group is engaged in a policy to sponsor family caregivers by financing local community projects throughout France. Since 2010, it has supported 170 local projects and paid out close to \u20ac2.5/uni00A0million.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  also  positioned  as  a leading name in energy transition, with new investments in infrastructure projects and renewable energies in 2020 such as the acquisition of 30% of EF Solare, Europe's leading photovoltaic energy company, the second-largest hydroelectric power portfolio in Portugal with Engie and Mirova, and European Locomotive Leasing, a pan-European supplier of electric locomotive leasing solutions with AXA Investment Managers - Real Assets. In late 2020, the Group invested in wind and solar power infrastructure projects representing 2.9/uni00A0GW of installed capacity in France. These\n\ninvestments fit in fully with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's climate strategy and contribute to its ambition of establishing itself as European leader in responsible investment by 2022.\n\nWith net income (Group share) of \u20ac1.2/uni00A0billion for the year and a solvency ratio of 227% under Solvency/uni00A0II as at 31/uni00A0December 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances demonstrated its resilience during this year of the health crisis, and once again proved its solid financial basis in an uncertain economic environment with continuing very low interest rates. Not taking account of exceptional items relating to the health crisis (1) and the balance paid to Credit Agricole S.A. (2) , net income (Group share) totalled \u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion in 2020.\n\nTo a very large extent, these impressive results are thanks to the company's great ability to innovate and adapt to change, which has always been Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' strength.\n\nThe Group has developed new products and activities in order to better respond to its customers' needs and capitalise on new sources of growth, which constitutes a core part of its 2022 Medium-Term Plan. In France, at the end of 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances launched its business property & casualty operations, allowing it to create a comprehensive and unique bancassurance model for businesses in addition to the health, death & disability and retirement solutions already available. In order to enlarge its range of services, the Group also signed a strategic agreement concerning assistance services in the French market with Europ Assistance and acquired a 50% stake in Europ Assistance France, the services entity providing the Europ Assistance group's expertise and resources in France. Outside France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assicurazioni was a winner in the Future Bancassurance Awards 2020 in November 2020 in Milan for its CA Vita Fiducia Sostenibile investment offering, which combines performance with environmental and social sustainability.\n\nThese innovations fit in fully with the Human Project responsibility on a local level, as part of which the Group intends,  by  capitalising  on  its  bancassurance  model, to put people at the heart of the customer relationship, while also making its operations digital. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances therefore took action during the crisis to remain accessible and maintain the service standards expected by its policyholders by simplifying and digitising a number of processes, which helped it to continue to operate and provide services for its customers,\n\nWith the support of partner banks and drawing on our solid economic fundamentals, as well as the commitment of our staff, we are confident that we will be able to maintain the close relationship we have established with our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this climate of unprecedented uncertainty  and  economic  instability  coupled  with  ongoing  very low interest rates, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances upheld its role and responsibilities towards its customers and society by supporting those worst affected by the crisis, while also pursuing its strategic targets in terms of diversification and international expansion:\n\n- z reaching out to those in need: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took action in the light of the health and economic crisis, adopting support measures and contributions to solidarity funds representing close to \u20ac350/uni00A0 million for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, thereby reasserting its role as insurer, investor and responsible business. In particular, the Group supported its business customers by providing a \u20ac239/uni00A0 million non-contractual support programme inspired by its mutualist values. The Group also contributed \u20ac38/uni00A0million to the solidarity fund set up by the public authorities for very small businesses and the self-employed in sectors particularly affected by the crisis. In addition, the Group participated in the exceptional contribution of supplementary health insurers to the expenses related to the management of the Covid-19 epidemic for \u20ac40/uni00A0million. Lastly, the Group contributed to the solidarity fund set up by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group to help the elderly and has set up a solidarity fund for health workers fighting against the spread of the epidemic. As an investor, the Group also allocated \u20ac250/uni00A0million to support economic recovery and boost the healthcare sector;\n- z digitisation:\n- z against the backdrop of the health crisis and particularly during the lockdowns that occurred in/uni00A02020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took action to remain accessible and maintain the service standards expected by its policyholders, primarily by simplifying and digitising a number of processes, which helped it to continue to operate and provide services for its customers,\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Ma Sant\u00e9 app offered features to support policyholders during the crisis (news about Covid, online doctor consultations, psychological support). This platform was developed further in/uni00A02020, with around 70% of policyholders registering for the platform and 60% of invoices sent to them in electronic format. It also allowed for over 3,000 doctor consultations to be conducted online;\n- z prudential: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continued to adapt its commercial policy, asset allocation and financial resources to Solvency/uni00A0 II quantitative requirements. At the end of/uni00A0 2020, the Group's prudential ratio remained at the high level of 227%. Furthermore, in/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took part in the EIOPA holistic impact assessment exercises in preparation for revising the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, testing in particular the impact of a new interest rate shock in a climate of low interest rates and the new volatility adjustment formula. These exercises fed into EIOPA's technical advice given to the European Commission in\n\nDecember/uni00A02020. In/uni00A02021, the Group will continue to monitor changes in the Solvency/uni00A0II framework, in particular when discussions begin between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Europe in preparation for the new regulations;\n\n- z strategy:\n- z in  January/uni00A0 2021,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  and  Europ Assistance finalised the agreement concerning the acquisition by Pacifica of a 50% stake in Europ Assistance France, the main services entity of Europ Assistance, in relation to the Group's expertise and resources on the French market. As of January/uni00A0 2022, Credit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries will assign all their assistance activities in France to Europ Assistance, which will become the assistance partner of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's insurance companies (Predica, Pacifica, CAMCA, La M\u00e9dicale),\n- z in late/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances launched a business property & casualty insurance offering. A key element of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan, this supplements its group retirement , death & disability and  health insurance products and will enable the Group to create a unique bancassurance model for businesses and offer them a comprehensive range of insurance solutions,\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is continuing to pursue its policy of development in the most value-creating businesses. Against the backdrop of record low interest rates over the last few years, the Group has bolstered its strategy of diversifying its product mix by stepping up the development of property & casualty and personal protection activities, as well as in/uni00A02020 reinforcing its policy of refocusing on unit-linked savings and retirement products, while also highlighting its duty to advise;\n- z internationally:\n- z in July/uni00A02020, in order to support CA Bank Polska in its retirement and unit-linked product development strategy, a new life insurance subsidiary - CA Zycie - was founded in Poland and commenced operation in November,\n- z in October/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances announced the signing of an agreement with Novo Banco concerning the acquisition of 25% of GNB Seguros, thereby increasing the Group's stake in GNB Seguros to 100% of share capital. The acquisition also includes a 22-year non-life insurance distribution agreement between Novo Banco and GNB Seguros concerning the distribution of GNB Seguros policies in Portugal, reflecting the Group's desire to export its bancassurance model to other countries,\n- z in January/uni00A0 2021, the Spanish non-life insurance joint venture equally owned with Spanish banking group Abanca, Abanca Seguros Generales, started selling its first products within Abanca's branch and digital networks, illustrating the Group's strategy  of  developing  its  insurance  business  through international partnerships.",

They now use new methods to calculate their capital requirements, which require to quantify their risk exposure, then to compare the result obtained in terms of capital with the level of available capital (pillar/uni00A0 1). Insurers also\n\nhave to attest that the governance and risks policy adopted enable a sound, prudent and efficient management (pillar/uni00A02). Then, enhanced regulatory reporting, which deliver both quantitative and qualitative information, have to be produced in order to attest the quality of the organis ation and the financial strength of the company (pillar/uni00A03).\n\n## QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS (PILLAR/uni00A01)\n\nFor  several  years,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  adapted  its strategy to match perfectly the Solvency/uni00A0II directive, whether in terms of activity, investments policy or liabilities structure:\n\n- z orientation of the business policy towards death & disability, property & casualty insurance and unit-linked retirement/savings products in order to meet the diversification and profitability targets;\n- z optimis ation of assets allocation (investments in more diversified assets and unlisted fixed-income securities and local authority financing, which bring regular and little volatile returns; development of strategic investments and interest rate hedging policy);\n- z adjustment of financial resources to the eligibility criteria and required level under Solvency/uni00A0 II, either via issues (in particular two issues recognised as Tier/uni00A01 via the grandfathering clause, in October/uni00A0 2014 and January/uni00A0 2015, respectively for \u20ac750/uni00A0 million and \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, as well as issues of bonds classified Tier/uni00A02 in June and September/uni00A02016, in January/uni00A02018, then in September/uni00A02019 and July/uni00A0 2020 for an amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion in each case) or via a strengthening of reserves and provisions.\n\nRegulatory  capital  requirements  are  measured  through  two indicators:\n\n- z the SCR (Solvency Capital Requirement), which is the target level of capital necessary to absorb the shock induced by a major risk (for instance: an exceptional damage, a shock on the assets\u2026).\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group level, the evaluation of the regulatory capital required is calculated by using the standard formula of the Solvency/uni00A0II directive (formula and assumptions proposed by the  European  Insurance  and  Occupational  Pensions  Authority), which is adapted to the risk profile of the Group. No transitional measure was used by the Group, except for grandfathering clause on  subordinated  debts.  The  standard  formula  covers  all  risks (market  risks,  life  underwriting  risks,  non-life  underwriting  risks, health  underwriting  risks,  counterparty  default  risks,  operational risks), market and life underwriting risks representing the major part of the capital required, reflecting the predominance of savings and retirement activities in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\nAt 31/uni00A0 December/uni00A0 2020, the MCR coverage ratio of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances amounted to 420%.\n\nAt 31/uni00A0 December/uni00A0 2020, the SCR coverage ratio of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances amounted to 227%.\n\n- z the MCR (Minimum Capital Requirement), which is the minimum level of capital, below which the supervisory authority intervenes;\n\n## QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS (PILLAR/uni00A02)\n\nMoreover, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group set up a governance and  risks  management,  which  are  in  line  with  Solvency/uni00A0 II recommendations.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' governance includes three executive directors, beyond the 'four eyes rule' specified by the supervisory authority.\n\nFour key functions were set up, as defined by the directive:\n\n- z the  risk-management  function,  which  conducts  the  risk management framework at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Group level, is in charge of the consistency of its implementation in the subsidiaries, manages the risk mapping, monitors the evolution of the risk profile, issues opinions on the transversal risk management, reports the risk exposures and its level of control to the governance;\n\n- z the Actuarial function, which defines the Group's norms and standards for the prudential technical provisions, is in charge of the consistency and the adequacy of the Group's technical provisions' calculation, formulates its 'actuarial' opinion on provisioning, controls the definition of the underwriting and reinsurance policies and their implementations, organis es the coordination with the Actuarial functions defined in the entities, contributes to the technical risk management at the  Group's level;\n- z the Compliance function, which is in charge of the coordination of the entities 'Compliance functions and conducts the Group's projects, manages the implementation in the Group's entities of a compliance procedures corpus which is the Group's view of the non-compliance risks and the implementation of the devices contributing to its efficiency, supports the Directions for compliance questions at the Group level;\n\n<!-- image -->",

As permitted by the law, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has elected not to produce an NFS inasmuch as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., its parent\n\ncompany, produces a consolidated Non-Financial Statement for the Group, including non-financial information for its entities and subsidiaries, which is published in its annual Universal Registration Document. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances therefore takes a voluntary approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting.\n\n## EMBEDDING CSR IN BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\nIn keeping with the raison d'\u00eatre set out in the 2022 MTP and with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's commitments, since/uni00A0 2010 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has deployed a socially responsible approach in all its business lines and activities, which are mainly housed in its insurance companies Predica (life insurance), Pacifica (property & casualty insurance) and CACI (creditor insurance). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also has two other insurance companies: Spirica, which is dedicated to independent financial advisers, and La Medicale, which specialises in insurance for healthcare professionals.\n\nCSR is a strategic issue for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and this is reflected in its Assurances 2020 medium-term plan. Climate strategy and inclusion are two of the major pillars of the MTP unveiled in early June/uni00A0 2019. Adjustments are made each year to ensure that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's policy is aligned to the expectations of its main stakeholders. The CSR strategy has been validated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's Executive Committee and was presented to the Board of Directors in December/uni00A02018.\n\n## Analysing CSR issues\n\nThis approach was restructured in/uni00A02016 with a new CSR strategy aiming to embed CSR more deeply into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's business operations.\n\nThe strategy was drawn up after substantial consultation with internal stakeholders  (executive  management)  and  external  stakeholders (shareholder  and  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  N  ationale  du  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole).  This approach led to a structured CSR strategy that all employees can identify with, embedded directly in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's overall strategy.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2017, to support these strategic thrusts, a materiality matrix was drawn up in conjunction with the entities' CSR stewards during a  dedicated  workshop.  The  matrix  is  based  on  documentary work  (including  benchmarking,  stakeholder  mapping,  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise  de  l'Assurance  publications)  and  the  CSR  barometer devised by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.\n\nAt present, the main CSR issues are:\n\n|   1. | Observing ethical business conduct                             |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    2 | Building a lasting relationship with customers                 |\n|    3 | Assessing and managing ESG and climate risks                   |\n|    4 | Embedding ESG criteria more deeply in products and investments |\n|    5 | Stepping up the preventive approach                            |\n|    6 | Financing a low carbon economy                                 |\n|    7 | Improving the quality of work life                             |\n|    8 | Guaranteeing fairness and promoting diversity                  |\n|    9 | Supporting customers faced with new risks                      |\n|   10 | Encouraging the personal development and skills of employees   |\n|   11 | Reducing the direct environmental footprint                    |\n|   12 | Deploying a responsible purchasing policy                      |\n|   13 | Developing an outreach culture                                 |\n\nIdentification of these priority issues supported the main thrusts of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's CSR policy:\n\n- z acting as a responsible insurer: its first responsibility is to protect its customers by providing products, advice and a quality service tailored to their needs and expectations, while also including a preventive approach in all its products. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances must also embed social and environmental issues throughout the entire value chain;\n- z acting as a responsible investor: as a leading institutional investor, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has a major responsibility regarding the choice of the companies in which it invests. It fulfils this responsibility by taking a selective approach to issuers based on non-financial criteria;\n- z acting as a responsible company: in accordance with its operational focus on business ethics, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances strives to take into account the social and environmental impacts of its operations both in its purchasing processes and in managing resources as well as waste. As a subsidiary of a mutual group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also places a strong focus on employee development, which involves improving the quality of work life, guaranteeing fair treatment and promoting diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In use since/uni00A02012, FReD is based on three pillars relating to trust and customer relations (Fides), respect for employees and the company's ecosystem (Respect) and environmental protection (DEMETER). Each year, an action plan is drawn up and validated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's Executive Committee and an index is used to measure progress in the plan.\n\nPerformance assessment based on the FReD index is one of the incentive criteria that has an impact on the variable compensation earned by employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions and determines one third of the variable compensation paid to its senior executives. To create a secure framework for the FReD approach and the self-assessment process, half of all actions taken by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances falling within the FReD scope were audited and validated in/uni00A02019 by PwC, one of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A.'s statutory auditors.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricoel Assurances has formalised its commitment by joining the major national and international initiatives. Today, this commitment is also reflected in the labels and awards won from independent organisations.\n\n## z Signatory of:\n\n- z United Nations Global Compact since/uni00A02003;\n- z Principles for Responsible Investment since/uni00A02011;\n- z Diversity Charter since/uni00A02008;\n- z Responsible Purchasing Charter since/uni00A02010;\n- z CSR Charter for FFA insurers, renewed in/uni00A02018;\n- z Gender Diversity Charter since/uni00A02018.\n\n## z Member of:\n\n- z C3D - College of Sustainability directors\n- z Admical - Network of Philanthropists;\n- z France Silver Eco;\n- z 'Demographic Transitions, Economic Transitions' chair launched by Jean-Herve Lorenzi;\n- z Novethic's Circle of Institutional Investors.\n\n## z Awards and labels:\n\n- z AGEFI's Global Invest Sustainable Insurance Company of the year award in/uni00A02018;\n- z Entreprise Salari\u00e9s Aidants (ESA) award for supporting employee caregivers in/uni00A02016;\n- z Socially responsible customer relations label for CACI since/uni00A02016;\n- z 'Responsible supplier relations and purchasing' label since/uni00A02014;\n- z Finansol label for the 'Solidarity Contract' since/uni00A02013;\n- z 35 unit-linked funds offered by Predica have received the 'SRI' label, five have received the GreenFin label and 11 have received the Finansol label;\n- z Argus d'Or 'Civic company' 2019 award for the 'Stop Illiteracy' programme.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

For individuals, it was for example the cover of the cost of daily indemnity payments for vulnerable individuals signed off work.\n\nContracts were swiftly adapted at no additional cost to policyholders to provide cover for the exceptional situation:\n\n- z for individuals, measures to support working from home (civil liability cover for working from home, extending the cover provided by certain motor insurance policies) and the introduction of features to help policyholders on the Ma Sant\u00e9 app (news about Covid, online doctor consultations, psychological support);\n- z for business customers, cover of buildings unoccupied due to lockdown, deferral of instalments and premium payments, commitment  to  maintain  cover  provided  by  business  and professional policies in the event of late payment. As landlord, deferral of rent payments for small businesses;\n\n- z for health professionals (doctors, nurses) and front line workers during lockdown (firefighters, police and teachers), removal of the excess on motor insurance policies in the event of an accident if the vehicle is used in relation to work (travelling from home to work, doing rounds), h ome insurance cover for properties made available to care workers and extension of professional indemnity insurance to policyholders and retirees for providing online medical services, and for everything outside their usual sphere of competence to help fight the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to supporting its own customers and in accordance with the Group's mission statement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances made a commitment to be useful to civil society during this unprecedented crisis:\n\n- z contributing to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's emergency fund for the elderly;\n- z contribution of \u20ac38/uni00A0million to the solidarity fund set up by public authorities  to  support  micro-companies  and  independent professionals severely affected by the crisis;\n- z the '1 death & disability policy taken out = \u20ac5 donation to a local charity' campaign run from 1/uni00A0June to 10/uni00A0September 2020 enabled Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to pay over \u20ac450,000 to over 90/uni00A0local charities helping to combat the impact of Covid-19.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## ACTING AS A RESPONSIBLE INSURER\n\n## TAKING AN ETHICAL APPROACH TO CUSTOMERS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities strive to take an ethical approach to their customers and partners, in particular by making sure that they comply with their service commitments.\n\nWithin the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, new products and services are analysed by internal Committees (called 'New Products and New Business' (NAP) Committees). These Committees are specific to each French and international entity, and are made up primarily of representatives of the Risk, Legal, Actuarial, Marketing and Compliance functions, among others. Their main role is to ensure that the products offered to customers fulfil a real need, that they comply with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's CSR policy and that the tools provided to the distribution networks enable them to effectively fulfil their duty to advise in the best possible conditions. They ensure that legislative and regulatory provisions are adhered to: clarity of the information provided to customers, definition of a target\n\nmarket, prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, fraud prevention, compliance with internal banking and financial Codes of Conduct and procedures,/uni00A0etc.\n\nFor  several  years  now,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  been developing  actions  to  strengthen  its  responsibility  towards  its policyholders:\n\n- z customers and partner networks are regularly involved in designing new products in co-creation workshops, during which their needs are assessed in depth and their reactions to new proposals are analysed;\n- z customers are also involved in the product lifecycle via their representatives on the governing bodies of associations that have taken out life insurance contracts: in particular, these bodies must approve any changes made to the contracts.\n\n## BUILDING A LASTING RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS\n\n## Ensure that products are clear and/uni00A0understandable\n\nCr\u00e9d it  Agricole  Assurances  has  developed  a  product  offering suited to all types of customers - individuals, small businesses, farmers and corporations - in response to the different insurance needs of its partners' customers. In the business market, a clear, understandable product offering is key to retaining the loyalty of business customers. It is essential to be transparent about the real costs to avoid the consequences of any nasty surprises. Thanks to the partner banks operating locally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances provides all its customers, regardless of segment, with a summary view of claims experience and indicates the appropriate measures taken to guarantee the technical equilibrium of the contract.\n\nMoreover, advertising material and contracts are carefully scrutinised, with an emphasis on the objectivity and transparency of the documents; for example, risks as well as benefits must be prominently displayed.\n\n## Support the distribution networks in providing high quality customer advice\n\nThe distribution networks are trained to identify customer needs using their customer discovery tools. Customers' insurance needs and knowledge of financial mechanisms are assessed. The networks also receive regular training in the product offers, especially in the case of new product launches or product changes. For each new product, Predica and Pacifica produce and circulate a training pack\n\n(branch manager pack, advisor pack, e-learning, microlearning,/uni00A0etc.) for the distribution networks of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks and LCL. These packs are designed to give the distributors the necessary resources to understand and explain the features of new products so that they can sell them correctly. Furthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's Group insurance business has provided the sales teams of its partner banks with more than 30/uni00A0hours of training on  regulatory  developments,  products,  tools  and  management processes. Advisor training is a key marker used by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in ensuring the excellence of its relationships. It is now reinforced by the Insurance Distribution Directive, which requires advisors to undergo 15/uni00A0hours of training each year.\n\nFor  personal  protection  and  property  &  casualty  products,  an 'e-Wheel'  tool  shared  with  the  customer  enables  an  approach based on exchange, listening, awareness and satisfaction. It helps discover customers' needs so that they can be offered the most appropriate protection. Accessible from the adviser's workstation and as a tablet application, the e-Wheel helps advisers to present and explain all personal and property protection options to customers in a completely transparent way. A summary of the products selected by the customer is sent by email and archived at the end of each interview.\n\nIn the LCL network, CACI has rolled out iCACI/uni00A0Immo, a 100% digital insurance writing tool, which aims to better identify customer needs and shorten and streamline the process for taking out policies. With the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks, CACI has introduced an interactive digital educational tool to support the branch advisers in selling creditor insurance (presentation of coverage, simulation of the split between borrowers, comparison of contracts,/uni00A0etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

This is a new holistic and dynamic advisory approach that makes high quality  wealth  management  advice  (building  up  and  protecting capital) accessible to all customers. Based on a shared customeradviser application available in-branch, this approach combines human with digital to inform the customer of all available solutions, thus optimising the Customer and Adviser experience.\n\n## Optimise service quality\n\n## Claims administration\n\nFor  an  insurer,  handling  claims  (fire,  theft,  water  damage,  hail damage,  road  accidents,/uni00A0 etc.)  is  a  major  issue  in  terms  of responsibility. Pacifica therefore offers an active, fast service, along with quality customer support. The claims administration centres and partner networks involved in this service are in close proximity to the customers making the claim and are therefore able to offer a solution tailored to each specific situation. In/uni00A0 2020, Pacifica once again demonstrated this ability to take action throughout the year, particularly at the time of specific, unusual events. 2020 was marked primarily by storm-related events affecting various regions of France, such as Storm Ciara in the north of France in February, Jorge-LeonKarine-Myriam in the southeast in March and Storm Alex in the Alpes Maritimes and Brittany in early October.\n\n## ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE HARD OF HEARING AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED\n\nIn/uni00A02018, Pacifica set up a specific partnership to make its telephone service for claims reporting and assistance accessible to people with impaired hearing, sight or speech (in accordance with the Digital Republic law). The purpose of the partnership is to provide a special reception service for them. Claims assistants have been trained to handle their very specific needs. The service includes a sign language interpreter and/or text transcription for the customer in real time. This solution, at no extra cost to the user, is already available to property & casualty and legal protection customers (individuals, small businesses and farmers) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and LCL across the existing channels: web portal and Pacifica smartphone app.\n\n## PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR CLAIMANTS\n\nEvery year, Pacifica handles more than a million claims ranging from simple windscreen breakage through to serious events (house or business fire, serious injury). Such events can be very distressing for customers and require a response that goes beyond merely paying out the benefits.\n\nCustomers need personalised psychological support in their daily life and their future plans. In response to this issue, Pacifica has introduced a psychological support service during the post-claim period for customers who have suffered terrorist attacks, accidents or serious weather events. The service consists of putting customers and/or their families into contact with a psychologist from our partner Rehalto,  who  will  help  them  overcome  their  emotional  trauma. In/uni00A0 2020, Pacifica called on Re halto for 861 claims, down 22.4% compared with 2019 when it was called on for 1,109 claims. This\n\nreduction is primarily due to the lower number of claims relating to burglaries and fires during lockdown, which are still the main reasons for requiring support for policyholders making claims.\n\nFor personal injury victims, two new support measures enable our customers to rebuild their lives and help to overcome their disability: Kareo Horizon with a comprehensive case management system to create a new life plan, and Equiphoria using hippotherapy (physical re-education)  and  equitherapy  (psychological  benefits)  to  help people with motor and mental disabilities.\n\n## CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATION INDEX FOLLOWING A CLAIM (1)\n\n|          | 2018             | 2019             | 2020             |\n|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Pacifica | 43/uni00A0points | 43/uni00A0points | 44/uni00A0points |\n\n- (1) Out of 4,500 Pacifica individual customers making a property & casualty claim between 1/uni00A0October 2019 and 30/uni00A0September 2020.\n\n## GROUP INSURANCE\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018, the Group insurance business introduced an analytical approach to death & disability insurance. In/uni00A02019, a medical check process was introduced and applied to the entire portfolio. The employer company receives a report and, depending on absenteeism levels, solutions may be proposed to help get employees back to work. This approach continued in/uni00A02020 with a digital dashboard for the employer.\n\n## Complaints handling\n\nComplaints, along with surveys, are a way of assessing customer satisfaction and, as such, deserve special attention. Dissatisfied customers expect a prompt response with clear and transparent information.  They  expect  their  questions  to  be  answered  and corrective action taken where necessary.\n\nThe  procedure  for  handling  customer  complaints  is  regularly updated so that each business line can improve the existing system, particularly in terms of customer information about how to make a complaint, handling times and the existence of a mediation charter.\n\nIn France, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole or LCL banking networks are the main contacts for handling complaints about insurance policies. If needed, customers can contact the relevant insurance companies, particularly with regard to claims handling and, if agreement cannot be reached, they may also contact the mediation service of the French Insurance Federation (FFA).\n\nPredica has a set of procedures that include a periodic review of the main reasons for complaints. This may lead to improving the information provided to customers or amending procedures to make them  clearer  and  more  explicit.  Information  from  this  periodical analysis is included in a ' Voix du Client ' (customer voice) process intended to steer the resolution of all customer grievances identified. Major complaints are also reported annually to the Management Committee.\n\nPredica is currently conducting a wide-scale review of its Assistance processes for its networks and customers. This work should help to optimise handling times and improve Predica's ability to understand and deal with the issues reported by its policyholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "As part of a project devoted to complaints initiated in/uni00A02014, Pacifica has developed key indicators to analyse complaints, thus promoting a better knowledge of customer expectations, expressed through dissatisfaction. As a result of this process, changes may be made to certain contracts to make sure that the policyholders have a clearer understanding of their contract. In parallel with these indicators, in/uni00A0 2017  Pacifica  introduced  a  system  of  obtaining  immediate feedback from customers about their claims handling. More than eighteen thousand policyholders were invited to give their opinion on how their claim had been handled. Their opinions can be found on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Bank portals. This system supplements the information gathered during annual surveys to measure policyholder satisfaction.\n\nThe  main  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  companies  have  made  a commitment to honour the time frames for processing customer complaints. Pacifica undertakes to deal with requests within 60/uni00A0days and 90% are handled within 30/uni00A0days (in 70% of cases, an answer is given in fewer than two weeks).\n\nIn  creditor  insurance  and  death  &  disability  insurance,  handling of complaints is assessed yearly and the results are reported to Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Executive  Committee.  These  yearly assessments analyse trends and regulatory changes, and define corrective measures. As part of a continuous progress approach, the root causes of complaints are analysed in order to remedy any dysfunctions observed and check that the handling process is correctly applied. In addition, particular attention is paid to the handling of complaints resulting from insurance mediation.\n\nRegular training about handling customer complaints is provided for management teams in accordance with GDPR requirements.\n\n## Home care services\n\nThe home care services market is a highly demanding sector that long had a bad reputation, mainly due to a lack of professionalism on the part of both the service providers and the carers. Since its creation in/uni00A02007, Viavita, a Pacifica subsidiary specialising in home care services, has been developing a network of high quality home care service providers. From the outset, Viavita drew up a highly demanding quality charter to select only the best service providers based on essential criteria, including quality of customer relations, quality of services proposed, professionalism and training of carers, compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  engagement,  respect  for  the customer's private life and requisite approvals and authorisations. Thanks to its information systems, Viavita can oversee the quality delivered by the service providers on a daily basis, using a scalable scoring tool.\n\n## Unclaimed contracts\n\nAs regards unclaimed life insurance policies, Predica, together with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group banks (Regional Banks and LCL), has implemented procedures to find and identify beneficiaries. If these initial efforts are not conclusive, the teams responsible for finding the beneficiaries will then call on a network of specialised service providers, including genealogy firms and private detectives.\n\nLastly,  awareness-raising  measures  are  taken  with  customers, particularly when the contract is taken out and when key life events occur.  The  purpose  of  these  checks  is  to  make  sure  that  the beneficiary clause is still appropriate for the family situation and in accordance with the policyholder's wishes.\n\n## Guarantee personal data protection\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has implemented the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on 25/uni00A0May 2018.\n\nUnder this regulation, all processing of personal data must comply, from  the  outset,  with  the  provisions  on  data  protection  and professional secrecy as regards customers or more generally third parties related to the company.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances   has  also  distributed  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group's  personal  data  charter  to  its  employees,  which  notably requires personal data to be used in the customer's interest and in full transparency.\n\nFurthermore, when the Ma Sante app was launched, the Group insurance business took great care to inform policyholders about the use of their personal data, whether in relation to their insurance contract or their health data. Health data is hosted on a certified secure (HADS) server.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances seeks to build a lasting relationship with customers in all its products. This recognition of the consistency of measures put in place at all levels of the value chain is reflected by the customer satisfaction rate.\n\nPredica is working on improving its satisfaction rate and in/uni00A0 2019 launched a new methodology in order to achieve excellence in its relationships. The scope taken into account, as well as means of responding (increase from four to five means of responding), have been revised.\n\n| Customer satisfaction rate   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Pacifica (1)                 | 94%    | 93%    | 93%    |\n| Predica (2)                  | -      | 92%    | 90%    |\n| Viavita (3)                  | 95%    | 93%    | 96%    |\n\n- (1) Based on 4,500 individual Pacifica customers surveyed after a car home insurance claim.\n- (2) Based on 6 ,006  customers that responded to a satisfaction survey on Predica's main services. New methodology implemented in/uni00A02019.\n- ( 3 ) On the basis of 627 active customers interviewed by telephone by an independent organisation (Market Audit).\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insurance allows policyholders to directly face new risks.\n\n## Reduce social vulnerabilities: ageing population, disability, growing insecurity of/uni00A0some customer segments, isolation\n\n## Ageing and ageing well\n\n## LONG-TERM CARE\n\n90% of French people want to stay in their home as long as possible (1) and two out of every three French people have a family member who needs long-term care. (2) Supporting the ageing population is therefore a major challenge for the company and for society as a whole.\n\nTo respond to this challenge, Predica offers long-term care insurance. Approved by the French Federation of Insurance (FFA), its contract guarantees a minimum income of \u20ac500 in cases of severe long-term care needs, either to finance home care services or to cover part of the costs of living in a care home. This solution also meets the needs of families faced with a loved one's loss of independence, by providing a range of services such as financing respite leave with an allowance of \u20ac1,000 per year. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's healthcare partners are committed to providing a response within 72 hours and a solution within 30/uni00A0days, for policyholders looking to go into a care home. Their carers can also benefit from at-home training in essential carer skills provided by a nurse. Regulations have been expected to change for many years, which would allow for a better positioning for this offering. At the end of/uni00A02020, Predica insured more than 163,000/uni00A0people for long-term care risks.\n\nBased on these elements, Viavita, a subsidiary that provides home care services, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group initiated a new approach called  'Living  Well  at  Home'.  This  customer  approach  aims  to support seniors who wish to stay in their home as well as their carers.\n\nUsing a tablet application, the banking adviser can discuss the senior customer's life plans and needs as regards vital issues such as social relationships, day-to-day life, and comfort and security in the home. After the initial discussion, the tablet application provides the customer with advice and prevention messages, as well as the Group's solutions to meet the customer's needs (home care services, assistance in procedures, adapting the home, helpline and remote monitoring,  insurance,/uni00A0 etc.).  Customers  who  tried  out  this  new approach were highly satisfied as it gave them a real understanding of and information about useful solutions to support them in their life plan. Bank advisors also particularly appreciate this approach, which has enabled them to re-establish their links with older customers and better understand their needs. The experiment conducted by three\n\nRegional Banks in/uni00A0 2019 was convincing, and at the end of/uni00A02020, six Regional Banks had already implemented this human-led and innovative approach in their region, with others set to begin in/uni00A02021.\n\nWith the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's desire to continue to enhance the 'Living Well At Home' approach and better address caregivers' needs, a number of working groups were set up in/uni00A0 2020, whose work made it possible to lay out the initial outline of a support system and a range of relevant products and services. These hypotheses were submitted to a panel of caregivers by means of a qualitative study jointly financed by Viavita and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., and carried out by an independent consulting firm in October/uni00A02020. The results of this qualitative study will enable the Group to continue its work.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances finances the Demographic Transitions Economic Transitions Chair, devoted to assessing and analysing the impacts of the unprecedented demographic shock currently being experienced in France. Since/uni00A02015, the Chair has transformed this analysis into proposed actions to give new life to a generational contract based on the belief that all economic policy measures must be thought out and implemented from an intergenerational perspective.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  also  partners  France  Silver  Eco,  an association founded in/uni00A02009 under the direction of the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Employment and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. Its role is to develop the silver economy and promote innovative solutions for active ageing.\n\nLastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes part in the think tank led by the FFA, which began at the time of the public consultation on financing long-term care led by the Ministry of Health. The purpose of the think tank is to make concrete proposals to the government for a future Long-Term Care law. In parallel, the Group continues to invest in the development and management of residential homes for seniors.\n\n## INDIVIDUAL HEALTH\n\nTo respond to public health priorities, the Pacifica health offerings for individual customers are ethical and responsible. Therefore, no medical selection takes place, the coordinated healthcare circuit is respected, minimum reimbursements (such as patient contributions to consultations, pharmacy fees and hospital costs) are applied and preventive procedures are covered. To support the increase in life expectancy, Pacifica long ago raised the age limit for taking out its contracts to 75 and has adapted its cover to better meet the needs of these people (for example, housework hours if the person is unable to move, and prevention actions such as free flu vaccinations).\n\nIn  addition,  health  products  and  services  have  included  100% Sant\u00e9 since 1/uni00A0January 2020 in order to support the 'nothing to pay' principle for our customers and thereby reduce incidences of denial of care for the most vulnerable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE\n\nIn June/uni00A0 2018, Pacifica revamped its personal accident insurance offering. Apart from raising the age limit to 75, Pacifica also paid close attention to older customers, with an extension of cover to their grandchildren (under the age of 18) when in their grandparents' care and in their parents' absence. In/uni00A02019, the extension of cover was extended to nephews and nieces under the age of 17, in the event of temporary care. Childcare is costly and people are increasingly turning to family members for their childcare needs, particularly when returning to a low-paid or insecure job. It was therefore essential to find a 'full' protection solution covering the children when in the care of other close family members. Pacifica has also added ' Coup Dur 50/50 ' to its insurance cover, which pays out \u20ac50 a day for people over the age of 50 if they are hospitalised for more than 48 hours within a limit of 60/uni00A0days per insured event.\n\n## Inclusion of vulnerable populations\n\n## SOLIDARITY POLICY\n\nMany savers would like to invest in socially responsible investments while still earning an acceptable return, in order to finance activities that combat exclusion and promote social cohesion or sustainable development. Predica launched a 'Solidarity Policy' in/uni00A02013, the first multi-fund ethical life insurance policy to win the Finansol label. (1) It is an innovative policy that combines savings and social benefits, with:\n\n- z an ethical euro investment fund specially created for this contract, including investments of 5% to 10% in social enterprises ( via the Finance et Solidarity investment fund managed by Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's asset manager). The remainder is managed in the same way as Predica's general assets, which includes an ESG filter;\n- z a range of six solidarity-based unit-linked funds certified by Finansol, including investments of 5% to 10% in social enterprises ( via the Finance et Solidarity investment fund for funds managed by Amundi). The remainder is managed on the basis of ESG criteria.\n\nEvery year Predica sends 'Solidarity Policy' customers a report on the social impact generated by the contract funds (number of jobs created or consolidated, number of people housed, number of care beneficiaries, tonnes of waste recycled, number of micro loans granted internationally,/uni00A0etc.). For unit-linked funds, the social impact is related to each fund's total assets under management on the market.\n\nAdvisor support was reinforced in/uni00A0 2020 with a new e-learning programme, and the inclusion of the solidarity policy in T\u00e9o, a sales support tool. Customers meanwhile benefited from a pre-sales document and an updated Facebook presence.\n\nAt the end of/uni00A0 2020, the Solidarity Policy's performance was as follows:\n\n- z \u20ac23.7/uni00A0million in assets under management (up 35% compared with end-2019);\n- z contract sold by 24 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks ( versus 15 at end-2017).\n\n## PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPL\u00c9MENTAIRE SANT\u00c9 SOLIDAIRE SCHEME (FREE TOP-UP HEALTH INSURANCE)\n\nOn 1/uni00A0November 2019, the ACS (2) and CMU-C (3) merged to become Compl\u00e9mentaire Sant\u00e9 Solidaire to improve access to healthcare for people who were eligible for the ACS. This new scheme offers a unique and regulated level of cover. Customers are still means tested to ensure that they are eligible. Pacifica has decided to continue taking part in the scheme and has therefore modulated its product offering and updated its processes.\n\n## POINTS PASSERELLE\n\nPoints  Passerelle  is  a  mechanism  for  helping  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole customers in financial difficulties following a life crisis such as job loss, separation, death, illness,/uni00A0etc. They receive free guidance and advice from dedicated advisers who help them get back on their feet financially. These customers should not have to give up their mobility or have to drive without insurance due to financial difficulties. On the contrary, a car is often essential when looking for a job. We have therefore introduced a scheme to reimburse six months of car insurance premiums for these customers who are already insured by Pacifica. The financial cost is shared between Pacifica and the Regional Banks offering the scheme.\n\n## SOCIAL ACTION FUND\n\nSince/uni00A02018, the Group insurance business has taken several social action initiatives for a few targeted large accounts by setting up a special assistance fund (fed by various mechanisms) intended to meet the exceptional healthcare needs of employees for care not covered by the Group insurance contract. The approach has continued and the study of the deployment of a general social action fund for all our insureds has been carried out in 2020 for a planned deployment in 2021.\n\n## Combat climate change by encouraging virtuous customer behaviour\n\nThe frequency of serious weather events such as hail, drought, flood and severe cold is increasing. According to experts and the latest IPCC reports, these changes are due to increased greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity. The cost of natural disasters in the years to come will be exponential if people do not change their behaviour. Insurance can help limit these greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging policyholders to behave in a more environmentallyfriendly way. It also provides support in high-risk situations.\n\n## Comprehensive home insurance\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  introduced  insurance  cover  for renewable energy facilities (solar panels, wind turbines) as part of its comprehensive home insurance and all-risks business and farming insurance policies. These products also include energy producer civil liability in the event of harm caused to third parties.\n\nThe 25% premium reduction on the first year of home insurance initially offered to people taking out an eco-PTZ loan (interest-free loan to finance work to improve a building's energy efficiency) was then extended to the Energy Economy Loan. More flexible than an eco-PTZ loan, this loan finances work designed to save energy, for  example  insulating  walls  and  glazed  surfaces,  purchasing  a condensation boiler,/uni00A0etc.\n\n- (1)  The Finansol label guarantees that the funds invested will be used to finance activities with a high social value and that the fund management company will provide regular, reliable and clear information.\n- (2)  ACS is a State aid that covers all or part of a person's top-up health insurance contributions. It is allocated according to income and household composition and the amount allocated depends on beneficiary's age. Since 1/uni00A0July 2015, around ten organisations, including Pacifica, have been authorised to offer top-up healthcare policies for beneficiaries of the ACS state aid.\n- (3)  CMU-C = Couverture Maladie Universelle Compl\u00e9mentaire (free top-up health insurance).\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

The battery and cable are also insured in the event of theft or damage, even if they are rented.\n\nPacifica is also adapting to new uses and covers insurance needs for ride sharing (driver injury, protection of passengers, including when they take the wheel, and assistance). For policyholders travelling less than 5,000/uni00A0kilometres a year, Pacifica applies a premium reduction.\n\nSince/uni00A02018, Pacifica has extended its motorcycle insurance to cover new types of electric vehicle, thus meeting insurance needs and supporting new urban mobility solutions.\n\n## Reforestation campaign\n\nForests are the second most important carbon sink after oceans and an essential element in biodiversity. Action to protect forests is essential to help limit the effects of climate change both locally and globally. In/uni00A02019, therefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances strengthened its commitment to reforestation and sustainable forestry in France by pledging to plant a tree for every protection contract taken out, in\n\npartnership with Reforest'Action. Customers are made aware of this issue and they are involved in the approach, as they can choose from several different plantation projects when taking out their contract.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020,  277,402/uni00A0 trees  were  planted  in  France  thanks  to  this campaign.\n\n## Responsible Investment\n\nPredica offers socially responsible unit-linked funds in the multi-fund life insurance products distributed by its networks. These socially responsible unit-linked funds offer primarily thematic and best-inclass approaches.\n\nAs of/uni00A0 2020, rolling out this responsible investment approach has formed part of an overall approach with regards the networks in cooperation with Premundi and Amundi (events, sales techniques, pitch,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nAt the end of/uni00A0 2020, 49 unit-linked funds offered by Predica had received one or more of the SRI, Finansol and GreenFin labels.\n\n## STEPPING UP THE PREVENTIVE APPROACH\n\nPrevention, as supported by a dedicated governance body - the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Prevention Committee - has been an ongoing theme since/uni00A02012 in the form of coordinated actions, which are planned and assessed in the light of their usefulness for customers. This has given rise within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group to unwavering and unanimous support for its importance for 'individual and collective wellbeing'. The implementation of a prevention-led approach is concrete proof of the Group's support for its customers.\n\nThe  Covid-19  health  crisis  has  highlighted  the  importance  of prevention, by means of barrier measures, in stopping the virus from spreading.\n\nThis historic event has confirmed its belief in the importance of prevention  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  stepped  up  its support for its customers through a number of initiatives to raise awareness about the risks to which they are exposed and which are covered by an insurance policy. Customers are provided with relevant prevention  advice  for  their  situation,  along  with  recommended protection  measures  or  specific  training.  This  year,  due  to  the lockdown and relaxation of lockdown, advice and information have focused more on personal accidents, cyber-risks, returning to driving and reopening businesses.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is also continuing to raise customer awareness through prevention advice included in:\n\n- z the general terms and conditions of all insurance policies written by the property & casualty subsidiary, which can be found in the customer's account area of the online bank;\n\n- z during meetings between advisors and customers in relation to their business activity;\n- z during specific workshops organised as part of larger events.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, the 'common thread' theme initiated in/uni00A02019 concerning raising awareness about common personal accidents continued, with a programme including a digital game ' Halte aux chutes ' ('Stop the falls') as well as an awareness-raising initiative based on virtual reality. This innovation concerned the five most common household risks for children (burns, falls, shocks, suffocation, intoxication) and was supplemented in/uni00A02020 with a module on preventing falls among the elderly.\n\nThis  prevention  advice  was  also  made  available  to  member shareholders at the annual general meetings of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Local Banks, which this year carried on the theme of new forms of mobility with motorised personal transportation equipment and prevention of climate risk.\n\nExtra customer support is provided in relation to certain themes or for certain groups:\n\n- z a free preventive driving course is offered to young drivers, who are especially likely to be involved in road accidents. The course teaches them how to handle their vehicle in emergency situations; A study conducted in/uni00A02019 shows a reduction in the frequency of accidents causing personal injury and material damage of around 17.5% over the period from/uni00A02014 to 2017 for customers who took the course;\n- z for professionals and farmers, training in environmentally friendly driving is offered to everyone taking out a business motor insurance policy;",

After two claims of the same kind, customers receive personalised advice by letter with an offer for turnkey services suited to the nature of their claim, for example the contact details of a CCTV partner if the claims were for theft or the contact details of a partner to check electrical systems if the claims were for electrical damage;\n- z proposal of insurance products including support services to help customers and their relatives in the event of death, dependency or disability. Assistance contracts also complement the range of death & disability cover, thereby providing access to preventive advice.\n\nTo help to safeguard the businesses of farming and professional customers,  a  network  of  over  20  prevention  experts  has  been put together within the Regional Banks to provide a local service. Prevention  experts  undergo  high-level  training  resulting  in  a qualification at IFCAM, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's university.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances supports the Regional Banks in offering fun, educational events for their mutual shareholders on preventing road risks, personal accidents, first aid or risks of falling for the elderly. As of this year, this also includes prevention of digital risks. More than 20,000/uni00A0 people took part in these events in/uni00A0 2020, held in partnership with specialist prevention associations and providers.\n\nAnother important new service was launched in/uni00A0 2020, a weather alerts service in partnership with Predict, French market leader in this area. At the end of November, more than 3.2/uni00A0million SMS had been sent to customers to ensure their safety and provide them preventive advice relating to the relevant weather conditions (heatwave, storms, strong winds, extreme cold).\n\nLastly, the business insurance offering created and rolled out this year by Pacifica included proactive preventive measures:\n\n- z the comprehensive system of risk and prevention visits carried out when taking out a multi-risk business insurance policy;\n- z a risk management approach allowing for exhaustive analysis and information on how to prevent the risks to which businesses are exposed (whether covered by an insurance policy or not);\n- z a booklet on preventing road risks plus, at the request of the customer insuring their fleet, an audit of the car fleet and recommended preventive measures to be taken by the business owner;\n- z proposed training in environmentally friendly driving for employees.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances rolled out the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Ma Sant\u00e9 app to help policyholders look after their health, including specialist  and  personalised  content  on  various  health  issues, guidance  through  the  healthcare  process,  online  advice  and consultations and health coaching proposals tailored to the person or type of job. 70% of policyholders are now registered with the platform, which in/uni00A02020 also provided information about Covid-19.\n\n## SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS FACED WITH NEW RISKS\n\n## Helping the agricultural world to succeed in its ecological and energy transition\n\n## Support the agricultural world\n\nPacifica  supports  farmers  faced  with  the  challenges  of  climate change,  by  offering  insurance  for  most  types  of  crops  (largescale farming, vineyards, orchards) to protect against almost all weather events that may affect them including drought, hail, excess rainfall, floods, storms and frost, as well as insuring forests against fire  or  storms.  At  31/uni00A0 October  2020,  Pacifica  managed  around 28,000/uni00A0climate insurance policies (crop, hail and pasture insurance).\n\nPacifica and Airbus Defence & Space have developed a global innovation, the Pasture Production Index, which makes it possible to measure changes in pasture production by satellite and use this as the basis for an insurance policy. This index has now been adopted by all insurers providing pasture insurance in France and internationally. The challenge is to be able to insure pastures that are severely affected by successive droughts as have been seen over a number of years and which risk happening again.\n\nThe damage caused by cyclone Klaus in/uni00A0 2009 demonstrated the need to exploit and redevelop France's forests, most of which are\n\nprivately owned. Insurance is a way to protect this natural heritage as, in the event of storm or fire, it is easier to replant an insured forest than a non-insured forest. Just one replanted forest can act as a carbon well, while a forest left abandoned releases carbon dioxide. Pacifica offers forest insurance to cover forest owners for the financial consequences of fire, storms, natural disasters and civil liability.\n\nAt the end of/uni00A0 2020, more than 1/uni00A0 million hectares of forests were insured, making Pacifica the leading name in the market.\n\nFor the last 10/uni00A0years, a research initiative into new agricultural risks (mainly climate change related) and potential responses has been carried out in active partnership with Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine, Universit\u00e9  de  Paris-Nanterre,  several  research  laboratories  and Airbus  Defence  and  Space.  A  second  research  initiative  based on the first has been created to carry out a four-year experiment of an unprecedented scale to measure on the ground changes in pasture production as a result of climate change. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Grameen foundation is involved in this research work in order to be able to offer operational insurance solutions for crops in developing countries.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

Behind this question lies a real concern, as we do not know enough about the impact of changes in farming practices on farms' resilience. Since/uni00A02018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has marked its commitment to supporting the agricultural transition towards more sustainable practices. A three-year agreement was signed with AgroParisTech to become a partner of the Grignon Energie Positive (GE+) initiative. GE+ is a technical and research programme that aims to improve agriculture's economic, energy and environmental performance. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances brings the programme its expertise in risk management and will work on assessing and quantifying new risks for farmers inherent in changing agricultural practices. This innovative approach will enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to precisely identify needs and propose risk management tools adapted to these new agricultural practices.\n\n## ANAEROBIC DIGESTION\n\nThe multi-year energy programme published in/uni00A02019 sets a biogas production target of 24 to 32/uni00A0 TWh in/uni00A0 2028 ( vs. 11.4 TWh at the end of/uni00A02019). The number of anaerobic digestion facility projects in the farming industry has therefore increased sharply (800 at project stage in France). Insurance for these facilities is essential to protect the  anaerobic  digestion  business  and  agricultural  production. Pacifica  has  developed  an  insurance  offering  covering  damage to property (fire, storm-hail-snow, machine breakdown, electrical damage), business interruption and civil liability for energy suppliers that resell electricity, heat and gas, as well as employer liability (where applicable) and civil liability due to damage to the environment.\n\nPacifica has positioned itself at the heart of the development of the anaerobic digestion business by taking part in working groups with GRDF to draw up practical guidelines, as well as supporting Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Regional Banks network on the ground by means of  training  and  technical  support  for  sales  staff  on  these  new risks. Pacifica is working on these issues in close collaboration with CAMCA, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's specific risk insurance company, which offers construction insurance for these anaerobic digestion facilities. As a result of all these measures, the number of agricultural anaerobic digestion units insured by Pacifica saw a fourfold increase between 2014 and 2020.\n\n## Managing pollution risk\n\nThe law of 1/uni00A0August 2008 created a new environmental responsibility for  companies  based  on  the  'polluter  pays'  principle.  The  law requires the operator to take all prevention and protection measures to avoid all risks. In the event of environmental damage (soil pollution, damage to surface and underground water quality, preservation of species and protected natural habitats), the operator's obligations include repairing damage and restoring protected natural habitats, protected areas and species. Pacifica has therefore included cover, at no additional cost, in its all-risks business and agricultural policies for the cost of preventing imminent damage to the environment. This cover enables the operator to remain solvent in the event of environmental damage.\n\nAsbestos is very common in agricultural buildings built before/uni00A01997. If the building is damaged by fire or storm, the asbestos must be removed when repairing or rebuilding. Asbestos removal is a costly operation and requires specialist skills. The all-risks agricultural and business  policies  include  unlimited  reimbursement  of  asbestos removal costs following a claim event.\n\n## Adapt products to new uses and behaviours\n\n## Portability of driver protection insurance for rented vehicles (car and motorcycle insurance)\n\nNew driving practices are emerging as a result of the sharing economy. Ride  sharing  and  car  sharing  are  the  main  examples.  Pacifica accompanies them with, in particular, cover for both passengers and driver and liability cover for car lending. However, insurance for peer-to-peer, business-to-consumer and self-service car hire is generally of poor quality, particularly as regards driver protection. To strengthen its position as a responsible bancassurer, Pacifica's car and motorcycle insurance policies now include portability of the 'driver protection' cover for hire vehicles. Customers with a Pacifica car or motorcycle insurance policy will therefore be covered for driver injury protection for up to \u20ac1/uni00A0million with no minimum amount in the event of an accident during the hire period, in addition to the cover provided by the car hire operator's insurance. This additional feature is automatically included in all car and motorcycle policies, at no extra cost.\n\n## Boat sharing with the Assurance Plaisance policy\n\nNew  features  offered  by  Pacifica  include  'policyholder  injury protection' included in all policies, plus a 'boat hire' option to cover the boat when hired out (trips to sea or nights in dock).\n\n## Insuring new types of electric vehicle\n\nIn the last few years, new types of electric vehicle have appeared in towns, such as electric scooters, hoverboards, monowheels and e-bikes. Pacifica has devised an insurance solution for this new means of mobility by making them eligible for insurance under the motorcycle policy.\n\n## House sharing with the 'rental accommodation pack' in home insurance policies\n\nWith the boom in the sharing economy, more and more people are letting their homes out to travellers such as holiday makers, tourists and businessmen, in order to make some extra money. Hosts either make the entire home available, or just one room, for one or more nights, or even the entire school year. In most cases, hosts use dedicated platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. In these conditions, Pacifica has adapted its home insurance cover to meet the new needs driven by the sharing economy. The 'rental\n\n<!-- image -->",

Healthcare costs can be very costly in some countries and often, their healthcare cover in France is not valid in other countries. This new product offer gives Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances an opportunity to maintain a relationship with these young people during their stay abroad. It is available to anyone under the age of 31 and covers reimbursement of their healthcare costs with no excess, a 24/7 multilingual hotline and assistance cover valid worldwide.\n\n## Revamp of the Personal Accident Insurance product\n\nPacifica will pay out for the most minor after-effects of a personal accident  (minimum  of  1%  permanent  functional  impairment). Children under the age of 26 can also be covered for psychological\n\nsupport in the event of harassment or cyber bullying. In today's world of ever-present smartphones and social networks, bullying among schoolchildren no longer stops at the school gates. Pacifica has therefore introduced this cover to support children who are victims of bullying during what can be very difficult and sometimes violent times.\n\n## Cyber-protection for small businesses, farmers, companies and associations\n\nIn an increasingly digital world, in which businesses and individuals handle ever greater amounts of information, cyber-threats have been growing exponentially over the past few years. More than 80% of companies have suffered at least one cyber-attack (1) and the threat is increasingly present for our customers. In these conditions, Pacifica has decided to protect its customers against this risk with its CyberProtection product offer.\n\nLaunched in/uni00A02018, it offers IT assistance to help the company restore its original data, obtain specialist help (lawyers, communications experts,/uni00A0 etc.),  cover  damage  related  to  cyber-fraud  and  cyberextortion, as well as third party cover in the case of losses suffered by third parties as a result of a violation, malicious use of or attack on data belonging them (identity theft, virus transmission,/uni00A0etc.). An income protection option is also available to cover total or partial business interruption following a cyber-attack.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into account when analysing, making and monitoring investment decisions, and has an appropriate reporting system to measure the progress made. Some sectors are also given priority with regard to the importance of certain social\n\nissues (health, renewable energy, financing of the economy) and in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's areas of excellence. Since the adoption of Article/uni00A0173-VI of the French law on energy transition for green growth, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has published an ESG-Climate report, available on its website ww.ca-assurances. com.\n\n## EMBEDDING ESG CRITERIA MORE DEEPLY IN INVESTMENT DECISIONS\n\n## Embedding ESG criteria in all asset classes\n\n## Amundi filter\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances relies on the expertise of Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's asset management company, as regards integrating non-financial (environmental, social and governance) criteria. Amundi has produced a set of 36/uni00A0criteria based on the laws and directives in force and on universally accepted principles. The weighting of each of these environmental, social or governance criteria was determined in line with the issues specific to each business sector.\n\nWithin each business sector, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group invests in European companies with the best ESG practices.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group will not invest in issuers proven to have repeatedly breached all or some of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Likewise, all issuers that design, manufacture or sell controversial weapons (cluster bombs,/uni00A0etc.) are excluded from investment portfolios.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also introduced an exclusion policy for the tobacco industry and it no longer holds any direct tobacco investments in its portfolios.\n\nAmundi's  rating  methodology  already  applies  to  all  managed portfolios.  For  bond  portfolios,  the  Investment  department  also applies its own ESG assessment filters.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  won  the  Global  Invest Sustainable Insurance Company of the Year award at Agefi's Global Invest Sustainable Awards on 11/uni00A0October 2018, rewarding it for the quality of its non-financial approach (integration of ESG criteria in investment management processes, contribution to financing the energy transition, clarity and transparency of its ESG report,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nIn/uni00A0 2021, the scope of application of ESG filters will be extended to sovereign debts in the bond portfolio and also listed securities in the diversification portfolio.\n\n## Real estate investment\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  continues  to  increase  the proportion of real estate assets with environmental certification (such as HQE, BREEAM and LEED) in its office property portfolio. All new programmes now include environmental certification.\n\nAt the end of September/uni00A02020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances held more than \u20ac5/uni00A0billion of certified floorspace, equal to around 825,000/uni00A0m 2 of certified floorspace out of a total of over 3.6/uni00A0million m 2 . Around 63% of office space in the portfolio is certified.\n\n## Developing shareholder engagement\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a committed shareholder and votes directly  for  its  strategic  investments.  They  are  managed  by  the Investment  department  which  sits  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of companies in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a shareholder. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances encourages the companies in which it invests to communicate more about the ESG aspects of their business.",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  therefore  also  invests  in  renewable  energy through energy infrastructures mainly located in France.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances signed its first partnership with ENGIE in onshore wind energy in/uni00A02013, which was reinforced in/uni00A02019 in the area of onshore wind power. In France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has been the leading institutional investor in the energy transition since/uni00A0 2018,  committed  to  developing  local  economies  through its major investments in infrastructure and renewable energy, in particular through its partnership with ENGIE.\n\nIn/uni00A02017, a second partnership was signed with Quadran, which has since been acquired by Direct Energie and then by Total.\n\nIn  December/uni00A0 2019,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  acquired  EDP's hydroelectric  portfolio  in  Portugal  with  ENGIE  and  Mirova.  The consortium won the call for tenders launched by EDP to acquire the second hydroelectric portfolio in Portugal, representing hydroelectric\n\nproduction capacity of 1.7/uni00A0 GW, for an enterprise value and an amount of \u20ac2.2/uni00A0 billion. This acquisition has strengthened Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances's  commitment  to  the  energy  transition  in Europe, a major pillar/uni00A0of its climate strategy, with partners recognised for their expertise in this field.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  also  developed  a  strategic partnership with ENGIE to develop renewable energies in Europe.\n\nIn June/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invested in the three 'Ambition Climat' funds coordinated by Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts and supported by the French Insurance Federation alongside 11 other institutional investors.\n\nIn  parallel,  in/uni00A0 2020  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  continued  its investment of \u20ac278/uni00A0 million (as at end-June) in bond funds that finance renewable energy production and invested \u20ac6/uni00A0billion in green bonds (as at end-September).\n\nThe combined wind and solar portfolio had reached 2.9/uni00A0 GW by end-2020, up from 2/uni00A0GW at end-2019. This portfolio makes CAA the leading institutional investor in renewable energy in France.\n\n## Calculating the carbon footprint of investment portfolios\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes a proactive approach to reducing the carbon footprint of its asset portfolios, relying on the two drivers described earlier.\n\nThe carbon footprint is an indicator that measures the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the operations of companies in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invests. It uses two methods to calculate the indicator: an issuer approach for part of the portfolio and an overall approach for the portfolio as a whole.\n\nAmundi's bottom-up approach focuses on calculating greenhouse gas emissions at the level of corporate and government issuers. The top-down approach developed by CA CIB (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank) maps greenhouse gas emissions across the entire asset portfolio by business sector and geographical area.\n\nThe two methods are described in the ESG-Climate report.\n\nThe overall objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the entire portfolio is based on an annual average reduction in line with national and international objectives (see ESG-Climate report).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a long-term project and will comprise several stages.\n\nA  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Ethical  Charter,  drawn  up  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances's parent company, was distributed to all employees in June/uni00A02017. It is always available on the entity's Intranet.\n\nThe Code of Conduct distributed since/uni00A02018 to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances employees as well as externally was updated in/uni00A02020:\n\n- z it is intended for all business lines and comprises themed guidance sheets setting out Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' commitment, how its commitment is put into practice, what to do and what not to do, and practical examples specific to each theme. Four areas are addressed: customer and supplier relations, labour, environmental and social issues, anti-corruption, and protecting the Group's reputation;\n- z there is one single Code for all of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's employer entities and its subsidiaries, thus strengthening a shared ethics and compliance culture;\n- z to drive its commitment to ethics yet further, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has chosen to publish its Code internally and externally. It is distributed internally to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities (Intranet, news stream, presentation video, specific article in the weekly newsletter) in both French and English to make it accessible to all employees in France and elsewhere in the world. In addition, it is available on corporate websites for external visibility.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances's  commitment  to  ethics  continued in/uni00A0 2019  with  a  support  plan  for  employees  to  accelerate  the development of an ethical culture.\n\n## Deploying a responsible compliance approach\n\nCompliance  means  adherence  to  legislative  and  regulatory provisions specific to the banking and finance sector, industry and ethical  standards  and  practices,  and  the  instructions  issued  by the executive body. Compliance contributes to stakeholder trust (customers,  employees,  investors,  regulators,  suppliers,/uni00A0 etc.)  in financial institutions by preventing the risk of judicial, administrative or disciplinary sanctions, major financial loss or reputational damage.\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Compliance  department  defines  the  policy implemented within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group to prevent non-compliance risks, such as money laundering, financing of terrorism, violation of  embargoes,  market  abuse,  conflicts  of  interest,  inadequate protection of customer or employee personal data, or poor advice.\n\nThe Compliance function has drawn up a number of documents, including:\n\n- z the Ethical Charter adopted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, translated into ten languages and given to all new Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group employees;\n- z the Code of Conduct, drawn up jointly with the Corporate Social Responsibility department;\n- z the Fides programme, comprising procedural memos setting out the regulations in terms of compliance.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole's Compliance department must also make sure that efficient mechanisms are in place to ensure effective compliance. To do this, the Compliance function in the Group's entities:\n\n- z advises operatives by giving opinions on transactions where it is asked to do so;\n- z takes part in the product marketing process (from design to distribution) and in sales and customer needs analysis strategies to provide them with a suitable offering;\n- z issues compliance notices to the business lines;\n- z identifies conflicts of interest in line with the Group conflict of interest policy;\n- z draws up compliance training plans and makes sure that employees complete the requisite compliance training;\n- z ensures that systems and operations function smoothly.\n\nThe  Compliance  function  uses  the  following  resources  for  this purpose:\n\n- z risk mapping to evaluate non-compliance risks within each entity;\n- z translating compliance standards into procedures, in conjunction with the business lines;\n- z reporting  on  compliance  risks  and  action  to  assess  the implementation of compliance arrangements;\n- z financial security tools including profiling software and customer account monitoring tools which are used to detect unusual and/or suspicious transactions, screening tools used to ensure compliance with asset freezes and embargoes, and information sharing tools which are used within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- z compliance tools, mainly those used to manage employees who hold insider information, and tools to prevent and manage conflicts of interest;\n- z tools to ensure compliance with disclosures of notifiable interests in securities giving access to the capital or voting rights of issuers.\n\nThe Compliance function has 59  full-time equivalent (FTE) employees structured as a business line within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group  in  order  to  ensure  harmonised  compliance  and  financial security practices.",

Training in compliance, financial security and fraud and corruption prevention may be either in-person or online, as applicable. Targeted compliance training may also be required depending on business line exposure to certain risks (for example prevention of market abuse).\n\n## Anti-money laundering and terrorism financing\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group places extreme importance on the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as compliance with international sanctions (asset freezes and embargoes).\n\nThe Group's Compliance department is responsible for implementing, across the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, and to ensure compliance with international sanctions.\n\nThe overall system is strengthened continuously in response to regulatory and risk assessment developments.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group implements anti-money laundering and terrorism financing training programmes within its various entities.\n\nTraining has also been provided in international sanctions. Annual training for all employees has been provided since/uni00A0 2015 to help them understand international sanctions and to become familiar with and know how to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn October/uni00A02015, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group signed an agreement with the US on a framework of penalties imposed on the Group following events that took place between/uni00A02003 and 2008. A remediation plan was implemented in February/uni00A02016 and will continue until/uni00A02021.\n\n## Fraud prevention\n\nA fraud prevention system is deployed in all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities.  In  a  climate  of  escalating  external  fraud  attempts  and growing complexity of fraud methods (particularly via cybercrime), the key challenges now lie in a proactive approach on the part of financial system operators. In this respect, awareness is a key component of prevention as it encourages people to be more on their guard.\n\nA training program specific to the Insurance business was devised in/uni00A0 2015 for the most exposed employees in order to raise their awareness about the risk of fraud and its prevention.\n\nIn addition to specific training, actions to raise employee awareness of the different types of existing and new external fraud to which they could fall victim are regularly organised.\n\nIn addition to the existing operational procedures and principles (selection procedures, segregation of tasks, authorisation management for management and payment tools,/uni00A0 etc.), the antifraud arrangements at Predica - Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's main life company - are based on a coordination unit whose role is to oversee this area and gain an overview of fraud attempts and proven cases of fraud. The fraud prevention system has been strengthened, in particular by revising the detection sheets for unusual cases and structuring and overseeing the network of fraud prevention stewards,\n\nwhich has helped to identify new fraud situations. This has prompted change to improve prevention, by adapting both procedures and product  terms  and  conditions.  In/uni00A0 2018,  several  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances Group companies continued to roll out fraud detection tools based on leading-edge technologies.\n\n## Prevention and detection of corruption\n\nIn line with its traditional values, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group believes that combating corruption is an important element of good business practice. Measures have been taken as regards money laundering and  fraud  prevention,  the  purchasing  policy,  the  segregation  of functions policy, prevention of conflicts of interests and internal rules governing gifts and incentives.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group also began work in/uni00A0 2018 on bringing its systems into line with the new requirements arising from the Sapin/uni00A02 anti-corruption law. Measures included appointing an anti-corruption steward, specific corruption risk mapping, the introduction of a Code of Conduct aiming to prevent inappropriate behaviour, and a whistleblowing procedure.\n\nAnti-corruption training for employees is available through e-learning.\n\nAt the end of/uni00A0 2020, on average across the reference cycle, over 90% of relevant employees in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group had received training in:\n\n- z day-to-day compliance (94%);\n- z external fraud prevention (96%);\n- z anti-corruption (96%).\n\nMore than 93% of relevant employees also received training in international sanctions and anti-money laundering.\n\nLastly, the new GDPR training module has been completed by more than 95% of employees.\n\n## Reporting of dysfunctions\n\nThe entire compliance framework (organisation, procedures, training programmes) creates an environment favourable to the enhancement of the control framework within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. Nonetheless, when preventive measures do not fully play their expected role and a dysfunction occurs, it must be:\n\n- z detected and then analysed as quickly as possible;\n- z reported to the operational managers and the Compliance functions at the most appropriate level within each business line;\n- z monitored and corrected, and its causes eliminated;\n- z reported to the Supervisory Authority in the case of the most important dysfunctions.\n\nCentralised reporting of dysfunctions in accordance with a specific procedure adapted by each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity enables exposure to non-compliance risk to be measured at the highest level of the company. Thus, employees who have reasonable grounds to suspect, or who witness, a compliance dysfunction must notify their line manager, who will report it to the Compliance function.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

This Committee reviews the report and approves proposals to remedy the dysfunctions.\n\nThis framework is completed by a whistleblowing facility enabling employees  who  witness  an  anomaly  in  the  normal  dysfunction reporting system or who feel under pressure to allow a dysfunction to occur, to notify the entity's Compliance officer of the situation without going through line management. The employee's identity remains anonymous throughout the whistleblowing procedure.\n\n## Conducting a responsible lobbying policy\n\n## ALIGNING TO BEST PRACTICES\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  conducts  its  lobbying  activities  in accordance with best practices set out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. and applied by its entities. In/uni00A0 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. adopted a Lobbying Charter which applies to all of its entities. In/uni00A0 2014, it signed Transparency International France's joint statement, thereby committing  to  the  transparency,  fairness  and  integrity  principles recommended by the association. Lastly, in accordance with the Sapin/uni00A0 2  law  of  9/uni00A0 December  2016,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances is registered on the digital register of interest representatives and complies with the guidelines issued by the France's High Authority for Transparency in Public life.\n\n## ORGANISING TRANSPARENCY\n\nThe Public Affairs unit is responsible for guiding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's lobbying activities. The unit has two full-time employees  in  Paris  who  are  in  continuous  contact  with  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.'s Public Affairs department. They regularly present matters to the internal bodies, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's Management Committee. This cross-functional body is thus made aware of future regulations and drives the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's lobbying activities.\n\n## ADDRESSING THE MAIN ISSUES\n\nThe Public Affairs unit conducts its activity at both French and European level. Most issues are addressed in close cooperation with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de l'Assurance . In/uni00A0 2020, action taken by the Public Affairs unit was aimed at the French public authorities in the context of the proposed radical reform of the insurance industry, and at the European institutions (European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of Europe).\n\nThe Public Affairs unit was able to highlight the important role played by insurers in long-term financing of the economy and to defend the bancassurance model in the service of its customers and society. A number of measures have been taken directly and through industry associations on major issues such as sustainable finance regulations, optimising prudential and accounting constraints, and distribution of financial products. Lastly, the Covid-19 crisis has prompted the Group to redouble its efforts regarding its customers since spring 2020.  The  Group  has  also  contributed  to  reviews  on  creating insurance cover for exceptional disasters with the aim of limiting the health and economic impacts of future pandemics as much as possible. This work has been presented to the public authorities.\n\n## ASSESSING AND MANAGING ESG AND CLIMATE RISKS\n\n## Managing ESG and climate risks\n\nAs the head of a major business for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has long taken part in the Group's Climate Finance initiatives as well as the long-term commitments to step up action in this area made at the end of/uni00A02018 and repeated in the 2022 Medium-Term Plan.\n\nIn order to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement, in June/uni00A02019 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole published its Group Climate strategy with the aim of stepping up its efforts and its commitments to supporting the energy transition. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances fully adheres to this Climate s trategy and plays an active role in its governance in order to ensure its implementation.\n\nAs the largest insurer in France and a major institutional investor, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  committed  to  three  key  priorities alongside the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group:\n\n- z supporting all customers in the transition to a 'low carbon' economy:\n- z through its investment activities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is mainly subject to the transition risks resulting from adjustments that issuers will have to make in order to move to a low carbon economy. This will affect the business model of some investments and could have an impact on their value. If issuers do not make those adjustments, they would risk having to discontinue businesses regarded as over-polluting or emitting too much greenhouse gas or pay regulatory fines, which could result in the impairment of the associated investments,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- z by providing information for its policyholders. In terms of climate reporting, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances implements the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This working group created by the G20 during COP/uni00A021 defines and issues recommendations of best practices in terms of business transparency on climate issues. In/uni00A02017, it specified the reporting elements expected in Universal Registration Documents, with four main areas: governance, strategy,  risk  management  and  measurement  indicators used. In addition to non-financial reporting, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group provides policyholders with information about its ESG-Climate policy by means of dedicated articles on its website,\n- z by developing its range of unit-linked funds with an ESG-Climate policy in order to offer customers a wide choice. Within the framework of the implementation of the PACTE  law, 34 unitlinked funds offered by Predica have received the 'SRI' label and three have received the GreenFin label;\n- z factoring environmental, social and governance criteria into its investment processes across a broad scope (see details under Acting as a responsible investor):\n- z as of/uni00A02020, extend the ESG assessment to all new Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  investments and financing to ensure consistency in their economic, social and environmental impacts,\n\n<!-- image -->",

In/uni00A0 2019, a review of direct and indirect investments in the coal sector was conducted and allowed for the initiation of a plan to sell the main exposures identified,\n- z continuing and stepping up partnerships in order to increase investment in energy and ecological transition, as with the strategic partnership with Engie to develop renewable energies in Europe;\n- z invest in and encourage the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects, such as the acquisition of Portugal's second largest hydroelectric portfolio in a consortium with Mirova and ENGIE.\n\nThese actions bring into play the following governance framework:\n\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes part in the governance bodies for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group's Climate strategy introduced as part of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan;\n- z internally, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's Board of Directors, made up of nine directors and one non-voting director, defines and approves all strategic decisions, in particular ESG-Climate matters, that may influence business performance. The Investment department works for most of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance companies. With them, it defines their investment strategy, which takes ESG-Climate issues into consideration. It is then responsible for their implementation. In this respect, it manages relations with all financial services providers (asset management companies, finance and investment banks,/uni00A0etc.) on behalf of the insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, the objective of stepping up the energy transition and supporting customers in this transformation is also reflected in action taken by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to assess and manage the physical risks related to the climate.\n\nDue to the nature of its business, particularly in property & casualty insurance, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is directly exposed to physical risks  related  to  weather  conditions  (storms,  flooding,  cyclones, hail, drought,/uni00A0 etc.). These risks may concern buildings (residential buildings and business or agricultural premises), vehicles and crops in the field. The weight of climate events in the cost of claims varies from one contract to another and can be up to 100% for climate products such as crop, pasture or forest insurance.\n\nTo  manage  these  risks  and  contain  exposure,  a  physical  risk monitoring and management system is in place:\n\n- z identification and assessment of physical risks through quantification based on simulations of general weather event scenarios;\n- z implementation of a physical risk management system to limit the impact of extreme weather events by adjusting pricing and physical risk modelling;\n\nTo support its customers and improve their satisfaction with regard to  these  risks,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  continuously  renews or adapts its products and services. Examples are developments in products to protect farmers against climate risk, including hail insurance for targeted protection of crops against weather events (2005), crop insurance to protect crop yields and income against weather events (2005), pasture insurance which guarantees a capital sum to purchase the fodder required by livestock in the event of a severe weather effect on pasture land (2015).\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took part in the climate pilot exercise organised by the ACPR to test the resilience of its portfolios to several scenarios relating to climate risk: a benchmark scenario (ordered  transition  corresponding  to  the  National  Low  Carbon Strategy); an adverse scenario of delayed transition; an adverse scenario of accelerated transition; a unique physical risk scenario (IPCC's 'RCP/uni00A08.5' scenario).\n\nAll of these factors provide input for the parent company's vigilance plan.\n\n## ECOVADIS rating\n\nChanges  in  non-financial  reporting  regulations  are  prompting companies to strengthen their CSR policies yet further. This new regulatory environment has led Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to call on an external stakeholder to assess its CSR management system as part of a continuous progress approach.\n\nObtaining a rating is the first step in an improvement process whose ultimate objective is to maintain and strengthen customer confidence in the products and procedures in place, and in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's environmental commitments, purchasing policies and attention paid to internal operations. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has therefore called on EcoVadis, which specialises in analysing CSR policies of companies across all business sectors.\n\nThanks  to  the  hard  work  done  by  internal  stakeholders,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has compiled a full set of information in a questionnaire supplied by EcoVadis, tailored to the bancassurance sector, to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's size and its location, mainly France but also abroad. This information has been assessed on a set of non-financial criteria and issues to establish Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's EcoVadis rating and produce an assessment sheet identifying the Group's strengths and areas for improvement.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2019,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  CSR  performance improved and received a gold label with a score of 63 out of 100. This put Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in the top 9% of the highest  scoring  companies  in  the  same  sector  (Insurance, Reinsurance, Pension funds).\n\n- z specific monitoring and oversight of exposure to weather events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

The term 'active' implies:\n- z a legal relationship through a standard permanent or fixed-term employment contract (or equivalent abroad),\n- z being on the payroll and in the job on the final day of the period,\n- z working time percentage of 50% or more.\n\nEach table presented below is accompanied by an indication of the proportion of employees covered (as a percentage of the total number of employees at the year-end).\n\nAs a responsible employer, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group took further action in/uni00A02020  to promote:\n\n- z development of employee skills and career prospects;\n- z fair treatment and diversity;\n- z quality of work life;\n\nIn response to the Grenelle/uni00A02 legislation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances specifies  that  the  ILO  conventions  apply  to  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances employees.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group as an employer\n\nTo support its development and despite the constraints relating to the health crisis, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continued to recruit staff both in France and internationally.\n\n## NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PER TYPE OF CONTRACT\n\n|                                               | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2020    | 31/12/2020   | 31/12/2019   | 31/12/2019    | 31/12/2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n| (in number)                                   | France       | International | Total        | France       | International | Total        |\n| Active permanent contract (CDI) employees     | 2,602        | 588           | 3,190        | 2,483        | 519           | 3,002        |\n| Fixed-term contract (CDD) employees           | 133          | 26            | 159          | 114          | 26            | 140          |\n| Total number of active employees              | 2,735        | 614           | 3,349        | 2,597        | 545           | 3,142        |\n| Non active permanent contract (CDI) employees | 58           | 4             | 62           | 51           | 4             | 55           |\n| TOTAL EMPLOYEES                               | 2,793        | 618           | 3,411        | 2,648        | 549           | 3,197        |\n| Coverage: Total France + International        |              |               | 100.0%       |              |               | 100.0%       |\n\n## Improving the quality of work life\n\nAware of changing employee expectations about the quality aspect of the relationship with work and convinced of the need to explore new  ways  of  promoting  employee  engagement  and  collective performance, in/uni00A02018 the Group launched on ongoing improvement process for quality of life at work based on a specific survey to begin with. This was continued in/uni00A0 2020 thanks to the Engagement and Recommendation Index survey in its extended format, with 84% of employees responding.\n\nSpecific support measures have also been implemented to facilitate correct adaptation to widespread working from home:\n\n- z organisation of web conferences and distribution of practical guides on how best to work from home over a long period;\n- z creation of video tutorials to facilitate appropriation of new collaborative tools;\n- z provision of a chatbot to advise on how to quickly relieve physical discomfort resulting from sitting and looking at a screen, among other issues;\n- z the option of benefiting from coaching for parents on how best to combine working from home with home schooling;\n\n- z as employees gradually returned to working on site, regular surveys were conducted on themes such as sanitary requirements, working conditions and staff restaurants, in order to be able to adjust measures if necessary.\n\nLastly, thanks to support provided for caregivers at most of the Group's entities, around 150/uni00A0days of paid leave for caregivers were used in/uni00A02020 by employees who are caregivers.\n\n## Health and Prevention\n\nThe Group provides various health and wellness benefits in addition to the top-up health insurance plan covering all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions employees. With 75% of contributions paid by the company, this plan is more advantageous than the requirements set out in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the occupational health team, in collaboration with union organisations and general resources, drew up the health protocol and health procedures applicable within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group  and  ensured  tracking  and  support  of  Covid cases reported within the Group's various entities. These various documents have been validated by the company doctor.\n\nIn addition, the diabetes screening programme launched in late/uni00A02019 at sites in Paris was also rolled out at the Lille and Vaison sites in autumn 2020.

The steps frequently taken in this respect by Group entities in France include:\n\n- z commitment to professional development for seniors in terms of training and compensation;\n- z managing the end of career and the transition between work and retirement and implementing a system to gradually reduce hours with the option of working part time;\n- z specific training for employees aged over 55 on preparing for their retirement.\n\n## INTERNSHIPS AND WORK-STUDY CONTRACTS\n\nA pre-recruitment policy through pools of interns and work-study scheme employees is also an important area of focus for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group. Thus, the Group took on a further 15/uni00A0interns and 117/uni00A0people on work-study contracts this year.\n\nDespite  the  health  crisis,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Human Resources department maintained and ramped up its recruitment of people on work-study contracts. The orientation day was held online.\n\nThe tutors have received special training or support in most entities.\n\nAt the end of the scheme, tutors fill in a questionnaire to assess students and recommend them if applicable. These students are then systematically interviewed by HR with a view to offering them permanent or temporary job opportunities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group wherever possible. The rate of conversion from work-study contracts to permanent and fixed-term contracts was 38% in/uni00A02020.\n\n## AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNSHIPS AND WORK-STUDY CONTRACTS\n\n| Average number of employees over the year   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Internships                                 | 15     | 14     |\n| Work-study contracts                        | 117    | 101    |\n| Coverage: Total France                      | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n\n## Compensation policy\n\nTo guarantee a fair policy in terms of individual variable compensation, whilst developing  'collective performance',  the  performance management  review  with  the  objective  of  revising  the  variable compensation policy by spreading the practice of setting SMART targets  and  introducing  a  collective  target  accounting  for/uni00A0 20% carried out in/uni00A02018 was repeated in/uni00A02019 and 2020.\n\nIn  order  to  facilitate  understanding  of  the  overall  compensation system for both managers and employees, guides were provided setting out details of the compensation policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAround 350/uni00A0 managers from various entities also benefited from information  sessions  giving  them  a  better  understanding  of  the principles and challenges of the Group's wage policy during the performance interviews period.\n\nIn addition, special attention is paid to gender equality during each compensation campaign:\n\n- z based  on  external  and  internal  benchmarks,  HR  identifies employees in a given function where there is a significant pay gap compared with market practices (pay index </uni00A080%);\n- z a budget is allocated to narrowing the largest gaps.",

The HRM provides guidance on how to devise a formal career plan, rewrite one's CV, prepare for recruitment interviews and emphasise one's strengths.\n\nIn/uni00A02020, due to the health crisis, the Human Resources department was  unable  to  provide  support  for  employees  on  transfers during group workshops by means of professional development workshops. Individual support was nevertheless enhanced thanks in particular to the use of Jobmaker, a tool complementing the work of HR managers.\n\nIn addition, employees seeking an internal move are invited to take part in 'Mobilijobs' (a Group scheme that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has joined), which provides opportunities for employees to talk to operational and HR staff in the various Group entities to discover internal job opportunities. They can also take part in pre-selection speed interviews. This year, the event was held 100% online.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, 1,130 individual career management interviews took place involving 890/uni00A0employees.\n\nIn  addition,  to  prepare  actively  for  succession  and  offer  real opportunities for best senior managers to develop within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, the talent management system implemented\n\nin/uni00A0 2019 continued in/uni00A0 2020 with the following held in the first half of/uni00A02020:\n\n- z 40 talent Committee meetings for all BUs/SUs;\n- z four business line Committee meetings (Finance - Actuarial - IT and Marketing/Development).\n\nThese various Committee meetings:\n\n- z identified Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' key positions, key resources, potential key resources and potential transfers;\n- z provided information for the succession plans for 60 key positions at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, paying particular attention to gender balance;\n- z shared all these considerations with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' inner circle;\n- z and thereby allowed for better identification of the needs of each area in terms of resources, taking account of gender balance issues.\n\nIn/uni00A02019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances devised an internal assessment and  validation  process  to  review  each  candidate's  potential  to become a manager, which was implemented in/uni00A02020:\n\n- z eight pre-validation Committee meetings held - five candidates selected.\n\nA programme for supporting young talent was devised with a pilot scheme launched in late/uni00A02020 centred around:\n\n- z individual support to develop self-awareness;\n- z a collective review day based on the themes relating to the three pillars of the Group Project, with the aim of making them work on very business-focused subjects, make them visible and help them to develop their network.\n\nAn  International  talent  Committee  meeting  was  organised  in late/uni00A0 2020 to launch a similar talent management approach within subsidiaries and identify employees in France and within the various entities suitable for international transfers.\n\n## Mobility\n\nIn line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. Group policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances favours internal mobility to fill job vacancies.\n\nVacancies are therefore published on 'My Jobs', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's job mart, which has been open to everyone since the end of/uni00A02014. Employees can schedule alerts so that they never miss new vacancies. This year, MyJobs was also rolled out at all international entities.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, there were 175 internal transfers within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, and 38 from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\n## INTERNAL TRANSFERS\n\n| (in number)                                                        |   2020 |   2019 | Scope                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Intragroup mobility (incoming)                                     |     77 |    109 | Total - France and International | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n| Intragroup mobility (outgoing)                                     |     57 |     76 | Total - France and International | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n| Mobility within one entity - Active permanent employment contracts |    124 |    110 | Total - France and International | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## REDUCING THE DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a financial services company and its operations do not have any major direct impact on the environment. Its main direct greenhouse gas emission is carbon dioxide ( via the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity). The most harmful waste comes from electronic items, for which collection and processing procedures are in place. Paper is the main raw material used.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  therefore  focused  its  efforts  on reporting processes and the environmental management of paper and energy consumption and CO2 emissions. These efforts are directed at two objectives: improving the operation of the company and raising awareness among employees.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic had a major impact on ways of working in/uni00A0 2020,  with  widespread  working  from  home  and  most  travel cancelled. This makes it difficult to analyse data relating to the Group's direct environmental impact compared with last year.\n\nWith most employees absent from buildings, this inevitably resulted in  a  reduction  in  onsite  water  and  electricity  consumption  and waste  generation.  However,  the  transfer  of  these  elements  to employees' homes cannot be quantified and monitored. Essential health precautions taken may also have a negative impact on the Group's waste production, in particular with it being impossible to recycle waste from any bins containing face masks or as a result of measures taken within the company restaurant.\n\n## Use of resources\n\n## Paper\n\nAs a member of Citeo, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's 'Grenelle papier' approach, which is based on two separate objectives: increasing the use of responsible paper and increasing the rate of paper recycling, for all paper use (office systems, desktop publishing, customer communications).\n\nFor this purpose, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has set up a network of paper stewards, comprising employees who buy paper and/or use paper for printing on the company's behalf. These stewards have been made aware of the environmental issues related to paper and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. Group's commitments. They are not only responsible for reporting, but also for:\n\n- z encouraging the purchase of certified (PEFC, FSC,/uni00A0etc.) or recycled paper;\n- z promoting paperless communication between employees, with the banking and partner networks, and with customers that opt for paperless communications;\n- z reducing the amount of paper used for business correspondence by  grouping  life  insurance  (Predica)  correspondence  with banking correspondence, double-sided printing for business correspondence (insurance certificates, death & disability renewal notices,/uni00A0 etc.) and for annual statements, as well as using thinner paper. Employee payslips are now paperless.\n\nConsiderable work was done by Pacifica to send 100% of eligible letters in electronic format while also reducing the weight of general terms and conditions documents. Customers can agree (or not agree) to receive their documents in electronic format. To encourage them to do so, an awareness campaign was organised in/uni00A0 2020. This allowed for a reduction in paper consumption as well as carbon emissions relating to transporting these documents.\n\nPredica has made a special effort in terms of envelopes for business correspondence. Envelopes are made from 100% recycled, FSC certified paper manufactured in France. The transparent window is made from transparent plant material (biodegradable bioplastic from agricultural plant waste), and the glue used is plant-based.\n\nIn the offices of the main French subsidiaries, printers are now shared and their default settings are double-sided and black and white. Launched in/uni00A02017, the system of employee badges to operate photocopiers  was  expanded  when  the  company's  photocopiers were  upgraded.  This  reduces  printing,  as  documents  are  only printed when strictly necessary.\n\nThese efforts have succeeded in reducing employee consumption of office paper from 37/uni00A0kg per employee per year in/uni00A02014 to 21/uni00A0kg and then 19.5/uni00A0kg per employee per year respectively in/uni00A02018 and 2019.\n\nMoreover, the proportion of responsible paper, as defined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group (PEFC, FSC or recycled paper) in purchasing rose from 90% at the end of/uni00A02013 to 100% at the end of/uni00A02019.\n\n## PAPER INDICATORS\n\n|                                 | 2020       | 2019         |\n|---------------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Total consumption  (in tonnes)  | 852 tonnes | 1,145 tonnes |\n| Proportion of responsible paper | 92%        | 100%         |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding claims administration centres.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF CONSUMPTION BY USE (%)\n\n62% of paper is used for customer correspondence, either for transparency purposes or to meet regulatory requirements. Control over volumes in other areas gives this category a higher percentage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

It monitors and controls energy consumption in the buildings and contributes to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's reporting.\n\nFor buildings in the greater Paris region, various measures have been taken to better control energy use based on in-depth knowledge of the sites (occupation techniques and types) and the outcome of energy audits. These actions include:\n\n- z optimisation of lighting timer settings (reduction of time slots), terminals (fan-coil units), air processors (ventilation), car park extractors, circulation pumps,/uni00A0etc.;\n- z installation of LED lighting in the car parks of some buildings;\n- z some equipment made responsive to the outside temperature ( e.g. circulation pumps, different ventilation temperatures depending on the outside temperature, hot air curtain,/uni00A0etc.);\n- z changes to the temperature settings for hot and cold water;\n- z installation of innovative equipment to measure electrical signals to better understand how the buildings operate;\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018,  a  follow-up  audit  confirmed  the  HQE  certification  for buildings in use at the Saint Vincent de Paul premises in Paris, which was obtained in/uni00A02013. This site is used as a pilot site to test new operational and occupant communication practices. For example, a plan to obtain HQE certification for our main premises was launched in/uni00A02016. The buildings at 8-10 and 16-18 boulevard de Vaugirard in Paris obtained certification in/uni00A0 2019. The new 36-44 boulevard de Vaugirard premises completed in/uni00A0 2019 are also HQE Exploitation certified.\n\nSince/uni00A0 2020, buildings in Paris have been fitted with Smart Impulse technology to allow for better identification of energy consumption item by item, to help achieve the Group's targets for reducing energy consumption.\n\nPacifica's 'Acting for the climate' initiative continued in/uni00A02020 with its efforts in the five priority areas identified: travel, energy and offices, IT, letters and waste. This approach resulted in the emergence of an ISO/uni00A0 50001 certification project to manage the energy efficiency of the Group's properties. Buildings in Paris are in the process of obtaining this certification.\n\n## ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS\n\n|             | 2020               | 2020                        | 2020                      | 2019               | 2019                        | 2019                      |\n|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n|             | Consumption  (kWh) | Ratio  (kWh/m/two.num/year) | Estimated  coverage ratio | Consumption  (kWh) | Ratio  (kWh/m/two.num/year) | Estimated  coverage ratio |\n| Electricity | 10,648,342         | 138                         | 100%                      | 9,509,071          | 120                         | 100%                      |\n| Steam       | 1,329,000          | 55                          | 100%                      | 1,844,796          | 59                          | 100%                      |\n| Fuel        | 82,678             | 23                          | 100%                      | 118,982            | 33                          | 100%                      |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding claims administration centres.\n\nThe ratio of electricity per m2 increased to 138/uni00A0kWh per m 2 . This is primarily due to:\n\n- z the ventilation recommended by the health protocol (facilities running entirely without air recuperation);\n- z the reduced presence of employees on site (and therefore decreased use of PCs and screens), making it more difficult to maintain building temperature;\n- z works carried out in/uni00A02020 at one site;\n- z the inclusion over a full year of a building heated using electricity.\n\nHowever, steam consumption per m2 decreased as part of one of the buildings heated using district heating was partially undergoing works and therefore not heated.\n\nFurthermore, the significant reduction in fuel consumption between 2019 and 2020 was due to the limited onsite presence of employees and the temperatures seen in/uni00A0 2020 (the oil-fired boiler is used in addition to the heat pump only during periods of extreme cold).\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances renewed its green electricity agreement  with  EDF  for  a  further  five  years.  EDF  is  therefore committed to injecting renewable electricity capacity into the grid equivalent to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' consumption.\n\n## Waste management\n\nCompartmentalised bins have been installed in Paris offices so that paper can be separated from other waste. In/uni00A02019, the sites at 3644 and 16-18 Boulevard de Vaugirard turned into flexi offices were fitted with centralised collection points for recycling using different types of bins for cardboard, paper, cans, plastic bottles,/uni00A0etc. All Paris sites now have collection points.\n\nWaste from the Paris premises are now collected and re-sorted at 36-44 Boulevard de Vaugirard (and no longer taken to Montrouge) before recycling. At the Lille premises, an ESAT (a support through work organisation) is responsible for collecting and sorting paper.\n\nInk cartridges are collected exclusively by our machine supplier, which has its own sustainable development procedure.\n\nComputers at the end of their useful lives are collected by a company from the adapted sector which recycles them in accordance with D3E electronic waste standards for defective or obsolete hardware. Working  hardware  is  then  repurposed  or  donated  (mainly  to employees). Other hazardous waste (fluorescent tubes, LEDs,/uni00A0etc.) is also collected and processed through regulated recycling channels.",

A D3E waste collection campaign has been organised by employees and donated to an ESAT for recycling.\n\nAt the Lille premises, employees are encouraged to dispose of their used paper cups, cans and plastic bottles in a recycling container that can recognise, sort and store waste. Each time an item is inserted in the machine an association receives a micro-donation.\n\nFood waste comes principally from company restaurants, which are managed by our catering services providers. Food waste from the company restaurants at Boulevard de Vaugirard are sent to an anaerobic digester.\n\n## WASTE INDICATORS\n\n|                           | 2020       | 2019       |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Paper/cardboard           | 37 tonnes  | 71 tonnes  |\n| Ordinary industrial waste | 145 tonnes | 199 tonnes |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding claims administration centres.\n\nThe reduction in the volume of waste relates primarily to the extended absence of employees.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn/uni00A02019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances conducted its carbon assessment for/uni00A02018, which showed that its greenhouse gas emissions are equal to 7/uni00A0tonnes equivalent CO2 per employee per year (France financial consolidation scope) versus 11.4/uni00A0 tonnes equivalent in/uni00A0 2014. This assessment was made available to all employees in/uni00A02020 in the form of an infographic published on the intranet site.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances formed a partnership with the  Plantons  pour  l'Avenir  endowment  fund  to  offset  all  CO2 emissions from its operations in France. The fund is dedicated to replanting forests in France by providing the funds required for owners engaged in sustainable forestry to replant their land. This partnership aims to plant a number of trees in France equivalent to the total amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's CO2 emissions (1) as shown in the carbon assessment. Since/uni00A02018, 666,000/uni00A0trees have been planted as a result of this partnership.\n\n## Travel policy\n\nIn order to limit its direct environmental footprint, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has worked on the carbon impact related to employee travel, the second largest generator of CO2 emissions. It has therefore drawn up a travel policy to encourage the use of transport with the least impact and to encourage more virtuous practices:\n\n- z rail travel to be used wherever possible and systematically for some destinations;\n- z better management of air travel: only permitted for journeys of more than three hours, no first class travel, direct flights preferred;\n- z installation of videoconferencing equipment in all premises;\n- z use of distance working.\n\nThe company travel plans for the Lille and Paris premises were published on dedicated platforms (Paris - Ile de France Mobilit\u00e9s; Lille - M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9enne de Lille).\n\nA specific action plan has been drawn up for each site. The Paris action plan is based on six objectives:\n\n- 1. raise employee awareness;\n- 2. limit business travel and travel between home and work;\n- 3. encourage the use of soft transport;\n- 4. facilitate the use of public transport;\n- 5. rethink the use of private cars;\n- 6. special action in the event of a pollution spike (action under the Ile de France Atmospheric Protection Plan).\n\nLille has only four objectives as the premises are due to be relocated in/uni00A02021:\n\n- 1. optimise the use of cars;\n- 2. encourage the use of soft transport;\n- 3. encourage new working methods;\n- 4. raise employee awareness.\n\n## TRAVEL INDICATORS\n\n|           | Distances travelled  (in thousands of kilometers)   | Distances travelled  (in thousands of kilometers)   | Distances travelled  (in thousands of kilometers)   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|           | Rail                                                | Air                                                 | Total                                               |\n| 2020      | 2,609                                               | 1,316                                               | 3,925                                               |\n| 2019      | 7,212                                               | 4,377                                               | 11,589                                              |\n| Variation | (64%)                                               | (70%)                                               | (66%)                                               |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding claims administration centres.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

In keeping with the Group's transportation policy, train is still the preferred means of transport, representing 66% of kilometres travelled in/uni00A02020 (compared with 63% in/uni00A02019).\n\n## Raising employee awareness\n\nAs part of the awareness-raising policy, a CSR page is accessible to most Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities on the Intranet. It provides information about general CSR issues and about Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's approach.\n\nDuring the European  Sustainable  Development  Week  from 18/uni00A0 September to 8/uni00A0 October, workshops were organised at the Group's Paris sites on three themes:\n\n- z environmentally friendly modes of transport, in particular cycling, with a three-day workshop on updating and repairing your bicycle by repair company Ridy;\n- z waste, with the chance to visit the Paris sites' recycling centre and then a video of these visits made available on the intranet site;\n- z forests, with a conference held jointly by Plantons pour l'Avenir and Reforest'Action.\n\nAs part of the 'Acting for the climate' initiative, Pacifica employees were taught about the environmental impact of using emails and encouraged to sort their mailboxes. Those involved in the initiative underwent Climate Collage training.\n\nMore than 130/uni00A0 employees have had a WeNow box since/uni00A0 2019. These boxes encourage environmentally friendly driving practices and help to offset CO2 emissions. At the end of/uni00A0 2020, a total of 121/uni00A0tonnes of CO2 equivalent had been offset by means of a United Nations programme in India and the planting of 500/uni00A0trees in France.\n\n## Company restaurant\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances works with its service provider Sodexo on improving practices at its Paris Vaugirard company restaurant.\n\nIn terms of the supply chain for meat products, Sodexho mainly purchases labelled products that include animal welfare in their specifications,  such  as  the  Bleu-Blanc-Coeur  and  Label  Rouge labels. Similarly, for fish products, Sodexo mainly purchases Pavillon France label fresh products from French fisheries that guarantee more  environmentally  friendly  fishing  practices  (selective  fishing methods, respect for seasonality of products,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nSince/uni00A0 2017,  Nespresso  coffee  capsules  have  been  sorted  for recycling, and a collection system for employees has also been put in place.\n\nA waste bin solely for leftover bread was provided to help make company restaurant users aware of the amount of waste.\n\nSelective sorting was introduced in the restaurant in January/uni00A02018 for separate collection of cardboard and cans, glass bottles and bio-waste. Bio-waste is taken to an anaerobic digester. Measures have also been taken to limit food waste.\n\n## DEPLOYING A RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING POLICY\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, a subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A., applies and observes Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group guidelines on the purchasing process and responsible purchasing. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group purchasing charter, which is set out in an internal procedure  memo,  forms  part  of  these  guidelines.  It  includes  a detailed description of the basics of the CSR approach in terms of purchasing.\n\nThe guiding principles of its CSR policy are based on the following commitments:\n\n- z UN Global Compact;\n- z Diversity Charter;\n- z Responsible Supplier Relations Mediation Charter.\n\nAll the commitments cover human rights and labour regulations, combating all forms of discrimination, promoting diversity, environmental protection and business ethics based on the duty of care.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances wishes to encourage its suppliers, service providers and their sub-contractors to share these commitments by observing the principles set out in the international conventions, the laws and regulations in the country where they operate, and practices in their business sector, and more specifically:\n\n- 1. human rights;\n- 2. diversity and working conditions;\n\n- 3. environment;\n- 4. business ethics and the value chain.\n\n## Being responsible throughout the supply chain\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's responsible purchasing policy is based on the following:\n\n- z encouraging responsible supplier relations;\n- z assessing its suppliers on the basis of their CSR management system and the products proposed to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group;\n- z raising awareness among buyers and suppliers.\n\n## Committing to suppliers\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.  is  a  signatory  of  the  Responsible  Supplier Relations Charter, which aims to create a balanced relationship with its suppliers in an unstable economic environment.\n\nThis charter comprises ten commitments for responsible purchasing and a fair and lasting relationship between large buyers, SMEs and suppliers more generally, notably with regard to environmental impacts,  financial  fairness  and  reducing  the  risks  of  reciprocal dependence.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  therefore  appends  the  Responsible Purchasing Charter to all its tender documents and contracts.

        "page_content": "Charter is a joint initiative between French banks and insurance companies that wish to encourage their suppliers to implement duty of care measures as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) approach. It sets out:\n\n- z the commitments made by the signatories to their suppliers in terms of fairness, ethics and transparency, reciprocal dependence, respect for payment periods, confidentiality and intellectual property rights, small and mid-size suppliers, and recourse to mediation;\n- z the commitments made by suppliers in terms of the environment, human rights and labour, business ethics, sub-contracting, progress approach, and monitoring compliance with the Charter;\n- z the reference texts: the 10 principles of the Global Compact, the 30/uni00A0 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\n## Assessing its suppliers\n\nThe vast majority of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances's suppliers are listed on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's panels. These suppliers, selected at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level, are assessed on their CSR policies not only in terms of their CSR management system, but also in terms of their products themselves.\n\nIndependent specialist firm EcoVadis has been appointed to assess the supplier's CSR management system. This approach, common to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group entities, is led by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. The scoring principle involves sending suppliers a questionnaire based  on  four  themes:  the  environment,  labour,  ethics  and supply chain management. Over 900 suppliers common to Cr\u00e9dit\n\nAgricole/uni00A0 S.A. Group entities have now been rated and additional suppliers are in the process of being rated.\n\nMeanwhile, where appropriate for the purchasing category, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances assesses the CSR quality of the supplier's product or service by including technical and specific sustainable development criteria in the specifications. The supplier must show that its procedures comply with specific principles throughout the entire product life cycle and provide documentary evidence of this.\n\nThe CSR criterion accounts for 15% of a supplier's rating in a call for tenders.\n\n## Raising awareness among buyers and/uni00A0suppliers\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances buyers are made aware of responsible purchasing at meetings run by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A.'s Purchasing department.\n\nEveryone involved in the purchasing function receives training in responsible purchasing provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group.\n\nA specific policy of sourcing from companies in the sheltered sector has been implemented for the Purchasing function.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  took  part  for  the  first  time  in  the 'Responsible supplier relations and purchasing' labelling scheme and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 S.A. Group with the contribution of new entities confirmed that it maintained the label in/uni00A02020.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2019,  the  purchasing  policy  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of EcoVadis rating criteria. It obtained a score of 70/100.\n\n## DEVELOPING AN OUTREACH CULTURE\n\n## Launch of a programme to encourage employee outreach engagement\n\n2020  saw  the  launch  of  Csolidaire,  the  programme  to  involve employees in community initiatives intended to develop an outreach culture within the company. The programme comprises sponsorship and  skills-based  volunteering  schemes,  tutoring  and  mentoring for various target groups (such as deserving young people from underprivileged areas, refugees, people with literacy problems), as well as paid leave for employees to do volunteer work in France (and abroad if the health situation permits). Overall, around 100/uni00A0volunteer positions are available, which are constantly updated and geolocated to allow employees all over France to get involved.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continued its partnership with the association #STOPILLETTRISME to help address the problem of reading and writing difficulties in the workplace.\n\nIt is an innovative scheme combining a training cycle with mentoring provided  by  some  thirty  employees  for  about  ten  volunteer employees of GSF, the cleaning company responsible for cleaning Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's premises. The mentoring is provided during the employees' working hours as part of a skills volunteering initiative.\n\n## A long-term commitment to sponsorship and/uni00A0a responsive approach during exceptional times\n\n## Help for the elderly\n\nDuring the 2020 health crisis, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances played a very active role in creating a \u20ac20/uni00A0million Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group solidary fund to protect elderly people living in care homes or looked after by home care services and help them stay in contact with their relatives. This exceptional fund in response to the crisis was used mainly to finance tablet computers, personal protective equipment, medical equipment  and  cognitive  stimulation  equipment.  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances' made a contribution of \u20ac5/uni00A0million to the initiative.\n\n## Help for caregivers\n\nFor 10/uni00A0 years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has been engaged in a policy to sponsor family caregivers by financing community projects throughout France. Caregivers play a key role in intergenerational solidarity and home care for dependent people.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the end of/uni00A0 2020, 170/uni00A0 local projects to help family caregivers had been financed and more than \u20ac2.5/uni00A0million distributed.\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020, the associations short-listed and selected for the call for projects were given two days of training on how to develop resources and communications for their project, with support from an outside firm. Particular emphasis has been placed on finding funding in view of the considerable difficulties faced by charities against the backdrop of the health crisis.\n\nTo mark the 10th/uni00A0anniversary of the call for projects, a film is currently being made collecting the testimonies of 10/uni00A0charities based all over France, as well as the Regional Banks and experts in providing help for caregivers. The film is due to be released at the end of the first quarter of/uni00A02021, accompanied by an external communications campaign.\n\n## Help for the environment\n\n## COMMITMENT TO REFORESTATION IN FRANCE\n\nIn/uni00A0 2020,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  -  France's  leading  forest insurer - continued its partnership with the Plantons pour l'Avenir endowment fund. The fund's objective is to step up the rate of reforestation in France by providing the funds required for owners engaged in sustainable forestry to replant their land in the form of\n\na zero-interest advance repayable over 30/uni00A0years. This partnership aims to plant a number of trees in France equivalent to the total amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' CO2 emissions according to a metric established by the FCBA, i.e. 10,000/uni00A0trees per 1,400/uni00A0tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted. Since/uni00A02018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' involvement  has  allowed  for  the  planting  of  666,000/uni00A0 trees  and sustainable management of 533/uni00A0hectares.\n\n## SUPPORT FOR COMBATING PLASTIC POLLUTION OF/uni00A0THE/uni00A0OCEANS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances supports the Plastic Odyssey expedition to combat plastic pollution in our oceans. Engineers, entrepreneurs and naval officers will travel along the coasts of France, Africa, Latin America and Asia onboard a specially equipped vessel for three years from January/uni00A0 2021. The project's aim is to raise awareness about recycling plastic waste and share expertise with emerging countries.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, has been a partner of the project since/uni00A02018 and is continuing with this commitment by providing backing of \u20ac1.2/uni00A0million over five years. The support provided for this expedition forms part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Societal Project.\n\n## Help for employees\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's sponsorship efforts include financing the Courte Echelle programme since/uni00A02011. The programme aims to support employees heavily invested in community projects. At the end of/uni00A02020, 90/uni00A0projects were launched or came to fruition thanks to a grant of up to \u20ac3,000. These community projects involve international outreach, environmental protection and social inclusion.\n\nThe  Coup  de  Coeur  scheme  was  renewed  in/uni00A0 2020,  enabling employees to vote for the Courte Echelle project of their choice, which receives an additional \u20ac3,000 grant. Since/uni00A02019, the Courte Echelle winning associations have attended a training day on how to develop resources and communications for their project. For the 2020 winners, the contents of this training were closely correlated to the health crisis and the mainly financial difficulties facing community organisations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-37, L./uni00A0 225-37-4 and L./uni00A0 22-10-10 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, it contains the following information:\n\n- z the composition as well as the conditions for the preparation and organisation of the Board's work;\n- z a list of all the mandates and functions exercised in any company by each corporate officer;\n- z agreements entered into, either directly or through an intermediary, between, on the one hand, one of the corporate officers or one of the shareholders with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10% of a company and, on the other hand, another company controlled by the former within the meaning of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-33, with the exception of agreements involving transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business on an arm's length basis;\n- z a summary table showing the current authorisations granted by the General Meeting of Shareholders in the field of capital increases, and the use made of these authorisations during the financial year;\n- z any limitations that the Board of Directors may place on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer;\n- z the governance rules adopted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in addition to those required by law and in comparison to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- z the procedure for shareholders to take part in the General Meeting of Shareholders, provided for the in the articles of association (Article/uni00A018).\n\n## COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD AND PREPARATION AND/uni00A0ORGANISATION OF ITS WORK, BOARD ACTIVITY IN 2020\n\nThe  preparation  and  organisation  of  the  work  of  the  Board  of Directors is governed by current legislation and regulations, by the company's articles of association, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors (see below).\n\nOn  31/uni00A0 July  2015,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances decided not to adopt a Code of corporate governance (AFEP-MEDEF or MIDDLENEXT), as some of their provisions do not apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances due to it being 100% owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., a CAC/uni00A040 company.\n\nHowever,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  complies  with  the  main recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The governance rules applied in addition to legal requirements are described in an overview table below .\n\n## Governanc e structure\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances,  a  French  public  limited  company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme) , is managed by a Board of Directors which has at least three members and at most eighteen members, subject to the exemptions provided by law.\n\nThe Board is a collegial body mandated by all of the shareholders.\n\nThe offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are separated in accordance with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's specific governance model, which separates the strategic and oversight functions from the executive functions.\n\nThe duties of the Chairman of the Board are those conferred on him by law.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  law  and  the  articles  of  association  the Chairman of the Board of Directors organises and directs the work of the Board and reports to the General Meeting of Shareholders on its activities.\n\nHis legal duties include drawing up the agenda for Board meetings and  ensuring  that  the  information  provided  to  the  directors  is sufficient for them to make an informed judgement. In this respect, he contributes to the smooth flow of information between the Board and Senior Management and between the Board and its Committees. He encourages and promotes open, critical discussion and ensures that all points of view can be expressed within the Board. He ensures that the responsibilities of the Board are clear to all directors.\n\nAs indicated in the Rules of Procedure, reproduced hereafter, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that, prior to each meeting, the directors receive the information that is necessary and sufficient to deliberate with full knowledge of the issues.\n\nFollowing consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors assesses the work carried out and the work still to be carried out, in particular, when the Board's meeting agendas are being set.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nAt 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Board was composed of nine members. A non-voting Board member also takes part in Board meetings.\n\nThe term of office of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' directors is set at three years by the company's articles of association. This term is renewable although directors and non-voting Board members cannot serve for more than four consecutive terms of office.\n\nEach year, the Board considers the desirable balance of its members and in particular its diversity (representation of men and women, age, qualifications and professional experience, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Board consists of five men and four women, with women therefore making up 44.4% of members.\n\nThe average age of directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances as at 31/uni00A0 December 2020 was 54. The company's articles of association set an age limit of 65; any director who exceeds this limit will be automatically deemed to have resigned at the end of the next General Meeting.\n\nMembers' qualifications and experience vary and are complementary.\n\nSince it is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and also as the head of an insurance group whose shares are admitted to trading on a  regulated  market,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances comprises one independent director, and then 50% Regional Bank executives (four directors) and 50% members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Management (four directors).\n\nThe non-voting Board member is the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nThe Board has not appointed a Lead Director.\n\nAlthough as at 31/uni00A0 December 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries in France and abroad had 5,386/uni00A0 employees (including 4,770 in France), its Board does not have any directors representing employees, as its parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., fulfils this requirement.\n\nThe Board also does not have a director representing employee shareholders.  None  of  the  employees  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances  Group  holds  shares  in  the  company.  The  directors of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  are  also  not  shareholders  of  the company. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' articles of association do not require directors to hold a minimum number of shares in the company.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Board  of  Directors  includes  one independent director. Her appointment was based on an assessment of several criteria: expertise in insurance, no conflicts of interest, respect for the principle of gender diversity and diversity, respect for the age limit, availability, involvement, adaptation to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's culture.  The independence criteria used by the Board were as follows:\n\n- z not to have a relationship of any kind whatsoever with the company, its G roup or its management that may interfere with the person's freedom of judgement;\n- z not to be or to have been in the previous five years: an employee, Chief Executive Officer or director of the company, one of its subsidiaries or its parent company;\n- z not to be a corporate executive officer of a company in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a director;\n- z not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker, commercial banker or consultant that is significant to the company or its G roup;\n- z not to be related by close family ties to a company officer;\n- z not to have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years.\n\n## Overall skills and expertise of the Board, director training\n\nThe Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) assesses the overall skills and expertise of the Board based on an individual assessment of each member. This ensures that overall the directors have the knowledge and experience required in the insurance and financial markets, the company's business strategy and business models, its system of governance, financial and actuarial analysis and the legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to the insurance business.\n\nA director's skill is assessed in the light of their duties as member of  the  Board  of  Directors,  member  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee, Chair of the Board or Chair of the Audit and Accounts Committee. This takes account of experience acquired during their working life in respect of offices held or through training courses taken in the course of their career.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  'Fit  and  Proper'  policy  approved  and reviewed each year by the Board, a questionnaire is sent to each member asking them to assess themselves on the basis of the five themes set out above and express a request for training in these areas. The results of the questionnaires are also used to assess the Board's overall skills and expertise.\n\nIn accordance with the wishes expressed by the directors at the end of 2019, six training courses were given during 2020 on the following subjects: 1) Pricing an insurance premium; 2) Reinsurance (mechanism, use, operational advantage); 3) Obligations relating to the role of director (duty of discretion and confidentiality, preventing conflicts  of  interest,  preventing  market  abuse,  etc.);  4)  Claims handling;  5)  Operational  risk  (risk  management  and  prudential treatment); 6) Technical reserves.\n\nDirectors may if they wish receive training on the specifics of the company, its methods, business sector and social and environmental responsibility issues.\n\n## Movements within the Board of Directors in/uni00A02020\n\nDuring 2020, the composition of the Board of Directors underwent a number of changes:\n\n## Departures in 2020\n\n- z Resignation:\n- z Elisabeth EYCHENNE resigned as director on 30/uni00A0June 2020,\n- z Nicole GOURMELON resigned as Chairwoman of the Board and director as of 30/uni00A0July 2020;\n- z Age limit of 65 reached:\n- z Yves PERRIER reached the age of 65 in October/uni00A02019 and his term of office therefore ended at the close of the General Shareholders' Meeting of 29/uni00A0April 2020.\n\nThe  status  of  independent  director  is  lost  after  12/uni00A0 years.  An independent director cannot receive variable compensation linked to the performance of the C ompany or G roup\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each year, the overall budget for directors' compensation is set by the General Meeting of Shareholders and its allocation is decided by the Board of Directors. If a director's repeated absence disrupts the smooth functioning of the Board, the Chairman may ask that director to stand down (see Rules of Procedure below).\n\nThe Board of Directors performs the duties conferred on it by law and the company's articles of association. It acts in all circumstances in the interest of the company. It strives to promote long-term value creation taking into account the social and environmental impacts of its operations. It proposes any amendments to the articles of association  it  deems  appropriate.  It  determines  the  company's strategy and general policies. It approves, where appropriate, at the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, the resources, structures and plans required to implement the strategy and general policies it has determined. It rules on all matters concerning the running of the company referred to it by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. It takes decisions on all transactions falling within its exclusive remit. It performs any controls or inspections that it deems necessary.",

        "page_content": "The non-voting Board member takes part in Board meetings in an advisory capacity. He is consulted on any item tabled on the Board's agenda. Thus, apart from his duty to ensure compliance with the articles of association, he may, after review, give his opinion during the meeting on an agenda item, in particular regarding strategy, business, growth, operational matters, results, risk governance and the company's financial statements. He may be removed from his position at any time by the Board.\n\nOn 21/uni00A0July 2009, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances adopted Rules of Procedure which set out the operating procedures for the company's Board and Senior Management, while taking into account the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. A directors' Code of Conduct has now been added to the Rules of Procedure. The main provisions of the Rules of Procedure are presented in this report.\n\nThe Rules of Procedure set out the way in which the Board's work is organised in Board meetings and in meetings held by its specific Committees (Audit and Accounts Committee, Customer Processes and IT Strategic Committee).\n\nThe directors' Code of Conduct appended to the Rules of Procedure constitutes  a  formal  reminder  of  the  provisions  of  the  laws, regulations and articles of association governing the prerogatives and responsibilities associated with a directorship (regular attendance, duty of discretion, protection of the company's interests, prevention of conflicts of interest, right to receive information, etc.).\n\nSince their adoption, the Board of Directors has amended the Rules of Procedure (reproduced below) on several occasions.\n\n## Assessment of the Board's practices and/uni00A0procedures\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Board of Directors expressed its wish to add a summary report on the first page of each briefing document, shorten the time taken to send out briefing documents and improve means of remote communication.

At  the  beginning  of each meeting, the Chief Executive Officer informs the Board of any significant events that have occurred since the last Board meeting.\n\nOn 10/uni00A0December 2020, a seminar was held dedicated entirely to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's strategic plan.\n\nAt the end of 2020, a new self-assessment questionnaire on the Board's  practices  and  procedures  was  sent  to  all  directors  to determine new areas for improvement.\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors during 2020\n\nThe Board of Directors met eight times in 2020, on 12/uni00A0 February, 7/uni00A0 April, 22/uni00A0 April, 29/uni00A0 April, 30/uni00A0 July, 29/uni00A0 October, 24/uni00A0 November and 10/uni00A0December 2020.

In this regard, the Group - and therefore Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances - has set itself priority actions with concrete targets, with the aim of women making up 30% of managing bodies by 2022. In the space of two years, the proportion of women within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Executive Committee has risen from 0% to 21%.\n\n## Age of directors\n\n## French Commercial Code:\n\n(L./uni00A0225-19 al./uni00A02).

Group, the compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances shares the same principles of competitiveness, responsible commitment and consistency of compensation structures.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. has established a responsible compensation policy aimed at reflecting the values of the Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Group and respecting the interests of all stakeholders, be they employees, customers or shareholders. The aim of the policy is to recognise individual and collective performance over the long term.\n\nIn line with the specific characteristics of its business lines, legal entities and legislation in local markets, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's compensation system aims at offering competitive compensation relative to its benchmark markets to attract and retain the best talent. Compensation is dependent on individual performance, but also the overall performance of the business lines. Lastly, the compensation policy aims at limiting excessive risk-taking.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances compensation policy reflects the targets defined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, while seeking to adapt them to different employee categories and the specific features of the insurance market.\n\nTotal compensation paid to employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances comprises the following elements:\n\n- z basic salary;\n- z individual variable compensation;\n- z collective variable compensation;\n- z long-term variable and deferred compensation;\n- z peripheral compensation (supplementary pension and health insurance schemes).\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  compares  its  practices  with  those of  its  market  (mutual  insurance,  insurance,  and  bancassurance companies) and thus seeks to position the overall compensation of its employees around the median market practice.\n\n## Basic salary\n\nThe basic salary rewards employees for the skills required to exercise the responsibilities associated with their position.\n\nA  position  (and  by  extension  the  associated  function)  are characterised by a particular role and contributions, a grade within the  organisation  and  a  job  description  outlining  the  expected competencies and experience.\n\n## Individual variable compensation\n\nIndividual variable compensation rewards employee performance and is an integral part of the annual compensation structure.\n\nThe basic salary and variable compensation are calculated to allow a fully flexible variable compensation policy, with the possibility of nonpayment of individual variable compensation in the event of underperformance and/or reported and proven risk behaviours.\n\nFurthermore, variable compensation is set in such a way that it does not impede the ability of Group entities to increase their solvency when necessary.\n\nIndividual variable compensation is assessed by precise measurement  of  the  results  obtained  relative  to  specific  annual objectives (how much), taking into account the conditions in which the objectives were achieved (how).\n\nThe extent to which objectives are achieved or exceeded is the key criterion for the allocation of individual variable compensation, in addition to a qualitative evaluation focusing on how the targets were achieved (examining criteria such as autonomy, involvement, uncertainty, general context, etc.), and in light of consequences for other stakeholders in the company (managers, colleagues, other sectors, etc.).\n\nTaking these various aspects into account helps to differentiate between individual performance levels.\n\nIn response to regulatory requirements both in Europe (Solvency/uni00A0II, Directive on insurance distribution) and the United States (the Volcker Rule), a Code of Conduct is included in the compensation policy so that compensation practices:\n\n- z do not create incentives that might encourage the persons concerned to promote their own interests to the potential detriment of their client;\n- z do not hinder the ability of their employees to act in the best interests of their clients, or dissuade them from presenting information in an unbiased, clear and non-misleading way;\n- z do not encourage speculative trading positions to be taken, where proprietary trading is permitted by law;\n- z prohibit employees from any recourse to an individual hedging strategy or income protection or liability insurance that could compromise the risk alignment envisaged by variable compensation schemes.\n\nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements under Solvency/uni00A0II, to prevent any conflict of interest, the compensation of personnel occupying 'key' functions will be set independently of that of the business lines they oversee or audit. These include functions such as those defined by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10/uni00A0 October 2014, namely Risk Management, Compliance, Internal Audit and Actuarial functions.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe targets set for them and the indicators used to determine their variable compensation do not take into account criteria relating to the results and financial performance of the entities they control.\n\nThese targets can be economic and/or non-economic:\n\n- z economic targets are disconnected with the results of the controlled entity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, and based on the results of the immediately upper entity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.;\n- z non-economic targets are set up with respect to the SMART method (Specific, Measurable, Accessible, Realistic and Timelimited). These targets can for instance focus on the quality/reliability of the control procedures under their responsibility.\n\n## Collective variable compensation\n\nCollective variable compensation rewards the collective performance of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances.  It  consists  of  profit-sharing  and incentive plans.\n\nCollective variable compensation is supplemented by a company savings scheme and collective pension savings plan for the benefit of all employees.\n\n## Employee share ownership to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s equity\n\nIn 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. has carried out a capital increase reserved for the employees of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nOn an exceptional basis and to take into account the mobilization of its employees since the beginning of the health crisis, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. has set this year the discount offered on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price at 30%.\n\n## Compensation policy for executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has implemented the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.  compensation  policy  for  executive  managers  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group.\n\nThese  managers,  members  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances management team, are identified and named according to the rules laid down and defined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.: they then join the management pools established by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group.\n\nThe variable compensation policy put in place by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group is aimed in particular at:\n\n- z correlating compensation levels with actual performance in the long term;\n- z aligning management interests with those of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. ecosystem, by differentiating between individual and collective objectives and linking economic and non-economic performance (customer satisfaction, management efficiency and impact on society);\n- z attract, motivate and keep executive managers in.\n\n## Individual variable compensation\n\nAmong  individual  variable  compensation  mechanisms,  executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are eligible for a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  Group  variable  compensation  scheme:  individual variable compensation, based on the achievement of pre-defined individual  and  collective  targets  within  an  employee's  area  of responsibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis  programme  has  been  designed  and  adapted  for  senior executives, who are not executive managers, of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances who also receive individual variable compensation.\n\nThe  calculation  of  individual  variable  compensation  measures individual performance, on the basis of the attainment of individual and collective targets in four areas specified below.\n\nThese areas are weighed according to the level of responsibility of the executive manager or senior executive:\n\n- z economic results are weighted by 20% to 50% of the total individual variable compensation, the weight increasing with the level of responsibility;\n- z the remaining 50% to 80% are spited by the management between the three other areas, according to the level of responsibility.\n\n## ECONOMIC RESULTS\n\nThe creation of shareholder value is assessed according to the nature of the function concerned. It must cross-reference financial results as well as levels of investment and risks generated, the cost of capital and liquidity, in harmony with the development strategy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group and its businesses.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nThe creation of management value is assessed according to the ability to attract, develop and retain the employees necessary for the development of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group by:\n\n- z finding and developing talent and future leaders;\n- z developing skills (training, delegation, etc.);\n- z managing careers: promotion, internal mobility, etc.;\n- z motivating teams: sharing information, participating in projects, etc.;\n- z initiating a managerial transformation allowing for a reinforced framework of trust.\n\n## INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS\n\nValue creation for internal or external customers according to the department is assessed by measuring satisfaction with the services and advice provided, the adaptation of our offers to new uses, the dynamics of innovation.\n\n## SOCIETY\n\nThe creation of societal value, in line with the mutualist and ethical identity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, is measured internally (corporate social responsibility, respect for values other than legal and economic obligations, etc.) and externally (impact on the environment, dealings with partners, customers, investors, suppliers, ethics, etc.).\n\nConduct that is found to be contrary to fit and proper requirements, compliance rules and procedures and risk limits has a direct impact on the variable compensation awarded.\n\nThe amounts of annual variable compensation are calculated as a percentage of base salary. Target bonus increases in line with responsibility levels.\n\nThe financial objectives set for each executive manager, irrespective of his/her business line or function, are partly based on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group criteria, commensurate with his/her level of responsibility, and partly on the entity's financial objectives.",

        "page_content": "## Long term variable compensation\n\nThe long-term compensation plan set up by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group takes the form of a share award and/or cash scheme indexed to long-term performance conditions.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' executive managers and key Group positions are eligible for this long-term plan, the actual allocation of which is at the discretion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe objectives of the long-term incentive plan are threefold:\n\n- z to strengthen the link between sustainable performance and compensation;\n- z to adapt compensation structures, in line with regulations, by allowing compensation to be managed over both the short and long term;\n- z to ensure the 'random' nature of the payout, by linking the grant to actual performance and the definitive acquisition of shares or indexed cash at the end of the deferral period to demanding criteria of sustainable performance linked to the Group's economic, stock market and social performance.\n\nThe target level of the grant corresponds to the grant made in respect of an actual performance in line with expectations. It was determined on the basis of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's past practices and benchmarks.\n\nSubject to the fulfilment of the performance conditions, the shares and/or ndexed cash are vested annually in equal proportions over a three-year vesting period.\n\nAn additional holding requirement may subsequently be imposed on beneficiaries for a further period.\n\nAt the end of the deferred period, the vesting of the shares is linked to the fulfilment of strict long-term performance conditions, on the basis of criteria linked to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's economic, stock market and social performance.\n\nThese performance criteria are set when each plan is implemented.\n\nIf performance conditions are met or exceeded at the end of the vesting period, 100% of the rights awarded are deemed to have vested.\n\nIn  the  event  of  partial  achievement  of  performance  conditions, a proportional reduction is applied. Each performance condition accounts for a third of the initial award.\n\n## Supplementary pension schemes\n\nFrom 2011 to 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' supplementary pension plan for executive managers consisted of a combination of defined contribution pension plans and a top-up defined benefit plan:\n\n- z the aggregate contributions of the two defined-contribution supplementary pension plans (the branch scheme and the company scheme) are equal to 8% of the gross salary capped at eight times the Social Security ceiling (of which 5% is paid by the employer and 3% by the beneficiary);\n- z the rights to the defined-benefit top-up scheme, which are determined after the rights paid under the defined-contribution plans. These rights are equal, subject to presence at term, to the product of a pension rate between 0.125% and 0.30% per quarter of seniority, within the limit of 120 quarters, and the reference salary.\n\nThis defined-benefit supplementary pension plan complies with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code as well as the former provisions of Article/uni00A0 L./uni00A0 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code which, for the periods concerned, limited the vesting rate of definedbenefit plans to 3% per year (text repealed by Order no./uni00A02019-1234 of 27/uni00A0November 2019).\n\nIn all cases, at the settlement date, the total retirement annuity of all schemes is capped at 70% of the reference compensation by application of the supplementary pension scheme regulations for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' executive managers.\n\nIn compliance with the PACTE  law and in accordance with the provisions  of  Order  no./uni00A0 2019-697  of  3/uni00A0 July  2019,  the  top-up defined-benefit plan has been definitively closed since 4/uni00A0July 2019 and the conditional rights it provides have been crystallized as of 31/uni00A0December 2019.\n\nEntitlements accumulated within the Group prior to the effective date of the 2011 regulation are maintained in accordance with the provisions of the regulation and are accumulated, where applicable, with entitlements arising from the application of the regulation in force for the calculation of the ceiling of the pension paid.\n\nTherefore,  no  additional  entitlements  under  the  top-up  definedbenefit pension plan will be granted for periods of employment after 1/uni00A0 January 2020. The entitlements for periods of employment prior to 1/uni00A0January 2020 will continue to be calculated on the basis of the salary at the end of the career, in accordance with the conditions provided for by the plan, and the benefit of these past entitlements remains uncertain and subject to the condition of presence.\n\nAs of 1/uni00A0 January 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has set up a defined contribution plan (Article/uni00A082) enabling executive managers to build up savings for retirement, with the company's support.\n\n## Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances does pay any compensation to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of his office, as his compensation is paid by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in accordance with the provisions applicable within the Group. He is not entitled to any benefits, specific pension arrangements, death and disability insurance or severance benefits of any kind in respect of his office.\n\nHowever,  he  is  'identified  staff'  (as  defined  under  the  heading 'Reward policiy' of the Universal Registration Document of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) and his compensation is structured in such a way as to be aligned to the longterm interests of the company.\n\nThus, and in accordance with regulatory obligations, strict rules apply to the compensation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Chief Executive Officer, in particular through a compensation policy that encourages sound and effective risk management, a variable compensation that is partly deferred and paid in the form of instruments, and which may be adjusted according to risks (malus and/or clawback clause).\n\nThis annual variable compensation is also determined on the basis of economic and non-economic objectives measuring the creation of managerial, social and customer value.\n\n## Governance of compensation\n\nThe governance of the compensation policies and practices of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' entities is based on the terms and processes defined within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAccordingly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  has  established  a Committee to implement compensation policies; this Committee gathers the Risks Management and Permanent Control department, the Compliance department and the Human Resources department.\n\nThe role of this Committee, that allows to involve Control functions in the process of variable compensations review and more precisely the ones relative to identified staff, is to:\n\n- z define identification criteria for employee considered as 'risk-takers', in a consistent manner within the framework given by the Group for each period, and regulatory requirements specific to i nsurance;\n- z identify and update the list of identified staff;\n- z coordinate the effective implementation of a risk-behavior control, in accordance with the ongoing procedures and norms;\n- z validate the review of the process and the reporting to the Group governance bodies, including the information relative to observed risk-behavior individual situation.\n\nAn arbitration procedure has also been formalised by this Committee to deal with any cases of risky behaviour observed during a financial year.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' compensation policy, which is drawn up on the recommendation of the Human Resources department, is regularly adjusted on the basis of the Committee's work, assessments and recommendations, as well as any changes in regulations and changes in the Group's compensation policy.\n\nSince 5/uni00A0November 2013, the date on which the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances decided to transfer the duties of the Compensation Committee to that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., the compensation policy has been placed under the control of the Compensation Committee of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group,  through  the  Human  Resources  department, therefore provides this Committee with all the information it needs to carry out its duties.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  then informed each year of the work carried out by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Compensation Committee, in particular:\n\n- z through the issuance of opinions relating to the compensation policy, its updates and the various related application notes;\n- z on its position regarding the variable compensation package in relation to the financial situation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, its long-term performance and its compliance with the risk policy;\n- z on the completion of a census of identified personnel;\n- z on the review of the opinion of the Control functions on the implementation and control of the compensation policy.\n\nThis work enables the Board of Directors to review and approve the compensation policy.\n\nFinally, the Group General Inspection department ensures, through its audits, compliance with the policy and conformity of practices.\n\n## COMPENSATION OF IDENTIFIED STAFF\n\nThe determination of employees as identified staff is the result of a joint process that involves the Risks Management and Permanent Control department, the Compliance department and the Human Resources department. This process is under the supervision of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Compensation Committee.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2015/35  of 10/uni00A0 October 2014, the employees considered as 'identified staff' include the employees that belong to a category of staff that could have an impact on the risk profile, because of the function they carry out, namely:\n\n- z corporate officers and executive directors;\n- z members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Committee;\n- z staff holding 'key' positions specified in articles/uni00A0 269 to 272 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35: risks management, Compliance control, internal Audit, Actuarial function;\n- z the staff responsible for the underwriting activity and the business development;\n- z the staff responsible for investments.\n\nFor each new financial year, the list or categories of employees identified are presented to the Compensation Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on the recommendation of the executive management of each entity, after validation by the risk, compliance and human resources functions.\n\nThe compensation policy of identified staff is specific in terms of variable compensation, 40% of this compensation (60% for the highest compensations) being deferred over three years, subject to performance conditions:\n\n- z the deferred share is acquired in one-third tranches: one third during the year N+1, one third during the year N+2 and one third during the year N+3, N being the reference year, provided that the acquisitions conditions are fulfilled (performance conditions);\n\n- z the performance conditions are in line with the ones of the long term variable compensation, defined in the chapter 'Long term variable compensation' above;\n- z the deferred variable compensation is acquired in the form of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shares or cash indexed to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shares;\n- z the employees involved in this scheme are prohibited from implementing a hedging or insurance strategy (whether on a personal basis or through their employer) with a view to limiting the scope of the statements contained in the compensation system in order to align a portion of the variable compensation with risks taken;\n- z the total amount of variable compensation attributed to an employee being identified staff can entirely or partially be reduced in function of the actions or risk behavior observed;\n- z in case of proven risky behaviour or particularly serious acts, subject to applicable local laws, the return of all or part of the variable compensation already paid could be demanded, up to five years after the payment;\n- z the staff whose variable compensation is below \u20ac120,000 is excluded from the scope for the application of these rules relative to deferred compensation.\n\nThe compensation paid during the fiscal year to identified staff is the subject of a resolution that is annually submitted to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Covid-19 is a shock unprecedented in nature firstly due to its disruption of the real economy: an external event that has impacted the economy globally and affects both supply and demand by forcing entire business sectors into inactivity, while at the same time causing consumption to contract with the resulting unintentional accumulation of extensive savings. The magnitude of the shock is another point of difference, being much greater than the 2008-2009 crisis. As early as April, the IMF thus delivered a forecast of a contraction of world GDP of -3% in 2020 (compared to a -0.1% decline in 2009). In June, the IMF stated that it expected a recession of -4.9% in 2020 followed by a recovery of 5.4% in 2021. In October, the forecasts of a recession followed by global recovery were both slightly revised (-4.4% followed 5.2%) to finally be revised favourably in January/uni00A02021 (-3.5% and 5.5%).\n\nTo cushion the anticipated recession and prevent the public health and economic crisis from being coupled with a financial crisis, we have thus witnessed the rapid and generalised implementation of monetary and budgetary support policies unprecedented in terms  of  size  and  capacity  to  overcome  constraints.\n\nIn/uni00A0 monetary/uni00A0 matters, central banks have had recourse to diverse combinations of various tools, while pursuing similar targets: easing of financing conditions, efficient transmission of monetary policy, better functioning of the financial and credit markets and, in the case of the ECB, easing of tensions on the most vulnerable sovereign bond spreads in the Eurozone. Thanks to massive support plans (partial  unemployment,  aid  to  the  most  vulnerable  populations, temporary reduction in social contributions, deferral of tax charges and social security costs, public guarantees on loans to companies, government equity investments), the budgetary policies have sought to soften the shock by limiting the destruction of jobs and production capacities in order to ensure the best possible restart, once the pandemic  has  passed.  While  monetary  and  budgetary  policies have made it possible to avoid a financial crisis and attenuate the recessionary  effect  of  the  pandemic,  its  effect  has  nonetheless been considerable but of varying magnitude by country depending, notably,  on  the  countries'  structural  features  (structure  of  GDP, employment, weight of different sectors), how robust they were precrisis, their public health strategies and how much leeway they had.\n\nIn the United States, in mid-March, the Federal Reserve took a series of radical easing measures (1) some of which were then extended and supplemented in order to ensure a supply of liquidity to banks and markets (unlimited asset buying, expansion of the universe of purchasable securities). This accommodative stance was also reinforced by the adoption of average inflation targeting which\n\n- (1)  Rate cut of 100 basis points (Fed funds range at [0; 0.25%]) of the marginal lending facility rate (discount window of 1.5% to 0.25%), lower reserve requirement rate, asset purchase program ($500/uni00A0billion in Treasuries and $200/uni00A0billion in mortgage-backed securities, MBS), liquidity for specific segments (Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility), forward guidance (no interest rate hike until the public health crisis is overcome and the economy evolves in line with its inflation and employment targets).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "explicitly allows the inflation target to be exceeded after periods in which inflation has been consistently below 2%. After its December meeting, the Federal Reserve made it clear that it would maintain an accommodative stance and its key rates at zero for an extended period as evidenced by the 'dot plot', in which the median projection of members of the FOMC shows unchanged rates until at least 2023. While feeling comfortable with the current set up, the Fed has said it was ready to do more (more bond purchases and/or maturity extensions) if necessary.\n\nThe  US  budgetary  response  was  also  rapid  (March)  and massive,  in  the  form  of  a  support  plan  known  as  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (totalling nearly $2,200/uni00A0 billion ( i.e. 10% of GDP) aimed at providing financial assistance or relief to households and businesses, but also to hospitals and states. The flagship measures included the direct stimulus payment to low and moderate income households, an unemployment insurance assistance plan (authorising the extension of unemployment benefits which normally fall under the competence of the states), financial support to SMEs ($350/uni00A0 billion), loans to large corporates, to states and local governments ($500/uni00A0billion), the release of loans to hospitals ($150/uni00A0billion). An additional budget plan ($484/uni00A0 billion i.e. just over 2% of GDP), aimed at strengthening the CARES Act of March and 'lengthening' the loan program for SMEs, was adopted in April.\n\nIn 2020 (1) , the US budget deficit therefore widened by nearly 10/uni00A0points to 14.9% of GDP, while the debt grew by +20 percentage points to reach 100% of GDP. Activity nonetheless fluctuated throughout the year. After a decline of -1.3% in the first quarter (non-annualised quarterly change), the decline in GDP in the second quarter was violent  (-9%)  but  followed  by  a  more  sustained  rebound  than expected (+7.5% in the third quarter). Owing to the resurgence of the pandemic, the improvement in the labour market came to a halt in December (after peaking at 14.8% in May, the unemployment rate reached 6.7% against 3.5% before the crisis). In the fourth quarter, economic activity grew only +1%. Despite massive monetary and budgetary support, the recession in the end stood at -3.5% (-2.5% in 2009); GDP was 2.5% below its pre-crisis level (end of 2019) and inflation reached 1.4% at end December.\n\nIn the Eurozone, from March onwards, the ECB deployed aggressive accommodative measures which it then adapted to prevent any undesirable tightening of financial conditions: increase in Quantitative Easing (additional envelope of \u20ac120/uni00A0billion), launch  of  a  new  temporary  purchasing  program  (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program or PEPP of \u20ac750/uni00A0billion, initially until the end of 2020, purchases not constrained by the limit of holding no more than 33% of any one bond or issuer, which makes for easier compliance with the capital distribution key), introduction of  transitional  Long  Term  Refinancing  Operations  (LTRO)  until June/uni00A02020 (with more favourable conditions as well as less stringent rules for collateral), easing of the TLTRO/uni00A0 III conditions, new longterm  refinancing  operations  Pandemic  Emergency  Longer-Term Operations (PELTRO) and, lastly, measures to alleviate the solvency and  liquidity  constraints  on  the  banking  sector.  At  the  end  of December,  faced  with  the  more  severe  impact  of  the  second\n\nwave of the pandemic on the short-term scenario and the high uncertainties about growth (for which it revised the 2021 forecast downwards from 5% to 3.9%), the ECB sent a very clear signal of substantial and, above all, lasting presence; it renewed its incentive to lend to banks and its commitment to limit pressure on the risk premiums of vulnerable sovereigns: recalibration of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO/uni00A0III, extension until June/uni00A02022 of the period during which very favourable conditions adopted in terms of interest rates (2 ) and easing of collateral apply), three additional operations planned for 2021 (June, September, December), increase in the total amount that the counterparties will be authorised to borrow during TLTRO/uni00A0III, four additional refinancing operations (PELTRO, from March to December/uni00A02021 for a period of one year), additional budget of \u20ac500/uni00A0billion dedicated to the PEPP (a total of \u20ac1,850/uni00A0billion), extension of the horizon for net purchases to the end of March/uni00A0 2022, reinvestment of principal repayment of maturing securities extended at least until the end of 2023.\n\nThe Eurozone's fiscal policy also quickly took an expansionary turn with national measures (support for the healthcare system, businesses and employment, public guarantees on new business loans).  By  easing  constraints  on  national  policies  through  the suspension of budgetary rules, the European Commission enabled the  countries  to  respond  immediately  to  the  crisis.  Faced  with such diverse national latitudes that posed the risk of a detrimental fragmentation to the market and to the single currency, the pooling of resources was essential. The existing funds were first mobilised (3 ) . As the scale of the crisis became clear, new pooled resources financed by debt emerged: the SURE fund (support to mitigate unemployment risks, \u20ac100/uni00A0 billion), investment guarantees by the EIB (\u20ac200/uni00A0 billion), a proposal from the European Commission in  favour  of  a  recovery  and  reconstruction  support  fund, redistributing in favour of the poorest countries and those most affected by the crisis: the Recovery Fund ( i.e. \u20ac750/uni00A0billion raised by bond issue guaranteed by the EU budget).\n\nIn 2020, the boost to the economy provided by fiscal policy was slightly less than 4 percentage points of GDP on average in the Eurozone. Coupled with the cyclical deterioration of the budget balance (4 percentage points of GDP), the public deficit widened by almost 9.3% on average in the Eurozone and led to a sharp increase in public debt (almost 18/uni00A0points on average to reach just over 104% of GDP). Despite monetary and fiscal arrangements, the economy nonetheless evolved with the pandemic and the mobility restriction measures it imposed. After an already substantial decline in the first quarter (-3.7% quarter-on-quarter), GDP fell by -11.7% in the second quarter before recording a spectacular rebound that was more robust than expected (+12.5%). In the last quarter, the decline was less severe than expected (-0.7%). While inflation fell back (-0.3%, year-on-year in December; 0.3% on average), the recession thus reached 6.8% in 2020 (compared to -4.5% in 2009), leaving GDP down -5.1% on its level at end 2019 and showing significant differences between the large Eurozone countries. For example, in Germany, after almost zero growth in the fourth quarter, GDP recorded an average contraction of 5.3% over 2020, which remains 'limited' notably in view of the financial crisis of 2009 (a -5.7% decline).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Over  full  year  2020,  GDP  fell  by -8.3%, a shock much greater than that of the 2009 crisis (-2.9%), but ultimately lower than what had been anticipated in the scenario of  December  or  by  the  economists  'scenario  which  planned  a contraction by around 9%. With a less maturity and extent, the second lockdown has been less negative for the economy than the spring's one. Thus, the level of activity in the fourth quarter is lower by 5% compared to the fourth quarter 2019, last quarter with a 'normal' level of activity, whereas the second/uni00A0quarter/uni00A02020 was lower by 18.8%. In the fourth quarter, the contraction of activity is mainly due to the decline in consumption, caused by administrative closures and curfew measures. On the other hand, the investment continues its recovery thanks to the continuation of the activity in sectors such as building, and capital goods production.\n\nBy  posting  even  moderate  growth  (around  2.3%),  China was ultimately the only G20 economy not to have suffered a recession in 2020. After a historically low first quarter, Chinese activity was revived thanks to a policy focused on supply (support for companies through public orders and lines of credit). A twospeed recovery has thus started with, on the one hand, a/uni00A0V-shaped recovery for industrial production, exports and public investment and, on the other hand, a more gradual rebound in consumption, private investment and imports. Despite the recovery, almost a year after the public health crisis, some stigmas are still visible: retail sales, just like certain service activities (requiring a physical presence) have not caught up to their 2019 level and job creation is still insufficient to offset the destruction that took place in early 2020 and absorb new entrants.\n\nIn 2020, monetary activism made it possible to prevent the economic crisis from being coupled with a financial crisis: a clear success in view, on the one hand, of the shock to the real economy and, on the other hand, of the threats that hovered at the beginning of the year, particularly within the Eurozone. In the wake of a powerful wave of risk aversion, in March, the German ten-year interest rate plunged to -0.86%, a low quickly followed by a violent widening of risk premiums paid by the other countries. Risk premiums offered by France, Spain and Italy peaked at 66 basis points (bp), 147/uni00A0 bp and 280/uni00A0 bp, respectively, in mid-March. Completed by  the  European  Recovery  Fund,  the  monetary  policy  measures rolled out by the ECB made it possible, if not to significantly raise German rates, then to avoid a fragmentation of the Eurozone and to encourage the appreciation of the euro against the dollar (9% over the full year). At end December, while the Bund stood at -0.57%, French, Italian and Spanish spreads were only 23/uni00A0 bp, 62/uni00A0 bp and 111/uni00A0 bp respectively. US rates (10-year US Treasuries), which started from 1.90% at the beginning of the year, fell back to 0.50% in March and then moved within a relatively narrow range (0.60%-0.90%). At its 15-16/uni00A0 December meeting, the Fed opted for the status quo but confirmed that it was still possible, if necessary, to increase its bond purchases and extend their maturity. Rates therefore rose slightly before quickly easing off. Having followed a slow upward trend since the summer, rates ended the year at 0.91%. Finally, the abundance of liquidity and the commitment to maintain accommodative monetary conditions provided by central banks supported riskier markets. Thus, for example, while American and European equities posted declines of respectively -30% and -37% in mid-March compared to their level at the beginning of January, they ended the year with a respectable rise (+14%) and a limited decline (-6.5%).\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE    ASSURANCES GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group results\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                         | 2020     | 2019     | Changes   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|\n| Written premiums                                        | 29,439   | 36,968   | (20.4%)   |\n| Change in unearned premiums                             | (223)    | (225)    | (0.9%)    |\n| Earned premiums                                         | 29,216   | 36,743   | (20.5%)   |\n| Revenue  or income from other activities                | 232      | (124)    | NS        |\n| Investment income net of investment expenses            | 7,661    | 15,662   | (51.1%)   |\n| Claims expenses                                         | (30,223) | (45,546) | (33.6%)   |\n| Net income and expenses from reinsurance contracts held | (176)    | (43)     | x 4.1     |\n| Other current income (expense)                          | (4,674)  | (4,292)  | 8.9%      |\n| Operating income                                        | 2,036    | 2,400    | (15.2%)   |\n| Financing expenses                                      | (279)    | (239)    | 16.7%     |\n| Income tax                                              | (522)    | (647)    | (19.3%)   |\n| Net income from  discontinued operations                | -        | 8        | NS        |\n| Consolidated net income                                 | 1,235    | 1,522    | (18.9%)   |\n| Non-controlling interests                               | (5)      | (4)      | 25.0%     |\n| CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES GROUP NET INCOME GROUP SHARE | 1,230    | 1,518    | (19.0%)   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Premium  income  in  2020  totalled  \u20ac29.4/uni00A0 billion.  2020  was overshadowed by the health and economic crisis relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a slowdown in business activity and a 20.4% drop in premium income. This was due to an unfavourable base effect following a record level of inflows in 2019, as well as the implementation of the policy initiated in 2019 aiming to refocus savings and pensions activities on unit-linked business. Premium income from property and personal protection rose further. The breakdown  by  business  line  is  detailed  in  the  section  'Gross revenues  by business segment'.\n\nInvestment income net of investment  expenses decreased sharply, mainly due to the change in fair value of investments recognised at fair value through profit or loss in connection with the unfavourable development of the financial markets in 2020 and an unfavourable base effect following strong growth on the markets in 2019, having bottomed out at the end of 2018.\n\nClaims expenses  were down 33.6%:\n\n- z in life insurance, business continued to grow with outstandings (1) up 1.4% over the year at \u20ac308.3/uni00A0billion. In addition, the Group pursued its policy of strengthening its reserves, notably by allocating approximately \u20ac800/uni00A0million to the policyholders' participation reserve in 2020, bringing it to \u20ac11.6/uni00A0billion, or 5.6% of Euro outstandings (2) ;\n- z in non-life insurance, growth remained robust both in France and internationally (508,000 net new contracts in 2020). Growth in premium income in France continued to outperform the market considerably.\n\nOther current income and expenses rose in line with business. This item mainly comprises administrative expenses and contract acquisition costs.\n\nThe 16.7% increase in financing expenses  was mainly due to the payment to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. of a cash balance of \u20ac54/uni00A0 million before tax related to the early redemption of redeemable subordinated bonds totalling \u20ac1/uni00A0billion following a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion perpetual subordinated debt issue in July/uni00A02020.\n\nThe tax charge decreased by 19.3%, mainly in connection with the fall in operating income.\n\nNet income (Group share) in 2020 was \u20ac1.2/uni00A0 billion, down 19.0% compared with 2019. Adjusted for exceptional items relating to the health crisis (nearly \u20ac140/uni00A0million of solidarity and support measures, \u20ac15/uni00A0million exceptional contribution of supplementary health insurers to the expenses related to the management of the Covid-19 epidemic) and the cash balance paid to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (\u20ac49/uni00A0million net of tax), net income (Group share) was \u20ac1.4/uni00A0 billion, down 5.5% compared with the particularly high level achieved in 2019.\n\nThe breakdown in net income and gross revenues shown below is done on the same basis as the segment breakdown presented in note/uni00A05 to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A08.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF NET INCOME (GROUP SHARE) BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                       | 2020   | 2019   | Changes   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Life  France                          | 1,055  | 1,229  | (14.2%)   |\n| Non-life  France                      | 21     | 110    | (80.9%)   |\n| Creditor s (France and International) | 57     | 54     | 5.6%      |\n| International (excluding creditors)   | 84     | 73     | 15.1%     |\n| Other                                 | 13     | 51     | (74.5%)   |\n| CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES GROUP      | 1,230  | 1,518  | (19.0%)   |\n\nNet income Group share in 2020 breaks down as follows:\n\n- z \u20ac1,055/uni00A0million from life insurance in France in 2020, down 14.2%, representing around 86% of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's net income.

The profile and pace of growth will therefore continue to be impacted by the pandemic and the delicate trade-off between growth and public health safety. After a lacklustre first half, recovery should be very modest and very disparate, despite monetary and budgetary infusions. The major economies will continue to be helped out by massive budgetary support, highly accommodating monetary policies and favourable financial conditions. While some key markers may still fall (as in the scenario of negative interest rates in the UK, which cannot be ruled out), it seems that easing exercises have come to an end (in the sense that there will be no new tools) and reliance will now have to be on improving/extending existing mechanisms. Budgetary policy will be decisive in delivering shortterm support and then stimulating the economy once the situation is 'normalised'. As is being demonstrated in Japan, where monetary innovation seems highly advanced, budgetary policy is playing a more direct role in reducing the output gap. This has the support of Bank of Japan, which is acting as an 'integrated stabiliser' of long rates by controlling the yield curve.\n\nIn the United States , at a time when the resurgence of the virus poses a risk of sharp deceleration in first half 2021, the election of Joe Biden as President and the control of both houses of Congress by the Democrats is expected to result in additional stimulus measures on top of the $900-billion deal negotiated at the end of 2020. In fact, Joe Biden has already proposed a new stimulus bill worth $1.9/uni00A0trillion. However, political constraints make it unlikely that a bill of that size will pass (a stimulus of around $1/uni00A0trillion is more likely). In January, the Federal Reserve, with its wait-and-see attitude, extended its status quo, (1) while noting that the economy was slowing, that its scenario for boosting economic recovery in the second half was contingent on the progress of immunisation and that rumours of tapering were premature. Consequently, while budgetary support could contribute 1 percentage point to US growth, growth will not start to accelerate until the second half, once the vaccine rollout is more widespread and restrictions are eased, at which point it should be close to 4% (as an annual average).\n\nIn the Eurozone , uncertainty as to when the pandemic will be under control and the lack of a clear view of the economic situation will continue to weigh on spending decisions, both by consumers (risk of precautionary savings) and investors, throughout 2021. The risk of a massive and early withdrawal of budgetary support measures seems to be ruled out for 2021: the risk (including of business failures and increased unemployment) is expected to materialise later, once business activity begins to return to normal./uni00A0Our scenario assumes growth in 2021 close to 3.8% (with a now-downward bias). Depending on structural characteristics (sectoral composition of supply and employment, services weighting, export capacity,\n\nadequacy of exported products, etc.) and national strategies (health/ economy  trade-offs,  abundance  and  effectiveness  of  support measures), there will be enormous diversity in both the impact of the crisis and the speed and strength of the recovery. Our scenario assumes average growth rates close to 2.5% in Germany, 5.9% in France and 4% in Italy. At end 2021, the Eurozone's GDP is expected to be 2.4% below its pre-crisis level ( i.e. at end 2019). While this gap should be limited to 2% in Germany, it is expected to be close to 7.4% in Spain and around 2.2% and 3.9% in France and Italy respectively.\n\nThe  announcements  made  by  the  ECB  in  December  removed any prospect of normalised monetary policy. The ECB has offered reassurance that there will be no early rise in interest rates while additional budgetary efforts are being rolled out and guaranteed its presence in the sovereign market until 2023. It is working to maintain the credit supply provided in recent months, ensuring banks have favourable  conditions.  In  the  medium  term,  the  key  issues  are therefore less about the sustainability of public debt than about governance and the ability to mobilise public funds to organise a response to the crisis.\n\nThe United Kingdom left the single market and customs union on 1/uni00A0 January 2021, with a last-minute free-trade agreement. This avoids customs duties and quotas (subject to compliance with fair competition rules and rules of origin) but involves significant non-tariff barriers. Frictionless trade in goods and services has therefore come to an end, as has the free movement of people. In addition to the disruptions associated with setting up a new post-Brexit relationship, there are also the consequences of the pandemic: following a major contraction in 2020 estimated at -11.1%, growth is expected to be close to 4.5% in 2021, leaving GDP at the end of 2021 3.8% below its 2019 pre-crisis level.\n\nIn emerging markets , after a contraction of just under 3% in 2020, recovery looks to be close to 5.5%. However, this figure masks substantial diversity: an optical illusion that conceals both the immediate effects of the crisis, mostly the result of monetary and budgetary constraints that are more severe in emerging markets than in the developed world, and its lasting consequences in the form of a widening of the structural gap between the emerging markets in Asia and the others. Asia (particularly North Asia) has suffered less and is getting ready to rebound, led by China. At the fifth plenum, the Chinese authorities made public the initial objectives of the country's 14 th /uni00A0 Five-Year Plan. The plan aims for 'sound and sustainable development' promoting 'quality growth' with no formal economic growth target, perhaps to allow for more flexibility in economic policymaking. China is expected to rebound strongly in 2021 (+8%) before returning to its projected trajectory in 2022 (+5.1%). However, it seems unrealistic to count on China's momentum to invigorate Asia and promote the recovery of the rest of the world given the experience of 2009. With most of the catching-\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "up now done, growth in China has slowed, and the country no longer has the means to tow the rest of the world in its wake. And nor does it want to. Its latest so-called 'dual circulation' strategy, aimed at limiting its dependence on overseas markets, is proof of this.\n\nA slow, uncertain and probably chaotic recovery, multiple uncertainties  and  monetary  easing  are  all  conditions conducive to maintaining extremely low interest rates. It will be necessary to wait until favourable news finally emerges, in terms of public health as well as the economy, before recovery can start to take shape - a start limited by the absence of inflation and excess capacity. In the meantime, progress made by the Eurozone can be judged by past interest rate changes: clear solidarity has avoided fragmentation,  risk  premiums  paid  by  the  so-called  'peripheral' countries have been tightened, and the euro has put in a solid performance.  Our  scenario  therefore  assumes  US  and  German 10-year sovereign rates of close to 1.50% and -0.40% respectively at end 2021, coupled with spreads of 20/uni00A0basis points (bp), 50/uni00A0bp and 100/uni00A0bp above the Bund for France, Spain and Italy where it is assumed that political tensions will ease.\n\nIn keeping with a scenario where recovery might even be slow, timid and unsynchronised, the dollar could depreciate very slightly against the euro and currencies that are more procyclical or driven by risk appetite. The dollar's depreciation would, however, be tempered by the resurgence of Sino-American tensions that weigh on Asian currencies in particular: the current crisis  has  only  temporarily  overshadowed  the  dissent  between the United States and China. While the timetable is uncertain (the US still has to install the new administration, manage its domestic problems and rebuild its global alliances), and despite the fact that Joe Biden's presidency augurs a change in tone, the roots of the conflict remain. The rise of protectionism and political risk hampered hyper-globalisation: the crisis should favour greater regionalisation of growth centres, as evidenced by the signing of the Regional Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  uniting  China,  ASEAN member countries and key US allies (Australia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand).\n\n## For Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group\n\nLargest  insurer  in  France (1) ,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  keeps growing for the customers' satisfaction, with the support of the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  distribution  networks  in  France  and  in Europe, through an integrated bancassurance model.\n\nOn 6/uni00A0June 2019, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group announced the adoption of its 2022 Medium-Term Plan. The 2022 Medium-Term Plan sets out ambitious targets for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances as one of the main drivers for achieving targeted revenue synergies by 2022 at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, over \u20ac800/uni00A0 million of which is expected to come from the insurance business.The 2022 MediumTerm Plan reflects the following key strategies for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances business:\n\n- z Life i nsurance: in its savings product line, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will continue to offer pertinent savings products in a low interest rate environment as part of a global advisory approach, supporting customers in the diversification of their assets and acting as a trusted advisor, while preserving profitability for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group. In retirement products, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will take advantage of new market opportunities provided by the 'PACTE law ' to increase its market share in France, while also strengthening synergies with Amundi for Group retirement plans. In the Death and Disability business,\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will offer more flexible creditor insurance solutions, boost growth on individual death & disability insurance, and continue to grow its Group health and Group death & disability solutions lines;\n\n- z Property & Casualty: in the property & casualty segment product line, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will aim to increase penetration among customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks and LCL, offer new solutions to farmers to preserve their farms and crops, and reinforce a 'Prevention-Insurance-Protection' approach with a prevention plan for all Regional Banks across a range of customer segments including young adults, families, seniors, farmers and employees;\n- z The 2022 Medium-Term Plan includes targeted offers for each of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance's main customer segments, including:\n- z an expanded offering for households, with in-home services such as remote surveillance, extended offers for property & casualty individual risk management and support for key life events. It will offer services for new forms of mobility with specific offerings for individuals and fleet management companies. It will also offer e-health services for key life moments,\n- z a  comprehensive  bancassurance  offering  for  corporate customers, including a robust offer for group health, death & disability, and retirement solutions, structured for corporate customers' needs. A property and casualty commercial lines insurance solution will be launched for corporates by the end of 2020,\n- z increased international business. The Group aims to increase its exposure to international markets, and is targeting reaching \u20ac7.3/uni00A0 billion in premium income from international activities by 2022 (a 20% increase from 2018). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances aims to achieve this through a combination of (i)/uni00A0 synergies within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, such as expanding customer penetration in Italy and developing property & casualty solutions for Italy, Portugal and Poland and (ii)/uni00A0beyond the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group through partnerships, using a bancassurance model for partner banks in Italy, Portugal and Japan, and via private banks hubs and creditor insurance in Europe,\n- z reflecting these strategies, the 2022 Medium-Term Plan includes the following targets for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances by 2022: reaching \u20ac322/uni00A0 billion in life insurance outstandings (a 13% increase from 2018) with 26% of life insurance outstandings in unit-linked contracts by the end of 2022, a market share of 15% for new retirement savings in France, \u20ac5/uni00A0billion in premium income from death and disability, creditor and group insurance (a 35% increase from 2018) with a 2% increase in penetration rate, and \u20ac5.5/uni00A0billion in premium income from property and casualty insurance policies (a 31% increase from 2018) with over 5% of customers subscribed to at least one property and casualty insurance contract. In addition, the 2022 Medium-Term Plan targets a 3% compound average growth rate in Group revenues (revenues plus fees paid to distributors) over the 2018-2022 period, to achieve \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion by 2022. It also targets a combined ratio of less than 96% by 2022 and a cost-income ratio of around 30% by such date.\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nNo  significant  events    occurred  between  the  reporting  date  on 31/uni00A0 December 2020 and the date on which the Board of Directors approved the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other risks and uncertainties which are currently not known or considered as minor could significantly impact Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in the future.\n\nThe  risks  described  below  are  inherent  in  the  nature  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's business as well as in the economic, political, competitive and regulatory environment in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group operates.\n\nConsidering  the  numerous  possibilities  and  uncertainties  related to these risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is not always able to\n\nprecisely quantify the impact of these risks. However, several risk management  processes,  procedures  and  controls  have  been implemented in order to continuously monitor and manage these risks, which, nevertheless, have their limits like any control system and cannot protect with absolute certainty against all of the risks described below or losses liable to be generated.\n\nIn  addition,  if  the  risks  described  below  lead  to  quantifiable financial losses and/or a potential material liability, these elements are reflected in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance Group consolidated financial statements, in accordance with applicable IFRS accounting standards.\n\n## RISKS R ELATED TO THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's operating income depends on investment returns and changes in the fair value of its portfolio of financial investments\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance Group holds an investment portfolio related  to  the  matching  of  liabilities  and  particularly  guarantees granted to policyholders. As of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, the Group's portfolio of financial investments from insurance activities amounted to \u20ac419.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is exposed to a number of financial risks in connection with its financial investment portfolio, including:\n\n- z market risks, in particular interest rate risk, which exposes the general account to valuation risk, and equity risk. Investment income net of expenses thus amounted to \u20ac11.7/uni00A0billion in 2017, while it decreased to \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion in 2018, mainly due to the change in fair value of investments recognised  at fair value through profit or loss, penalized by unfavorable financial market trends, particularly in the last quarter of 2018. In 2019, it recovered to \u20ac15.7/uni00A0billion before declining to \u20ac7.7/uni00A0billion in 2020 as a result of the change in fair value of investments recognised  at fair value through profit or loss in the context of the crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic. This demonstrates the volatility of income from the Group's investments, and there is no guarantee that the Group will not incur significant losses in the future;\n- z asset-liability management risks: the evolution of the portfolio's return is negatively impacted by a low interest rate environment on Euro-denominated life insurance contracts. This low interest rate environment directly affects the rates at which the Group invests and thus the return on its portfolio, which could lead to a decrease in margins. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, 82% of the Group's investments (excluding unit-linked products) consisted of bond products and the Group is pursuing a policy of asset diversification\n\nwhich limits the dilution of the investment portfolio's return, with limited risk taking, notably thanks to the hedges set up on the portfolio. Thus, at the end of 2020, the return rate on the Group's investments was 2.13%. Such risk does not affect unit-linked contracts, where the policyholder obtains a return directly linked to the return on the underlying asset.\n\nIn  an  unfavorable  market  situation,  these  financial  risks  could therefore have a very significant negative impact on the Group's operating income.\n\nChanges in interest rates, whether the continuation of a low (or negative) interest rate environment impacting operating income, or a sharp rise in interest rates that could impact the market value of investments, may affect the financial position of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group\n\nThe continuation of a persistently low or even negative interest rate environment could have a significant impact on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's business. As of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, 82% of the Group's investments (excluding unit-linked products) consisted of fixed income products. Low (or negative) interest rates weigh on the return on fixed income investments, which may be insufficient to cover the minimum guaranteed rates on savings products, which could significantly affect the Group's operating income and solvency position. While the Group has not issued policies with minimum guaranteed rates in excess of zero (beyond one year) since 2000, certain policies issued prior to that date that remain outstanding offered positive guaranteed rates; the average minimum guaranteed rate being 0.27 % for all policies as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, leaving the Group exposed in a negative interest rate environment. For comparison, the yield on Group's investments as of 31/uni00A0December 2020 was 2.13%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "An increase in interest rates may also have a significant negative impact on the fair value of the Group's fixed income portfolio, leading to a decrease in unrealised gains which could negatively impact its capital, solvency position and net income. Unrealised capital gains on the investment portfolio amounted to 30.7/uni00A0 billion euros as of 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could increase the cost of the debt securities the Group may issue to finance the Group's operations or its regulatory capital requirements. For example, the latest issue of one billion euro of subordinated Group debt, eligible as Tier/uni00A02 capital and with a ten-year maturity, bears interest at a rate of 2.00%.\n\nThe fixed income portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates provides an assessment of this risk's impact. According to this sensitivity analysis, which is conducted net of the impact on deferred policyholder surplus and tax, as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, a 100/uni00A0basis points increase in risk-free rates would have decreased the Group's net income by \u20ac53/uni00A0million and equity by \u20ac2,213/uni00A0million. As at the same date, a 100/uni00A0basis points decline in risk-free rates would have increased the Group's net income by \u20ac89/uni00A0 million and equity by \u20ac2,217/uni00A0million.\n\n## The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the business, operations and financial performance of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurnaces Group\n\nIn December/uni00A0 2019, a new coronavirus strain (Covid-19) appeared in China. The virus spread to many countries around the world, leading the World Health Organisation to describe the situation as a pandemic in March/uni00A02020. The pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, significant negative impacts on the world economy and financial markets.\n\nThe spread of Covid-19 and resulting government control and travel restrictions implemented around the world have caused disruption to global supply chains and economic activity. The outbreak has led to supply and demand shocks, resulting in a marked slowdown in economic activity, due to the impact of containment measures on consumption, as well as production difficulties, supply chain disruptions and a slowdown of investment. Financial markets have been significantly impacted, with increased volatility, stock market indices declining precipitously, falls in commodity prices and credit spreads widening for many borrowers and issuers. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets over the long term will depend, in part, on its length and severity, and on the impact of governmental measures taken to limit the spread of the virus and its impact on the economy. For this reason, in December/uni00A02020 the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance revised its GDP growth forecasts for 2021 downwards to 5.0% versus 7.4% previously announced.\n\nThe pandemic and its impact on the global economy and financial markets have had and are likely to continue to have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, operating income and financial condition. As an illustration, and even if the impacts of changes in the fair value of assets accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are reversible, and have moreover largely reduced over the rest of the year thanks to the recovery of the markets, in the first quarter\n\nof 2020, when the crisis occurred, adverse market conditions had a negative impact of \u20ac306/uni00A0 million on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' contribution to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s revenues, compared to the first quarter of 2019. As of the end of March/uni00A0 2020, life insurance outstandings decreased to \u20ac299/uni00A0billion from \u20ac304/uni00A0billion at the end of 2019 largely as a result of adverse changes in market valuations, before returning to \u20ac308/uni00A0 billion at the end of 2020. In terms of solvency, the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of the Group was 227% at the end 2020, down from 263% at the end of 2019, mainly as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nThe health crisis and its consequences on the French, European and International economies have had an impact on the activity levels of the Group's business lines. During the year 2020, several lockdowns were imposed in many countries around the world, notably in France and Italy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's two main markets, leading to a decline in life insurance inflows and a slowdown in new business in the protection of assets and individuals segments. Thus, in 2020, savings and retirement business was down 28.4% from the very high level of 2019 and new business in property and casualty insurance reached 91% of 2019 production.\n\nUncertainties  continue  to  weigh  on  developments  in  the  health situation in Europe, with the introduction of new restrictive measures in France and other European countries (curfews, border closures, new  lockdowns)  and  the  emergence  of  variants  of  the  virus. Additional measures are therefore likely to be deployed depending on the evolution of the pandemic. Although vaccines were announced at the end of 2020, and several countries have begun their phased roll-out, the timing of this process also remains highly uncertain, reducing visibility on the speed of the exit from the crisis. Finally, there is considerable uncertainty about the pace of development and  implementation  of  the  economic  support  measures  of  the governments (particularly the French and Italian States) and central banks (notably the European Central Bank).\n\n## General economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect the market value of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's investments and its business\n\nThe  market  value  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's investments could be impacted by the general situation of financial markets, or by the situation of particular sectors or geographic markets to which the Group is exposed. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the  Group's  investments  by  asset  class  (excluding  unit-linked products) consisted of 82% fixed income products, 7% real estate and 6% equities, and 4% others. At that same date, the breakdown of Group's investment portfolio (consisting of assets owned directly, excluding GNB Seguros and CA Assicurazioni as well as derivatives, repurchase agreements, and intragroup loans) by economic sector included  33%  government,  23%  financial  and  securitization, 24% corporate, 11% agencies and 8% real estate. The Group's investments by geographic area (consisting of assets owned directly, excluding GNB Seguros and CA Assicurazioni as well as derivatives, repurchase agreements, intragroup loans) at the same date included 64% of investments in France, 20% in the Euro zone (excluding France), 5% Europe non Euro zone, 7% Americas and 4% other. The Group's total exposure to sovereign debt was \u20ac77.3/uni00A0billion, of which 70% was exposure to France, 12% exposure to Italy, 5% exposure to Belgium, 5% exposure to Spain, 3% exposure to Austria and 5% exposure to other countries.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Among  other  things,  these  factors  include  concerns over the creditworthiness of certain sovereign issuers, high-levels of corporate indebtedness, the impact of Brexit, the fluctuations of foreign currencies against the Euro, the availability and cost of credit, the stability and solvency of certain financial institutions and other companies, central bank intervention in the financial markets, energy  costs,  trade  disputes  and  geopolitical  issues.  Moreover, extreme market events, such as the global financial crisis during 2008 and 2009, have led, and could in the future lead, to a liquidity crisis, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation of the values of all asset classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a widening of credit spreads. These factors, as well as adverse economic conditions in general, could lead to significant declines in the market value and performance of the investment portfolio and a decline in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's business.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's hedging programs may be inadequate to protect the Group against the full extent of the exposure or losses the Group seeks to mitigate which may negatively impact the Group's business, operating income and financial condition\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group uses derivatives to hedge certain risks. As of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, the notional amount of the Group's total hedging derivative instruments was \u20ac1.9/uni00A0 billion. For  further  quantitative  information  on  the  Group's  outstanding hedges, see note/uni00A0 6.9 of the Consolidated financial statements at 31/uni00A0December 2020. The Group's hedging techniques are designed to reduce the economic impact of unfavorable changes to certain of the Group's exposures to interest rate risk and other factors. In certain cases, however, the hedges are not perfect or limited compared to the overall exposure, due, for example, to the insufficient size of the derivative market or due to excessive hedging costs or the very nature of the risk that can not always be hedged. This may result in losses due to hedging imperfections as well as unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle transactions. In addition, hedging counterparties  may  fail  to  perform  their  obligations,  resulting  in losses on positions that are not collateralized. The operation of the Group's hedging program is based on models and assumptions that may not fully reflect reality and may therefore give rise to a risk, which could have a material impact on its business, operating income and financial position.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's valuation of investments that lack an active trading market or observable market data may change as a result of changes in methodologies, estimations or assumptions, or may prove inaccurate\n\nCertain of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's investment assets, for which there is no active trading market or other observable market data,  are  valued  using  models  and  methodologies  that  involve estimates,  assumptions  and  significant  management  judgment. As  of  31/uni00A0 December  2020,  \u20ac9.7/uni00A0 billion  of  the  Group's  financial instruments,  were  categorized  as  Level/uni00A0 3  financial  instruments under IFRS/uni00A0 13 and valued based on unobservable data. As of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, financial instruments categorized as Level/uni00A0 3 financial  instruments  represented  2.4%  of  total  financial  assets valued at fair value. For further quantitative information, see note/uni00A06.5 of the Consolidated financial statements dated 31/uni00A0December 2020 which presents a breakdown of the Group's assets measured at fair value and otherwise.\n\nDuring  periods  of  market  disruption,  a  larger  portion  of  the Group's  investment  assets  may  be  valued  using  these  models and  methodologies  as  a  result  of  less  frequent  trading  or  less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes that were previously actively traded in liquid markets. There can be no assurance that the Group's valuations on the basis of these models and methodologies represent the actual price for which a security may ultimately be sold or for which it could be sold at any specific point in time. Use of different models, methodologies and/or assumptions may have a impact on the estimated fair value amounts and inaccurate valuations could have a material negative effect on the Group's operating income and financial condition. For additional information on the accounting policies and principles related to the valuation of the Group's investments, see note/uni00A01 to the Consolidated financial statements dated 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nLosses due to defaults by financial institution counterparties, reinsurers and/or other third parties could negatively affect the value of the Group's investments and reduce the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's profitability\n\nThird parties that owe the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group money, securities or other assets, are likely to default to their obligations which could have a material negative effect on the value of the Group's investments and reduce the Group's profitability. These parties  include  private  sector  and  government  (or  governmentbacked) issuers whose securities the Group holds in the Group's investment portfolios, borrowers under mortgages and other loans that the Group extends, reinsurers to which the Group has ceded insurance risks, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under derivative contracts, other counterparties including brokers\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Group's investments by economic sector included 33% government, 23% financial and securitization, 24% corporate, 11% agencies and 8% real estate. In addition, as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the breakdown of the Group's bond portfolio, which represents 82% of the investment portfolio, by credit rating included approximately 11% exposure to AAA-rated bonds, 45% exposure to AA-rated bonds, 24% exposure to A-rated bonds, 19% exposure to BBBrated bonds, less than 1% exposure to bonds rated BB or lower and  1%  exposure  to  non-rated  bonds.  For  further  quantitative information on the Group's counterparty risk exposure, see item entitled 'Counterparty risk' in the section 'Risk factors and risk management procedures - Quantitative and qualitative information'.\n\n## The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments to be taken on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's investments requires the use of significant management judgment and could impact the Group's operating income or financial position\n\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments under the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's accounting principles and policies with respect to investments (as detailed in note/uni00A01 to the Consolidated financial statements dated 31/uni00A0December 2020) varies by investment type and is based upon the Group's periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. In considering impairments, management considers a wide range of factors and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and the prospects for near-term recovery. For certain asset classes, including debt instruments, management's evaluation involves a variety of assumptions and estimates about the Group's\n\noperations and its future earnings potential, which may involve a large uncertainty. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the amount of impairment on debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income was  \u20ac103/uni00A0 million.  Impairments  and/or  allowances  may  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  operating  income  and financial position. Note/uni00A06.7 of the Consolidated financial statements dated 31/uni00A0 December 2020 provides additional information on the changes in carrying amounts and loss allowances during the period.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's reported earnings\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Euros. A portion of the Group's insurance written premiums and financial revenues, as well as the Group's benefits, claims and other deductions are denominated in currencies other than the Euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have a very  moderate  impact  on  the  Group's  operating  income,  cash flows, investments value, shareholders' equity and solvency. As of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, the Group's foreign exchange risk related primarily to structural exposure to the yen for its CA Life Japan subsidiary (net exposure equivalent to \u20ac9.7/uni00A0million) and to the Polish zloty for its CA Insurance Poland subsidiary (net exposure equivalent to \u20ac2.0/uni00A0 million), as well as the risk of operational foreign exchange exposure arising from a mismatch between the currency of assets and liabilities in the Group's global portfolio. The sensitivity analysis of the investment portfolio to changes in exchange rates helps to assess the impact of this risk. According to this sensitivity analysis, as of 31/uni00A0December 2020, a 10% increase in each currency compared to Euro would lead to a decrease in net income of 0.1/uni00A0million euros and an increase in Group equity of 0.1/uni00A0million euros. A 10% decrease in each currency compared to the Euro would increase net income by 0.1/uni00A0million euros and decrease Group equity by 0.1/uni00A0million euros. For further quantitative information on the Group's foreign exchange risk exposure, see item entitled 'Foreign exchange risk' in the section 'Risk factors and risk management procedures - Quantitative and qualitative information'.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group may not be able to meet its obligations to pay minimum guaranteed returns and the surrender value of policies in connection with its savings and retirement business\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's principal business is savings and retirement, which consists of offering insurance policies that provide policyholders with investment returns, and that can either be surrendered for their cash value at the option of the policyholders or paid out to the beneficiaries in the event of death. In the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2020, the savings and retirement business accounted for 69% of the Group's gross written premiums.\n\nThe Group's savings and retirement business is subject to risks related to the guaranteed surrender value of its Euro-denominated contracts. Under these policies, the surrender value is not tied to the fair value of the underlying assets (unlike unit-linked policies that provide the policyholders with returns specifically tied to underlying assets or indices), which leads to the risk of asset and liability\n\nvaluation mismatches. If rapid increases in interest rates or other factors lead to a large increase in surrender rates by policyholders, the Group may be unable to meet its obligations under the surrender value of these contracts. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Group had \u20ac308.3/uni00A0billion of savings and retirement outstandings, of which 76% came from Euro-denominated contracts.\n\nThe Group's life insurance business is also subject to risks related to minimum guaranteed rates offered to policyholders on some of its Euro-denominated contracts issued before 2000, corresponding on average to a minimum guaranteed rate of 0.27 % for all of the Group's policies as of 31/uni00A0 December 2020. For these policies, if investment income falls below the guaranteed rates, the Group may not be able to meet its obligations under the minimum guaranteed rates. In 2020, return rate on the Group's investments was 2.13% and the Group had a policyholder participation reserve ('PPE') of \u20ac11.6/uni00A0billion, representing 5.6% of outstandings in euro.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  the  Group's  obligations  with  respect  to the surrender value or minimum guaranteed rates would have a significant impact on the Group's financial position.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Because the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's business is concentrated in France, a downturn in the French market could have a disproportionate impact on the Group's operating income\n\nAs of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's life and non-life segments in France accounted for 85% of the Group's gross written premiums. At the same date, 64% of the Group's investments were concentrated on issuers located in France. As a consequence, a sharp deterioration in French economic conditions would significantly affect the Group's operating income, and would impact the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance Group more than a group with more diversified international activities.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance business may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates\n\nIn addition to impacting the Group's financial investments, changes in prevailing interest rates also affect the Group's insurance operations. For example, in periods of declining interest rates, Euro-denominated savings and retirement products may be relatively more attractive to consumers due to better expected returns compared to other types of savings investments available to them, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features and a higher percentage of retirement and savings contracts remaining in force from year-to-year, creating potential significant asset liability duration mismatches if the change is not properly anticipated.\n\nConversely, in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, surrender rates  in  savings  and  retirement  contracts  may  increase  as policyholders choose to forego insurance and seek higher investment returns. In 2020, in a low interest rate environment, the surrender rate of Predica (the main Group's savings and retirement subsidiary) was 3.2%. An unanticipated increase in policy surrenders could require the Group to liquidate fixed maturity investments in order to obtain cash to satisfy surrender obligations at a time when market prices for such assets are depressed, leading to significant realised  investment losses for the Group. Accelerated surrenders may also cause the Group to accelerate amortisation  of deferred contracts acquisition costs, which would reduce the Group's net income.\n\n## Claims experienced could be inconsistent with the assumptions used to price the Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole Assurances Group's products and establish its reserves\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  earnings  depend  to  a large extent upon the adequacy of its claims experience with the assumptions the Group uses in setting the prices for the Group's products and establishing the liabilities for obligations relating to technical  provisions  and  claims.  These  assumptions  concern, for  example,  changes  in  mortality  or  morbidity,  the  behavior  of policyholders, and the frequency and cost of claims. The Group uses\n\nboth its own experience and industry data to develop estimates of future claims and policy benefits, including information used in pricing insurance products and establishing the related actuarial liabilities. However, the claims experience may be higher than the assumptions used for pricing and establishing reserves. This risk mainly concerns products from the Death & Disability/ Cr\u00e9ditor/ Group Insurance and Property & Casualty businesses, which account for 15% and 16% of the Group's premium income in 2020, respectively. It is particularly important as obligations to clients are long, as is the case with creditor or long-term care insurance products. In 2020, creditor insurance premium income was \u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion and the Group had 163,000 clients insured for the risk of long-term care. Thus, if the Group's actual benefits paid to policyholders are greater than the assumptions on which the pricing was based and the provisions were  established,  the  Group's  operating  income  and  financial position may be materially affected.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is subject to risks specific to the death/uni00A0&/uni00A0disability, creditor and group insurance segments\n\nIn 2020, 15% of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's gross written premiums originated in the death & disability, creditor and group  insurance  segments.  These  segments  include  insurance products designed to protect against the financial consequences of a serious life event (death, hospitalization, serious injury, disability or long-term care needs), guarantee the repayment of a loan in the event of disability or unemployment and to provide additional health insurance services for employees. In these segments, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk that mortality rates will be higher than expected for policyholders with death coverage or the risk that policyholders with disability coverage will experience health needs that are in excess of those expected when the policies were written. In addition, the Group's life and health insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality and disease, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. If any such event occurs, or if the Group's assumptions related to mortality rates, life expectancies and other health-related factors used in pricing insurance policies prove incorrect, the Group's operating income could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's loss reserves for the property & casualty segment may prove to be inadequate\n\nAs of 31/uni00A0 December 2020, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's property & casualty segment accounted for 16% of the Group's gross written premiums. In accordance with industry practices and accounting  and  regulatory  requirements,  the  Group  establishes reserves for claims and claims expenses related to the Group's property and casualty business. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Group had \u20ac10.6/uni00A0billion of technical liabilities relating to non-life insurance business (\u20ac9.2/uni00A0 billion after reinsurance). The Group's net revenue after claims expenses is used to cover operational expenses. The\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the Group were required to increase its technical liabilities or were to incur greater losses than expected, its combined ratio would increase, and its operating income would decline. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent estimates, generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date. These reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Group's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. No assurance can be given that ultimate losses will not exceed the claims reserves and have a moderate negative effect on the Group's operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is subject to risks specific to catastrophic events, which by definition are unpredictable and can increase the volatility of the Group's operating income\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, particularly in its principal market  of  France,  which  represents  85%  of  its  2020  premium income. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks, military actions and core infrastructure failures. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes or man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life or property damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. In addition, changing climate conditions, primarily global warming, may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, and result in greater than expected losses. As of 31/uni00A0October 2020, the  Group's  subsidiary  Pacifica  managed  nearly  28,000  climate insurance  policies.  Although  the  Group  takes  efforts  to  limit  its exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not eliminate all risk and claims resulting from catastrophic events could therefore moderately affect the Group's operating income and increase its volatility. Recent examples of natural catastrophes that have led to an increase in claims in the Group's non-life insurance business include the Eleanor storm in January/uni00A02018 and the Ciara storm in February/uni00A02020, which had a moderate impact on the Group's operating income.\n\nIn addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of financial instruments the Group holds in its investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations. These events\n\nmay also affect the financial condition of the Group's reinsurers, thereby  increasing  the  probability  of  default  on  reinsurance recoveries. Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt the Group's business and the value of its investments or ability to write new business. It is possible that increases in the value of insurance policies, caused by the effects of inflation or other factors, and geographic concentration of insured lives or property, could increase the severity of claims the Group receives from future catastrophic events. Due to their nature, the Group cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of any such catastrophe, which could lead to increases in claims and modaretely adversely affect the Group's operating income.\n\n## Default of a reinsurer or increased reinsurance costs could adversely affect net income\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group reinsures with reinsurance companies to limit its risks. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on prevailing market conditions, in terms of price and available capacity, which may vary significantly. As of 31/uni00A0 December  2020,  reinsurers'  shares  of  liabilities  arising  from insurance and financial contracts amounted to \u20ac2.3/uni00A0billion.\n\nWhile the purpose of reinsurance agreements is to transfer a portion of  losses  and  related  expenses  to  other  insurers,  they  do  not eliminate the requirement for the Group, the direct insurer, to settle claims. In this regard, the Group is subject to the solvency risk of its reinsurers at the time that sums due must be recovered from them. Although the Group initially places its reinsurance with reinsurers that the Group believes to be financially stable, its assessment of their stability may be incorrect and the financial stability of a reinsurer may change adversely by the time recoveries are due. As of 31/uni00A0December 2020, net outstandings ceded to reinsurers (ceded reserves and current accounts with reinsurers net of cash deposits received, and excluding securities account pledges) amounted to \u20ac0.9/uni00A0 billion. Their breakdown by financial rating of reinsurers is as follows: 8% exposure to AA+ rated reinsurers, 20% exposure to AA rated reinsurers, 52% exposure to AA- rated reinsurers, 10% exposure to A+ rated reinsurers, 3% exposure to A rated reinsurers, 4% exposure to A- rated reinsurers and 2% exposure to unrated reinsurers. A reinsurer's failure to make payment under the terms of a significant reinsurance contract would have a moderate negative effect on the Group's businesses, financial condition and net income. In addition, after making large claims under reinsurance policies, the Group may have to pay substantial reinstatement premiums to continue reinsurance coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on overall current economic conditions and may vary considerably. In the future, the Group may be unable to obtain reinsurance at commercially  reasonable  prices,  thus  increasing  its  risk  of  loss due to lower levels of reinsurance, or its income statement could be adversely affected by the increased cost of reinsurance for its already-reinsured activities.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

In property and casualty, representing 16% of the Group's gross written premiums in 2020,\n\n## LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\n\n## The solvency capital ratios of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and its insurance subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by adverse capital market conditions, evolving regulatory interpretations and other factors\n\nUnder the Solvency/uni00A0 II Directive requirements, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group  is  required  to  maintain  eligible  own  funds sufficient to meet solvency capital requirements. To determine the solvency capital requirement, the regulations allow either a standard formula or an internal model approved by the regulator to be used.\n\nThe Group has chosen to use the standard formula and assumptions proposed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  (EIOPA).  Based  on  the  standard  formula  calculations (without  transitional  measures  other  than  the  grandfathering  of subordinated debts) the Group's Solvency/uni00A0 II solvency capital ratio ( i.e. , the ratio of Group's eligible own funds to its solvency capital requirement) was 227% at the end of 2020. At 31/uni00A0December 2020, the Group's minimum capital requirement coverage ratio ( i.e. the ratio of the Group's eligible own funds to its minimum capital requirement) was 420%.\n\nThe Group's solvency capital ratios are sensitive to capital market conditions (including the level of interest rates, the performance of equity markets and foreign exchange impacts) as well as a variety of  other  factors.  In  particular,  the  Group's  solvency  position  is affected by the prevailing negative interest rate environment both because it impacts investment returns and the Group's ability to meet minimum guaranteed returns and the guaranteed surrender value in Euro-denominated contracts. See risk factor 'Changes in interest rates, whether the continuation of a low (or negative) interest rate environment impacting operating income, or a sharp rise in interest rates that could impact the market value of investments, may affect the financial position of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group' above.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, a 50 basis point increase in prevailing interest rates would have increased the Solvency II capital ratio to 255%, whereas a 50 basis point decrease would have decreased it to 183%. As at the same date, a 25% decline in equity market prices would have decreased the Solvency II capital ratio to 215%, a 75 basis point increase in corporate borrowing spreads would have decreased the Solvency II capital ratio to 22 5% and a 75 basis point increase in sovereign borrowing spreads would have decreased the Solvency II capital ratio to 209%.\n\na sustained increase in inflation may result in (i)/uni00A0claims inflation ( i.e. an increase in the amount ultimately paid to settle claims several years after the policy coverage period or event giving rise to the claim), coupled with (ii)/uni00A0an underestimation of corresponding claims reserves at the time of establishment due to a failure to fully anticipate increased inflation and its effect on the amounts ultimately payable to  policyholders,  and,  consequently,  (iii)/uni00A0 actual  claims  payments significantly exceeding associated insurance reserves which would moderately  negatively  impact  the  Group's  operating  income.  In 2020, 97% of the Group's property and casualty insurance gross written premiums come from the French market. The rate of inflation in France in 2020 was 0.5%. A failure to accurately anticipate higher inflation and factor it into the Group's product pricing assumptions may  also  lead  to  underwriting  losses  which  would  moderately negatively impact the Group's operating income.\n\nInsurance regulators generally have broad discretion in interpreting, applying and enforcing their rules and regulations with respect to solvency and regulatory capital requirements and, during periods of extreme financial market turmoil of the type the market has experienced over the recent years, regulators may become more conservative  in  the  interpretation,  application  and  enforcement of  these  rules  which  may  involve  them,  for  example,  imposing increased reserving requirements for certain types of risks, greater liquidity requirements, higher discounts/'haircuts' on certain assets or asset classes, more conservative calculation methodologies or taking  other  similar  measures  which  may  significantly  increase regulatory capital requirements.\n\nIn the event of a failure by the Group and/or any of its insurance subsidiaries to meet the applicable regulatory capital requirements, insurance regulators have broad authority to require or take various regulatory  actions  including  limiting  or  prohibiting  the  issuance of  new  business,  prohibiting  payment  of  dividends,  and/or,  in extreme cases, putting a company into rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings. A failure of any of the Group's insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory capital requirements and/or a reduction in the level of their regulatory capital that may negatively impact their competitive position may also result in the Group deciding to inject significant amounts of new capital into its insurance subsidiaries which  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's  liquidity  position, operating income and financial position. Regulatory restrictions that inhibit the Group's ability to freely move excess capital among its subsidiaries or which otherwise restrict fungibility of the Group's capital resources may, depending on the nature and extent of the restrictions,  adversely  affect  the  capital  position  of  the  Group's operating insurance subsidiaries which may have a consequent negative impact on the Group and the perception of its financial strength.  Additional  regulatory  developments  regarding  solvency requirements, including further implementing measures under the Solvency/uni00A0 II Directive or changes resulting from further efforts by EIOPA to harmonize implementation of the Solvency/uni00A0 II Directive may lead to further changes in the insurance industry's solvency framework and prudential regime as well as associated costs. It is difficult to predict how the regulations resulting from such initiatives and proposals will affect the insurance industry generally or the Group's operating income, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory actions against the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group or an in insurer in the Group in the event of resolution could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group\n\nOn 28/uni00A0November 2017, the ordinance no 2017-1608 of 27/uni00A0November 2017  (the  'Ordinance')  establishing  a  resolution  framework  for insurers ( Ordonnance n\u00b0/uni00A02017-1608 du 27/uni00A0novembre 2017 relative \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9solution pour le secteur de l'assurance ) was published, setting out the French legal framework providing effective resolution strategies for French insurers. The Ordinance has entered into force.\n\nThe  Ordinance  is  designed  to  provide  the  French  supervision authority, i.e. the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR') with a credible set of tools to intervene in an institution failing or likely to fail (as defined in the Ordinance) so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimizing the impact of an institution's failure on the economy and financial system.\n\nUnder the Ordinance, powers are granted to the ACPR to implement resolution measures with respect to an institution and certain of its affiliates (each a 'Relevant Entity') in circumstances in which the resolution conditions are met - namely that the institution is failing or likely to fail.\n\nWhile the Ordinance does not include bail-in powers such as those applicable to credit institutions, it nonetheless provides the ACPR with resolution tools that could, if used, significantly impact the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group:\n\n- (i) bridge institution: enables the ACPR to transfer all or part of the business of the Relevant Entity to a 'bridge entity;\n- (ii) asset separation: enables the ACPR to transfer impaired or problem assets of the Relevant Entity to asset management vehicles to allow such assets to be managed and worked out over time; and\n- (iii) administrator (administrateur de r\u00e9solution): enables the ACPR to intervene in the corporate governance of the Relevant Entity.\n\nThe impact of the Ordinance on insurance institutions, is currently unclear but its current and future implementation and applicability to the Group or the taking of any action pursuant to it could significantly affect the activity and financial condition of the Group.\n\n## Changes in government policy, regulation or legislation in the countries in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group operates may affect the Group's profitability\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  is  subject  to  extensive regulation and supervision in the various jurisdictions in which its French and international insurance subsidiaries do business, which are mainly France, Italy and Luxembourg, but also other European countries and Japan. Applicable regulations relate to a range of matters,  including  licensing  and  examination,  rate  setting,  trade practices, policy reforms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, underwriting and claims practices, mandated participation in shared markets and guarantee funds, adequacy of the Group's claims provisions, capital and surplus requirements, insurer  solvency,  transactions  between  affiliates,  the  amount  of dividends that may be paid and underwriting standards.\n\nAs the amount and complexity of these regulations increase, so will the cost of compliance and the risk of non-compliance. If the Group does not meet regulatory or other requirements, the Group may suffer penalties including fines, suspension or cancellation of its insurance licenses which could adversely affect the Group's ability to do business. In particular, the Group is subject to the solvency and capital requirements of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive discussed in the risk factor 'The solvency capital ratios of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and its insurance subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by adverse capital market conditions, evolving regulatory interpretations and other factors' and could be placed into resolution by the ACPR per the Ordinance discussed in 'Regulatory actions against the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group or an in insurer in the Group in the event of resolution could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group' above if it is failing or likely to fail.\n\nA  lack  of  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Solvency/uni00A0 II Directive or any regulatory action against the Group could have material negative financial effects, cause reputational harm or harm the Group's business prospects.\n\nIn addition, the Group may be adversely affected by changes in government  policy  or  legislation  applying  to  companies  in  the insurance industry.\n\nThese  include  possible  changes  in  regulations  covering  selling practices  and  certain  classes  of  business,  regulations  covering policy terms and the imposition of new taxes and assessments or changes in the tax treatment of life insurance savings products and retirement savings plans. Regulatory changes may affect the Group's existing and future businesses by, for example, causing customers to cancel or not renew existing policies One recent example is the adoption of the Bourquin amendment to the Sapin/uni00A02 law in France in 2018 which led to the unbundling of mortgage loans and creditor insurance products. It is not possible to determine what changes in government policy or legislation will be adopted in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and, if so, what form they will take or in what jurisdictions they may occur. Insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than the Group's current requirements, may result in higher costs or limit the Group's growth or otherwise adversely affect the Group's operations.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

While no significant cyber security breach has affected the Group to date, the risk of unauthorized intrusions is increasing given the number of incidences of hacking globally. If the Group's information technology systems were compromised by a security breach, the Group could lose the ability to carry out functions that are essential for its activities particularly  in  the  savings  and  retirement  business,  including underwriting new insurance contracts, pricing policies, estimating technical liabilities and reserves, conducting relations with customers and implementing risk management activities with respect to its portfolio of financial investments. Moreover, given that the Group's insurance business requires it to obtain and process a large amount of clients' personal data (banking information, health information, etc.), the Group is subject to the risk that such data may become compromised or subject to unauthorized disclosure in the event of a cyber security breach. The occurrence of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business and operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group could/uni00A0incur significant sanctions if it fails to/uni00A0protect its customers' data\n\nWith the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the 'GDPR'), the data protection framework in the EU has been significantly modified  and  now  includes  new  restrictions  on  data  usage/ processing, disclosures to customers and a stronger enforcement regime.  As  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  insurance business  requires  it  to  obtain  and  process  a  large  amount  of personal data of its customers (including banking information, health information, etc.), the Group is particularly exposed to risks related to the protection of its customers' data. If the Group's policies and procedures fail to ensure that data collected by the Group and its third-party service providers is processed in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR or other data protection laws this could result in significant regulatory sanctions (including fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenues) or damage to the Group's reputation and may consequently have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business and operating income.\n\n## Failure to adequately manage the reputational risk of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group could have an adverse effect on its competitive position and business prospects\n\nConsidering the highly competitive environment in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  operates,  a  reputation  for  financial strength, solvency and transparency is critical to its ability to attract and retain customers and employees, access markets, maintain positive  interactions  with  regulatory  authorities  and  compete effectively. The Group's reputation could be harmed as a result of internal operational risks inherent to the business environment in which it operates, by the Group's response to external events affecting its operations, by adverse press coverage or other factors. Further, the Group's membership in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group increases the potential sources of reputational risk to the Group to the extent that any reputational harm to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or any entity within it may indirectly affect the reputation of its insurance business. Reputational risks may be further compounded by the increasing use of social media channels such as blogs, social networks, online commentaries  and  consumer  surveys,  through  which  damaging and potentially unfounded information may spread rapidly and any such reputational harm could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's competitive position and business prospects.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group faces strong competition in all of its business segments\n\nThere is substantial competition among  general  insurance companies in France and the other jurisdictions in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group does business, in particular in Italy and Luxembourg and some of the Group's competitors may benefit from greater financial and marketing resources or name recognition than the Group. In France, the Group is the largest life insurance provider (source: L'Argus de l'assurance , 3/uni00A0 July 2020, based on written premiums at the end of 2019), the fifth largest property and casualty insurer (source: L'Argus de l'assurance , 18/uni00A0December 2020, based on premiums at the end of 2019) and the second largest insurer providing  creditor  insurance  (source: L'Argus  de  l'assurance , 4/uni00A0September 2020, based on premiums at the end of 2019).\n\nThe Group's competitors include not only other insurance companies, but also mutual fund companies, asset management firms, private equity firms, hedge funds and commercial and investment banks, many of which are regulated differently than the Group is and may be able to offer alternative products and services or more competitive pricing  than  the  Group.  In  addition,  development  of  alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance and securities products, including through the internet, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. While the Group seeks to maintain premium rates at targeted levels, the effect of competitive market conditions may have a material adverse effect on the Group's market share and financial condition. These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of the Group's products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, which could harm the Group's ability to market certain products profitably.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## RISKS RELATED TO THE CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES GROUP'S RELATIONASHIP WITH THE CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE GROUP\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group relies on entities in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group to distribute its insurance products and perform a range of other important services\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  relies  primarily  on  the networks  of  banks  affiliated  with  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  to distribute its products. For the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2020, 94% of the Group's insurance products (as a percentage of total revenue) were distributed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's banking networks and group partnerships and only 6% was distributed through external partnerships. As a result, factors affecting the competitive position, reputation or credit quality of the banks in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group could have a very significant adverse effect on the Group's gross written premiums, reputation and operating income. Similarly, in countries where the Group distributes its products primarily through other partner banks, such as Japan, factors affecting the reputation, performance or credit quality of those banks could have an adverse impact on sales of the Group's products through those channels. In addition to the distribution of its products, the Group has also entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with members of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and other third-party service providers for certain other services required in connection with the day-today operation of the Group's insurance businesses. Deficiencies in the performance of outsourced services may expose the Group to substantial operational, financial and reputational risk. The Group's reliance on its affiliates to provide it with important services may give rise to conflicts of interest. Failure to manage these conflicts of interest appropriately could have a very significant adverse effect on the Group's reputation, gross written premiums or operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group may not realize the targets set out for the Group in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Group Project & 2022 Medium Term Plan\n\nOn 6/uni00A0 June 2019, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group announced its Group Project & 2022 Medium-Term Plan, which sets out specific targets for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  and  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's insurance business. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' individual targets and objectives, which are included within the framework of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's 2022 Medium-Term Plan, were also separately published  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  on  1/uni00A0 October  2019. The 2022 Medium-Term Plan was developed for internal planning purposes in order to develop the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's strategy and  to  allow  it  to  allocate  resources.  The  2022  Medium-Term Plan targets achieving significant revenue synergies by 2022, over\n\n\u20ac800/uni00A0 million of which is expected to come from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. With respect to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, the 2022 Medium-Term Plan outlines several key strategies, which include further developing its savings product line by taking advantage of new market opportunities provided by the  PACTE law   to increase its market share in France, increasing the penetration of its property &  casualty  products  among  customers  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Regional Banks and LCL and increasing its international business by developing the synergies with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. Among other objectives, the 2022 Medium-Term Plan targets Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances increasing life insurance outstandings by more than 13% (to \u20ac322/uni00A0billion by 2022, with unit-linked contracts representing 26% of life insurance outstandings), achieving 15% market share for new retirement savings in France (including individual and group retirement  policies),  increasing  written  premiums  in  death  and disability, creditor and group insurance by over 35% (to \u20ac5/uni00A0 billion by 2022) and written premiums in property and casualty insurance by over 31% (to \u20ac5.5/uni00A0billion by 2022). The 2022 Medium-Term Plan also targets increasing written premiums from international activity by over 20% (to \u20ac7.3/uni00A0billion by 2022), net banking income by over 3% (to \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion by 2022) and achieving a combined ratio (Pacifica scope) that is below 96% and a cost-income ratio of approximately 30%.\n\nThe plan is based on a number of assumptions, and therefore is by definition subject to uncertainty. While the 2022 Medium-Term Plan is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will turn out to be true. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances may fail to realize the targets described in the 2022 Medium-Term Plan for its business for several reasons, some of which (such as the global, European and French economic and financial  environment)  are  outside  the  control  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances. The 2022 Medium-Term Plan is subject to change and no obligation is undertaken to update or revise the information in the 2022 Medium-Term Plan as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThe plan's success depends on a very large number of initiatives (both significant and modest in scope) within different business units of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. While many of these could be successful, it is possible that not all targets will be met, which could materially impair the ability to achieve one or more of the objectives set forth in the 2022 Medium-Term Plan, and harm the Group's image on the markets depending on the level of achievement of these objectives and the circumstances that led to the failure to achieve certain objectives. The Medium-Term Plan also contemplates significant investments, but if the objectives of the plan are not met, the return on these investments will be less than expected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the end of 2020, the staff assigned to these functions for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group totalled 154/uni00A0FTE versus 133/uni00A0FTE at the end of 2019 (+15.8%), or 60 in the Permanent Control and Risk Management functions, 59 for Compliance Control and 35 in Periodic Control functions. Furthermore, in accordance with the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive applicable since 1/uni00A0January 2016, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group set up the Actuarial function at the level of the Group and its insurance subsidiaries; it totals 19 FTE at the end of 2020. Each of these four key functions (Risk Management,  Compliance,  Actuarial  function,  Internal  Audit)  is headed by a manager appointed by the Executive Management, approved by the Board of Directors and notified to the competent national supervisory authority.\n\nIt should be noted that the system implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is part of the framework of standards and principles set forth below and adapted and appropriately deployed across the various business lines and risks in order to best observe insurancerelated and, as the subsidiary of a credit institution, banking-related regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances satisfies the new regulatory requirements of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive (effective since 1/uni00A0January 2016) with its three pillars, thanks to its adaptation over several years of its organisation and procedures, as necessary. Further information on Solvency/uni00A0 II is given in the 'Solvency' section of Part 'Presentation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## INTERNA L CONTROL REFERENCE TEXTS\n\nInternal control standards are derived from the regulations applicable to insurance companies (Insurance Code in France and its equivalent in other countries where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances subsidiaries are based).\n\nIn addition, as a subsidiary of a banking group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is subject:\n\n- z to the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0511-41);\n- z to the Decree of 3/uni00A0 November 2014 on the internal control of banking, payment services and investment services firms subject to supervision by the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR);\n- z to  the  AMF  general  regulations  and  Basel  Committee recommendations on internal control, risk management and solvency.\n\nThese national and international external standards are supplemented by internal standards specific to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, as well as by procedures and standards specific to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries.\n\nWithin this context, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. issued procedural notes regarding the organisation of internal control and a body of rules and procedures relating, in particular, to accounting (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole chart of accounts), financial management, risk management and permanent controls. It also adopted, in 2004, a set of procedural notes to control its compliance with laws and regulations (in particular, in relation to financial security), which have been rolled out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  entities.  This  procedural  system  is regularly updated to take into account regulatory developments and changes in the internal control scope.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "An Operating Charter was signed by the main French subsidiaries and by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances S.A. holding company with the Risk Management and Permanent Control  function to be applied to international subsidiaries.\n\nThis Charter sets out:\n\n- z the scope covered by the Risk Management and Permanent Control function;\n- z the organisation of the Risk Management and Permanent Control function; how responsibilities are divided between the Group's Risks department (DRG) and operating entities' Risk Management and Permanent Controls Officers (RCPRs);\n\n- z the role of the Risk Management and Permanent Control function (aims, general organisation, risk management).\n\nThe operational framework of the Compliance and Periodic Control functions is similarly organised.\n\nFinally, in December/uni00A0 2015, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group adopted written policies as required under Solvency/uni00A0II. These were approved by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries in their respective areas. Among these policies, it should be noted that a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group risk management policy exists at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group level. This serves as a frame of reference for the organisation of the internal control system.\n\n- z information held by the Risk Management and Permanent Control function exchanged between the central DRG and the entities' RCPRs;\n\n## ORGANISATIONAL PRIN CIPLES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## Fundamental principles\n\nThe organisational principles and components of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance's internal control system, which are common to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, cover obligations with regard to:\n\n- z reporting to the decision-making body (risk strategies, risk limits and use of such limits, internal control activity and results);\n- z the direct involvement of the executive body in the organisation and operation of the internal control system;\n- z the comprehensive coverage of all business operations and risks, and accountability of all persons involved;\n- z the clear definition of tasks, effective segregation of the commitment and control functions, formal and up-to-date delegations of authority;\n- z formal, up-to-date standards and procedures, especially in the area of accounting.\n\nThese principles are supplemented by:\n\n- z risk  measurement,  monitoring  and  management  systems: financial risks (assets/liabilities, counterparty risk, liquidity risk, etc.), insurance business-related techniques, operational risks (transaction processing, IT processing), accounting risks (including the quality of financial and accounting information), non-compliance and legal risks;\n- z a control system, forming part of a dynamic and corrective process, encompassing permanent controls, which are carried out by the operating units themselves or by specific staff, and periodic controls (carried out by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Internal Audit department and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Control function).\n\nFurthermore,  across  the  various  business  lines,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances' objectives and strategy are taken into consideration when changes are made to Internal Control systems, particularly via the Risks and Internal Control Committees and NAP (new business and new products) Committees.\n\n## Oversight\n\n## Respective responsibilities of the business lines with control functions\n\nIn terms of banking regulation, three separate control functions ensure the consistency and effectiveness of the internal control system and compliance with the principles listed above over the entire scope of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances internal control. Their organisation is as follows on 31/uni00A0December 2020 :\n\n- z the Risk Management and Permanent Control Officers (RCPR) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has a hierarchical reporting line to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk department, and a functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Executive Management. The RCPRs in the French and foreign subsidiaries have a hierarchical reporting line to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Risk Management and Permanent Control department, and a functional reporting line to their Executive Management;\n- z Compliance Control falls within the scope of the enhanced compliance program of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The holding company Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Compliance Officer has a hierarchical reporting line to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Compliance department and a functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Executive Management. The compliance head in the subsidiaries have a hierarchical reporting line to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Compliance department and a functional reporting line to their Executive Management;\n- z the Permanent Control system ensures the integration of the control system in general, including non-compliance risks (mapping, local and consolidated control plan, action plans);\n- z Internal Audit operates as a third level of control throughout the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group. Its operation is governed by the internal audit policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, as approved by the Board of Directors, which establishes its independence from operational functions. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Audit director has a hierarchical reporting line to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Control and Audit function, and an functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFinally,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  set  up  the  Actuarial function, required under the Solvency/uni00A0II, at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and its insurance subsidiaries. On 31/uni00A0December 2020,  the  heads  of  the  Actuarial  function  for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries, have a hierarchical and a functional reporting lines to their Executive Management.\n\n## Consolidated and Internal Control\n\nIn accordance with the current Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group principles, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances internal control system has a broad scope of application for the supervision and control of activities and to measure and monitor risks on a consolidated basis.\n\nEach Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity applies this principle to its own subsidiaries such that the internal control system is rolled out according to a pyramid structure, thereby ensuring a consistent internal control system throughout the various Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities.\n\nIn this way, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances ensures that there is a satisfactory system operating within each subsidiary carrying risk, as well as the identification and consolidated monitoring of activities, risks and the quality of controls, particularly with regard to accounting and financial information.\n\n## Group Risk Management and Internal Control Committee\n\nThe Risk Management and Internal Control Committee of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group brings together the four key functions of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group within the meaning of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive. The tasks of these key functions are specified in the 'Solvency' section of Part 'Presentation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis Committee meets 10/uni00A0 times a year under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. It is composed of the members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Executive Committee (in particular the 3 executive directors and the heads of key functions), and representatives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s control business lines.\n\nThe purpose of this Committee is to reinforce cross-functional actions to be implemented within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group. Its role is to review common internal control issues and to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of internal Control and, in particular:\n\n- z to carry out progress reports on the work of the 4/uni00A0key functions;\n- z to validate the internal control system;\n- z to validate the draft Solvency/uni00A0II policies to be submitted to the Board of Directors for validation;\n- z to draw up an assessment of the control of financial, technical, operational and non-compliance risks;\n- z to validate and ensure the follow-up of the main associated action plans;\n- z to validate the Group's risk management strategy;\n- z to make decisions on remedial measures.\n\nIt incorporates the prerogatives of the Compliance Management Committee  within  the  scope  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances Group. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Data Protection Officer also reports on his activity and submits, if necessary, opinions for decision to the Committee.\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Compliance  D irector  acts  as the  secretary  of  the  Risk  Management  and  Internal  Control Committee and prepares the agenda in consultation with the other participants, supervises the drafting of the minutes and monitors the implementation of the decisions taken by the Committee.\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is informed of the organisation, operation and results of the internal control system. It is involved in understanding the main risks to which the company is exposed.\n\nOn this basis, it is regularly informed of the overall limits set as acceptable levels of such risks. It is also notified of levels of use of such limits.\n\nReports  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  and  risk management systems are submitted on a regular basis to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance bodies which are also informed of the main incidents identified.\n\nIn addition to the information that it receives on a regular basis, the Audit and Accounts Committee informs the Board of the main risks incurred by the company and of significant incidents picked up by internal control and risk management systems.\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the holding company's overall organisational  structure  and  its  internal  control  systems.  It  also approves the organisational structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group as well as that of its internal control system.\n\nIn addition, it is informed, at least twice a year, by the executive body and the heads of the three control functions, of internal control activities and results, either directly or via feedback given to the Audit and Accounts Committee. In accordance with the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, the heads of the four key functions have direct access to the Board of Directors, to which they present the results of their work at least once a year.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit and Accounts Committee reports to the Board on the Committee's work.\n\n## Role of the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nThis  Committee  is  responsible  for  verifying  the  clarity  of  the information  provided  and  of  assessing  the  appropriateness  of accounting methods used to prepare the consolidated and parent company financial statements as well as the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control system.\n\nAs such, it has broad communications powers in respect of all information relating to periodic control, permanent control, including accounting and financial control, and compliance control. Since the beginning of 2016, these communication powers were extended to the Actuarial function.\n\nAccordingly, it receives periodic reports on activity management systems and risk measurement.\n\nCommittee  meetings  also  include  an  update  on  internal  audit activities,  thereby  enabling  audits  to  be  monitored  as  well  as the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  made  by  national supervisory authorities, by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Control and Audit function and by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Internal Audit function.\n\n## Role of the executive body: Executive Management\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the two others executive directors appointed under the Solvency/uni00A0 II Directive are directly involved in the organisation and operation of the internal control system. They ensure that risk strategies and limits are compatible with the financial position (capital base, earnings) and strategic guidelines set by the decision-making body.\n\nThe Executive Management defines the general organisation of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and oversees its implementation by the relevant staff. In particular, it defines roles and responsibilities and allocates adequate resources to the Internal Control function.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group Risk Management department and functionally to the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. Head of a key function within the meaning of Solvency/uni00A0 II, the director in charge of  the  Risk  Management  function  is  responsible  for  the  overall supervision of the risks of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and, among other things, ensuring consistency and standardisation within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group. He/she is assisted by the Risk Management Officers at the different entities, who report to him/her on a hierarchical basis and have a fully operational role within the respective entities. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, both French and international subsidiaries are provided with the necessary means of managing the risks inherent in their specific business activities. Each subsidiary uses risk measurement, monitoring and control systems for all risks (market risks, including liquidity, counterparty, insurance and reinsurance technical risks, operational  risks,  compliance  and  legal  risks)  depending  on  its business activities and its organisation, and incorporates them into its internal control system.\n\nA description of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's risk exposure is presented in the 'Risk factors and risk management procedures Risk factors' section. Due to their savings and retirement activities, life insurance entities are, more specifically, exposed to market risks and risks associated with assets/liabilities management. Non-life insurance entities are mainly exposed to insurance and reinsurance technical risks.\n\nThe organisation and operation of the Insurance Risk business line is based on a matrix approach which takes into account, on the one hand, the supervision of all the Risks of each entity by its Head of Risk Management and, on the other hand, the management of major risks centrally at the holding company level. Financial risks are monitored by a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Financial Risks advisor, who operates across all entities to analyse financial risks (in an advisory capacity) and define a risk framework (proposal of a Financial Risk Strategy and associated risk policies). Other major risks are also managed according to a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group approach, with co-ordination and consolidation given direct impetus by the holding company (technical risks), or by sharing best  practices  for  harmonisation  purposes  (operational  risks). Monitoring and management of IT security and business continuity risks across Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group are also centralised in the holding company, under the aegis of the information systems Risk and business continuity plan Manager, and are separated from operational monitoring of those risks, which is under the aegis of the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), also centralised at the holding company level.\n\nTo carry out its strategic orientations, by containing and regulating its risks in a proper manner, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has implemented a risk appetite framework which has to be observed. This risk appetite framework, which forms the basis of the Risk Management Strategy, is declined in key indicators by nature of the risks.\n\nThe Risk management strategy implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group  is  based  on  the  overall  risk-management framework  and  the  limits  and  alert  thresholds  for  the  range  of different risks it is exposed to through the implementation of its business strategy.\n\nIt is reviewed and validated, as well as the risk appetite, at least annually, by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, after review by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management Committee (a sub-Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Executive Committee, chaired by its CEO) of the main indicators and limits. With regard to limits of their responsibilities, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management and Board of Directors or even the Group's Risk Management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is notified of any breaches of alert thresholds or limits and, when appropriate, the resulting corrective measures.\n\nThe  limits  system  includes,  particularly  for  market  risks,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  consolidated  limits,  set  in  reference to assets under management (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group total portfolio), on allocations in terms of assets classes and risk spreading (by class of rating, by counterparty, by sector, etc.). It is supplemented by alert limits and thresholds to manage Predica (the main life insurance company) assets/liabilities risks. In addition, the technical risks to which the main life insurance (Predica) and nonlife insurance entities (Pacifica, Caci) are exposed, are monitored by means of indicators measuring the ratio between claims and premiums, compared against an alert threshold defined by each of the companies. To control counterparty risk in reinsurance programs, the quality of the reinsurer is subject to a minimum rating criterion.\n\nEach entity adopts the limits and risk appetite framework of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group through a process co-ordinated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, taking into account the specificities of life insurance and non-life insurance companies. Furthermore, they have formal risk policies and procedures providing a strict framework for  risk  management:  rules  for  accepting  risk  when  insurance policies are taken out, hedging of technical risks by reinsurance (action thresholds), claims management, decisions based on formal analyses, authorisations, 'four-eyes' principle (second reading, two signatures) where justified by amounts or risk levels, rules governing management mandates granted to asset managers, etc.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nEach entity's risk measurement system is comprehensive. It covers all  categories  of  commitments  (on-  and  off-balance  sheet)  and positions, and consolidates commitments to companies belonging to the same group, by aggregating all portfolios and identifying risk levels.\n\nThese measurements are supplemented by regular assessments based on stress scenarios. In this regard, each year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries conduct the ORSA exercice, a multi annual  forward-looking  assessment  to  analyse  changes  in  their risk profile and solvency, including in negative cases. Prospective assessment  can  be  carried  out  more  often  if  necessary.  The measurement  methodologies  on  which  these  assessments  are based are documented and explained. They are subject to periodic review in order to check their relevance and adaptation to the risks incurred. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Insurance Models Committee, under the responsibility of the Group Risk function, validates the methodologies underpinning the models and indicators used to address major risks for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group or presenting cross-sector challenges for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\nEach entity controls the risks involved. This oversight takes the form of  permanent  monitoring  of  limits  exceeded  and  corresponding adjustments to return risk to normal levels and technical and price monitoring in relation to insurance policies, particularly for new or specialised business. In property and casualty insurance, matching the level of provisioning (corresponding to the commitment to pay out for claims made by policyholders) to the real cost of claims, is measured at regular intervals.\n\nOn  its  part,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  holding  company provides to the governance a comprehensive and consolidated view of the Insurance business risk by producing a Flash-risks dashboard including  quarterly  review  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group risks,  supplemented  by  monthly  risk  updates.  More  specifically, for financial risks, a monthly report makes it possible to ensure compliance with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group consolidated aggregate limits and to monitor consumption in relation to such limits. Bodies have also been set up to manage risks consistently at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group level: a bi-monthly meeting of the Risk Management Committee, a monthly meeting of the Financial Risks Committee, specialist portfolio reviews (equities, real estate, etc.), quarterly fixed-income portfolio reviews with both the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department and with the Amundi Cr\u00e9dit Risk teams, within the context of asset management services outsourced to Amundi.\n\nThe entities also have their own Risk scorecard. Any anomalies identified, any non-compliant accounting classifications as well as any instances where limits fail to be met, are reported to the entity's appropriate management levels, to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Risk Management and Permanent Control department, depending on the procedures laid down.\n\nIn this context, significant incidents, whose trigger thresholds for each type of risk identified are calibrated by the entities according to their size, are reported in accordance with the alert procedure.\n\nHave been validated by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances:\n\n- z thresholds for strategic indicators of solvency, results and value;\n- z thresholds for indicators relating to significant risks with a potential impact on strategic indicators (in particular, monitoring of interest rate risk, issuer risk and liquidity risk);\n- z thresholds  for  indicators  relating  to  operational  risks  and compliance;\n\nwhose  exceeding  leads  to  the  information  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances' Board of Directors.\n\nLastly, the internal operations and procedures control system aims at ensuring that the corrective measures decided upon are implemented within reasonable time limits. It also ensures that the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.  Group's  compensation  policy  and  the  associated  internal controls have been implemented, in accordance with the measures relating to the compensation of executive managers and risk-takers within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, as defined by the regulation.\n\nWith regard to liquidity risk, and in accordance with regulations, the entities have developed specially adapted approaches, with the aim of measuring their capacity to handle shock situations likely to affect their cash position both in relation to their liabilities (increase in non-life insurance benefits, large-scale redemptions of life insurance policies, etc.) and to their assets (occurrence of adverse market conditions).\n\n## Risks related to the effects of climate change\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  exposure  to  risks  related  to climate change consequences can be classified, according to the industry's drive, in physical risks and transition risks, knowing that induced liability risks (legal and reputation risks) are also likely to affect the G roup.\n\nIn line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's 'Corporate Social Responsibility' (CSR) approach and in accordance with a strategy presented to the Board of Directors, the CSR system is managed by the CSR manager within the Corporate Communication and CSR department, who reports directly to the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nDirect physical risks are, for instance, the destruction of goods caused by adverse climatic events such as hurricanes, floods or drought, the excess frequency of which can affect the technical results of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances property and casualty business and, besides, cause a decrease in the value of the investments affected by these risks. In its property and casualty insurance business, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is exposed, among other things, to catastrophe risk, particularly climate risk. The monitoring of this risk is integrated into the monitoring of technical insurance risks. Pacifica, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' property and casualty insurance subsidiary, has set up a system to monitor and follow-up these risks in order to contain exposure (quantification based on general scenarios simulations and monitoring of the climate burden compared to an annually revised budget, risk control by limiting the impact of extreme weather events through reinsurance, adjustment of pricing and modelling).\n\nIn  addition,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  offer  seeks  to promote  the  responsible  behaviour  of  its  customers,  with  rate reductions for drivers of hybrid or electric vehicles or coverage for renewable energy installations in the event of claims under multi-risk home insurance policies.\n\nMoreover, these physical risks can be source of interruptions of the cycle of production of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. In front of such a risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has set in place a business continuity plan as described in the section 'Internal control system for  the  security  of  information  systems  and  business  continuity plans'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These new risks are taken into account by the Investments Division of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances which integrates extra-financial criteria into the choice of issuers. Bond investments are subject to Amundi's 'Socially Responsible Investment' (SRI) filter. The issuers with the lowest ratings on these criteria are either excluded from investments or limited.

In addition, a policy to improve the energy performance of the real estate assets in the portfolio (materialized by obtaining a label) has been implemented. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group also participates in discussions within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and with other insurers on the contribution of financial investments to achieving the objectives of limiting global warming.\n\nThe impacts in terms of image and reputation could result from investments  in  activities in contradiction with environmental protection policies. The compliance function watches to protect the reputation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group including in its investments.\n\nThe measures taken by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to reduce the climatic risks by implementing a low-carbon strategy are developed in the section 'Economic, social and environmental Information'. The low-carbon strategy includes in particular the reduction of the direct carbon footprint linked to the operation of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group (energy consumption, transport, etc.).  Finally, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  adopted  a  Code  of  Conduct  that includes a section on social, environmental and societal issues.\n\n## Permanent control system\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances  permanent  control  system complies with the principle of subsidiarity defined by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Risk Management department. Each subsidiary has its own permanent control system which is based on a set of core operational and specialised controls carried out by dedicated agents exclusive to the subsidiary.\n\nWithin the entity's departments and services, procedures describe the processes to be implemented as well as related permanent operational controls. These particularly concern compliance with limits, risk strategy and authorisation regulations, the approval of operations and their correct outcome, etc.\n\nThe  system  has  now  been  put  into  use  worldwide,  although organisational  changes  or  new  activities  still  require  periodic adjustments or additions to be made to the system.\n\nWithin the context of the implementation of the decree of 3/uni00A0November 2014 on the internal control of companies in the banking sector, resources dedicated to last-line permanent control, independent of the operating units, working on the main categories of risk to which the entity is exposed, are grouped together under the authority of the Risk Management and Permanent Control Officer.\n\nWhere control points have not been incorporated into automatic processing systems (blocks on data entries, checks for consistency, etc.), these are defined with the aid of a risk map, which is updated on a yearly basis.\n\nThe results of the controls are made into formal check-lists and are the subject of summary reports for the attention of the Executive Management within the context, particularly, of the Risk Management\n\nand Internal Control Committees. The heads of the control functions also receive the main reports issued by the operating departments. Corrective plans of action are set up for any anomalies that these different methods detect.\n\n## Non-compliance risk control system\n\nThe aim of this system is to protect against risks of non-compliance with laws, regulations and internal standards and, in particular, to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, to  prevent  and  combat  fraud  and  corruption,  and  to  protect customers and personal data. Specific means of managing and monitoring operations were implemented: staff training, adoption of written internal rules, permanent compliance control, fulfilment of reporting obligations to supervisory authorities, etc.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's Compliance department is also in charge of regulatory projects. For example, the Compliance department supervised the deployment of GDPR (personal data protection), the corruption prevention part of the Sapin/uni00A02 law, and the OFAC remediation plan.\n\n## Internal control system for the security of/uni00A0information systems and business continuity plans\n\nThis system covers information systems and business continuity plans,  for  which  procedures  and  controls  aim  at  ensuring  a satisfactory level of security with regard to major risk scenarios (internal/external fraud, wide-scale virus attack, physical destruction of a production site, inaccessibility of a vital piece of software and its  backup,  etc.)  approved  by  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  security Committee.\n\nSecurity  levels  are  measured  every  six  months  and  tests  are carried out on a regular basis. Plans are drawn up to improve any weaknesses.\n\nActions have been taken to secure protection against cyber-attacks.\n\nThe  national  crisis  management  system  (in  which  the  entities participate via their designated crisis officers) is tested every three months.\n\nAn Insurance Group function continuity plan initiative, aiming at preventing 'compartmentalising' should one of its entities suffer damage, was introduced with cross-business line tests involving both French insurance subsidiaries, IT entities and the distribution network (Regional Banks and LCL). Emergency tests are usually carried out with an annual frequency by simulating alternatively a complete loss of each computer centers owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in the Centre region.\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group uses the Saint-Denis (93) site as a user fall-back site, which is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Eversafe pool of user fall-back sites, and tests it periodically.\n\nIt should be noted that, following the Covid-19 crisis, most of the business continuity plan exercises planned for 2020 had to be postponed to 2021.\n\nIndeed, the year 2020 was a particular year in which the IT back-up exercises were cancelled or postponed. The next IT back-up exercise organized in March/uni00A02021 will be entirely conducted remotely.\n\nThe traditional business continuity plan systems with the back-up user plan are to be rethought considering the crisis of the Covid-19, especially with the massive use of remote work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

It  bases  its  IT  standards and organisation on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group principles, which it adapts and supplements to meet the specific requirements of the insurance sector.\n\nEach  subsidiary  has  the  means  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the accounting  and  management  data  forwarded  to  the  holding company  for  consolidation  purposes.  Subsidiaries  must  comply with the following principles: compliance with current standards applicable in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, consistency of the consolidated  financial  statements  with  parent  company  financial statements approved by its decision-making body, reconciliation of accounting and management reporting figures.\n\n## Accounting Data\n\nEach Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group entity has responsibility, towards the supervisory authorities to which it reports, for its own financial statements, which are approved by its decision-making body. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances prepares its consolidated financial statements  in  accordance  with  current  accounting  standards apllicable in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, distributed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Accounting and Consolidation department.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses accounting and financial information systems which allow it to process data under satisfactory security conditions.\n\n## Management Data\n\nWhen  published  data  is  not  extracted  directly  from  accounting information, the sources and definition of the calculation methods used are generally referred to so as to make the data easier to understand.\n\nManagement data mainly comes from the Management Control function. It may also come from external sources of information (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  fran\u00e7aise  de  l'assurance, L'Argus  de  l'assurance ), particularly  for  the  information  relative  to  market  shares.  The management data used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is subject to accounting controls (particularly for data covered by the application of IFRS/uni00A07) to ensure that this information is accurately reconciled with accounting data, as well as compliance with management standards set by the executive body and the reliability of management data calculations.\n\nManagement  data  is  prepared  using  calculation  methods  and methodologies that ensure the comparability of figures over time.\n\n## Description of the permanent accounting, financial and prudential Information control system\n\nAn Accounting Control Charter has been formalised within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  Solutions  (Predica,  CACI,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances h olding). It describes the general organisation of the control system, the roles and responsibilities of those conducting the controls and the way in which results are fed back.\n\nThe  permanent  control  of  accounting  and  financial  information (second-scale  control,  second  level),  carried  out  by  the  Risk Management function, aims to provide an independent view of the accounting and financial information production system on the basis of a risk-based approach by:\n\n- z exploiting recurring reports on the results of business controls following the closing of the accounts;\n- z carrying out thematic missions on subjects presenting risks.\n\nThe checks focus in particular on:\n\n- z compliance of data with legal and regulatory requirements and with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group standards;\n- z reliability and fair representation of data, in order to give a true and fair view of the financial position of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and its consolidation scope;\n- z security of data preparation and processing procedures, to limit operational risks and respect publication deadlines;\n- z prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nA risk mapping of accounting processes has been set up using a  harmonised  methodology  thanks  to  joint  development  work between the business lines, the shared permanent control teams and the accounting audit. Accounting risks are integrated into the group's alert procedure.\n\nPermanent accounting and financial information control is based on risk assessment and accounting process controls realised by the operational services, namely:\n\n- z first-degree controls conducted by Operating departments, Back Offices (or, in some cases, by Key Outsourced Accounting Service Providers);\n- z second-degree controls, conducted by the accounting audit unit.\n\nOn this basis, the Permanent Controller defines a control plan and implements the necessary corrective actions, in order to strengthen, if  necessary,  the  system  for  the  preparation  and  processing  of accounting and financial information.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Solvency/uni00A0II since the 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02016, the permanent accounting and financial information control system was extended to the prudential information.\n\n## Relations with the Statuory Auditors\n\nIn accordance with current professional standards, the statutory auditors  perform  those  procedures  they  deem  appropriate  on published financial and accounting information:\n\n- z audit of the parent company and consolidated annual financial statements;\n- z partial audit of interim consolidated financial statements;\n- z overall review of financial information and materials published.\n\nAs part of their statutory duties, the statutory auditors submit the findings of their work to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Periodic control (Control and Audit/Audit)\n\nThe Periodic Control function or Internal Audit function, within the meaning of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, is responsible for third-degree controls throughout the consolidated scope of surveillance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, including Key Outsourced Service Providers, in accordance with the Decree of 3/uni00A0November 2014.\n\nPeriodic controls are carried out by a central team in France, the Insurance Audit department, which, on 17/uni00A0 September 2015, was awarded  Professional  Certification  for  Internal  Audit  activities (No./uni00A0IFACI/2015/0075r) by the French Institute of Audit and Internal Control. It is supported by three dedicated teams in subsidiaries in Italy, Poland (property and casualty insurance) and Japan. These controls are independent of the operating units. So as to guarantee its  independence,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Internal  Audit director reports hierarchically to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Control and Audit and functionally to the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. This dual reporting line falls within the operating logic of  the  Audit-Inspection  function  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  and  its subsidiaries.\n\nIn accordance with Solvency/uni00A0II requirements, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and the Boards of Directors of its insurance subsidiaries approved the appointment of a person responsible for the Internal Audit key function at the Group level and its subsidiaries. Then this appointment was approved by the competent national supervisory authority.\n\nThe annual audit plan was prepared using a risk-based approach. It is part of a five-year plan. It is based on a risk map updated on an annual basis. It was prepared by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Audit department in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Head of Control and Audit. It is presented to the Risk Management and Internal Control Committee and approved by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  Control  and  Audit  function  provides  a second-level audit of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, within the context of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group risk map (critical issues, parent company's systematic audit coverage over the main Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group subsidiaries).\n\nControls are in proportion to the nature and intensity of the risks to which all the activities and entities within the consolidated scope of surveillance are exposed, both in terms of their frequency and the resources allocated.\n\nThey are conducted using formal methodologies, in line with the annual plan. They aim at ensuring compliance with external and internal rules, risk management, reliability and completeness of the information and risk measurement systems. They focus, in particular, on permanent control and compliance control systems, as well as the activities of the Actuarial function.\n\nThe smooth running of the audit plan is monitored by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Control and Audit function and by the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. The Internal Audit director also systematically presents a summary of the findings of the published audits to the Risk Management and Internal Control Committee of the Group and its subsidiaries, as well as to the Audit Committees and, at least once a year, to the Boards of Directors.\n\nThe audits carried out by the Audit department, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Control and Audit function or any external audits (conducted by supervisory authorities) are monitored through a formal system. For every recommendation formulated as a result of these audits, this  process  ensures  the  effective  implementation  of  corrective measures, by deadlines agreed with the entity's management at the end of the audit. If necessary, the H ead of the Audit department will submit a statutory disclosure to the decision-making body as a result of this process.\n\nIn accordance with the organisational procedures common to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities and described above, and with existing systems and procedures at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, the Board of Directors, the Executive Management and the relevant parts of the company are provided with detailed information on internal control and exposure to risks, areas of improvement achieved in this area and the status of any corrective measures adopted, as part of a continuous improvement approach. All this information is provided particularly  by  means  of  the  Annual  Report  on  internal  control and risk measurement and monitoring and regular reporting on operations, risks and control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is also subject to insurance risks. Finally, it may be impacted by operational risks, in particular in the execution of its processes, noncompliance risks and legal risks.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND ORGANISATION  OF RISK MANAGEMENT WITHIN CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES\n\nThe risk governance system in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is based on the following principles:\n\n- z it is part of the control system, which includes the 'Risks and Permanent Control' business line, in charge of steering (supervision, prevention) and second-level control, the 'Internal Audit' business line, in charge of periodic control, and the 'Compliance' business line at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. level. In addition to these functions, the Actuarial function at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances level completes this system, in accordance with insurance company regulations;\n- z it is headed up by the Risk Management function of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, which manages the 'Risks' business line, supervises the frameworks, and ensures, through Group standards and principles, the consistency of subsidiaries' risk management systems, supported by experts for each major risk category;\n- z it is based on the principle of subsidiarity. Each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group  entity  is  responsible  for  defining  and implementing its solo risk management policy, in accordance with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. principles and rules, the principles and rules for the management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, and local regulations for international subsidiaries.\n\nRisk governance is based on:\n\n- z the executive management, composed of the Chief Executive Officer and the second executive directors within the meaning of Solvency/uni00A0 II, and the Board of Directors, ultimately responsible for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's compliance with legal and regulatory provisions of all kinds;\n- z the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, strategic body of the Executive Board, which relies on group-level Committees (in particular the Risk and Internal Control Committee, the plan, budget, results, Strategic Financial Committee, the Strategic ALM and Investments Committee, the Strategic Reinsurance Committee);\n- z the four key functions (Risk, Compliance, the Actuarial function and Internal audit). Each of them is embodied by a representative who has been appointed by the CEO, approved by the Board of Directors and notified to the competent national supervisory authority. The coordination of the four key functions is ensured by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group Risks and Internal Control Committee. The heads of the key functions have a direct access to the Board of Directors to whom they introduce the results of their activity at least once a year;\n\n- z an internal control system, defined as the framework designed to manage and control all types of operations and risks and to ensure that all transactions are carried out in a manner that is proper (in compliance with regulations), secure and effective. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances risks policies are validated by the Board of Directors;\n- z the internal process for evaluating Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's solvency and risks (ORSA), synchronised with other strategic processes MTP/Budget, Capital planning and the updating of risk strategy and business policies. The forward-looking assessments, carried out within this framework, allow to analyse the consequences of adverse situations on the control indicators of the Group and take the necessary measures in case of need.\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe risks management framework of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is monitored by the Manager in charge of the Risk Management function, who reports functionally to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' CEO and hierarchically to the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. He relies on the Risks Manager of each local entity who report directly to him. Insurance risk is organised along the lines of a matrix structure integrating entity level organisation with group approaches by type of risks.\n\nThe hierarchical reporting line guarantees independence, with a 'second glance' role (to issue an opinion) to back the operating functions, which manage risks on a daily basis, make decisions and exercise first-level controls to ensure their processes are performed properly.\n\n## Risk management procedures\n\n## At Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group level\n\nTo carry out its strategic orientations, by containing and regulating its risks in a proper manner, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has implemented a risk appetite which has to be observed. This risk appetite, which forms the basis of the Risk Management Strategy, consists of key indicators by nature of risks.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's Risk strategy formalizes the risk management framework, including limits and alert thresholds, for the various risks to which it is exposed in implementing its strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group Risk Management Committee (a sub-Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Executive Committee, chaired by its CEO) of the main indicators and limits. With regard to limits of their responsibilities, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management and Board of Directors or even the Risks Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group is notified of any breaches of alert thresholds or limits and, when appropriate, the resulting corrective measures.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's quarterly risk dashboard, supplemented by monthly risk reporting, monitors changes in the group's risk profile and identifies any deviations.\n\nThe Board of Directors is regularly informed about monitoring of compliance with the appetence framework.\n\nDedicated bodies ensure consistent risk management at group level: a bimonthly Risk Monitoring Committee, a monthly Financial Risk Committee, portfolio reviews by type of assets, with news items presented monthly to the Executive Committee.\n\nMoreover,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  set  up  a  group-wide Insurance Models Committee, steered by the Group Risk function. The  role  of  the  Insurance  Models  Committee  is  to  approve  the methodologies  underpinning  the  models  and  indicators  used  to address major risks for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group or presenting cross-sector challenges for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\n## MARKET RISKS\n\nIn view of the predominance of savings acti vities in the French and international (Italy mainly) life insurance subsidiaries and, as a consequence, the very large volume of financial assets held to cover policyholder liabilities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is particularly affected by market risks.\n\nThe market risk is the risk of loss, arising from fluctuations relative to the prices of financial instruments, which compose a portfolio.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is exposed to several types of market risks:\n\n- z interest rate risk;\n- z equity risk;\n- z foreign exchange risk;\n- z risk of spread which is detailed in a specific section.\n\nIn particular, these risks have an impact on the valuation of portfolio assets and their long term yield, and must be managed closely with matching of liabilities and, particularly in life Insurance, guarantees granted to policyholders (minimum guaranteed rate, floor guarantee, etc.).\n\n## At the entity level\n\nIn accordance with the Group framework, companies define their own risk monitoring and control systems: risk and process mapping, adaptation  of  the  risk  appetite  matrix  and,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances Group limits in accordance with a process coordinated by the holding, taking into account, if necessary, the life and non-life companies' features.\n\nThe entities also draw up formal policies and procedures providing a strict framework for risk management (including the rules for accepting risk when insurance policies are taken out, provisioning and hedging of technical risks by reinsurance, claims management, etc.).\n\nFor  its  international  subsidiaries,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has drawn up a set of standards to be transposed by each entity, which set out the scope and rules for decentralised decision-making.\n\nOperational risk management is supervised in each entity by Committees that meet periodically (investment, ALM, technical, reinsurance, etc.) to monitor developments in the risk position, based on reporting by business lines, to present analyses to support the risk management process, and, if necessary, to draw up proposals for action. Alerts are triggered if main incidents (and breaches of limits) occurred and notified either to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department (for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group limits), or to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management/the entity's management. Corrective measures are implemented in response.\n\nThe risk management system is reviewed during the Risk and Internal Control Committees of each subsidiary, in the light of the results of ongoing controls, the analysis of their risk management dashboards and the conclusions of periodic control missions.\n\nRisk is monitored specifically.\n\nHence, the financial policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group includes an ALM supervision aimed at reconciling the objectives of  conserving  ALM  balances,  delivering  shareholder  value,  and seeking yield for policyholders. This supervision is based on 'risk/ yield' analyses and 'stress scenarios', to identify the characteristics of the amounts to invest, the requirements and objectives over short/ medium and long term horizons, and a market analysis, supported by economic scenarios, to identify opportunities and limitations in terms of the environment and the markets.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Investments department contributes to monitoring the investment policies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and of the subsidiaries (taking into account individual ALM requirements and financial objectives), which are submitted to their respective Boards for approval. As such, it is responsible for oversight of  the  investment  management  services  provided  by  Amundi (management mandates granted by the companies). Moreover, it makes investments directly (without a mandate) on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group companies (in real estate in particular), as part of the policy of diversification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Management  of  this  risk  requires  an  overarching approach combining financial strategy, constitution of reserves, sales and income policies. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' framework for managing interest rate risk sets out the limits on risks and the related governance (ALM Committee, presentation of stress scenarios to the Board of Directors, etc.).\n\nA context of low interest rates weighs on the profitability of the life-insurance activity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances: it leads to a situation where the yield on the securities entering the portfolio is lower than the rates served on life insurance policies. Risks related to the minimum guaranteed returns in France are handled at regulatory level by means of prudential provisions.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has a range of levers to tackle the risk of falling rates:\n\n- z no issue of policies that feature a minimum guaranteed rate greater than zero (since 2000 for the main French life insurance company), so that the average minimum guaranteed rate has consistently reduced;\n- z moderation of profit sharing distributed;\n- z hedges using bond assets and swaps/swaptions to manage reinvestment risk;\n- z adaptation to the very low rates environment of the assets/liabilities management and of the investments policies;\n- z prudent diversification of investment assets;\n- z adaptation of the sales policy, favoring inflows towards unit-linked policies.\n\nA risk arising from an increase in interest rates may materialise if a mismatch arises between the return rate delivered by the insurer (related to bond yields) and the rate expected by policyholders in a high-rate environment, or the rate achieved by other savings vehicles.\n\nIt can lead to a wave of early redemptions by policyholders, forcing the insurer to sell assets, notably bonds, with unrealised  losses (which would generate losses) and reducing the portfolio's rate of return, with the risk of triggering new waves of policy redemptions.\n\nThus, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances implements measures to manage the risk of a rate rise:\n\n- z adjustment of duration according to projected outflows of liabilities;\n- z retention of liquidities or liquid investments with a low risk of loss;\n- z dynamic management of the investment portfolio and setting aside reserves to provide the capacity to increase the return (capitalisation reserve, and profit-sharing provision);\n- z derivative products against a rise in rates;\n- z building customer loyalty to limit early redemptions.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's dashboard, submitted to the Executive Committee, includes indications in order to monitor the nature of this risk: average minimum guaranteed rate, coverage rate of bond portfolio, allocation to reserve funds\u2026\n\n## Analysis of sensitivity to rate risk\n\n## Technical liabilities\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's technical liabilities are largely insensitive to rate risks for the following reasons:\n\n- z savings provisions (over 90% of technical provisions, excluding unitlinked policies): these technical provisions are based on the pricing rate, which is unchanging over time for any particular policy. As a result, a change in interest rates will have no impact on the value of these commitments;\n- z property & casualty provisions: these technical provisions are not discounted to present value, changes in interest rate therefore have no impact on the value of these commitments;\n- z mathematical provisions for benefits (personal injury, disability): the discount rate used in calculating these reserves is based on the interest rate in force at the calculation date. Therefore, the size of these commitments varies with interest rates. However, given the small amount of these technical commitments, they represent no significant risk for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus it does not integrate the impact over time on yield and insurance revenue of any variation in interest rates.\n\nThe  impacts  presented  above  take  the  following  elements  into account:\n\n- z the profit-sharing rate for the entity holding the financial investments;\n- z the tax rate in force.\n\nThe impacts resulting from investments recognised  as assets at fair value through equity are presented in the 'Impact on equity' column. The impacts resulting from investments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the 'Impact on net income' column.\n\nAs a reminder, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses the overlay approach for financial assets held for the purposes of an activity related to\n\ninsurance contracts, which are designated in accordance with the option offered by the amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 accounting standard (this approach is presented in the note/uni00A01 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe  impact  resulting  from  sensitivities  on  designated  assets  is presented in the 'Impact on equity' column.\n\n## Financing debts\n\nBorrowings arranged by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances mainly pay fixed rates. Interest is therefore largely insensitive to rate changes.\n\n## EQ UITY RISK AND RISKS KNOWN AS DIVERSIFICATION ASSET RISK\n\n## Type of exposure and risk management\n\nExposure to the equity markets and other so-called diversification assets  (private  equity  and  listed  or  unlisted  infrastructures,  real estate and alternative management) is intended to capture yield in these markets (notably with a low correlation between real estate and other asset classes). The market risk relative to shares and other diversification assets is defined as a risk of volatility in terms of valuation and, therefore, of accounting provisioning that may have an impact on the return provided to policyholders (provision for lasting impairment, provision for liquidity risk). To limit this effect, particularly for the life insurance portfolios, allocations are analysed to determine a ceiling for the share of these diversification assets and a maximum volatility level.\n\nEquities  and  other  diversification  assets  are  held  directly  or via dedicated  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  UCITS  to  provide regional diversification, in accordance with the relevant risk policies. Exposure to these assets is managed by a series of limits (by asset class and overall for the diversification) and concentration rules.\n\nCompliance with these limits is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\nThe main asset classes comprising the overall portfolio are presented in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances Group: in note/uni00A06.4 to the financial statements, the fair value amounts of assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss and equity are specified. The fair value of assets carried at amortised cost is detailed in note/uni00A06.5.1.\n\n## Analysis of sensitivity to equity risk\n\nA quantified assessment of equity risk can be expressed by the sensitivity achieved assuming a 10% rise or decline in equity markets (impacts are shown net of deferred policyholder surplus and tax):\n\n|                               | 31/12/2020            | 31/12/2020        | 31/12/2019            | 31/12/2019        |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions)               | Impact on net  income | Impact  on equity | Impact on net  income | Impact  on equity |\n| 10% rise in equity markets    | 123                   | 151               | 115                   | 174               |\n| 10% decline in equity markets | (127)                 | (151)             | (118)                 | (174)             |\n\nThe  impacts  presented  above  take  the  following  elements  into account:\n\n- z the profit-sharing rate for the entity holding the financial investments;\n- z the tax rate in force.\n\nThese  sensitivity  measurements  include  the  impact  of  changes in the benchmark equity index on assets measured at fair value, provisions for guaranteed minimum return and provisions for the right to withdraw from unit-linked policies as well as any additional impairment provisions required by a decline in equity markets.\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regarding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, this risk is very marginal as shown by the sensitivity to foreign exchange risks,\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses the overlay approach for financial assets held for the purposes of an activity related to insurance contracts, which are designated in accordance with the option offered by the amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 accounting standard (this approach is presented in the note/uni00A01 to the consolidated financial statements).

However, to achieve the aim of optimising\n\n## LIQUI DITY RISK\n\n## Type of exposure and risk management\n\nRegarding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, the liquidity risk corresponds mainly to its ability to meet its current liabilities.\n\nWith this purpose, the companies use a combination of approaches.\n\nOn  the  one  hand,  liquidity  is  an  investment  selection  criterion (majority of securities listed on regulated markets, limits on assets in markets that lack depth, such as private equity, unrated bonds, and alternative management, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, systems for managing liquidity are consistent across Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, and are defined by the companies as part of their ALM policy:\n\n- z for life insurance companies, these systems are intended to ensure a match between the maturities of assets and those of liabilities under normal and stressed conditions (wave of redemptions//uni00A0deaths, see below the liquidity monitoring indicator). They aim to ensure liquidity in the long term (monitoring and limiting of annual cash run-\n\nrisk/return and search diversification, the Group seeks to profit from projected gaps in growth and interest rate differentials between major regions, through dedicated funds or mandates relatives to investments in fixed incorme products. The general strategy is not to hedge exposure to the currencies of emerging economies, regardless of the asset class, and, in contrast, to hedge exposure to the currencies of mature countries, with the option of limited tactical exposure to the American dollar. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's overall foreign exchange exposure is bound by a maximum market value limit relative to the total portfolio, and two sub-limits for emerging currencies and the Amercan dollar.\n\nThe effective exposure, measured monthly, is compared to the limits. At the end of 2020, it was not material (0.5% of the total portfolio).\n\noff gaps), medium term (so-called 'reactivity' ratio detailed below), and, in case of uncertainty regarding net inflows, short term (oneweek and one-month liquidity, with daily monitoring of redemptions). In exceptional circumstances where markets are unavailable, temporary liquidity management approaches also exist (repos with collateral in cash or European Central Bank eligible assets);\n\n- z for non-life insurance companies, liquidities or assets that have low reactivity are retained, and the share is calculated to respond to a shock to liabilities.\n\nThe 'reactivity' ratio measures the ability to mobilise current assets of less than two years or variable-rate assets by limiting the impacts in terms of capital loss; it is measured and compared against a threshold set by each life insurance company.\n\nThe liquidity monitoring indicator, introduced in 2018, measures over a one-year period the ratio between stressed liquid assets (appreciation of a discount) and a liquidity requirement generated by a 40% buyback rate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This risk is reflected for debt securities by the decrease of their value.\n\nThis section only deals with counterparty risk on financial instruments. Exposure to counterparty risk on reinsurers' receivables is covered in the section on insurance risk.\n\nAmundi's  risk  management  teams  perform  the  analysis  of counterparty  risk  for  issuers  and  for  OTC  market  transactions (derivatives) under the mandates granted to them by the insurance companies.\n\nCounterparty risk is controlled, both at the global level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group and at the level of each entity's portfolios, through limits on ratings, issuer and sector concentrations.\n\n## Financing\n\nAs a holding company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is responsible for  subsidiary  refinancing  enabling  them  to  meet  their  solvency requirements and operational cash needs. It is refinanced through its shareholder Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., and, since 2014, through issuing subordinated debt directly in the market.\n\nThe structure of its borrowings and their breakdown by maturity is set out in note/uni00A0 6.21 to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' consolidated financial statements.\n\nHence, aggregate limits are placed to manage the breakdown of issues between rating classes. The rating used is the so-called 'Solvency/uni00A0 II' rating corresponding to the second best of the three ratings Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. The proportion of 'high yield' issues held directly or through funds is strictly limited and only minimum BB issues are authorised for purchase in mandates. Issuers not rated by an external agency but with an internal rating from  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  are  selected  according  to  a  rigorous process and represent a limited proportion (approximately 2.4% of the portfolio at the end of December/uni00A02020).\n\nThe breakdown of the bond portfolio by credit rating is a good indication of its creditworthiness.\n\nThe bond portfolio (excluding unit-linked policies and UCITS) by credit rating breaks down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConcentration in a single issuer (equities and interest rate instruments) may not exceed a given percentage of the total portfolio, which is determined according to issuer type and quality.

The debt of Greek issuers remains prohibited for purchase.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9   dit Agricole Assurances Group is exposed to insurance risk through the insurance business. Such risk primarily relates to the underwriting, valuation of provisions and reinsurance processes.\n\nEach entity implements an approach in collaboration with all the operating departments concerned, as well as Risks, Compliance, the Actuarial function and Legal Affairs, to manage risks when new insurance products are created or substantial changes are made to the features or an existing product. Products are approved by an ad hoc Committee (New Business and New Product Committee).\n\n## Underwriting risk\n\nUnderwriting risk takes different forms depending on the nature of the insurance, life or non-life:\n\n## Life insurance underwriting risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  exposed,  through  its  savings, retirement and provident insurance activities and the life guarantees associated with its borrowers' insurance policies, to biometric risks (longevity, mortality, incapacity to work, dependency and disability), loading risk (insufficient loading to cover operating expenses and commissions  paid  to  distributors)  but  above  all  the  behavioural risk of repurchases (for example, following an increase in rates that reduces the competitiveness of certain investments or a movement of mistrust against the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or a legal change such as the Bourquin amendment to the Sapin/uni00A02 law).\n\nLife insurance technical reserves, recognised in the main by French companies, are chiefly constituted from savings denominated in Euro or unit-linked contracts. For the majority of unit-linked contracts, the risk of fluctuation in the value of the underlying is borne directly by the policyholder. Some contracts may include a floor guarantee in the event of the death of the insured. The insurer is thus exposed to a financial risk determined by the value of the unit-linked account and the probability of death of the insured. A technical provision is recognised for this floor guarantee.\n\nIn savings, redemption rates are monitored for each life insurance company  and  compared  with  the  structural  redemption  rates established on the basis of historic and market data.\n\nFor the death and disability activity, the creditor insurance and yields, the underwriting policy, which specifies the risks covered and the underwriting conditions (target customers, exclusions), and pricing standards  (notably  the  statistical  tables  established  either  from national or international statistics or from experience tables) help to control risk in this area.\n\n'Disaster' risk, related to a mortality shock ( e.g. a pandemic) is liable to have an impact on the results for individual or group death and disability insurance. The French life insurance subsidiary receives BCAC  coverage  (Bureau  Commun  des  Assurances  Collectives), both on group death benefits and individual death and disability benefits, as well as, in part, supplementary coverage of disability risk.\n\nCash collateral contracts are used to manage counterparty risk for over-the-counter derivatives used by companies to hedge exposure to rate risk and presented on their balance sheets.\n\n## Non-life insurance underwriting risk\n\nFor property & casualty insurance and non-life guarantees included in creditor insurance policies, the underwriting risk can be defined as the risk that the earned premiums are not sufficient compared to the claims outstanding. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is mainly exposed to frequency and exceptional risk arising either from disaster risk, mainly climate risk, or the occurrence of expensive individual claims.\n\nFor distribution partners, underwriting policy defines the framework for accepting risk (to ensure appropriate selection of risks and the spread within the policy portfolio to optimize technical margins). Formal rules and procedures for pricing are also drawn up.\n\nThe ratio of claims paid to premiums earned is compared against targets reviewed annually. This claims ratio is the key indicator for monitoring risk and is used to identify priorities for improving the technical result, where necessary.\n\nConcentration risk in non-life insurance relates to an aggregation of liabilities in respect of a single claim, arising from:\n\n- z underwriting concentration, in which policies are written by one or more Group entities on the same risk;\n- z claim concentration, where policies are written by one or more Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group entities on risks that are different, but liable to be triggered by a single covered event or the same primary cause.\n\nThis type of risk is hedged, first, by a policy of diversifying the risks written in a single region and, second, by reinsurance to limit the  financial  impact  of  major  events  (storms,  natural  disasters, etc.), under a reinsurance policy (see reinsurance risk below) that incorporates this dimension.\n\n## Provisioning risk\n\nProvisioning risk is the risk of a gap between the provisions set aside and those required to meet liabilities. It may be related to risk valuation (volatility introduced by discount rates, regulatory developments, or new risks for which statistical depth is inadequate, etc.) or to a change in risk factors (population ageing, for example, leading to increased long-term care risks or health issues, stricter laws governing professional civil liability, personal injury compensation, etc.).\n\nThe objective of the provisioning policy established in each of the companies is to guarantee a prudent assessment of loadings for past and projected claims to ensure a high probability that the accounting provisions set aside will be sufficient to cover the ultimate load.\n\nThe methods used to constitute provisions for property and casualty claims, on a case-by-case basis according to the products and guarantees affected, are documented and the management rules applied by claims managers are set out in the manuals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  risks  are identified in the operational risk mapping of each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group entity.\n\nIn  each  entity,  the  Head  of  Compliance  is  responsible  for  the Group  procedures  issued  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s  Compliance department (Corpus FIDES) and for drawing up procedures specific to their business. It also deploys dedicated training and control systems  aimed  at  controlling  these  risks  and  preventing  fraud, with the constant aim of limiting potential impacts (financial losses, legal, administrative or disciplinary sanctions) while preserving the reputation  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group.  In  this  regard,\n\n## LEGAL RISKS\n\nResponsibility  for  legal  management,  regulatory  intelligence  and consulting with business line departments lies with the companies' Legal Affairs departments.\n\nTo date, there is no governmental, judiciary or arbitration proceeding (or any proceeding known by the company, in abeyance or that\n\n- z a process of collecting data on risk-related incidents and operating losses, backed by an early-warning system, is used to monitor identified risks and exploit them to introduce remediation measures and ensure consistency with mapping.

Group standards, with the adoption of the Group's solution for the user fallback site, the IT back-up plan based on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shared IT operating and production site. It is tested on a regular basis. IT system security is an inherent component of the Group's security policies.

Coordination for the Insurance business line is carried out through exchanges with subsidiaries.\n\nIn all areas of compliance, from the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism to protecting customers, the Group has strengthened coordination with distributors (Regional Banks, LCL, other  international  networks)  to  ensure  implementation  of  the controls to guarantee correct application of procedures by all parties.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has enhanced its organisation and its risk management system to be Solvency/uni00A0II compliant, after modalities pr\u00e9cised in the section 'Corporate governance'.\n\nthreatens it) that could have or has had, in the previous 12/uni00A0months, any substantial effect on the financial situation or the profitability of the company and/or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\nAs far as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is aware, there are no significant disputes to disclose.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The situation remains varied depending on the currency and the asset class. At this stage, a more significant increase in trading volumes has been seen on the derivatives markets, in particular with the use of SONIA. Meanwhile, \u20acSTR market liquidity is less developed.\n\nFor  the  majority  of  existing  contracts  benchmarked  against  the interest rates to be replaced, it is now believed that the replacement rates will be the combination of long-term rates (pre-determined or post-determined) calculated on the basis of RFRs and an adjustment spread, which aims to ensure economic equivalence with the rate being replaced. Despite this powerful direction, at this stage, the\n\nadoption of RFRs and the limited number of contracts renegotiated in order to update fallback clauses or proactively replace the benchmark rate reflect differing levels of maturity in the detailed definition of the means of transition - including conventions - depending on the currency and the asset class. Changes to IT systems, which depend on precise definitions of the target replacement rates in order to be finalised, are still being made.\n\nThe private sector is first in line for these transitions. However, recent announcements suggest that the authorities may intervene in order to support transitions for contract scopes that could not be renegotiated in time, whether this concerns replacing the benchmark rate in anticipation of rates disappearing, or inserting robust fallback clauses  allowing  for  transition  to  the  disappearance  of  rates. Nevertheless, in the absence of an ex-ante definition of the contract",

        "page_content": "scopes that could benefit from this kind of support, transition plans are still being prepared. Furthermore, proactive early transitions are still strongly encouraged by certain authorities such as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nSpecifically for the scope of derivatives contracts and, by extension, repo and securities lending/borrowing contracts, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has finalised the adoption of a protocol that will automatically include the new fallback clauses in the contract. This protocol is intended to simplify the transition of derivative contracts between the parties concerned. There is no such system for other non-derivative instruments and numerous bilateral negotiations are required.\n\nWith its Benchmarks project, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is continuing to steer transitions to alternative benchmark rates factoring in the recommendations of national working groups and milestones set by the authorities, initially the FCA. The project therefore aims to comply with the standards defined by the work being done. The transition timetable is based on adoption phases and alternative rates and the dates for when use of the indices due to disappear formally ends. The finalised transition plans for each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity, factoring in the most recent conclusions of the relevant working parties  and  associations  and,  if  applicable,  recommendations relating to possible interventions by the authorities, will be activated in 2021.\n\nWork has begun on the transition from EONIA to \u20acSTR (no later than 3/uni00A0January 2022). Clearing houses have changed the interest rate paid on collateral from EONIA to \u20acSTR. Cash flows benchmarked against \u20acSTR are only increasing very gradually. Furthermore, EURIBOR - like any benchmark rate - could see its methodology change or eventually be replaced. However, the scenario of EURIBOR being replaced in the short term in accordance with a schedule similar to the one for LIBOR transitions is not envisaged at this stage.\n\nAs things currently stand, the list of the main benchmark rates at the level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and/or defined as critical by the ESMA for which there will be a definite or potential transition remains unchanged:\n\n- z EONIA, which will disappear on 3/uni00A0January 2022;\n- z LIBOR (USD, GBP, CHF, JPY and EUR), which could end in late 2021 but no official announcement has been made as yet;\n- z EURIBOR, WIBOR and STIBOR, which may disappear but this is not anticipated in the short term.\n\nEURIBOR, EONIA and LIBOR represent (in decreasing order) the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's most significant exposures to benchmark rates.\n\nIn addition to preparing for early transitions and at least compliance with the BMR, work being done on the project also aims to identify and manage the inherent risks of transition to alternative benchmark rates, in particular in terms of the financial and operational aspects and customer protection.\n\nTo allow hedging relationships affected by this reform of benchmark interest rates to continue despite uncertainties about the timetable and means of transition from the current indices to the new indices, the IASB published amendments to IAS/uni00A039, IFRS/uni00A09 and IFRS/uni00A07 in September/uni00A0 2019 that were adopted by the European Union on 15/uni00A0 January 2020. The Group will apply these amendments for as long as uncertainties about the future of the indices continue to affect the amounts and maturities of interest flows and in this regard believes that all its hedging contracts, mainly those linked to EONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR rates (USD, GBP, CHF, JPY), may benefit as at 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2020, the list of hedging instruments impacted by  the  reform  and  subject  to  uncertainties  presents  a  nominal amount of \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion.\n\nOther  amendments  published  by  the  IASB  in  August/uni00A0 2020,  in addition  to  those  published  in  2019,  focus  on  the  accounting consequences of replacing old benchmark interest rates with other benchmark rates as a result of the reforms.\n\nThese  modifications,  known  as  'Phase/uni00A0 2',  concern  primarily modifications to contractual cash flows. They mean that entities do not have to derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial instruments to take account of the changes required by the reform, but rather update the effective interest rate to reflect the change to the alternative benchmark rate.\n\nAs regards hedge accounting, entities will not have to downgrade their hedging relationships if they make the changes required by the reform.\n\nThe  Group  decided  to  early  apply  these  amendments  from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2020, the breakdown by significant benchmark rate of instruments based on the old benchmark rates that need to transition to the new rates before they reach maturity is as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac billions)                            | EONIA   | EURIBOR   | LIBOR  USD   | LIBOR  GBP   | LIBOR  JPY   | LIBOR  CHF   | LIBOR  EUR   | WIBOR   | STIBOR   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|----------|\n| Total non-derivative financial assets      | 1,4     | 22,6      | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            | -       | -        |\n| Total non-derivative financial liabilities | -       | 4,8       | -            | -            | 0,8          | -            | -            | -       | -        |\n| Total notional amount of derivatives       | -       | 46,5      | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            | -       | -        |\n\nThe above figures are based on accounting values for notional amounts  of  derivatives  and  management  data  for  financial instruments other than derivatives.\n\nFor exposures relating to the EONIA rate, the amounts reported are those with a maturity date after the transition date 3/uni00A0January 2022.\n\nFor non-derivative financial instruments, exposures correspond to the nominal amounts of securities and capital remaining due for depreciable instruments.\n\nThe application of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's financial statements to 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

It clarified that all economic aspects of the contract must be taken into account in determining the enforceable period and that the concept of penalty extends beyond contractual termination indemnities and includes any economic incentive not to terminate the contract.\n\nThis decision constitutes a change of method in the approaches used by the Group to determine the duration of lease contracts, and goes beyond the specific cases that the IFRS/uni00A0 IC was questioned about, as stated by the AMF in its recommendations for accounts to 31/uni00A0December 2019. The duration of a contract used to evaluate right of use and lease liability is determined in accordance with IFRS/uni00A016 within this enforceable period.\n\nOn the publication of this definitive decision by the IFRS/uni00A0 IC, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group set up a project involving the accounting, finance, risk and IT departments in order to ensure its compliance for the financial year ending 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nThe Group applied a duration corresponding to the first post 5-year exit option, this being the reasonably certain duration of a lease. This duration, on the initiation of French commercial leases, will be applied in most cases. The main exception will be in the case of a lease in which the Group has waived its intermediate triennial exit options ( e.g. in return for a rent reduction). In this case, the duration of the lease will still be nine years.\n\nThe application of this decision did not have a material impact on the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  financial  statements  to 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\n## Standards published by IASB but not adopted by european union/uni00A0as of 31/uni00A0December 2020\n\nThe  standards  and  interpretations  published  by  the  IASB  at 31/uni00A0December 2020 but not yet adopted by the European Union are not applied by the Group. They will become mandatory only as from the date planned by the European Union and have not been applied by the Group at 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nThis concerns IFRS/uni00A017 in particular.\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 \u00ab/uni00A0Insurance contracts/uni00A0\u00bb, published by the IASB on 18/uni00A0May 2017 in its initial version and then on 25 June 2020n its amended version will replace IFRS/uni00A04. It will be applicable to accounting periods beginning 1/uni00A0January 2023 provided the European Union adopts it.\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 17 establishes recognition, measurement and presentation principles  for  insurance  contracts  that  fall  within  its  scope  ( i.e. insurance contracts issued, reinsurance treaties issued and held, and investment contracts with a discretionary participation feature issued, if the entity also issues insurance contracts).\n\nIn order to apply the provisions of IFRS/uni00A017 in terms of the recognition and measurement of insurance contract liabilities, the entity must\n\naggregate its insurance contracts based on their characteristics and estimated profitability at inception. It must also, on initial recognition, identify insurance contract portfolios (contracts that are subject to similar risks and managed together) then disaggregate each of these portfolios into three groups (onerous contracts, contracts with no significant risk of becoming onerous, and other contracts). The entity shall not include contracts issued more than one year apart in the same group.\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 introduces a general prospective model for the measurement of insurance liabilities, whereby groups of contracts are measured, on initial recognition, as the sum of fulfilment cash flows ( i.e. estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks associated with those future cash flows and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk) and the contractual service margin (CSM). The latter represents unearned profit that the entity will recognise in profit or loss as it provides services to insured parties in the future. It cannot be negative: if a contract is onerous at initial recognition, the loss must be immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAt the end of each subsequent reporting period, the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts must be reassessed as the sum of  the  liability  for  remaining  coverage  (comprising  the  fulfilment cash flows related to future services and the contractual service margin at that date) and the liability for incurred claims (comprising the fulfilment cash flows related to past services). The contractual service margin is adjusted to account for cash flow changes related to future services arising from non-financial assumptions. As CSM cannot be negative, any change in fulfilment cash flows that is not offset by changes in CSM must be recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThis general model is subject to modifications for certain insurance contracts  with  specific  features.  Hence,  for  insurance  contracts with  direct  participation  features,  the  standard  stipulates  that  a measurement model called 'Variable Fee Approach' (VFA) must be applied, allowing all changes in cash flows related to future services, including those linked to financial assumptions and options and guarantees, to be reflected in the adjustment of the contractual service margin.\n\nLastly,  the  standard  allows  for  the  application  of  a  simplified measurement  model  known  as  'Premium  Allocation  Approach' (PAA),  which  relies  on  the  premium  allocation  method  for  the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage of the group, provided that this measurement would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the general model, and that the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less.\n\nThe IFRS/uni00A0 17/uni00A0 standard is applied retrospectively with mandatory restatement of comparative information. As retrospective application of the standard appears impossible, transitional measures are to allow two alternative options (modified retrospective approach and fair value approach).\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is organised to implement the  IFRS/uni00A0 17/uni00A0 standard  in  the  required  delays  by  integrating  all the  impacted  functions  (accounting,  actuarial,  controlling,  IT, procurement, etc\u2026). In 2017, a framing phase helped in identifying and measuring all the stakes linked to the implementation of the IFRS/uni00A0 17/uni00A0 standard and perform a first impact study for the Group. In 2018 the implementation phase of IFRS/uni00A017 has started and the works are structured around projects allowing to fulfil the identified stakes  (actuarial  and  accounting  methodologies,  accounting, consolidation, processes, actuarial models, data management, IT, etc.). These works continued to be handled in 2019 and in 2020 and will continue until the standard enters into force.",

        "page_content": "The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group has been closely following the process initiated by the IASB in October/uni00A0 2018 and finalised on 25/uni00A0 June 2020 of amending IFRS/uni00A017, as well as the process of adoption of IFRS/uni00A017 by the European Union, currently in the process of being finalised.\n\nThe  Group  has  paid  careful  attention  following  the  new  IASB discussions regarding the amendments proposed in the exposure draft of 26/uni00A0 June 2019, as well as the amendments to IFRS/uni00A0 17 resulting from this process.\n\n## Presentation format of financial statements\n\nIn the absence of a model decreed by IFRS standards, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses the format of financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of net income and gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement) recommended by the ANC recommendation n\u00b02013-05 of 7/uni00A0November 2013.\n\nThis presentation, adopted in 2013, has the following features:\n\n- z revenue on investment contracts without discretionary participation features is classified under the heading 'Revenue or income from other activities';\n- z assets and liabilities are classified on the balance sheet in increasing order of liquidity, as this presentation is more relevant for insurance companies than the classification into current and non-current items, as also allowed under IAS/uni00A01;\n- z expenses in the income statement are classified by function rather than by nature. This presentation, allowed under IAS/uni00A01, is the one used by a large majority of insurance companies. Information on expenses by nature is also provided in the notes.\n\n## Accounting policies and principles\n\n## Use of assessments and estimates to prepare the financial statements\n\nEstimates made to draw up the financial statements are by nature based on certain assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties as to whether they will be achieved in the future.\n\nFuture results may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\n- z activity in domestic and international financial markets;\n- z fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates;\n- z the economic and political climate in certain industries or countries;\n- z changes in regulations or legislation;\n- z the behaviour of the policyholders;\n- z demographic changes.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nAccounting estimates based on assumptions are principally used in the following assessments:\n\n- z financial instruments measured at fair value;\n- z investments in non-consolidated companies;\n- z liabilities on insurance contracts and investment contracts;\n- z pension schemes and other post-employment benefits;\n- z stock option plans;\n- z impairment on debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified);\n- z provisions;\n- z impairment of goodwill;\n- z deferred tax assets;\n- z valuation of equity accounted entities;\n- z policyholders' deferred profit sharing.\n\nThe  procedures  for  the  use  of  assessments  or  estimates  are described in the relevant sections below.\n\nAnnual accounts for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are closed on 31 December. They include estimates where information is not available at the closing date. Financial investments are valued at closing prices and transactions carried out in the final month of the period having an impact on profit or loss are taken into account.\n\nAs an exception, a single entity within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is closing its individual accounts on a date other than 31 December:\n\n- z CA life Japan, whose closing date is 31 March;\n- z for this entity, 12/uni00A0month-accounts are closed at 30 September to be consolidated in the Group accounts at 31 December;\n- z the impact from the difference in closing dates is not material.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\nThe segmental information presented in the financial statements and notes of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances reflects the operational business segments. It is based on five business lines: France life, France nonlife, Credit Insurance, International and Other, which mainly covers holding and reinsurance activities.\n\n## Intangible assets and deferred expenses\n\nThe main intangible assets are goodwill and the value of portfolios of contracts acquired, recognised as part of a business combination or separately through the transfer of a portfolio, together with software acquired or developed in-house.\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill (see section 'Consolidation principles and policies' below) is assumed to have a perpetual value and is therefore not amortised; however, in accordance with IAS/uni00A0 36 it is subject to impairment testing as soon as there are objective indicators of a loss of value and at least once per year.\n\nFor the purposes of these impairment tests, each item of goodwill is allocated to the various cash generating units (CGUs) of the Group that will benefit from the advantages expected to accrue from the business combination. CGUs were defined, within the Group's main business segments, as the smallest identifiable grouping of assets and liabilities operating according to its own business model. In practice, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses an entity-based approach.\n\nUnder the impairment tests, the carrying amount of each CGU, including that of the goodwill allocated to it, is compared to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value in use is calculated as the current value of estimated future cash flows from the CGU, as based on the medium-term plans drawn up for steering purposes of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

This impairment is irreversible.\n\n## VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS OF CONTRACTS ACQUIRED\n\nThe  fair  value  of  a  portfolio  of  insurance  contracts  acquired separately or as part of a business combination is recognised as an asset on the balance sheet. This corresponds to the present value of estimated future profits generated by the existing contracts at the time of acquisition.\n\nThese  portfolio  values  are  amortised  over  the  life  of  contracts acquired as profits materialise. This amortisation is complemented by an annual recoverability test which takes account of experience and changes in valuation hypotheses.\n\n## SOFTWARES\n\nSoftware  acquired  is  recognised  at  its  acquisition  cost,  less amortisation and depreciation accumulated since the acquisition date.\n\nSoftware created internally is recognised at its production cost, less amortisation and depreciation accumulated since the date of completion, where it meets the criteria of IAS/uni00A038 and in particular where it will generate future economic benefits for the company and where its cost can be assessed in a reliable manner. Only those expenses incurred during the development phase are capitalised; expenses incurred during the research phase are recognised directly in profit or loss for the year.\n\nSoftware is amortised based on its estimated useful life.\n\nStart-up costs are not capitalised and are recognised directly in expenses for the year in which they arise.\n\n## DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITH DISCRETIONARY PARTICIPATION FEATURES AND COSTS INCURRED AT THE INCEPTION OF INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nVariable costs incurred at the inception of life insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features as part of the underwriting of new business are recognised as assets on the balance sheet. The acquisition costs thus recognised are amortised over the life of the contracts in proportion to expected future profits arising.\n\nThe recoverability of such assets is tested together with the liability adequacy test (see section 'Insurance contracts' below): the share of acquisition costs which, at the closing date, proves not to be covered by estimated future gross profits is not considered as recoverable and is therefore recognised as an expense, in accordance with the requirements of CRC regulation 2000-05 which apply to contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04.\n\nAcquisition costs of non-life insurance contracts are deferred in proportion to corresponding unearned premiums for the financial year.\n\nAs regards investment contracts without discretionary participation features, which are governed by IFRS/uni00A09, marginal acquisition costs recoverable are posted on balance sheet assets and amortised in accordance with IFRS/uni00A015.\n\nSymmetrically  with  the  deferral  of  expenses  incurred  on  the subscription of contracts, unearned loadings and commissions are deferred via the posting of a provision in liabilities.\n\nThe deferral patterns are identical to those of deferred acquisition costs of insurance contracts.\n\nFor Predica, in the savings business segment, the Group does not recognise deferred acquisition costs, as commissions paid are offset by loadings for acquisition costs.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n## OPERATING AND INVESTMENT PROPERTY\n\nOperating property covers the buildings housing the company's services. Investment property covers rental property and shares in unlisted real estate companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises operating and investment property at cost, applying the component method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A016 and the option set out in IAS/uni00A040.\n\nAs an exception, as allowed under IAS/uni00A040, real estate assets backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by the policyholder are valued and recognised at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in profit or loss.\n\nProperties recognised at cost are analysed into four components, each with its own useful life and renewal schedule:\n\n- z major works (superstructure and infrastructure);\n- z secondary works (roofing, coverings, frames, facades, external joinery);\n- z technical installations (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lifts, electrical systems);\n- z fixtures and fittings (surfacing, wall and floor finishing stages, etc.).\n\nTechnical studies carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances lead it to use a residual value corresponding to approximately 90% of the major works component. By definition, this residual value is not depreciated; however, if an item of major works were to suffer a significant and lasting loss of value (technological change, change of use, fall in price), an impairment would be recognised.\n\n## DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  based  on  their estimated  useful  life.  The  depreciation  periods  used  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  are  specific  to  each  component  and  are adapted to its nature and, for property, its location:\n\n| Component               | Depreciation period   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Land                    | Non depreciable       |\n| Primary structure       | 30 to 80/uni00A0years |\n| Secondary structure     | 8 to 40/uni00A0years  |\n| Technical Installations | 5 to 25/uni00A0years  |\n| Fixtures and fittings   | 5 to 15/uni00A0years  |\n| IT equipment            | 4 to 7/uni00A0years   |\n| Specialist equipment    | 4 to 5/uni00A0years   |",

        "page_content": "If the net carrying amount of the asset is greater than the recoverable amount,  an  additional  impairment  is  recognised  further  to  its depreciation. The recoverable value, calculated where the property presents indicators of a loss of value, is the lower of fair value and value in use.\n\nFor  buildings,  fair  value  corresponds  to  an  expert  valuation, established at least every five years and updated annually by a suitably qualified independent valuer. This value is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements (see note/uni00A06.3).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances analyses at each closing all indicators of a loss of value for investment property. This multicriteria analysis is based both on the long-term character of the loss of value and the exercise of judgment. One of the criteria taken into account is a net carrying amount more than 20% higher than the expert valuation, however, if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances considers selling the investment in the short term or does not have the ability to hold it in the long term, any impairment, even less than 20%, is recognised.\n\n## Financial instruments (IFRS/uni00A09, IAS/uni00A039 and IAS/uni00A032)\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n\nIAS/uni00A032 defines a financial instrument as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity, meaning any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to receive or pay cash or other financial assets.\n\nDerivative instruments are financial assets or liabilities whose value changes according to that of an underlying asset, which requires a low or nil initial investment, and for which settlement occurs at a future date.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are treated in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 9 as adopted by the European Union, including for financial assets held by the Group's insurance entities.\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 9  sets  the  principles  governing  the  classification  and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of credit risk and hedging accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.\n\nIt should nevertheless be noted that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has opted not to apply the IFRS/uni00A09 general hedging model. All hedging relationships  consequently  remain  within  the  scope  of  IAS/uni00A0 39 pending future provisions relating to macro-hedging.\n\n## CONVENTIONS FOR MEASURING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND/uni00A0LIABILITIES\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nAt initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as defined by IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nFair value as defined by IFRS/uni00A013 corresponds to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to their classification either at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (EIR) for debt instruments, or at fair value as defined by IFRS/uni00A0 13. For derivative instruments, they are always measured at their fair value.\n\nAmortised cost corresponds to the amount at which the financial asset  or  liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  including transaction costs directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, reduced by repayments of principal, increased or reduced by the cumulative  amortisation  calculated  by  the  effective  interest  rate method (EIR) on any difference (discount or premium) between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a financial asset at amortised  cost or at fair value through recyclable OCI, the amount can be adjusted if necessary in order to correct for the loss allowance (see section 'Impairment for credit risk' below).\n\nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to obtain the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative  financial  assets  (debt  or  equity  instruments)  are classified  on  the  balance  sheet  in  accounting  categories  that determine their accounting treatment and their subsequent valuation mode.\n\nThe criteria for classification and measurement of financial assets depend on the nature of the financial asset, according to whether they are qualified as:\n\n- z debt instrument ( i.e. loans and fixed or determinable income securities); or\n- z equity instrument ( i.e. shares).\n\nThese financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- z financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- z financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (recyclable  for  debt  instruments,  non-recyclable  for  equity instruments).\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe classification and measurement of a debt instrument depend on the combination of two criteria: the business model and the analysis of the contractual terms, unless the fair value option is used.\n\n## The three business models\n\nThe  business  model  represents  the  strategy  followed  by  the management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances for managing its financial assets in order to achieve its objectives. The business model is specified for a portfolio of assets and does not constitute a case-bycase intention for an isolated financial asset.\n\nThe three business models are as follows:\n\n- z the collection only model for which the aim is to collect contractual cash flows over the lifetime of the assets; this model does not always imply holding all of the assets until their contractual maturity; however, sales of assets are strictly governed;\n- z the mixed model where the aim is to collect the contractual cash flows over the lifetime of the assets and to sell the assets; under this model, both the sale of the financial assets and the receipt of cash flows are essential; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This additional analysis consists of comparing the contractual cash flows of the asset under review with the cash flows of a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the difference between the cash flows of the financial asset and the benchmark asset is considered immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing.\n\nMoreover, a specific analysis is carried out when the financial asset is issued by special purpose entities establishing a differentiated order of payment among the holders of the financial assets by contractually linking multiple instruments and creating concentrations of credit risk ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is assigned a rank of subordination that specifies the order of distribution of cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn this case, the 'SPPI' test requires an analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset concerned and underlying assets according to the \u00ablook-through\u00bb approach and the credit risk borne by the tranches subscribed compared to the credit risk of the underlying assets.\n\nThe mode of recognition of debt instruments resulting from the qualification of the business model combined with the 'SPPI' test may be presented in the following diagram:\n\n## BUSINESS MODEL\n\n## MIXED\n\nFair value cost other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified)\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\nNOT SATISFIED\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\n## Debt instruments at amortised cost\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortised cost if they are eligible for the pure collection model and if they pass the 'SPPI' test.\n\nThey are recorded at the settlement date and their initial measurement also includes accrued interest and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs of loans and receivables and on fixed-income securities is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThis category of financial assets is impaired under the conditions described in the specific section \u00abImpairment for credit risk\u00bb.\n\n## Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified)\n\nDebt  instruments  are  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income on items that can be reclassified if they are eligible for the mixed model and if they pass the 'SPPI' test.\n\nThey are recorded at the trade date and their initial measurement also includes accrued interest and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premium or discount and transaction costs on fixed-income securities is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThese financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income on items that can be reclassified and offset against the outstanding accounts (excluding accrued interest recognised in profit or loss according to the effective interest rate method).\n\nIf the securities are sold, these changes are transferred to profit or loss.\n\nThis category of financial instruments is subject to adjustments for expected losses (ECL) under the conditions described in the specific paragraph \u00abImpairment for credit risk\u00bb (without this affecting the fair value on the balance sheet assets).\n\n## Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nDebt instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss in the following cases:\n\n- z the instruments are classified in portfolios composed of financial assets held for trading or for which the main objective is disposal.\n\n## SELLING ONLY\n\nFair value through profit or loss",

This is notably the case of UCITS.\n- z financial instruments classified in portfolios which the entity designates at fair value in order to reduce an accounting treatment difference in profit or loss.

They are recorded at the settlement date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, offset against the outstanding accounts.\n\nThis category of financial assets is not subject to impairment.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified (irrevocable option)\n\nThe irrevocable option to recognise equity instruments at fair value through  other  comprehensive  income  on  items  that  cannot  be reclassified is adopted at the transactional level (line by line) and applies from the date of initial recognition. These securities are recorded at the trade date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nAt subsequent measurement, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified. In case of disposal, these changes are not reclassified to profit or loss. The gain or loss on disposal is recognised in other comprehensive\n\nincome.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised in profit or loss if:\n\n- z the entity's right to receive payment is established;\n- z it is likely that the economic advantages associated with dividends will go to the entity;\n- z the amount of dividends can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Reclassification of financial assets\n\nIn the case of a significant change in the business model used for managing financial assets (new activity, acquisition of entities, disposal or discontinuation of a significant activity), a reclassification of these financial assets is necessary. The reclassification applies to all financial assets in the portfolio from the date of reclassification.\n\nIn other cases, the business model remains unchanged for existing financial assets. If a new business model is identified, it applies prospectively to new financial assets grouped in a new management portfolio.\n\n## Temporary acquisition and disposal of securities\n\nTemporary  disposals  of  securities  (loans  of  securities,  securities delivered under repurchase agreements) do not generally fulfil the conditions for derecognition.\n\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase agreements remain on the balance sheet. In the case of securities sold under repurchase agreements, the amount received, representing the liability to the transferee, is recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by the transferor.\n\nSecurities borrowed or received under repurchase agreements are not recognised on the balance sheet of the transferee.\n\nIn the case of securities purchased under resale agreements, a debt to the transferor is recorded on the balance sheet of the transferee and offset against the amount paid. If the security is subsequently resold, the transferee records a liability equivalent to the fair value of fulfilling its obligation to return the security received under the agreement.\n\nRevenue and expenses relating to such transactions are posted to profit and loss on a prorata temporis basis, except in the case of a classification of assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or group of financial assets) is fully or partially derecognised if:\n\n- z the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;\n- z or are transferred or deemed as such because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries, and when substantially all the risks and rewards related to the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, all the rights or obligations created or retained at the time of transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred but only some of the risks and rewards, as well as control, are retained, the financial assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in this asset.\n\nFinancial assets renegotiated for commercial reasons if there are no financial difficulties facing the counterparty and with the aim of developing or maintaining a business relationship are derecognised on the renegotiation date. The new loans granted to clients are recorded on this date at their fair value on the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition depends on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

Indeed it allows for an elimination from the net income of part of the additional accounting mismatches and the temporary volatility which could be caused by an application of IFRS/uni00A09 before the entry into force of IFRS/uni00A017.\n\nThe  designation  of  eligible  financial  assets  is  performed  on  an instrument by instrument basis, and this may be done:\n\n- z at 1/uni00A0January 2018, at the initial application of IFRS/uni00A09; or\n- z subsequently, but only at the initial recognition of the assets in question.\n\nThis designation applies until derecognition of the financial assets concerned.\n\nPursuant  to  the  overlay  approach,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances reclassifies, for designated financial assets, their impacts in profit or loss to other comprehensive income, such that the amount reported in profit or loss for these assets corresponds to that which would have been reported in profit or loss if IAS/uni00A039 had been applied.\n\nConsequently, the amount reclassified is equal to the difference, for the designated financial assets, between:\n\n- z the amount reported in profit or loss applying IFRS/uni00A09; and\n- z the amount that would have been reported in profit or loss if IAS/uni00A039 had been applied.\n\nIn  the  income  statement,  the  effects  of  this  reclassification  are recognised  in  the  item  'Investment  income  net  of  investment expenses', before tax effects, on the line \u00abAmount reclassified as gains and losses recognised directly in equity under the overlay approach\u00bb.  The  tax  effects  related  to  this  reclassification  are presented on the line \u00abIncome tax\u00bb.\n\nIn the statement of other comprehensive income, the effects of this reclassification are recognised in other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified) on the line \u00abReclassification of gains and losses on financial assets related to the overlay approach\u00bb.\n\nThe financial assets that may be designated to the overlay approach must fulfil the following two criteria:\n\n- z they are held by insurers within the Group in respect of an activity connected to insurance contracts; and\n- z they are measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS/uni00A09 but would not have been measured this way under IAS/uni00A039; thus these are financial assets which, under IAS/uni00A039 would have been recognised at amortised cost (assets held to maturity, loans and receivables) or at fair value through other comprehensive income (available-for-sale financial assets).\n\n## Evaluation of the impacts in profit or loss of the designated financial assets\n\nPursuant  to  the  overlay  approach,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances applies, for the final recognition of the net impacts in profit or loss of the designated financial assets, the accounting principles and policies that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances would have applied under IAS/uni00A039.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost under IAS/uni00A039\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are initially recognised at their initial fair value, including directly-attributable transaction costs and accrued interest.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at amortised cost with amortisation of any premium or discount and transaction costs using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Available-for-sale financial assets under IAS/uni00A039\n\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at their initial fair value, including transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, and accrued interest\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nIf the securities are sold, these changes are transferred (recycled) to profit or loss.\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs on fixed-income securities is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Impairment of designated financial assets under IAS/uni00A039\n\nAn  impairment  must  be  recognised  when  there  is  an  objective evidence of impairment resulting from one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the financial asset.\n\nAn objective evidence of impairment corresponds to a prolonged or significant decline in the value of the security for equity securities or the appearance of a significant deterioration in credit risk evidenced by a risk of non-recovery for debt securities.\n\nFor equity securities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses quantitative criteria  as  indicators  of  potential  impairment.  These  quantitative criteria are notably based on a loss of 30% or more of the value of the equity instrument over a period of six consecutive months. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  also  considers  qualitative  criteria  (financial difficulties of the issuer, short term prospects, etc\u2026).\n\nNotwithstanding  the  above-mentioned  criteria,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances recognises an impairment when there is a decline in the value of the equity instrument higher than 50% at the reporting date or durably observed for more than three years.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nFinancial liabilities relating to financial contracts without discretionary participation features are described in the section on insurance contracts.\n\nThe  other  financial  liabilities  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  are described below.\n\n## Distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments\n\nThe distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments is based on an analysis of the economic substance of the contractual terms.\n\nA financial liability is a debt instrument if it includes a contractual obligation:\n\n- z to provide another entity with cash, another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments; or\n- z to exchange financial assets and liabilities with another entity at potentially unfavourable conditions.",

        "page_content": "An  equity  instrument  is  a  non-redeemable  financial  instrument which offers a discretionary return evidencing a residual interest in a company after deduction of all its financial liabilities (net assets) and which is not qualified as a debt instrument.\n\nSecurities  for  which  there  is  no  contractual  obligation  to  repay the nominal or to provide cash are therefore classified as equity instruments.\n\n## Derecognition and modification of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised in full or in part:\n\n- z when it is extinguished; or\n- z when quantitative or qualitative analyses conclude it has been substantially modified following restructuring.\n\nA  substantial  modification  of  an  existing  financial  liability  must be recorded as an extinction of an initial financial liability and the recognition  of  a  new  financial  liability  (novation).  Any  differential between the carrying amount of the extinct liability and the new liability will be recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nIf the financial liability is not derecognised, the original effective interest  rate  is  maintained.  A  discount/premium  is  recognised immediately in profit or loss at the date of modification and is then spread, using the original effective interest rate, over the residual lifetime of the instrument.\n\n## NEGATIVE INTEREST ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND/uni00A0LIABILITIES\n\nIn accordance with the IFRS/uni00A0IC's decision in January/uni00A02015, negative interest income (or expenses) on financial assets that do not meet the definition of revenue within the meaning of IFRS/uni00A015 is recognised as interest expense in the income statement and not deducted from interest income. The same applies to negative interest expenses (income) on financial liabilities.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT FOR CREDIT RISK\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A09, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) on the following outstanding:\n\n- z financial assets of debt instruments recognised at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified) (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- z financing commitments which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z guarantee commitments coming under IFRS/uni00A09 and which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z leases receivables coming under IFRS/uni00A016; and\n- z trade receivables generated by transactions coming under IFRS/uni00A015.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified) are not concerned by impairment provisions.\n\nDerivative instruments and other instruments at fair value through profit or loss are subject to a calculation of counterparty risk which is not covered by the ECL model. This calculation is described in chapter/uni00A05 \u00abRisk factors and risk management\u00bb of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Registration Document.\n\n## Credit risk and impairment stages\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of losses related to the default of a counterparty leading to its inability to meet its commitments to the Group.\n\nThe process of impairing for credit risk has three stages (Buckets):\n\n- z 1 st /uni00A0stage (bucket 1): upon initial recognition of the financial instrument (credit, debt security, guarantee, etc.), the entity recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- z 2 nd /uni00A0 stage (bucket 2): if the credit quality deteriorates significantly for a given transaction or portfolio, the entity recognises lifetime expected credit losses;\n- z 3 rd /uni00A0stage (bucket 3): when one or more default events have occurred on the transaction or on a counterparty with an adverse effect on the estimated future cash flows, the entity recognises incurred credit losses to maturity. Subsequently, if the conditions for classifying financial instruments in bucket 3 are no longer met, the financial instruments are reclassified in bucket 2, then in bucket 1 according to the subsequent improvement in the quality of credit risk.\n\nA loan in default (Bucket 3) is said to be impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset. Evidence that a financial asset is creditimpaired include observable data about the following events:\n\n- z significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;\n- z a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\n- z the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;\n- z it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;\n- z the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or\n- z the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.\n\nIt may not be possible to identify a single discrete event-instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired.\n\nThe defaulting counterparty does not return to a healthy position until after an observation period to validate that the debtor is no longer in default (assessed by the Risk Management department).\n\n## Definition of expected credit losses (\u00abECLs\u00bb)\n\nECL is defined as the weighted expected probable value of the discounted  credit  loss  (principal  and  interest).  It  represents  the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows and the expected cash flows (including principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach is designed to anticipate as early as possible the recognition of expected credit losses.\n\n## ECL governance and measurement\n\nThe governance of the system for measuring IFRS/uni00A09 parameters is based on the structure implemented as part of the Basel framework. The Group's Risk Management department is responsible for defining the  methodological  framework  and  supervising  the  impairment system.\n\nThe Group primarily relies on the internal rating system and the current Basel processes to generate the IFRS/uni00A09 parameters required to calculate ECLs. The assessment of the change in credit risk is based on an expected loss model and extrapolation based on reasonable  scenarios.  All  information  that  is  available,  relevant, reasonable and justifiable, including of a forward-looking nature, must be retained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

The estimate of the expected cash flow shortfalls from a guaranteed financial instrument reflects the amount and timing of the recovery of the guarantees. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 9, the inclusion of guarantees and sureties does not affect the assessment of the significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on the evolution of the debtor's credit risk without taking into account guarantees.\n\nForward-looking macroeconomic data are taken into account in accordance with a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- z at Group level for the determination of a shared framework for the consideration of forward-looking data in the estimation of probability of default and loss given default parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- z at the level of each entity in respect of its own portfolios.\n\n## Significant deterioration of credit risk\n\nAll Group entities must assess, for each financial instrument, the increase in credit risk from initial recognition at each reporting date. This assessment of the change in credit risk leads the entities to classify their exposures into different risk categories (Buckets).\n\nTo assess significant increase, the Group uses a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- z the first level is based on relative and absolute Group criteria and rules that apply to all Group entities;\n- z the second level is linked to the expert assessment, based on local forward-looking information, of the risk held by each entity in its portfolios that may lead to an adjustment in the Group Bucket 2 reclassification criteria (switching a portfolio or sub-portfolio to lifetime ECLs).\n\nEach  financial  instrument  is,  without  exception,  assessed  for significant increase. Contagion is not required for the downgrading of financial instruments of the same counterparty from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2. The significant increase assessment must consider the change in credit risk of the principal debtor without taking account of  any  guarantee,  including  for  transactions  with  a  shareholder guarantee.\n\nTo  measure  the  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial recognition, it is necessary to look back at the internal rating and probability of default at origination.\n\nOrigination means the trading date, on which the entity became bound by the contractual terms of the financial instrument. For financing and guarantee commitments, origination means the date on which the irrevocable commitment was made.\n\nFor the scope without an internal rating model, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group  applies  the  absolute  threshold  of  arrears  of  more  than 30/uni00A0 days as the ultimate cut-off point for a significant downgrading and classification in Bucket 2.\n\nFor outstandings (apart from securities) for which internal rating procedures have been devised (in particular exposures monitored using authorised methods), the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group believes that all the information included in the ratings procedures allows for a more relevant assessment than just the criterion of arrears of more than 30/uni00A0days.\n\nIf the increase since origination is no longer observed, impairment may be reduced to 12-month expected credit losses (Bucket 1).\n\nFor securities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses an approach that consists in applying an absolute level of credit risk, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09, below which exposures are classified in Bucket 1 and impaired based on 12-month ECLs.\n\nAs such, the following rules shall apply for monitoring the significant increase of securities:\n\n- z \u00abInvestment Grade\u00bb rated securities, at the reporting date, are classified in Bucket 1 and provisions are made based on 12-month ECL;\n- z \u00abNon-Investment Grade\u00bb rated securities, at the reporting date, must be subject to monitoring for significant increase, since origination, and be classified in Bucket 2 (lifetime ECLs) in the event of significant increase in credit risk.\n\nRelative increase must be assessed prior to the occurrence of an actual default (Bucket 3).\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivative instruments are financial assets or liabilities classified by default as derivative instruments held-for-trading unless they qualify for being hedging derivatives.\n\nThey are recorded on the balance sheet at their initial fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently recognised at their fair value.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the counterparty of the change in fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- z through profit or loss for derivative instruments held-for-trading and for fair value hedges;\n- z through other comprehensive income for cash flow hedging derivatives and net investments in foreign operations for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n## General framework\n\nIn accordance with a decision made by the Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances does not apply the \u00abhedge accounting\u00bb provisions of IFRS/uni00A0 9, as permitted by the standard.

However, the eligibility of financial instruments to hedge accounting under IAS/uni00A039 takes into account the IFRS/uni00A09 principles for the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nUnder  IFRS/uni00A0 9,  and  given  the  IAS/uni00A0 39  hedging  principles,  debt instruments  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) are eligible to fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging relationships must comply with the following principles:\n\n- z fair value hedges are intended to provide protection from exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability that has been recognised, or of a firm commitment that has not been recognised, attributable to the risk(s) hedged and that may have an impact in profit or loss (for instance, the hedging of all or some changes in fair value caused by the interest rate risk of a fixed-rate debt).\n- z cash flow hedges are intended to provide protection from exposure to changes in the future cash flows of an asset or liability that has been recognised, or of a transaction considered to be highly probable, attributable to the risk(s) hedged and that could (in the event of a planned transaction not carried out) have an impact in profit or loss (for instance, the hedging of changes in all or some of the future interest payments on a floating-rate debt).\n- z net investment hedges in foreign operations are intended to provide protection against the risk of unfavourable changes in fair value associated with the foreign exchange risk of an investment carried out abroad in a currency other than the euro, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' presentation currency.\n\nHedges must also meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for hedge accounting:\n\n- z the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be eligible;\n- z there must be formal documentation from inception, primarily including the individual designation and characteristics of the hedged item, the hedging instrument, the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged risk;\n- z the effectiveness of the hedge must be demonstrated, at inception and retrospectively, by testing performed at each reporting date.\n\nFurther  details  on  the  Group's  risk  management  strategy  and its application are presented in Chapter/uni00A0 5 \u00abRisk factors and risk management\u00bb  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Registration Document.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe re measurement of the derivative at fair value is recorded in the financial statements as follows:\n\n- z fair value hedge: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ineffective portion of the hedge appears in profit or loss;\n- z cash  flow  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is recognised in the balance sheet against a specific account in other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) for the effective portion, and any eventual ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss. Profits or losses on the derivative accumulated in other comprehensive income are then reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- z hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in the balance sheet against a translation adjustment account in other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhere the conditions for benefiting from hedge accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively,  except  in  case  of  disappearance  of  the  hedged element:\n\n- z fair value hedge: only the hedging instrument continues to be revalued through profit or loss. The hedged item is wholly accounted for according to its classification. For debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified), changes in fair value subsequent to the ending of the hedging relationship are recorded in other comprehensive income in their entirety. For hedged items valued at amortised cost, which were interest rate hedged, the revaluation adjustment is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items.\n- z cash flow hedge: the hedging instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge remain in other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects profit or loss. For interest rate hedged instruments, profit or loss is affected as interests are paid. The revaluation adjustment is therefore amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items.\n- z hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge remain in other comprehensive income as long as the net investment is held. Profit or loss is affected when the net investment in a foreign operation exits the scope of consolidation.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn embedded derivative is the component of a hybrid contract that meets the definition of a derivative product. This definition applies only to financial liabilities and non-financial contracts. The embedded derivative must be accounted for separately from the host contract if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- z the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z the embedded component taken separately from the host contract has the characteristics of a derivative;\n- z the characteristics of the derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract.\n\nThe  main  hybrid  financial  investments  held  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances at 31/uni00A0December 2020 are some EMTN and convertible bonds. If the characteristics of the derivative are not closely linked to those of the host contract, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has elected to recognise these instruments at fair value through profit or loss, their embedded derivatives are thus not accounted for separately.\n\n## DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nWhen determining the fair value of financial instruments observable inputs must be prioritised. It is presented using the hierarchy defined in IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nIFRS/uni00A013 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

The methodology used maximizes the use of observable market inputs. It is primarily based on market data such as registered and listed Credit Default Swaps (or Single Name CDS) or index CDS in the absence of registered CDS on the counterparty. In certain circumstances, historical default data may also be used.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe standard classifies fair value into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in the evaluation.\n\n## Level/uni00A01: fair value corresponding to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel/uni00A01 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. These are, notably, stocks and bonds quoted in active markets (such as the Paris Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, etc.), fund securities quoted in an active market and derivatives traded on an organised market, in particular futures.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from a stock exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level/uni00A02: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level/uni00A01\n\nThe inputs used are observable either directly ( i.e. prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) and generally consist of data from outside the Company, which are publicly available or accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 is composed of:\n\n- z stocks and bonds quoted in an inactive market or not quoted in an active market but for which the fair value is established using a valuation methodology usually used by market participants (such as discounted cash flow techniques or the Black & Scholes model) and based on observable market data;\n- z instruments that are traded over the counter, the fair value of which is measured with models using observable market data, i.e. derived from various independently available external sources which can be obtained on a regular basis. For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally derived from the yield curves of market interest rates as observed at the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are based notably on standard models and observable market data (such as interest rate yield curves or implied volatility surfaces), the day one gain or loss resulting from the initial fair value measurement of the related instruments is recognised in profit or loss at inception.\n\n## Level/uni00A03: fair value that is measured using significant unobservable inputs\n\nFor some complex market instruments that are not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques using assumptions that cannot be observed on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are disclosed within Level/uni00A03.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances mainly classifies within Level/uni00A03 units in venture capital funds and unlisted equity securities.\n\nValuation methodologies and models used for financial instruments that are disclosed within Levels/uni00A02 and 3 incorporate all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price. They shall be beforehand validated by an independent control. The fair value measurement of these instruments notably includes liquidity risk and counterparty risk.\n\n## OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A0 32, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance offsets a financial asset and a financial liability and reports the net amount when, and only when, it has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts reported and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nThe derivative instruments and the repurchase agreements handled with clearing houses that meet the two criteria required by IAS/uni00A032 are subject to offsetting on the balance sheet.\n\n## INVESTMENT INCOME NET OF INVESTMENT EXPENSES\n\nThis heading of the income statement includes all the income and expenses linked to the investments of insurance companies. It is detailed as follows.\n\n## Investment income\n\nThis heading includes:\n\n- z dividends received on equity instruments classified in the categories of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified);\n- z interests received and accrued on fixed-income securities and loans and receivables;\n- z amortisation of premiums and discounts on amortisable securities;\n- z other investment income, notably corresponding to commissions on financial services, rental income from investment properties and foreign exchange gains;\n- z the share in the net income of entities accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Investment expenses\n\nThis heading includes:\n\n- z interest expenses on securities loaned under a repurchase arrangement;\n- z investment management expenses, including directly incurred expenses (commissions on financial services) or expense by function;",

They are, however, subject to impairment in accordance with the provisions of IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract under which the issuer must make specific payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred due to a specific debtor's failure to make a payment when due under the initial or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value then subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- z the amount of the loss allowance for expected credit losses determined in accordance with the provisions of the \u00abImpairment\u00bb section of IFRS/uni00A09; or\n- z the amount originally recognised less, where applicable, the sum of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS/uni00A015 \u00abRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u00bb.\n\n## Insurance contracts (IFRS/uni00A04)\n\n## CONTRACT CATEGORIES\n\nContracts  issued  by  the  Group's  insurance  companies  can  be divided into two main categories:\n\n- z insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, which fall under IFRS/uni00A04;\n- z investment contracts without discretionary participation features, which fall under IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nThese are contracts under which the insurer accepts significant insurance risk from another party, the policyholder, by agreeing to compensate the policyholder or another beneficiary if a specified uncertain  future  event,  the  insured  event,  adversely  affects  the policyholder or another beneficiary.\n\nAn insurance risk is defined as a risk other than financial risk, while financial risk is the risk of a potential future change in an interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate or another non-financial variable provided that it is not specific to one of the parties to the contract (otherwise it would qualify as an insurance risk).\n\nFor  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances,  for  each  portfolio  of  contracts grouped according to uniform characteristics, the significant nature of an insurance risk is analysed on the basis of a representative individual contract. The existence of a scenario (having commercial substance) under which the insurer would be required to pay to the policyholder significant benefits, that is to say amounts that significantly exceed those that would be paid if no insured event occurred, constitutes a significant insurance risk for all contracts of a uniform portfolio, regardless the likelihood of the scenario arising. Insurance risk may therefore be significant whereas the pooling of risks within a portfolio minimises the probability of a significant loss compared to the portfolio as a whole.\n\nThe main insurance risks are mortality (death benefits), longevity (life benefits, for example life-contingent annuities), morbidity (disability benefits), incapacity, illness (medical benefits) or unemployment for individuals, or third-party liability and damages to property.\n\n## Investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nContracts which do not expose the insurer to a significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nThey  are  considered  investment  contracts  with  discretionary participation  features  if  they  grant  the  policyholder  the  right  to receive, in addition to guaranteed benefits, additional benefits:\n\n- z that are likely to represent a significant portion of total contractual benefits;\n- z whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the insurer;\n- z and that are contractually based on the performance of a specified pool of contracts or type of contract, the realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer or the net income of the company, fund or an entity other than that issuing the contract.\n\nInvestment  contracts  with  discretionary  participation  features, are  primarily  euro-denominated  savings  contracts.  In  the  event of a multi-fund contract, where the policyholder has the option of transferring at any time all or some of his savings into a eurodenominated fund with discretionary participation features (under conditions that are not likely to impede such arbitrations), the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group considers that the contract as a whole is a contract with discretionary participation features, whether or not this option has been exercised by the policyholder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These reserves are reduced by projected recoveries to be collected, which are estimated from the collection pace of previous years, and increased by a reserve for claims management costs, aimed at covering future management costs of claims reported but not closed at the closing date. Claims reserves are not discounted, with the exception of reserves for incapacity and disability annuities.\n\nProvisions for Incurred But Not Reported ('IBNR') claims correspond to an estimation of expenditure on claims that arose during the financial year but have yet to be declared and, where applicable, to an additional assessment of the provision determined on a caseby-case basis. They are determined through, on the one hand, the application of deterministic statistical methods based on historical data and, on the other hand, the use of actuarial assumptions drawing upon expert opinion to estimate total expenditure. Changes to the chosen parameters are likely to significantly affect the value of these provisions at the closing date; this is particularly relevant for  long-term  insurance  categories  for  which  the  uncertainty inherent in forecasting is generally greater. These parameters are linked, inter alia, to the uncertainty surrounding the qualification and quantification of losses, the scales (tables and rates) that will be applied to determine compensation and the probability of withdrawal in favour of an annuity in cases involving physical injury. For the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, this affects insurance categories covering  automotive  civil  liability,  general  civil  liability,  personal accident guarantees and medical professional liability.\n\nPremium  and  claims  reserves  may  be  complemented,  where appropriate, by an unexpired risks reserve when unearned premiums\n\ndo not cover the cost of the claims covered and associated costs for the period covered by such premiums, or by a reserve for increasing risks where, for long-term contracts relating to closed groups, the cost of future risk exceeds the amount of future premiums.\n\nA provision for increased risks may be required with respect to insurance against illness and disability risks when premiums are constant. It is equal to the difference in the present value of commitments entered into by the insurer and policyholders (article/uni00A0R./uni00A0343-7 5 of the Code des assurances (French Insurance Code). Its calculation relies on a continuous update of biometric databases (probability of becoming dependent, duration of care, etc.). From 2017, a supplement to the provision for increased risks has been recognised for the long-term care insurance product. This takes the form of a global provision, separate from the regulatory provision for increased risks, ensuring that the company will henceforth be in a position to withstand any future revenue shortfalls that cannot be quickly mitigated through tariff increases, contractually capped at 5% investment.  A provision is also set aside to cover technical drift risk.\n\n## Financial contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nTechnical  reserves  on  life  insurance  contracts  and  investment contracts with discretionary participation features correspond to the difference in the present value of the commitments of the insurer and those of the policyholder. Reserves are calculated using actuarial methods  including  assumptions  on  premiums,  performance  of financial assets, redemption rate and changes in general expenses. In the particular case of unit-linked contracts, the value of savings recognised as liabilities is based on the value of the financial assets (the investment units) held under the contracts. Revaluations of assets and liabilities on unit-linked contracts are recognised in profit or loss, where they cancel each other out.\n\nWhere contracts carry a significant risk of mortality (or longevity) they are also calculated with reference to regulatory mortality tables or experience tables, where these are considered more prudent. More particularly, where a minimum guaranteed death benefit is included in a unit-linked contract, guaranteeing the beneficiary at least the initial capital investment irrespective of changes in the value of units held, this is subject to a reserve determined from an economic method (stochastic  scenarios).  Life  insurance  reserves  are  discounted using the technical interest rate (guaranteed minimum interest rate, regulatory capped).\n\nWhere fees on premiums, assets managed or financial products prove to be insufficient to cover future management costs, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances records a reserve for management costs. This is determined by dividing the portfolio into homogenous categories of contract, in accordance with the provisions of article/uni00A0 142-6 of ANC regulation 2015-11. Projected accounts for each category are based on prudent assumptions as stated in the regulatory texts (surrender rate, rate of financial return, unitary management cost) and there is no offsetting between onerous and profitable categories. In 2017, in a context of persistently low interest rates, it was decided to reassess the measurement model and assumptions, which led to the recognition of a reserve.\n\nLastly, a participation reserve is recorded where returns exceeding the guaranteed minimum are allocated, by contract or regulation, to  policyholders  or  other  subscribers  to  individual  or  collective contracts but have not been paid to them during the accounting period. Where required, this reserve is completed by the deferred participation resulting from the application of the shadow accounting principle.",

        "page_content": "## Application of shadow accounting and deferred participation\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation  features  are  subject  to  'shadow  accounting'  in accordance  with  the  option  available  under  IFRS/uni00A0 4.  Shadow accounting  consists  in  recognising  in  a  deferred  participation account the share of positive or negative revaluations of financial assets backing these contracts, together with certain consolidation entries ( e.g. elimination of liquidity risk reserve) that, potentially, go to policyholders.\n\nIn addition, CRC n\u00b02000-05 regulation includes provisions for the recognition  of  deferred  participations,  mandatorily  for  deferred participation liabilities and within the limits of the recoverable amount for deferred participation assets.\n\nThis deferred participation is recorded as a liability (technical liabilities on contracts) or an asset, with a balancing entry in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income similarly to the unrealised gains or losses on the assets to which it relates.\n\nFor Predica savings contracts, the deferred participation rate is measured prospectively on the basis of studied scenarios, consistent with the management directions of the company; it is updated only when significantly varying.\n\nIn the case of net unrealised losses, a deferred participation asset is only recognised if its imputation, by entity, against future participations is highly probable. This is most notably the case if the deferred participation  asset  can  be  deducted  from  future  participations, either directly by deducting it from deferred participation liabilities recognised as a result of gains on future disposals, or indirectly by being recovered on the future sums paid to policyholders.\n\nIn case of recognition of a deferred participation asset, recoverability tests are carried out in accordance with the CNC recommendation of 19/uni00A0December 2008. They are based:\n\n- z firstly, on analyses of the liquidity of the company; these demonstrate the company's ability to mobilise resources to meet its obligations and its ability to hold assets with unrealised losses even in the event of a decline in new premium production. The tests are carried out with and without new production;\n- z secondly, on a comparison between the average value of future benefits valued using an internal model that replicates the management decisions of the company and the value of the asset supporting the market value of its obligations; this illustrates the ability of the company to honour its obligations.\n\nLastly,  sensitivity  tests  on  the  ability  to  capitalise  the  deferred participation asset are also carried out, notably in the event of a uniform increase in policy redemptions applied to the redemption rates resulting from scenarios similar to those drawn up by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution ; or a fall in equity and real estate markets.\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 4, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances ensures at the end of each reporting period that the liabilities of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features  (net  of  related  deferred  acquisition  costs  and  related intangible assets) are adequate in the light of future estimated cash flows.\n\nThe liability adequacy test to be applied for this assessment must meet the following minimum requirements set out in the standard:\n\n- z consideration of all contractual cash flows, and of related cash flows such as claims handling costs, commissions as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees;\n- z if the test shows that liabilities are inadequate, the entire deficiency is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe group's life insurance companies test the adequacy of their liabilities using a stochastic method. The test considers mathematical reserves on life insurance contracts (excluding unit-linked contracts) grouped  into  product  families  with  uniform  characteristics.  The resulting estimates of future cash flows are compared, aggregating all product families, with the sum of the following items: mathematical reserves +/uni00A0 participation reserve +/uni00A0 share of unrealised gains and losses attributed to the product families concerned. In the event that the result of the estimates is higher than this sum, an additional reserve is recognised through profit or loss.\n\nThe group's non-life insurance companies perform an annual test based  on  'best  estimate'  claims  reserves.  This  test  covers  all claims reserves, including incurred but not reported claims reserves, additional reserves for commutation to annuities and reserves for claims management costs. The analysis is carried out on the basis of data gross of reinsurance, by risk segment and financial year of occurrence.\n\nThe  'best  estimate'  claims  reserves  are  calculated  without discounting and prudential margin and correspond to the probable value of expenditure necessary to settle all outstanding claims. They are compared to accounting claims reserves, gross of reinsurance. Should the estimates exceed the recognised amounts, an additional reserve would be recognised through profit or loss.\n\nIn  addition,  where  a  reserve  for  insufficiency  of  premiums  is recognised in local accounts (in France an unexpired risks reserve), this is maintained in the consolidated accounts.\n\nRecognition of revenue on insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\n## Premiums\n\nRevenue on life insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features corresponds to premiums on contracts in force during the accounting period, net of cancellations and corrected for premiums to be written for the share to be earned in subsequent periods.\n\nRevenue on non-life insurance contracts corresponds to written premiums excluding taxes, gross of reinsurance, net of cancellations, reductions and rebates, changes in premiums not yet written and changes in premiums to be cancelled. Written premiums adjusted for  changes  in  unearned  premiums  reserves  constitute  earned premiums.\n\n## Claims expenses\n\nClaims expenses relating to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features include:\n\n- z all benefits as soon as they are settled to the beneficiary;\n- z technical interests and profit participation that can be included in these benefits;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Claims correspond to claims net of recoveries for the period,  and  to  annuity  payments.  They  also  include  costs  and commissions relating to claims handling and settlement.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nThis class of investment contracts corresponds to financial liabilities and is covered by IFRS/uni00A09. They concern primarily unit-linked contracts without minimum guarantee and without the option of transfer to an investment contract with discretionary participation features.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 9, liabilities relating to these contracts are recognised as deposits. Thus premiums received and benefits paid, net of fees deducted by the insurer, are recognised directly on the balance sheet. The only items recognised in profit or loss are revenues and expenses relating to the acquisition and management of contracts.\n\nLiabilities relating to unit-linked contracts are valued and recognised with reference to the value of financial assets (investment units) backing  these  contracts  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Revaluations of assets and liabilities on unit-linked contracts have no effect in profit or loss. This rule applies to all unit-linked contracts, whether  they  qualify  as  insurance  contracts  under  IFRS/uni00A0 4  (for example if they include a guaranteed death benefit), investment contracts  with  discretionary  participation  features  (for  example, in a multi-funds investment contract, where they include a clause allowing an arbitration to an investment contract with discretionary participation features), or investment contracts without discretionary participation features.\n\n## DEFERRED ORIGINATION COSTS, UNEARNED CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS\n\nOrigination  costs  for  investment  contracts  without  discretionary participation features are subject to a similar treatment as deferred acquisition costs for life insurance contracts covered by IFRS/uni00A04.\n\nSymmetrically with the deferral of costs incurred on origination of contracts, unearned charges and deductions are spread over time via the booking of a reserve in liabilities. These are recognised in profit or loss at the same pattern as that of deferred costs.\n\n## REINSURANCE OPERATIONS\n\n## Presentation of direct business and ceded reinsurance\n\nPremiums,  claims  and  reserves  are  recognised  gross  of  ceded reinsurance. The share of ceded reinsurance, determined based on reinsurance treaties, is identified in the income statement under separate items for ceded reinsurance income and expense.\n\nThe share of reinsurers in reserves is recognised as an asset.\n\nNo reinsurance contract falls under the scope of IFRS/uni00A09.\n\n## Accepted reinsurance\n\nAccepted reinsurance is recognised treaty by treaty, on the basis of information provided by the cedants, or estimated in the event of receipt of incomplete information. Accepted reinsurance contracts are recognised as direct insurance contracts.\n\nNo reinsurance contract incorporates characteristics (such as the absence of risk transfer) that would result in its qualification as an investment contract covered by IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nSecurities given or received as collateral for reinsurance operations are recorded in the table of commitments given and received.\n\n## Provisions (other than insurance activities)\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A0 37, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances identifies obligations (legal or constructive) resulting from a past event, where it is probable (probability higher than 50%) that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, whose timing and amount are uncertain but can be reliably estimated. Such estimates are discounted where the effect of doing so is material.\n\nTherefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises provisions which cover, in particular:\n\n- z operating risks;\n- z employee benefits (see paragraph below);\n- z legal claims and risks;\n- z tax risks.\n\nThe valuation of these provisions relies on judgment and corresponds to the management's best estimate, given information available at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Employee benefits (IAS/uni00A019)\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A019, employee benefits are divided into four categories:\n\n- z short-term employee benefits such as salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave, profit sharing and bonuses, if payable within twelve months after the end of the reporting period in which the related services were rendered;\n- z post-employment benefits, which are themselves classified into the two categories described thereafter: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans;\n- z long-term employee benefits (long-service awards, bonuses and compensation payable more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period);\n- z termination benefits.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances determines its retirement benefits and similar benefits together with all other post-employment benefits granted to employees that fall into the defined benefit plans category.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A0 19, these obligations are measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method on the basis of a set of actuarial, financial and demographic assumptions. This method consists in attributing a unit of benefit entitlement to each period of service of the employee. This unit is calculated on the basis of the discounted present value of the future benefit.\n\nCalculations of retirement benefits and future employee benefits are based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, the employee turnover rate, the rate of salary and social security costs increase, drawn up by the management (see note/uni00A09.3).",

        "page_content": "Discount  rates  are  determined  based  on  the  average  duration of the obligation, that is to say the unweight average of durations calculated between the date of valuation and the date of payment weighted for employee turn-over assumptions. The underlying used is the discount rate in reference to the iBoxx AA index.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS/uni00A0 19  revised,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances recognises  all  actuarial  gains  or  losses  in  other  comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses consist of adjustments relating to experience (difference between the estimated and actual result) and the effect of changes made to actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is determined on the basis of the discount rates used to measure the defined benefit obligation. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is stated as gains and losses recognised directly in non-transferable equity.\n\nThe amount of the defined benefit liability is equal to the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date, calculated according to the actuarial method recommended by IAS/uni00A019; less, where appropriate, the fair value of the plan assets held to cover this obligation. Such assets may be represented by a qualifying insurance policy issued by an insurer that is not a related party. Where the obligation is entirely covered by a policy corresponding exactly, in its amount and period, to all or part of the benefits to be paid under the plan, the fair value of this policy is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (that is, the amount of the corresponding actuarial liability). In the particular case where obligations are covered by an insurance policy issued by a consolidated entity, they are not offset in liabilities by the associated assets, which are recognised separately as assets.\n\nFor  non-covered  obligations,  a  provision  aimed  at  covering termination benefits is recognised as a liability under the heading 'Provisions'. This provision equals the amount of the obligations relating to employees of entities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, in service at the end of the reporting period and covered by the Collective Employment Agreement of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group that came into force on 1/uni00A0January 2005.\n\nA provision aimed at covering the cost of early departures is also included under the heading 'Provisions'. This provision covers the present value of the additional cost resulting from the various early departure  agreements  signed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  entities which allow employees reaching the required age to be exempt from their service.\n\nLastly, supplementary  retirement  obligations,  which  generate obligations for the companies concerned, are subject to provisions determined from the actuarial debt representing these obligations. These provisions are also recognised as liabilities on the balance sheet under the heading 'Provisions' (see note/uni00A09.3).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThere are various mandatory retirement plans to which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations  and  the  contributing  companies  have  no  legal  or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions if the plans do not have sufficient assets to provide all the benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the current and prior reporting years. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has no liabilities in this respect other than the contributions to be paid for the past reporting period (see note/uni00A09.2).\n\n## LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nLong-term employee benefits are employee benefits, other than post-employment benefits and termination benefits, but not fully due to employees within twelve months after the end of the reporting period in which the related services were rendered.\n\nThis particularly concerns bonuses and other deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of the reporting period in which they were acquired, but which are not indexed on equity instruments\n\nThe measurement method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits falling under the defined benefit plans category.\n\n## Share-based payments (IFRS/uni00A02)\n\nThe  IFRS/uni00A0 2/uni00A0 standard  Share-based  payment  specifies  the measurement of share-based payment transactions in the income statement and balance sheet of the company. This standard applies to transactions entered into with employees and more precisely to:\n\n- z equity-settled share-based payment transactions;\n- z cash-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\nShare-based payment plans initiated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group that are eligible for IFRS/uni00A0 2 are mainly transactions settled in equity instruments (stock options, free share allocation plans, variable compensation settled in indexed cash or in shares, etc.).\n\nGranted options are measured at grant date at their fair value mainly according to the Black & Scholes model. These are recognised as expenses under the heading 'staff costs' with an ongoing balancing entry in an equity account over the vesting period.\n\nThe  expense  relative  to  share-based  payment  plans  settled  in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. equity instruments is recognised in the financial statements of the entities employing the plan beneficiaries. The impact is included in staff costs against an increase in consolidated reserves (Group share).\n\n## Current and deferred tax (IAS/uni00A012)\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A012, income tax includes all taxes based on income, whether current or deferred.\n\nIAS/uni00A012 defines the current tax liability as 'the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.' Taxable profit is the profit (loss) for a period determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities.\n\nThe taxation rates and rules applicable for the determination of the current tax liability are those in force in each of the countries in which subsidiaries of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are based.\n\nThe  current  tax  liability  includes  all  income  taxes,  payable  or recoverable, whose payment is not subject to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several periods.\n\nThe current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount already paid in respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for these periods, the excess shall be recognised as an asset.\n\nIn addition, certain transactions conducted by the entity may have tax consequences not taken into account in the determination of the current tax liability. Differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base are defined by IAS/uni00A012 as temporary differences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

They do not therefore give rise to the recognition of deferred taxes. Where the securities in question are classified in the category of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, unrealised gains or losses are recognised in equity. Thus, the actual tax expense or tax reduction incurred by the entity in relation to these unrealised gains or losses is reclassified by deduction of the latter.\n\nIn France long-term capital gains on the sale of equity investments, as defined by the General Tax Code, are exempt to tax; with the exception of 12% of long-term capital gains that are taxed at the normally applicable rate. Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the year generate a temporary difference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share.\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A016 Leases, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right of use and a deferred tax asset on the rental debt for leases for which the Group is a lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the financial year, unless the tax arises from:\n\n- z either a transaction or event which is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the same or a different period, in which case it is directly credited or debited in other comprehensive income;\n- z or a business combination.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other if, and only if:\n\n- z the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and\n- z the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority:\n- z either on the same taxable entity,\n- z or on different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nTax risks relating to income tax result in the recognition of a current tax receivable or liability when the probability of receiving the asset or paying the liability is considered more likely than not. These risks are also taken into account in evaluating current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nInterpretation IFRIC/uni00A0 23 concerning the valuation of uncertain tax positions applies if an entity has identified one or more uncertainties about the positions taken concerning its taxes. It also provides clarification on making estimates:\n\n- z analysis must be based on 100% detection by the tax authorities;\n- z the tax risk must be recognised in liabilities if it is more likely than unlikely that the tax authorities will question the treatment applied, for an amount reflecting management's best estimate;\n- z if the probability of repayment by the tax authorities is more than 50%, a receivable should be recognised.\n\nTax credits on income from receivables and securities portfolios, when effectively used in the settlement of income tax due for the reporting period, are recognised under the same heading as the income to which they relate. The corresponding tax expense is maintained under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions (IAS/uni00A021)\n\nOn the reporting date, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's operating currency.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A021, a distinction is made between monetary ( e.g. : debt  instruments)  and  non-monetary  items  ( e.g. : equity instruments).\n\nForeign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the income statement. There are three exceptions to this rule:\n\n- z for debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the component of the foreign exchange difference relating to the amortised cost is recognised through profit or loss; the rest is recognised in other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified);\n- z exchange differences on items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge or that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified);\n- z for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, the exchange differences linked to credit risk fair value variations are recognised in other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified).\n\nThe treatment of non-monetary items varies according to the nature of these items:\n\n- z items at historical cost are measured using the exchange rate at the transaction date;\n- z items at fair value are measured using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.",

They are classified as finance leases or operating leases.\n\nIn the case of finance leases, they are considered equivalent to a capital sale to the lessee financed by a credit granted by the lessor. The analysis of the economic substance of finance leases leads the lessor to:\n\n- z remove the leased asset from the balance sheet;\n- z record a financial debt for the customer under 'financial assets at amortised cost' for a value equal to the present value at the contract's implicit rate of the rental payments due to the lessor under the lease, plus any non-guaranteed residual value owed to the lessor;\n- z recognise deferred taxes for temporary differences relating to the financial debt and the net carrying value of the leased asset;\n- z break down the rental income into interest and principal.\n\nIn the case of operating leases, the lessor recognises the leased assets under 'property, plant & equipment' or 'Investment property' depending on the nature of the asset leased on the assets side of its balance sheet and records the rental income on a straight-line basis under 'income from other activities' or 'Investment Income' in the income statement depending on the nature of the asset leased.\n\n## LEASES FOR WHICH THE GROUP IS THE LESSEE\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet on the date on which the leased asset is made available. The lessee records an asset representing the right of use of the leased asset under 'property, plant & equipment' over the estimated term of the contract and a liability representing the rental payment obligation under 'miscellaneous liabilities' over the same term.\n\nThe lease period of a contract corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the lease adjusted for the contract extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and the termination option that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise.\n\nIn  France,  the  term  used  for  the  '3/6/9'  commercial  leases  is generally nine years with an initial non-cancellable period of three years. The Group applied a duration corresponding to the first post 5-year exit option, this being the reasonably certain duration of a lease. This duration is applied in most cases when initiating French commercial leases. The main exception is in the case of a lease in which intermediate triennial exit options have been waived ( e.g. in return for a rent reduction). In this case, the duration of the lease is still nine years. This 5-year period is also applied to leases extended by tacit agreement.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised for an amount equal to the present value of the rental payments over the term of the contract. Rental\n\npayments include fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or index, and payments that the lessee expects to pay as residual value guarantees, purchase options or early termination penalties. Variable rents that are not based on an index or rate and the nondeductible VAT on rents are excluded when calculating the debt and are recognised under 'operating expenses'.\n\nThe discount rate applicable to the calculation of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is, by default, the lessee's marginal rate of indebtedness over the term of the contract on the date of signature of the contract, when the implicit rate cannot easily be established. The marginal rate of indebtedness takes account of the rent payment structure. It reflects the terms of the lease (duration, guarantee, economic environment, etc.). The Group has applied the IFRS/uni00A0 IC's decision of 17/uni00A0 September 2019 since IFRS/uni00A0 16 was implemented (this decision has no impact).\n\nThe rental expense is broken down into interest and principal.\n\nThe right of use of the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability plus the initial direct costs, advance payments and restoration costs. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event of amendment to the lease, re-estimation of the lease period or rent review related to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised as temporary differences in right-ofuse assets and rental liabilities by the lessee.\n\nIn accordance with the exception set out in the standard, short-term leases (initial term of less than twelve months) and leases for which the new value of the leased asset is low are not recognised on the balance sheet; the corresponding leasing expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement under 'operating expenses'.\n\nIn accordance with the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS/uni00A016 to leases of intangible assets.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS/uni00A015)\n\nFee  and  commission  income  and  expenses  are  recognised  in profit or loss based on the nature of services with which they are associated.\n\nFees and commissions that are an integral part of the effective yield on a financial instrument are recognised as an adjustment to the yield on the instrument and included in its effective interest rate.\n\nThe recognition of other types of fees and commissions in profit or loss must reflect the rate of transfer to the customer of the control of the goods or services sold.\n\nThe income from a transaction associated with the provision of services is recognised at the time of transfer of control of the service to the customer, if this can be reliably estimated. This transfer may occur as the service is provided (ongoing service) or on a specific date (one-off service).\n\n- z Fee and commission income from ongoing services is recognised in profit or loss according to the degree of progress of the service provided.\n- z Fee and commission income paid or received as compensation for one-off services is recognised in profit or loss, in its entirety, when the service is provided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period. In practice, this condition can result in the deferred recognition of certain items of performance-related fee and commission income until the expiry of the performance assessment  period  and  until  such  income  has  been  definitively acquired.\n\nWithin the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group, revenues falling under the scope of IFRS/uni00A015 mainly concern revenues linked to investment contracts without discretionary participation features (commissions retrocessions).\n\n## Analysis of general expenses by function\n\nIn accordance  with  paragraph/uni00A0 99  of  IAS/uni00A0 1  and  the  ANC recommendation  No./uni00A0 2013-R-05  of  7/uni00A0 November  2013,  general expenses are analysed by function.\n\nThus, in the consolidated income statement of the Group, general expenses are presented according to the following functions:\n\n- z acquisition and similar expenses;\n- z claims handling expenses;\n- z investment management expenses;\n- z administrative expenses;\n- z other technical expenses;\n- z other non-technical expenses.\n\nThe analysis of expenses by nature is presented under the following headings:\n\n- z staff costs;\n- z commissions;\n- z taxes;\n- z other.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations (IFRS/uni00A05)\n\nA non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\nFor this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities concerned are recognised separately on the balance sheet under the headings 'Assets held for sale including discontinued  operations'  and  'Liabilities  held  for  sale  including discontinued operations'.\n\nThese non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs of sale. In case of unrealised loss, an impairment is recognised in profit or loss. In addition, such assets are no longer depreciated from their classification as held for sale.\n\nIf the fair value less costs of sale of the disposal group is lower than its carrying amount less impairment of non-current assets, the difference is allocated to the other assets of the disposal group, including financial assets, and recognised in the net income of assets held for sale.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and is in one of the following situations:\n\n- z it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- z it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n- z it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe  following  are  presented  on  a  separate  line  of  the  income statement:\n\n- z the net post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations until the disposal date;\n- z the post-tax gain or loss resulting from the disposal or the measurement at fair value less costs of sale of the assets and liabilities constituting discontinued operations.\n\n## Consolidation principles and policies (IFRS/uni00A010, IFRS/uni00A011 and IAS/uni00A028)\n\n## Consolidation scope\n\nThe  consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and of all companies over which, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS/uni00A010, IFRS/uni00A011 and IAS/uni00A028, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has control, joint control, or significant influence.\n\n## PRINCIPLE OF CONTROL\n\nIn accordance with international accounting standards, all the entities under control, joint control or significant influence are consolidated, provided that they do not fall within the scope of the exclusions mentioned thereafter.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is presumed to control an entity if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and if it is able to use its power over this entity to affect those returns. For the purpose of assessing this principle of power, only substantive (voting or contractual) rights shall be considered. Rights are substantive if their holder is able in practice to exercise them  when  making  decisions  concerning  the  entity's  relevant activities.\n\nControl over a subsidiary governed by voting rights is determined when the voting rights held give Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances the current ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances generally controls the subsidiary if it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the existing or potential voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such ownership does not allow it to direct the relevant  activities.  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  also  has  control over an entity if it holds half or less than half of the voting rights, including potential voting rights, of an entity, but in practice has the capacity to direct the relevant activities on its own, in particular due to the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of the investor's holding of voting rights relative to the dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, or other facts and circumstances.\n\nControl over a structured entity is not determined by the percentage of voting rights that by nature have no impact on the returns generated by the entity. Analysis of control takes contractual arrangements into account, and also the involvement and decisions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in the creation of the entity, arrangements entered into at inception and risks incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, rights",

        "page_content": "resulting from agreements that give the investor the power to direct the relevant activities solely under specific circumstances, as well as other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor has the ability of directing the entity's relevant activities. If there is an investment mandate in force, the scope of the decision-making authority  relating  to  the  delegation  of  power  over  the  entity  to the manager, as well as the remuneration to which it is entitled in accordance with the contractual agreements, are analysed in order to determine whether the manager is acting as an agent (delegated power) or principal (for its own account).\n\nThus, when decisions relating to the entity's relevant activities are to be taken, the factors to consider in determining whether an entity is acting as agent or principal, are the following: the scope of the decision-making authority relating to the delegation of power over the entity to the manager, the remuneration to which it is entitled in  accordance  with  the  contractual  agreements,  and  also  the substantive rights held by the other parties involved in the entity that may affect the ability of the decision-maker, and the exposure to variability of returns from other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is exercised if there is a contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity. Decisions affecting the entity's relevant  activities  require  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties sharing control.\n\nIn traditional entities, significant influence results from the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity without controlling the latter. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is presumed to have significant influence if it holds, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting rights of an entity.\n\n## EXCLUSIONS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A028, minority interests held by entities for which the option allowed by article/uni00A018 of this standard has been used, are excluded from the consolidation scope insofar they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Consolidation methods\n\nThe consolidation methods are defined respectively by IFRS/uni00A010 and IAS/uni00A028. They reflect the nature of control exercised by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances over the entities that can be consolidated, whatever their activity and whether or not they are incorporated:\n\n- z full consolidation for entities under control, including entities with different accounting structures, even if their activity is not an extension of that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances;\n- z the equity method, for entities under significant influence and under joint control.\n\nFull consolidation consists in substituting the assets and liabilities of each subsidiary for the value of shares held. Non-controlling interests in equity and income are recognised separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are as defined by IFRS/uni00A0 10 and include instruments that are present ownership interests and which entitle to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation together with other equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the group.\n\nThe equity method consists in substituting the Group's share in equity and income of concerned entities for the value of shares held.\n\nChanges in the carrying amount of these securities take changes in goodwill into account.\n\nIn the event of additional acquisitions or partial disposals, with the maintenance of joint control or significant influence, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises:\n\n- z in the case of an increase in ownership interest held, additional goodwill;\n- z in the case of a decrease in ownership interest held, a gain or loss on disposal/dilution through profit or loss.\n\nFurthermore, for the recognition of its participation in certain entities on  which  it  has  a  significant  influence,  the  Group  applies  the exemption of the equity method as permitted by IAS/uni00A028 \u00a7/uni00A018. This measurement exemption allows an entity to elect to measure at fair value through profit or loss an investment in an associate or a joint venture, that is held by, or indirectly held through, an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds.\n\n## Restatement and elimination of Intragroup transactions\n\nWhere necessary, financial statements are restated to harmonise the valuation methods applied to consolidated companies.\n\nThe  impact  of  Group  internal  transactions  on  the  consolidated balance  sheet  and  income  statement  is  eliminated  for  fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital  gains  or  losses  arising  from  intra-group  asset  transfers are eliminated; any potential impairment measured at the time of disposal in an internal transaction is recognise.\n\n## Translation of foreign subsidiaries' financial statements (IAS/uni00A021)\n\nThe financial statements of entities representing a 'foreign operation' (subsidiary, branch, associate or joint venture) are converted into euros in two steps:\n\n- z if applicable, the local currency in which the financial statements are prepared is converted into the functional currency (currency of the main business environment of the entity). The conversion is made as if the information had been recognised initially in the functional currency (same conversion principles as for foreign currency transactions here above);\n- z the functional currency is converted into euros, the currency in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are converted at the closing exchange rate. Equity items, such as share capital or reserves, are converted at their historical foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses included in the income statement are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign exchange impacts resulting from this conversion are recognised as a separate component of shareholders' equity. In the event of exit from the foreign operation (disposal, repayment of capital, liquidation, discontinuation of activity) or in the event of deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without disposal), these conversion differences are recognised in the income statement when the result of exit or loss of control is recognised .\n\n## Business combinations - goodwill\n\n## GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition method in accordance with IFRS/uni00A03, except for business combinations under common control (in particular mergers of Regional Banks), which are excluded from the field of application of IFRS/uni00A03.

However, as allowed under IFRS/uni00A04 for the acquisition of an insurance company, the liabilities relating to the life insurance contracts or investment  contracts  with  discretionary  participation  features acquired are maintained at their carrying amount on the balance sheet  of  the  acquiree  (after  harmonisation  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances measurement methods if necessary) and the value of these portfolios of contracts is recognised in assets and amortised over the period of payment of profits. This portfolio value represents the present value of future profits on the contracts acquired and corresponds to the difference between the fair value of contracts and their carrying amount.\n\nNo restructuring liability is recognised as a liability of the acquiree unless the latter, at the acquisition date, is obliged to carry out this restructuring.\n\nPrice adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value, even if their realisation is not probable. Subsequent changes in fair value of the clauses, which have the characteristics of financial debt, are recognised in profit or loss. Only those price adjustment clauses relating to operations where the acquisition of control took place before 31/uni00A0December 2009 may still be recognised against goodwill, as such transactions were initially recognised under non-revised IFRS/uni00A03/uni00A0standard (2004).\n\nThe non-controlling interests that are shares of current interests giving rights to a share of the net assets in the event of liquidation may be measured, at acquirer's choice, in two ways:\n\n- z at fair value at the acquisition date;\n- z at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThis option may be exercised on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nThe balance non-controlling interests (equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group) should be recognised for its fair value on the date of acquisition.\n\nThe initial measurement of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities may be adjusted within a maximum period of twelve months from the acquisition date.\n\nSome transactions relating to the acquired entity are recognised separately from the business combination. This applies primarily to:\n\n- z transactions that in effect settle a pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and the acquiree;\n- z transactions that remunerate employees or former owners of the acquiree for future services;\n- z transactions that reimburse the acquiree or its former owners for paying the acquirer's acquisition related costs.\n\nThese separate transactions are generally recognised in profit or loss at the acquisition date.\n\nThe transferred consideration at the time of a business combination (the acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values transferred by the acquirer, on the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments, etc.).\n\nCosts  directly  attributable  to  the  combination  in  question  are recognised in expenses, separately from the combination. If the transaction has a very high probability of being completed they are recognised under the heading 'Net gains or losses on other assets', otherwise they are recognised under 'Other operating costs'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the acquisition cost and noncontrolling interests, and the net balance, at the acquisition date, of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value, is recognised, where positive, as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet, under the heading 'Goodwill' where the acquiree is fully consolidated, and under the heading 'Investments in equity affiliates' where the acquiree is consolidated by the equity method. If this difference is negative, it is immediately recognised through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  at  its  initial  cost denominated in the acquiree's currency and translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\nIn the event of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree shall be remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value through profit or loss, and goodwill is computed only once, on the basis of the acquisitiondate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nSubsequent measurement of goodwill is described in the note on accounting principles and methods.\n\nIn the event of an increase in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' ownership interest  in  an  entity  over  which  it  already  exercises  exclusive control, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised as a reduction in the heading 'Consolidated reserves, Group share'. Symmetrically, in the event of a reduction in the ownership interest held by the Group in an entity remaining exclusively controlled, the difference between the disposal price and the carrying amount of the share in net assets sold is also recognised directly in the Group share of consolidated reserves. Costs relating to such transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the event of a loss of control, the result of the disposal is calculated for the entirety of the entity sold and any residual investment share retained is recognised in the balance sheet at its fair value at the date of loss of control.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OF ENTITIES UNDER COMMON CONTROL\n\nThis type of combination applies to entities that are already controlled by the group. In this event, transfers and sales are not recognised at fair value but at their net carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the parent at the date of the combination, provided such values were established in accordance with IFRS standards. Existing goodwill in the Group's accounts at this date is maintained in the same manner as other assets.\n\nThis strict application results in summing the equity accounts of the various entities concerned. If the transaction price is different from the net carrying amount of the acquirees, this method results in recognising the difference directly in consolidated reserves without recognising any additional goodwill.\n\nThe constitution of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in 2008, as a result of the restructuring of the insurance activities of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, was conducted under this principle.",

To assist customers whose business was affected by the virus, the Group played an active role in measures to support the economy.\n\n## Outreach measures inspired by its mutualist roots\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group played an active role in the outreach measures initiated by the insurance sector to deal with the consequences of the crisis.\n\nFor  example,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  provided a  support  programme  inspired  by  its  mutualist  values,  allowing its business customers to cope with loss of business due to the health crisis but not covered by their usual insurance. This support programme resulted in the payment to all Pacifica and La M\u00e9dicale customers holding a multi-risk business insurance policy suffering a loss of business of a sum corresponding to a flat-rate estimate of the loss of income for the sector concerned during the period. These measures had an impact on the item 'Claims expenses' in the income statement of \u20ac236.4/uni00A0million as at 31/uni00A0December 2020. They were partly covered by Pacifica's network of partner banks and La M\u00e9dicale's general insurance agents (\u20ac102.5/uni00A0million) by means of a reduction in the amount of commission fees paid to them by these entities.\n\nTo support vulnerable people (such as pregnant women in their third trimester and people on long-term sick leave) signed off work for preventive reasons in accordance with national health insurance recommendations,  La  M\u00e9dicale  also  covered  daily  indemnity payments for these contracts. This measure applies up to a limit of  21/uni00A0 days  off  work,  subject  to  the  same  conditions  as  being signed off work by a doctor due to illness. La M\u00e9dicale's death & disability contract also applies in accordance with the cover taken (fixed allowances and excess, excluding general expenses).

At 31/uni00A0December 2020, this update of the Group's impairment testing taking account of the significant negative effects on the economy relating to Covid-19, as well as the measures to support the economy taken by the French government,  did  not  result  in  any  additional  impairment  being recognised on goodwill.\n\nGoodwill as at 1/uni00A0 January 2020 was tested for impairment on the basis of the assessment of the value in use of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance entities. The value in use is calculated on the basis of the updated estimate of the CGU's future cash flows as a result of medium-term plans established for the Group's steering needs. The following assumptions were made:\n\n- z equity allocated to insurance activities corresponds to projected solvency requirements taking account of each entity's economic situation in terms of subordinated debt;\n- z growth rate: 2%;\n- z discount rate: different rates for each region, from 7.6% to 9.45%.\n\nGo odwill values as at 31/uni00A0December 2020 are justified.\n\nFurthermore, the sensitivity tests performed show that a variation of +50 basis points in discount rates would not result in any significant impairment.\n\n- z estimated future cash flows: projections mainly over a horizon of 3 to 5/uni00A0years established for the Group's steering needs;\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are subject to change in subsequent periods due to developments in market conditions or other factors.\n\nThe calculations represent best estimates. They are based on a number of assumptions. It is assumed that market participants act in their best economic interest.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  these  models  contain  uncertainties,  the  fair values shown may not be achieved upon actual sale or immediate settlement of the financial instruments concerned.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities is broken down according to the general observability criteria of the valuation inputs, pursuant to the principles defined under IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nLevel/uni00A0 1 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities quoted in active markets.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with observable inputs. This agreement includes market data relating to interest rate risk or credit risk when the latter can be revalued based on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread. Securities bought or sold under repurchase agreements with underlyings quoted in an active market are also included in Level/uni00A02 of the hierarchy, as are financial assets and liabilities with a demand component for which fair value is measured at unadjusted amortised cost.\n\nLevel/uni00A03 indicates the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable inputs or for which some data can be revalued using internal models based on historical data. This mainly includes market data relating to credit risk or early redemption risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This applies primarily to:\n\n- z assets or liabilities at variable rates for which interest rate changes do not have a significant influence on the fair value, since the rates on these instruments frequently adjust themselves to the market rates;\n- z short-term assets or liabilities where the redemption value is considered to be close to the market value;\n- z instruments executed on a regulated market for which the prices are set by the public authorities;\n- z demand assets and liabilities;\n- z transactions for which there are no reliable observable data.\n\nThe financial markets have been severely disrupted and subject to considerable volatility since the Covid-19 crisis began. This situation\n\nis a source of concerns relating to determining the fair value of unlisted financial investments in view of the practical difficulties in valuing these instruments, particularly in certain cases due to a lack of recent and reliable observable data.\n\nIn insurance undertakings' portfolios, these financial investments usually  correspond  to  unlisted  equity  interests,  units  in  venture capital funds ('Fonds Commun de Placement \u00e0 Risques' or FCPR), units in securitisation funds such as FCTs, FCCs and investments whose underlying assets may be real estate or infrastructure assets.\n\nThese investments are generally classified in level/uni00A03 of the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments under IFRS/uni00A0 13, i.e. instruments whose valuation is based on unobservable data.\n\nIn view of the current uncertainty about the consequences, duration and severity of the crisis, the process for determining the fair value of these unlisted investments has undergone a number of changes to take account of this specific situation as at 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\n## 6.5.1 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT AMORTISED COST AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nAmounts presented below include accruals and prepayments and are net of impairment.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                                               | Book Value  31/12/2020                                       | Estimated  fair value at   31/12/2020                        | Quoted prices  in active  markets for  identical   instruments: level 1   | Valuation based  on observable  data:  level 2               | Valuation  based on  unobservable  data:   level 3           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet | Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet | Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet | Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet              | Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet | Financial assets not measured at fair value on balance sheet |\n| Loans and receivables                                        | 900                                                          | 858                                                          | -

The amounts vary according to practices and collective bargaining agreements.\n\n- z post-employment benefits: no end-of-career benefits were paid but \u20ac0.50/uni00A0 million was paid under the supplementary pension plan for Group Senior Executive Officers;\n- z other long-term benefits: not applicable;\n- z termination benefits: not applicable;\n- z share-based payments: not applicable.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances perceived in 2020 a total of 144,000/uni00A0euros in directors' compensation (formerly known as directors' fees)  under their mandate to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report includes information specifically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of statutory auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances for the year ended December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at December/uni00A031, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report .\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014           .\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncer      tainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above We do not provide a separate opinio  n on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement of reserves specifically for long-term care\n\nAs regards the long-term care risk, specific reserves amounted to \u20ac1,173/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020. This amount is recognized under technical liabilities relating to insurance policies, which amounted to \u20ac249/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nSee notes/uni00A01 and 6.23 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nIn respect of health and disability cover, a reserve for increasing risks is recorded when the present value of the insurer's commitments (payment of benefits) is higher than the projected contributions of policyholders.\n\nThis  reserve  is  determined  prospectively,  over  the  lifetime  of  the  contract, which involves a large number of assumptions such as the remaining years of independent living, the likelihood of a state of partial or total dependence, the duration of the state of dependence, future premiums and the discount rate of the cash flows.\n\nThe long duration of the commitments in question makes calculating this reserve sensitive to changes in the financial markets when determining the discount rate used, especially in the context of the unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by Covid-19. The crisis has led to heightened market volatility and in addition, interest rates are historically low.\n\nIn light of the significant degree of judgment exercised by management when determining the assumptions used to make these estimates, in an exceptional economic context, we deemed the measurement of the reserve for increasing risks to be a key audit matter.\n\nAssisted by our actuarial experts, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- z assessing the relevance of the methodology used;\n- z gaining an understanding of the results of the controls implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to verify the accuracy of the management data underlying the calculation of the reserve;\n- z analyzing the assumptions regarding future premiums, life expectancy, the likelihood of a state of dependence, and the duration of the state of dependence, in light of the applicable rules and our audit experience;\n- z assessing the discount rate used in light of the estimated projected average yield on assets;\n- z recalculating the reserve based on data from the scale;\n- z assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Liability adequacy test - Predica\n\nPredica has implemented a test which ensures that, at December/uni00A031, 2020, the technical liabilities of life insurance contracts and financial contracts with discretionary participation features are adequate in relation to their estimated future cash flows.\n\nSee notes/uni00A01 and 6.23 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nAs required by IFRS/uni00A0 4, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances verifies at each reporting date that the liabilities recognized in respect of insurance contracts and financial contracts with discretionary participation features are adequate to cover future commitments to policyholders. This takes the form of a test performed as part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, to ensure the adequacy of the reserves set aside.\n\nFor this purpose, future commitments to policyholders in respect of life insurance contracts are estimated using a stochastic approach to project future cash flows based on the probability of certain scenarios occurring.\n\nThese  scenarios  are  based  on  assumptions  concerning  changes  in  the economic and financial environment impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis, which has resulted in a sharp drop in stock market prices and significant market volatility,  combined  with  historically  low  interest  rates.  Policyholder  behavior and the insurer's management decisions have also changed. Any change in the assumptions used, particularly those used by management as regards discount rates, will have an impact on the estimate of the future cash flows against which the recognized technical reserves, net of deferred acquisition costs and portfolio values, are compared.\n\nIn the event of inadequacy, the Group recognizes an additional reserve, which would have a direct impact on the Group's net income.\n\nAssisted by our actuarial experts, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- z familiarizing ourselves with the methodology used by Predica;\n- z assessing the consistency of the economic and financial assumptions used with market data, particularly in the context of the current health crisis related to Covid-19;\n- z examining the controls implemented in relation to the integration of asset and liability data and financial and non-financial assumptions into the calculation model;\n- z comparing data produced by the projection model with the future cash flows presented in the Predica liability adequacy test;\n- z analyzing changes in discounted future cash flows and recognized reserves when compared with the same captions at December/uni00A031,/uni00A02019;\n- z examining the sensitivity of the test result to changes in the main financial assumptions (rates and shares) and the portfolio (redemption rate) in order to ensure that the reserves remained adequate in these different scenarios;\n- z assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn light of the significant degree of judgment required to assess the scenarios used, in the context of Covid-19 as indicated above, and the duration of the projections, we deemed the liability adequacy test performed on Predica, the Group's main life insurance subsidiary, to be a key audit matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n267\n\n6",

They are composed mainly of reserves for claims on a caseby-case basis and for claims incurred but not reported (IBNRs).\n\nSee notes/uni00A01 and 6.23 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nTechnical  reserves  for  non-life  insurance  contracts  include  claims  reserves, covering the total cost of claims incurred but not yet settled. These reserves comprise an estimate of the cost of late claims that occurred during the year but have not yet been reported and, where applicable, an additional measurement of the reserve in question, determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nClaims reserves are determined by applying deterministic statistical methods based  on  historical  data  and  using  actuarial  assumptions  requiring  expert judgment to estimate the total cost.\n\nChanges in the inputs used can significantly affect the value of these reserves at the end of the reporting period, particularly for long-tail lines of   business, for which the inherent uncertainty of the attainment of forecasts is generally higher. For the Group, these lines of business correspond to motor, general, medical and life accident insurance.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of these reserves to be a key audit matter given their  materiality  to  the  financial  statements,  the  degree  of  expert  judgment required and the variety and complexity of the actuarial methods implemented to measure the reserves for these lines of business.\n\nAssisted by our actuarial experts and members with particular expertise in information systems, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- z gaining an understanding of the control environment relating to the reserve calculation process, the claims management process, which determines the measurement of reserves recognized on a case-by-case basis, and the information systems used in processing technical data and inputting said data into the accounting systems;\n- z testing the key controls set up by management, which we deemed to be the most relevant in the reserve calculation process;\n- z reconciling the accounting data with the historical data underlying the estimates;\n- z analyzing significant changes in order to identify their origin and circumstances and examining the outcome of the previous year's accounting estimates;\n- z examining the statistical methods and the actuarial inputs used as well as the consistency of the assumptions used with regard to market practices, the specific economic and financial environment of the Group and our audit experience;\n- z independently estimating reserves for IBNR on long-tail lines of business and reviewing the amount of the related reserves recognized;\n- z assessing the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of financial investments not quoted in an active market and investment properties\n\nThe Group's insurance business investments totaled \u20ac419/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020, of which \u20ac83/uni00A0billion at Level/uni00A02 and \u20ac10/uni00A0billion at Level/uni00A03. The carrying amount of the investment property classed as Level/uni00A02 is \u20ac6/uni00A0billion.\n\nSee notes/uni00A01, 6.3 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nFinancial investments recognized at fair value are presented in accordance with the hierarchy defined by IFRS/uni00A013.\n\nThe Group's assets classed as Level/uni00A0 2 mainly comprise equities and bonds quoted on an inactive market and valued by applying a method commonly used by market players, and over-the-counter instruments valued based on models that use observable market data. They also include directly-owned property assets assessed by independent and chartered experts.\n\nThe assets classed as Level/uni00A03 are essentially units in French venture capital funds ( Fonds Communs de Placement \u00e0 Risques ) and unlisted securities valued using assumptions that are not supported by observable market data for the same instrument.\n\nThese valuations also take into account liquidity and counterparty risks, where applicable.\n\nIn the current context of the Covid-19 health crisis and in consideration of the uncertain economic environment, we deem the measurement of these reserves to be a key audit matter given the degree of expert judgment required and the variety and complexity of the actuarial methods implemented for their measurement.\n\nAssisted by our valuation experts, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- z updating our knowledge of the internal control environment linked to the valuation process of these financial and property assets;\n- z for assets valued by internal valuation models:\n- z assessing the consistency of the assumptions, methods and inputs used as regards market practice and the economic context,\n- z assessing the valuations used and recognized at December/uni00A031, 2020;\n- z for assets valued by external management companies and for property assets:\n- z comparing the valuations used at December/uni00A031, 2020 with the reports sent by asset management companies and real estate experts,\n- z for assets directly impacted by the health and economic crisis: examining the reports of independent experts by analyzing whether the related risks had been correctly taken into consideration;\n- z for assets whose valuation was established at a date prior to the closing date: assessing the analyses conducted by the Group to address any significant disparity between the valuations used and the valuations on the closing date;\n- z assessing the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Regarding the consolidated financial statements, our work included verifying that the markups in the financial statements comply with the format defined by the aforementioned Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the single European electronic reporting format.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to ensure that the consolidated financial statements to be included by the Company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF correspond to those on which we carried out our work.\n\n## Appointment of the statutory auditor s\n\nWe were appointed statutory auditors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances by the Annual General Meeting held on May/uni00A05, 2008        .\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, our firms were in the thirteenth consecutive year of their engagement and the seventh year since the Company's securities were admitted to trading on a regulated market   .\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations .\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and financial reporting procedures .\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors .\n\n## Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated fi     nancial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0 L.823101 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- z identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- z evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- z obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article/uni00A06 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit and Accounts Committ       ee.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A022, 2021\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Trouillard-Mignen\n\nAnik Chaumartin-Roesch\n\nOlivier Drion\n\nOlivier Durand",

Long-term receivables are, where applicable, depreciated in order to reflect their current value at the end of the financial year.\n\n## 3.5 Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are shown at their acquisition cost, at the end of the financial year, the cost of acquisition of marketable securities is compared with the book value (net asset value) in the case of SICAV and FCP and with the average market price of the last month of the financial year for other securities.\n\n## 3.6 Accruals and prepaid expenses\n\nAccruals and prepaid expenses comprise expenses corresponding to loan issue costs, issue premiums and prepaid expenses.\n\n## 3.7 Other equity capital\n\nThis includes debt with special terms attached, presented on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in an intermediate section named 'Other equity capital'.\n\nThese loans are valued at historical cost. The coupons represent financial expenses (the accrued coupons are recognised whether payment is deferred or not).\n\n## 3.8 Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions are booked when it is likely or certain that an obligation towards a third party will result in an outflow of resources to this third party without receiving at least an equivalent benefit in exchange, and  the  maturity  or  amount  of  which  is  not  set  precisely  but\n\nmay be reliably estimated. This provision is stated at the amount corresponding to the best estimate on the date of preparing the financial statements of the outflow of resources needed to settle this obligation.\n\n## 3.9 Financing debts\n\nThe securities for which there is no contractual obligation to submit cash or another financial asset are as considered financing debts.\n\nThese  are  perpetual  subordinated  securities  and  redeemable subordinated notes.\n\n## 3.10 Financial income and expenses\n\nFinancial income and expenses principally include:\n\n- z interests on loans taken out (expenses) and loans granted to subsidiaries (income); these interests being calculated in accordance with the contractual conditions of these;\n\n## 3.11 Taxation\n\nThe company became part of the tax consolidation mechanism of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 1/uni00A0January 2007.\n\n- z dividends and interim dividends received;\n- z coupons received (income) and, where applicable, realised capital gains and losses on the disposal of marketable securities (income or expenses).\n\nAccording  to  the  tax  consolidation  agreement  between  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances S.A., the tax charge incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances S.A. in respect of each consolidation period is the same as it would have been if it had been taxed separately.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf there is an unrealised capital loss, a depreciation of the securities is recognised for the full amount of the capital loss.\n\nIssue costs and issue premiums are spread out over the duration of the loan if it has a definite term, or until the first date of exercise of the redemption option if it has an indefinite term.\n\nThe  impairments  recorded  on  financial  assets  are  due  to  the comparison of the value in use and the entry cost of these assets.\n\nUnrealised capital losses are subject to depreciation and are not offset against unrealised capital gains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT  ON THE/uni00A0 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors' report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of Englishspeaking readers. This report includes information specifically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of statutory auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n(For the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2020)\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting,\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\n16-18, boulevard Vaugirard\n\n75015 Paris\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances for the year ended December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company at December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant in our audit of the financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nWe determined that there were no key audit matters to discuss in our report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- z identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- z obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- z evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;\n- z assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- z evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article/uni00A06 of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit and Accounts Committee  .\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A022, 2021\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Trouillard-Mignen\n\nAnik Chaumartin-Roesch\n\nOlivier Drion\n\nOlivier Durand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n287\n\n7",

Failing notification within three months, it shall be deemed to have accepted.\n\nThe decision to accept must be taken by a majority of votes of the directors present or represented, with the assignor, if he/she is a director, abstaining from the vote. In accordance with the law and with these articles of association, at least half of the directors in office must be present.\n\nNo reasons need be given for the decision and, if turned down, it may not give rise to any form of claim.\n\nThe assignor must be notified by registered letter within ten days of the decision.

Where not all the shares have been purchased or repurchased within the three-month deadline following the notification of refusal to authorize the disposal, the assignor may make the sale in favor of the original assignee for those shares that he/she is free to sell, subject to any partial bids made as set out above.\n\nThis three-month deadline may be extended by order of the Presiding Judge of the Commercial Court ruling in summary proceedings to which the assignor and assignee have been duly called. This order is not open to appeal.\n\nII - 6. Where the shares offered are acquired by shareholders or by third parties, the Board of Directors shall notify the assignor of the first name, surname and domicile of the purchaser(s).\n\nThe disposal price for the shares and the terms under which the sale of said shares is completed are set at the price offered by the assignee whose bid was turned down in line with the approval application  received  by  the  company.  Failing  agreement  on  the price, this shall be determined by an expert, in accordance with the provisions of Article/uni00A01843-4 of the French Civil Code. The expertise fees shall be borne equally by the assignor and the purchaser(s).\n\nThe company shall send the assignor or unapproved subscriber, by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, the documentation necessary to register the transfer of shares and their registration in the name of the purchasers appointed by the Board of Directors.\n\nWhere the interested parties fail to return this documentation to the company within 15/uni00A0days from the sending, the transfer of shares in the name of the beneficiaries appointed by the Board of Directors shall  be  automatically  registered  through  the  signature  of  the Chairman of the Board of Directors or by a Chief Executive Officer and by the beneficiary, where applicable. The shareholder's signature is not required. The shareholder shall be advised within eight days of the shares being registered in the name of the purchaser and requested to contact the registered office to receive payment, which shall not accrue interest.\n\nWhere, after six months, the shareholder has not withdrawn payment to which he is entitled, the company has the option to transfer the amount to the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, after which it shall be discharged of its responsibility in this regard.\n\n- II - 7. The provisions of this article shall apply in all cases of disposal, either inter vivos or as a result of inheritance, liquidation of a marital estate, either free of charge or against payment, including in cases of disposal by public tender pursuant to a court ruling.
