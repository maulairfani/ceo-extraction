After a dynamic start to the year, the Covid-19 pandemic heavily impacted a large part of our activities in the second quarter. Then, despite the ongoing health crisis, we had an excellent second half of the year, marked by a strong acceleration in sales and record results, which owe a/uni00A0great deal to the exemplary mobilization of Saint-Gobain's teams, whose talent and commitment I would like to salute.\n\nSaint-Gobain is better prepared for sustainable and profitable growth than pre-crisis, and will be still more so in future.\n\nThese results are also due to a recovery in the construction markets, helped by an excellent sales performance, the continuation of our cost-savings programs,  conducted  with  rigor and discipline, and of course by the success of our Transform & Grow plan, which delivered the expected results a year ahead of schedule. Our new country-based organization, which brings us closer to our markets and our customers, proved its effectiveness, generating both efficiency gains and strong commercial synergies. It was\n\nalso invaluable during the crisis, giving us the agility we needed. We continued to adjust our investment portfolio, making 12/uni00A0small acquisitions and one more substantial - Continental Building Products, a leading player on the North American plasterboard market. Integration is going smoothly and the Company will benefit from the dynamism of construction in the United States. At/uni00A0the same time, we continued our divestment program, bringing the volume sold or in the process of being sold to \u20ac4.6/uni00A0billion by revenue since the plan was launched.\n\nMessage from\n\n## Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar\n\nChairman and Chief Executive O/fficer",

        "page_content": "I am convinced that Saint-Gobain is better suited for sustainable and profitable growth than pre-crisis, and will be still more so in the future. This is the result of a successful transformation, which is now complete. But it is also because the exceptional context of 2020 validated the direction taken by the Group over the past several years. The strong rebound in our results underlines the soundness of our positioning and our strategy, based on two pillars: performance and sustainability.\n\nAs a result, Saint-Gobain is ideally positioned to meet the expectations of its stakeholders in a world that, I believe, is dominated by three major trends: the/uni00A0increased weight of the local and regional level, the growing role of digital technology, and heightened expectations in terms of sustainability.\n\nSaint-Gobain is now a resolutely multi-local group. The/uni00A0health crisis accelerated the digitization of the Group's businesses, working methods and value chains in both distribution and industry; data is at the heart of our activities and operations. And the pandemic also acted as a catalyst for pre-existing trends. The/uni00A0habitat, its quality and performance, and its impact on our health and the planet, have become increasingly important to everyone. This strong link between building performance, occupant well-being and health and environmental impact has never been clearer. Recovery plans in Europe and the United States have made the renovation of buildings' energy performance a priority. Today, this is one of the most useful things we can do for the world, helping to create local jobs, improve purchasing power and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is also Saint-Gobain's biggest market, which presents us with a great opportunity for coming years.\n\n## 2020 saw the completion of two emblematic projects that will help build a more sustainable world: the\n\ncollective endeavor to express our Company's purpose - Making the World a Better Home - which illustrates our ambition to improve the lives of all by making the planet a fairer, more harmonious and more sustainable living space; and the development of our roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050. The roadmap sets out milestones for reducing our CO 2 emissions by 2030 and is supported by ambitious action plans by country and at Group level.\n\nMore  broadly,  this  means  we  accelerate  our decarbonization ambition which, beyond neutralizing our own impact, also and more fundamentally aims to develop solutions that move our whole value chain towards a low-carbon economy: reducing the carbon footprint of buildings throughout their lifespan, as well as offering innovative tailor-made solutions for our customers in the industrial, transport and energy markets.\n\nOur  vision  -  to  be  the  leader  in  sustainable construction, which improves everyday life through high-performance solutions - is fully in line with our purpose and resonates with our stakeholders' expectations  of  greater  energy  and  resource efficiency, solutions that contribute to the well-being and health of women and men, and inclusive economic development.\n\n## 2020 was a year of progress and collective learning, which marked a deepening of our sustainable growth\n\nstrategy. Saint-Gobain continues to attract praise and awards: for its culture of innovation - for a tenth consecutive year, we are among the top 100/uni00A0most innovative companies in the world, according to Clarivate's Top 100 Global Innovators ranking, and we are the only French company to have appeared every year since its creation; and also for its human resources policy and the attention we pay to the well-being and development of our employees qualifying for the Top Employer Global label for a sixth consecutive year. The annual global survey carried out among our employees showed, with an increase in participation rate compared to 2019 at 78%, a high level of engagement, at 82%. And more than ever in 2020, Saint-Gobain teams have demonstrated their solidarity and a strong sense of the common good, helping each other during difficult times, supporting caregivers and people in need in the context of the health crisis, and engaging with local communities.\n\nI know we can count on our 167,000 employees to continue to bring Saint-Gobain's values to life and take the Group forward to the success that awaits us.\n\n## The Group is ready to write the next chapter of its development and growth and has the resources to\n\nfulfill its ambitions. Feeling that the time was right, I/uni00A0proposed that the Board of Directors appoint Benoit Bazin as Chief Executive Officer from July 1, 2021. As for me, I will continue to act as Chairman of the Board from that date. I am very happy to hand over executive management to Benoit Bazin. He knows the Group intimately, in France and abroad, and has demonstrated his leadership in the strategic and operational roles he has held. He perfectly embodies the values of Saint-Gobain and the future direction of the Group. He will be able to drive its development towards comprehensive solutions and increasingly integrated and differentiating offers, by optimizing synergies, stimulating and encouraging innovation, and inspiring our teams to give the best of themselves. More than ever, with its new Group purpose, and its positioning and strategy, validated by changes in the world, enabling it to make the most of the strong recovery that is coming, Saint-Gobain can look forward to the future with great confidence.",

The Group then goes on to make acquisitions in Building Distribution.\n- The acquisition in 2005 of British Plaster Board, the /uni25A0 global leader in plasterboard, is Saint-Gobain's largest ever. In combination with ISOVER glass wool, it makes Saint-Gobain the world number one in interior solutions.\n- Saint-Gobain focuses its strategy on sustainable /uni25A0 habitat,  as  well  as  continuing  to  serve  a  number  of industrial markets. With its extensive network of assets, the Group is growing steadily in emerging countries.\n- At the end of 2020, Saint-Gobain, with its presence in /uni25A0 70/uni00A0countries, successfully completed  Transform  & Grow, its ambitious transformation plan launched at the end of 2018 to strengthen its competitiveness and fully unleash its growth potential.",

It  is  the  result  of  a  process conducted with its stakeholders: nearly 15,000 in-house contributions, over 600/uni00A0workshops worldwide and contributions from external stakeholders such as investors, NGOs, partners and opinion leaders.\n\nWith this purpose, Saint-Gobain took on its ambition to improve everyone's lives by making the planet a fairer, more harmonious and sustainable living space.\n\n## 'MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER HOME.'\n\nOur  purpose  sets  the  course  for  our  common future. Together with and for our customers, we design, manufacture and distribute materials and solutions that have a positive impact on everyone's life  and  provide  well-being,  quality  of  life  and performance, while caring for the planet.\n\nThrough its business model generally and with its solutions specifically, Saint-Gobain has a tangible impact on the life of  each  individual,  their  environment  and  their  way  of working, caring for themselves and getting around.\n\nThe Group's purpose is the link between the infinitely small unit of each person's living space and the infinitely large one of our shared home: the planet.\n\nOur purpose is a call to action. Our approach is clearly  focused  on  the  future.  Together  with  our customers,  partners  and  all  our  stakeholders,  it guides our action to unleash individual and collective aspirations, and enable everyone to live better in the world. It calls on us to innovate openly, with  the  ever-renewed  ambition  of  better  uniting humanity and nature for the common good.\n\nOur purpose reflects who we are. Our 350/uni00A0years of history,  our  collective  strength  and  our  leadership empower  us to pursue our development, by addressing  the  major  challenges  facing  humanity, namely, climate change, resource protection and the fight against inequality. We are both an international and  multi-local  company,  fully  integrated  into  the territories where we operate to support their vitality and help build a fairer and more sustainable, open and engaging world.\n\nOur purpose is based on values that guide us. We carry  out  our  business  in  compliance  with  the principles of conduct and action and the humanist values that permeate our corporate culture. Listening, dialogue, care, solidarity, trust and respect for difference are central to our commitment.\n\nThis is the profound ambition of our purpose: to act every day to make the world a more beautiful and sustainable place to live.",

Formalized in 2003, translated into 33/uni00A0languages, and distributed to all employees, these principles constitute an ethical reference applicable in action. They are a condition of belonging to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT\n\n- Professional commitment /uni25A0\n- Respect for others /uni25A0\n- Integrity /uni25A0\n- Loyalty /uni25A0\n- Solidarity /uni25A0\n\nare the fundamental values that unite managers and employees.\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action refer explicitly to the applicable conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Charter on Human Rights and the Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises with regard to the fight against corruption of the Organization for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD). Saint-Gobain has been signed up to the United Nations Global  Compact  since  2003.  This  demonstrates  the Group's drive for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which includes regular communication of its progress in areas covered by the Global Compact.\n\nThe implementation of the Group's strategy is reflected in policies and commitments applied by all of its entities in all countries in which they operate.\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF ACTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Respect for the law /uni25A0\n- Caring for the environment /uni25A0\n- Worker health and safety /uni25A0\n- Respect for employee rights /uni25A0\n\nguide the actions of all management and employees in the performance of their duties.\n\nForemost among these commitments are the 'reference policies'. These are directly derived from the Principles of Conduct  and  Action  and  define  the  management principles  applicable  to  all  Saint-Gobain  entities  and employees, as well as to subcontractors in their work for the Group, and suppliers under the Responsible Purchasing policy (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section 1.5).\n\nThis  desire  to  establish  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action as a sign of belonging is illustrated by the objective set  by  the  Group's  Board  of  Directors,  of  training  all managers  in  the  Principles  in  their  first  year  with  the Group. Furthermore, the Principles of Conduct and Action are  included  in  the  welcome  booklets  of  all  Group employees and in the majority of employment contracts (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section 1.2.1).\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n1",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nHighlights of 2020\n\n## Throwback to an exceptional situation 3.2\n\nThe  year/uni00A02020  was  literally  extraordinary  due  to  the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought an abrupt halt to all economies and paralyzed all human societies throughout the world. At the end of the year, despite the high hopes raised by the launch of vaccines, the pandemic was still raging in most parts of the world, with an intensity that tested health and lifestyles as well as economic models and shooke up certainties.\n\nThis unprecedented crisis has profound implications for Saint-Gobain, not only on its day-to-day operations but also  on  its  business  model  and  future  development strategy. It will have been a test of the Group's ability to react to adversity and its determination to take care of its own people, proof of its commitment to other players in society,  and  a  demonstration  of  the  relevance  of  its strategic orientations.\n\n## The priority: taking care 3.2.1 of the Group's stakeholders\n\nFrom  the first weeks of the crisis, Saint-Gobain demonstrated  unprecedented  agility  in  adapting  its operating  methods  and  implementing  new  ways  of working.\n\nThe overriding priority has been to protect the health of the Group's employees, customers, and suppliers and their families. This means compliance with barrier gestures, the widespread  deployment  of  protective  equipment  in factories, sales outlets, logistics centers and offices, the reorganization  of  flows  at  each  site,  regular  local communication  to  maintain  contact  with  everyone,  and continuous social dialogue. The widespread use of remote working  wherever  possible,  made  possible  by  the deployment  of  remote  collaborative  working  tools,  has made  a  rapid  reorganization  of  activity  easier.  In  an environment marked by lockdowns, employee balance of life is one of the priority management issues.\n\n## A commitment to serving society 3.2.2 as a whole\n\nTaking into account all of its stakeholders and conceiving of oneselves as part of a complex ecosystem are not just words. In times of crisis, it also means acting in solidarity, with initiatives that aid everyone on the front lines. Since the first days of the crisis, Saint-Gobain's collective and individual  mobilization  to  give  hospitals  and  caregivers masks, gloves, coveralls and financial resources has been living proof of the humane culture that drives the Group's employees.\n\nFor  a  leading  economic  player  such  as  Saint-Gobain, commitment also means mobilizing its industrial resources to  fight  the  pandemic.  The  Saint-Gobain  Life  Sciences Business Unit has made an exceptional effort to produce and  supply  the  components  (tubes,  connectors,  filters, membranes)  necessary  for  the  equipment  used  to diagnose,  treat  and  care  for  Covid-19  patients.  More specifically, it has increased by 15 times the production of parts essential to the manufacture of ventilators.\n\nThe Group's efforts have been deployed everywhere with the  same  determination,  through  supplying  walls  and plasterboard  for  field  hospitals  or  homes  for  people dependent  on  care,  supplying  materials  to  create  a gigantic  medical  center  in  London  in  record  time  and convert  stadiums  and  gymnasiums,  especially  in  the United  States.  The  creativity  of  all  employees  has multiplied the impact of Saint-Gobain's commitment. To give but one example, its teams in Spain have converted plastic  packaging  from  gypsum  pallets  into  protective aprons  for  caregivers  at  hospitals.  The  promotion  of creativity, the encouragement to find rapid and effective solutions to complex and concrete problems, all of these facets of the Group's management culture in the service of innovation  have  been  invaluable  assets  in  making  a difference in the field, for the benefit of society as a whole.\n\n## Strategic orientations validated 3.2.3 by the crisis\n\nWhile governments have sometimes faced the health crisis in a scattered manner, Saint-Gobain has remained united. Its strength lies in combining local actions - decided as closely as possible to needs -and international coordination,  so  as  to  disseminate  the  sharing  of  best practices. This new link between global and local, resulting from the Transform & Grow strategic plan, has proven its strength  and  relevance  during  the  pandemic  and  has allowed  for  crisis  management  that  is  both  highly coordinated and decentralized. Local operational actions were implemented quickly by each country while excellent global coordination enabled the exchange of information and cooperation via a central crisis management committee.  In  addition  to  managing  the  crisis,  this dynamic unique to the Group is clearly relevant in the context of a trend toward regionalization of the global economy and aspirations to relocate value chains.\n\nCommitment  to  employees,  to  ensure  their  safety  and well-being in times of crisis, is also an extension of the major  efforts  made  over  the  last  ten  years  to  make progress in this area, ensuring the health and safety of employees on the Group's sites while also committing to the social protection of all employees and their families throughout  the  world.  The  launch  of  the  \"CARE  by Saint-Gobain\" program in 2020 is proof of this.\n\nThis  difficult  period  also  validates  the  Group's  firm commitment to a digital revolution across all its activities. The current crisis has greatly accelerated the transition. For employees, this affects working methods as well as such areas as training procedures. This is evidenced by the move  to  100%  digital  for  the  Unicampus  training.  For customers, this has further highlighted the importance of the  online  relationship,  through  acceleration  of  sales, implementation  or  generalization  of  click  &  collect, redesigned  customer  experiences,  and  new  ways  of collaborating internally and with customers. The lockdown period was an opportunity to experiment and progress. It has also brought the Group closer to end consumers, who have been paying greater attention to the quality of their living spaces.",

        "page_content": "The  health  crisis  has  also  highlighted  other  underlying dynamics  that  are  showing  signs  of  acceleration  and mutual reinforcement, such as climate change and scarcity of  resources,  demographic  growth  and  urbanization, changes in mobility, and the future of work (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 1.1). For all of these issues, the positioning adopted by  Saint-Gobain  shows  the  relevance  of  its  strategic analysis,  first,  as  regards  its  portfolio  of  products  and services that contribute to a low-carbon economy (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A04.1), and second, by making Corporate Social  Responsibility  a  central  part  of  its  strategy.  The Group's  commitment  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by 2050, announced in September/uni00A02019, is proof of this. In general,  the  crisis  has  demonstrated  the  strength  of Saint-Gobain's strategy, which focuses on energy transition, the circular economy and green mobility to help build a more sustainable, digital, and local world.\n\n## Bounce back and prepare 3.2.4 for the future\n\nAs  regards  industrial  facilities,  this  means,  first  and foremost, concentrating all efforts throughout the crisis to maintain the reliability levels of the Group's factories and the quality of its network of distribution outlets and all of its operational channels, so that they can function as they did before when the time comes. From a human resources standpoint,  it  means  maintaining  daily  social  ties  and proximity with all teams despite distance or the need for remote  working.  It  also  means  preserving  skills,  in particular through the development of training.\n\nBeyond  the  short  term,  and  the  consequences  for  the Group on a daily basis, it is also a matter of understanding the  impacts  of  the  crisis  on  the  world  in  which Saint-Gobain  operates,  first  by  anticipating  the  future needs of its customers and their logistical, technical and financial  challenges,  then  the  solutions  that  will  be  a priority for them, and finally the emerging markets. To do this, it is essential to maintain the level of tenacity and agility shown by the Group's teams since the beginning of the crisis over the medium and long term.\n\nFor a group such as Saint-Gobain, the ability to face a crisis of exceptional  magnitude  in  the  short  term necessarily  goes  hand  in  hand  with  preparing  for  the future: coming out of the crisis and the more or less rapid recovery of markets and their transformation.\n\n## Transform & Grow: review of a profound transformation 3.3\n\nAnnounced in November 2018, the Transform & Grow plan was implemented starting January 1, 2019 for a two-year period.\n\n## A plan to unleash energies 3.3.1\n\nTransform & Grow was based on two pillars:\n\n- a new market-based organization, closer to customers /uni25A0 to capture all opportunities, simpler and more agile to accelerate decision-making;\n- agile and value-creating portfolio management. /uni25A0\n\n## 3.3.2 A cultural transformation\n\nFirst  and  foremost,  this  meant  making  Saint-Gobain  a lighter, more agile and more efficient structure.\n\nIn purely organizational terms, the Group therefore had to switch to a structure modeled on its customers, from a complex matrix to a simplified structure:\n\n- countries, divided into regions, serving local markets; /uni25A0\n- High-Performance  Solutions,  an  entity  organized  by /uni25A0 end markets.\n\nThis  concept  was  based  on  a  clear  principle:  the accountability  of  local  teams  responsible  for  managing their income statements and country operations, on which salary incentives are based.\n\nAt the managerial level, the new structure was strengthened  by  the  deployment  of  a  new  way  of leadership based on the principles of trust, empowerment and  collaboration.  It  was  implemented  through  very concrete actions: simplification of decision-making processes, the principle of a single hierarchical line, team training and aligned salary incentives.\n\nAmong  the  transformation  levers  used,  we  should  also mention:\n\n- strengthening the focus on customers; /uni25A0\n- more integrated offers and development of synergies; /uni25A0\n- the pursuit of digital transformation. /uni25A0\n\n## 3.3.3 A portfolio rotation that creates value\n\nThe second pillar of the Transform & Grow plan was based on the acceleration of the Group's portfolio rotation, with a disposal target of at least \u20ac3 billion in sales by the end of 2019, which had been exceeded by the end of 2019 (see Chapter 2, section 4.4.2).\n\n## 3.3.4 A plan implemented in an unprecedented environment, thus demonstrating the model's resilience\n\nBased on an analysis of the Group's performance during the period 2010-2018, which corresponds to the period following  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2007-2008,  the purpose of Transform & Grow was to enable Saint-Gobain to strengthen its competitiveness and unleash growth and value creation.\n\nThe implementation of this plan in 2020 took place in the unprecedented and unforeseen environment of the global Covid-19  health  crisis  (see  Chapter  1,  Section  3.2). Nevertheless, the new organizational structure put in place has proven to be particularly relevant in these times of crisis, thus demonstrating the relevance of the model built by Saint-Gobain to meet the challenges posed by changes in  its  markets  and  by  the  megatrends  affecting  its stakeholders, such as threats to the environment, climate",

The structure met with strong support from the teams, which was strengthened between 2019 and 2020. At the end of 2020, 82% of employees showed strong  commitment  (three  points  more  than  in  2019), while 78% of managers said that Transform & Grow had improved the Group's growth, i.e. four points more than in 2019.\n\nEncouraging a customer-focused mindset was the motivation to design and achieve market synergies, such as :\n\n- the creation of the 'Ceilings and Acoustics' Business /uni25A0 Unit in Brazil;\n- organizational synergies such as the reorganization of /uni25A0 the 'Fa\u00e7ades' activity in Europe that pooled the supply chain, prescription tools, marketing and sales;\n- or technological synergies such as the deployment of /uni25A0 predictive analytics to increase sales and personalize the customer experience via e-commerce.\n\nEmphasis  was  placed  on  digitizing  operations  and processes, and beyond that, on adopting new business models  and  seizing  new  opportunities  across  all  value chains.\n\nSince the new structure was leaner and more efficient, the success of  the  Transform  &  Grow  plan  also  made  it\n\npossible to achieve the objective of cost savings of \u20ac250 million  one  year  ahead  of  the  target,  which  helped  to improve the Group's operating margin in the second half of 2020. Fifty-five percent of these cost reductions came from  simplification  of  the  internal  structure,  20%  from more streamlined support functions and central functions, and 20% from synergies and optimizations obtained at country level.\n\nAs for accelerated portfolio rotation, the results were also largely achieved, with a volume of disposals completed or signed representing sales of approximately \u20ac4.6 billion at the end of 2020, exceeding the initial target of more than \u20ac3 billion in sales set for the end of 2019. At the same time, 31 acquisitions were made across the entire program, for a total of \u20ac740 million in sales.\n\nAmong these, on February 3, 2020, after obtaining the agreement  of  its  shareholders  and  the  US  anti-trust authorities, Saint-Gobain  finalized  the  acquisition  of Continental  Building  Products,  a  leading  player  in  the plasterboard sector in North America.\n\nThis transaction enabled the Group to expand its asset portfolio  and  increase  its  ability  to  offer  innovative solutions to a broader customer base and to strengthen its presence in high-growth regions in the United States. The strong  fit  between  corporate  cultures  and  operational models  facilitates integration and  accelerates  value creation.\n\nAs a result, cost synergies and performance improvements, estimated at least $50 million by the end of the  third  year  following  the  completion  of  the transaction, are being carried out at a pace faster than initially anticipated, with results of around $20 million for 2020.",

        "page_content": "## The Group's activities 4.\n\nSaint-Gobain designs, produces and distributes materials and solutions that are key ingredients for the well-being of each of us and the future of all.\n\nThese materials are found everywhere in our living places and our daily lives: buildings, transport, infrastructure, as well  as  in  many  industrial  applications.  They  provide comfort,  performance  and  safety  while  meeting  the\n\nchallenges of sustainable construction, efficient resource management and climate change.\n\nSaint-Gobain aims to meet today's individual expectations and  tomorrow's  collective  challenges  by  offering  its customers well-being through sustainable solutions that respect the environment and health; and its professional customers  in  particular,  a  guarantee  of  productivity, performance and innovation.\n\n## Business lines for regional customers 4.1\n\n## Expertise and businesses 4.1.1\n\nSaint-Gobain designs, develops and distributes innovative solutions that improve the quality of living places, reduce the  environmental  impact  of  buildings  and  makes  life easier  for  its  professional  customers,  which  include architects, craftsmen, and installers. The Group offers a unique range of products and services for all areas of the construction industry. Its geographical organization allows it to offer solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of  its  local  markets,  whether  in  terms  of  construction methods  or  styles,  building  systems,  distinctive  climate features, for the renovation of existing buildings or the undertaking of new constructions.\n\n## Distribution of products, solutions and 4.1.1.1 services for construction and housing\n\nSaint-Gobain serves millions of customers each year on the building, renovation and home improvement markets. The Group has a network of strong and complementary brands, both generalist and specialist. Primarily oriented towards trade customers, the Saint-Gobain trading brands also serve small and medium-sized businesses and large companies. They also support individuals in the completion of their projects with professionals. In this way, the trading brands seek to establish a balance within their customer portfolios, to ensure robustness and profitability.\n\nAnother major asset is the regional network. Anchored in local communities, sales outlets are located in the most dynamic economic areas.\n\nLogistics is essential to distribution and receives special attention  through  the  automation  and  robotization  of processes.  The  trading  brands  are  making  a  system  of centralized logistics bases and adapted delivery centers increasingly  efficient.  This  makes  it  possible  to  meet demanding  e-commerce  standards  (as  regards  delivery times especially) for low-volume and low-weight products in  particular.  To  support  logistics, robust  information systems are necessary.\n\nDigital technology is incorporated within the tools used by the trading brands to offer customers a unique multi-channel experience: e-commerce, enriched product content  (characteristics,  descriptions,  images,  technical and regulatory documentation, etc.), and digital services that  help  save  time.  The  teams  also  benefit  from productivity  tools  (Robotic  Process  Automation  and machine learning) and the facilitated use of data thanks to the implementation of data science algorithms with, for instance,  the  optimization  of  targeted  products  and customers for the sales teams.\n\n## Building Glass 4.1.1.2\n\nTo address the challenges associated with protecting the environment, aesthetics, comfort, ergonomics and safety, Saint-Gobain  develops,  produces  and  sells  solutions intended for the fa\u00e7ade, window and interior decoration markets and to protect assets and people. The Group's offerings range from the production and processing of flat glass to the distribution of glass solutions for the building market.\n\nSaint-Gobain aspires to be the partner of choice for its customers: installers, processors, manufacturers, distributors and architects. Saint-Gobain's glass solutions help  to  improve  building  energy  efficiency  and  user comfort: thermal insulation, solar control, light transmission, interior solutions and decoration and bulletproof  and  fireproof  glass.  These  properties  are obtained  as  a  result  of  thin  film  technologies:  using physical and chemical methods, stacks of films transform the glass into functional glazing. This means that the most complex glazing can consist of up to twenty successive layers.  Saint-Gobain  also  offers  a  wide  range  of  active glazing  products  such  as  PRIVA-LITE\u00ae,  which  turns opaque  at  the  click  of  a  switch,  and  the  SageGlass\u00ae solutions, with variable tint lenses, which are mainly used for fa\u00e7ade projects.\n\n## Gypsum 4.1.1.3\n\nPlaster-based solutions intended for use in partitions and wall  coverings,  ceilings  and  floors  offer  thermal  and acoustic comfort and meet growing demands for visually pleasing home environments. These products also meet high technical specifications in terms of fire and damp resistance.  Gypsum  is  an  ally  for  light  construction methods:  depending  on  the  type  of  building,  wall construction  processes  using  gypsum-based  partitions can save time by between 20% and 50% compared to traditional materials.\n\nTo  develop  this  offering,  Saint-Gobain  extracts  and processes gypsum into a wide array of plaster products for construction and decoration. These solutions comply with the highest technological standards and Saint-Gobain promotes their widespread adoption, and remain a step ahead  of  new  regulations  concerning,  for  example,  the elimination of formaldehyde to improve interior air quality (Activ'Air\u00ae). The new Habito range of plasterboard offers excellent impact resistance while allowing for all types of decorative features to be easily applied.\n\n1",

However,  three  major  trends  have  been  emerging  for several years now, and they are being accelerated by the health crisis: the world  demands  more  sustainable development, and it is more local and more digital.\n\n## A world that demands more 1.1.1 sustainable development\n\n## Trends and risks 1.1.1.1\n\nThe  year  2020  is  symbolic  as  it  marks  the  thirtieth anniversary of the first report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which served  as  the  basis  for  the  United  Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Since then, year after  year,  the  scientific  consensus  has  continued  to confirm  and  clarify  the  reality  of  multiple,  mutually reinforcing phenomena. The first of these is direct impacts on the environment, ranging from ecosystem integrity to biodiversity. Correspondingly, the consequences affect all aspects of human life, ranging from access to water and food to the resources necessary for industrial processes and survival in regions under threat. This ultimately leads to real and potentially extreme geopolitical risks.\n\n## Growing commitments from public 1.1.1.2 authorities to energy transition\n\nThe inadequacy of the measures taken during this period led scientists to consider darker scenarios. In this context, governments  have  decided  to  commit  to  quantitative targets for reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  to  limit  rises  in  temperature,  the  leading indicator  of  climate  change.  From  this  standpoint,  the Paris Agreement of 2015 is an important indicator because it is the expression of the binding ambition to keep the rise in temperatures below 2\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era, which means reducing GHG emissions by 2.7% per year from 2020 to 2030. However, this objective seems limited  if  we  compare  it  to  the  need  to  reduce  GHG emissions by 7.6% per year over the same period in order to limit the rise in temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C, a level beyond which environmental and economic consequences would be  major.  In  December/uni00A02020,  five  years  after  the  Paris Agreement,  the  27/uni00A0countries  of  the  European  Union agreed on a new commitment: to bring the total reduction of GHG emissions by the year 2030 to a minimum of 55% compared to 1990/uni00A0levels.\n\nEach year, on the basis of the latest scientific work, the Emissions Gap Report of the United Nations Environment\n\nProgram  (UNEP)  compares  the  gap  between  these commitments  and  the  reduction  required  to  meet  the objective. In 2020, once again, their conclusion is that 'the world is not on the right track to bridge this gap and meet the Paris Agreement objectives.' In 2019, greenhouse gas emissions  reached  a  record  high  of  59/uni00A0billion  tons (gigatons;  Gt)  of  CO2  equivalent,  signaling  a  continued rapid increase in emissions. As for 2020, it was a unique and undoubtedly decisive moment. While the health crisis is  expected  to  reduce  emissions  by  7%,  this  is  only  a circumstantial decrease linked to the consequences of the pandemic on production, consumption and transport. The stimulus plans announced by the major powers and by regional organizations such as the European Union, which are measured in the trillions of euros, are potentially part of the solution. Their unprecedented scale may make it possible  to  achieve  the  temperature  increase  targets, provided  that  they  are  sufficiently  directed  toward financing the ecological transition (see chapter/uni00A01, section 1.2.1.1).\n\nThe change acceleration effect that the health crisis offers, paradoxically, represents for Saint-Gobain both opportunities  and  the  confirmation  of  its  credo.  In  the context  of  the  debate  on  the  response  to  the  climate challenge,  the  Group  believes  that  carbon  neutrality  is compatible with growth and that a low-carbon economy offers prospects for virtuous growth.\n\n## Commitments by companies 1.1.1.3\n\nFor  these  objectives  to  be  met,  the  political  vision expressed  by  governments  must  be  accompanied  by concrete actions on the part of other players in society, first and foremost among them local authorities, but also companies, which must strive to contain the impact of their own activities. In 2019, Saint-Gobain formalized its support  for  the  'Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C'  initiative driven by the Global Compact (on the partnership with the Global Compact, see chapter/uni00A03, section 1.6.2). This initiative urges  business  leaders  to  commit  their  companies  to concrete targets aligned with limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with the ultimate goal being to support a 'truly systemic transformation'/uni00A0 (1) . The  Group  has  thus  committed  to achieving the objective of 'net zero emissions' by 2050, whereas Saint-Gobain had already committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by 20% between 2010 and 2025. Several programs and tools have been implemented to support this  objective,  such  as  internal  carbon  pricing,  one  for investment projects and one for research and development projects, to guide company decisions and encourage low-carbon solutions.",

        "page_content": "## The critical role of building construction 1.1.1.4 and renovation\n\nBeyond  the  issue  of  GHG  emissions  related  to  the Company's activities, Saint-Gobain sees its responsibility across its entire business model. Its efforts therefore also cover its entire value chain, both upstream and downstream. The Group is one of the major players in the building construction and renovation sector, where there is considerable room for maneuver. The habitat sector in industrialized  countries  accounts  for  40%  of  energy consumption, 12% of drinking water consumption, 38% of greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  40%  of  solid  waste production/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nIn order to comply with the long term goals set under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the global average building energy intensity per unit of floor area needs to be at least 30% lower by 2030 than the 2015 levels/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nThe  potential  for  energy  gains  lies  in  the  reduction  of heating and air conditioning consumption made possible by  improvements  in  building  insulation  and  equipment performance.  Accelerating  these  efforts  will  require  a better understanding of the benefits in terms of comfort provided by habitat energy efficiency.\n\n## Resource scarcity, recyclability, transition 1.1.1.5 to a circular economy\n\nOn a global scale, the consumption of natural resources is accelerating, with 92/uni00A0billion tons extracted  in  2017 compared to 27 in 1970, a threefold increase, while the population has only doubled in the same period of time/uni00A0 (3) . The construction sector, which uses materials such as steel or concrete, plays a decisive role in this area. To limit the consumption of raw materials, solutions exist for optimizing  the  quantity  of  materials  used  for  a  given worksite, as well as through the adoption of a circular economy  approach.  In  fact,  public  policies  increasingly adopt a 'life cycle' approach that takes into account the environmental impact of a building as a whole, from the extraction of raw materials to its dismantling and to the recycling of its materials. This is the case, for example, in France, in one of the sections of the 'Anti-waste for a circular economy' bill adopted at the end of 2019. At the European level, the 54/uni00A0actions of the plan for the circular economy launched in 2015 have now been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. In 2016, activities related  to  the  circular  economy,  such  as  recycling  or\n\nrepairs, generated almost \u20ac147/uni00A0billion in value added/uni00A0 (4) . The recovery of materials makes it possible to limit the use of  resources  and  emissions  while  generating  additional economic  growth,  especially  because  it  stimulates  the search for technological innovations./uni00A0 (5)\n\nIn the construction sector in particular, which is responsible for 40% of global waste production and 50% of  resource  consumption,  the  transition  to  the  circular economy is the source of profound renewal at different levels of the value chain: production processes, product formulation,  product  end-of-life  management,  recycling, reuse, development of the economy of functionality, etc. The  rise  of  prefabrication  (see  in  this  chapter,  section 3.2.1.3) and the development of lightweight construction solutions  (see  chapter/uni00A03,  section  4.1)  are  some  of  the responses to these major challenges. Adopting targets at the  local  level  is  one  approach  that  promises  concrete progress. This is how the Dutch government set in 2016 an interim target for a reduction of 50% in the consumption of raw materials by 2030.\n\n## An increasingly local world, which 1.1.2 requires us to reinvent the city\n\n## A gradual challenge to globalization 1.1.2.1\n\nSeveral  factors  indicate  that  globalization,  after  a  very sharp  growth  phase  initiated  in  the  1990s,  has  slowed down since 2008. Trade is showing signs of slower growth than GDP at the global level, and value chains, although very integrated, are beginning to regionalize. In addition, tariff  and  non-tariff  barriers  are  increasing  in  several regions of the world. Saint-Gobain's growth model, which consists of acting as a local player in all its countries of operation (see in this chapter, section 2.2.2), is adapted to this slowdown in globalization and the growing desire of populations to consume products of local origin.\n\n## A continuous increase in population 1.1.2.2\n\nThe world population in 2020  was  estimated  at 7.8/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (6) . In  total,  the  total  human  population  has grown by an average of 1.1% per year over the last five years. The various factors influencing global demographic trends (gross birth and death rates, infant mortality rates, life expectancy, etc.) resulted in a projection of 9.7/uni00A0billion inhabitants in 2050 and 11/uni00A0billion inhabitants in 2100/uni00A0 (7) .\n\n- (6) United Nations Population Fund: 'World population' - https://www.unfpa.org/en/data/world-population-dashboard\n- (7) United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs: 'World Population Prospects 2019' - https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/\n\n2",

At the local level, urban areas already directly or indirectly consume between 60% and 80% of the energy consumed by a country. According to projections, the percentage of the urban population will continue to grow rapidly and massively. In 2015, nearly 55% of the world's population lived in cities, whereas this proportion will reach 68% by 2050, representing an additional 2.7/uni00A0billion urban dwellers, with significant disparities: Asia and Africa alone will account for 90% of urban population growth by 2050.\n\n## Urban population by geographic region, 1950-2050/uni00A0 (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis growth is also unevenly distributed in terms of living standards, with developed countries having lower rates of urban population increase than poorer countries, while there is a clear acceleration of urbanization in the classified as 'upper middle' according to World Bank figures.\n\n## Percentage of urban population by income level of countries, 1950-2050/uni00A0 (2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs: 'World Urbanization Prospects 2018', p./uni00A011 https://population.un.org/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2018-Highlights.pdf\n- (2) United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs, 'World Urbanization Prospects 2018', p./uni00A08 https://population.un.org/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2018-Highlights.pdf",

        "page_content": "## Variable urbanization patterns 1.1.2.4\n\nFirst, the size of existing cities is increasing. The number of medium-sized  and  large  cities  (between  one  and  ten million inhabitants) is expected to increase from 515 in 2018 to 663 in 2030, while mega-cities are expected to increase from 33 to 43, an augmentation of nearly one third within 12/uni00A0years. All of these cities that are changing in scale,  leading  to  a  change  in  infrastructure  needs.  But some of these new urban centers are being created from scratch. It is estimated that over 40/uni00A0countries are in the process of building new cities around the world.\n\n## Sensitive areas, significant impacts on 1.1.2.5 the environment\n\nNo  matter  where  they  are,  the  urban  areas  in  which humans  congregate  are  increasingly  fragile.  More  than 90% of the population is concentrated in coastal areas, which  are  particularly  vulnerable  because  they  are exposed to a combination of factors such as sea level rises, the salinization of coastal water  tables  and pollution/uni00A0 (1) . Urban  areas,  which  are  dense  and  largely devoid  of  vegetation  and  have  waterproofed  soil,  are particularly vulnerable to the average increase in temperatures and the higher frequency of high temperature peaks.\n\nThe rapid expansion of cities in turn increases the pressure on natural resources; it is also leading to an increase in waste  production,  which  already  represents  an  annual volume of 720/uni00A0billion tons worldwide. On a global scale, cities  now  account  for  more  than  70%  of  greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. Construction alone is a key aspect of this increased pressure on the environment, in terms of both extraction and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Increased needs, but in a diversified way 1.1.2.6\n\nIn general, such rapid urbanization leads to an increase in the need for housing, transport, energy, water and waste treatment, but also, in a domino effect, all of the other infrastructures  necessary  for  urban  life.  The  problems generated  vary  with  the  type  of  city  and  the  level  of income: in emerging countries, waste treatment as well as access  to  decent  housing  are  major  socio-economic issues.  It  is  estimated  that  between  900/uni00A0million  and 1.4/uni00A0billion people,  or  one  quarter  of  the  world's  urban population,  are  currently  living  in  slums;  by  2030,  this figure  is  expected  to  rise  to  a  quarter  of  the  total population. On the other hand, in middle-income countries, a  large  middle  class  with  high  purchasing  power  is developing,  with  ever-increasing  demands  for  comfort, requiring adapted solutions. These variable impacts create massive, complex and distinct needs for housing infrastructure, construction and renovation.\n\n## Significant impacts on individuals 1.1.2.7 and lifestyles\n\nUrban dwellers already spend 90% of their time indoors, whether at home, during their commute or at work. The Covid-19 pandemic has already played a role that is still difficult to measure, but probably lasting, on the growth of telecommuting, which is leading to an increase in the time spent at home. This in turn has a significant impact on the expectations  and  needs  of  individuals  regarding  where they live.\n\n## An image of the sustainable city 1.1.2.8\n\nFaced with these megatrends, a sketch of the ideal city is emerging, and it must be shaped to limit risks and meet the expectations of individuals and companies.\n\n## Quality of life, the core of the sustainable city model\n\nA sustainable city is first and foremost a city where life is good, a city whose buildings meet the expectations of its inhabitants in terms of quality of life and, in particular, comfort. This involves thermal comfort - maintaining an optimal temperature at the lowest possible energy cost as well as acoustic comfort, so as to limit harmful noise and  allow  the  desired  sounds  to  pass  through,  visual comfort, by maximizing access to natural light, and air quality, by maintaining a ventilated atmosphere free of polluting substances.\n\nThe sustainable city also allows everyone to have access to decent housing on reasonable financial terms, which leads to enormous efforts to renovate the existing building stock in order to increase the number of energy-efficient buildings.\n\nAs regards new buildings, their design must reduce overall energy demand and, for the majority of them, produce more energy than they consume. It must also allow modularity  of  uses  to  facilitate  the  change  of  use  of buildings and thus switch more easily from office use to residential use, and vice versa.\n\n## Planning, organizing and densifying the city\n\nWith  regard  to  construction,  the  sustainable  city  is  a resilient city in the face of climate change, which requires in particular the construction of buildings that not only meet the conditions or standards that exist at the time of their delivery, but are also such that they can be adapted to the situation of their environment in 2050 and beyond. Buildings  must  also  be  constructed  and  designed  to overcome  all  climatic  phenomena  by  being  easier  to repair, rebuild or dismantle, especially in the event that they could not withstand extreme shocks.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nThe  sustainable  city  is  also  a  city  that  is  socially  and economically  united;  this  means  developing  access  to infrastructure  by  equipping  urban  areas  with  water distribution networks or waste treatment systems, as well as  essential  services  such  as  education.  Public  regional planning  policies,  and  urban  planning  in  particular,  can play a decisive role in limiting the negative impacts of urbanization. From  a  social  standpoint,  this  means providing for mixed-use structures to limit the distance between housing, jobs, services and other social activities. From an environmental standpoint, this means reducing the spatial footprint of cities by targeting the densification of urban areas. In the case of existing cities, this involves the  renovation  of  buildings,  or  construction  on  top  of existing structures. In the case of new cities, there will be a focus  on  high-rise  buildings  and  buildings  with  several residential units, to the detriment of single-family homes, and on integrating multi-use buildings and efficient public transportation services into the urban fabric. To protect and  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  contribute  to  the maintenance of biodiversity, it is possible to give pride of place  to  nature  in  cities  by  integrating  tools  such  as fa\u00e7ades and green roofs, as well as green spaces such as urban forests, and by developing integrated and efficient water  management  systems  at  city  level.  Finally,  the carbon impact of the building construction process can be drastically reduced and recycled and recyclable materials can be used.\n\nGenerally speaking, the goal is to create the conditions that  enable  the  transformation  of  cities  to  make  them sustainable.  Concretely,  this  means  planning,  measuring results and reporting back, but also, if necessary, creating local regulations that may be lacking at the national level, or  creating  neighborhoods  with  a  low  carbon  footprint that can lead by example. It is also a matter of generating synergies and overcoming obstacles related to national policies via alliances of a new type between the actors of this  transformation.  A  good  example  is  the  C40,  a transnational  network  that  brings  together  some  one hundred of the world's largest cities and nearly 700/uni00A0million people  determined  to  take  action  to  limit  climate change/uni00A0 (1) , or the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (2) , which brings together nearly 10,000/uni00A0cities and local authorities.\n\n## Transportation and mobility 1.1.2.9\n\nMobility is at the heart of sustainable development issues. Technology  and  digitization  have  certainly  caused  a 'shrinking' effect for the world, but being in connection with each other physically remains a fundamental human need.  Globalization  and  the  increase  in  the  mobility  of individuals, together with the average increase in living standards, logically cause an increase in local and global travel,  whether  in  individual  vehicles,  collective  land transportation (trains, trams, buses) or airplanes.\n\nThe  quality  of  life  of  citizens  and  the  need  to  build sustainable and inclusive regions at a local and country level depend  on  efficient  transportation  systems  to optimally connect workplaces, housing and services. This transport can be provided by lighter vehicles, in order to be  energy  efficient  and  cleaner  and  limit  pollutant emissions, which leads to the universal use of hybrid or fully electric vehicles. The consequences are many, such as the  need  to  insulate  them  optimally  to  improve  the efficiency of the batteries or the need to design buildings differently  to  integrate  charging  stations.  Finally,  they must offer maximum comfort in all areas.\n\nAnother  fundamental  trend  is  emerging:  the  changing needs  of  consumers,  who  increasingly  prefer  to  use individual vehicles rather than own them. This underlying trend, which is part of a wider social movement, has very strong concrete impacts in terms of vehicle design.\n\n## A more digital world 1.1.3\n\n## The digital revolution and distribution 1.1.3.1\n\nDigital  technology  is  opening  new  trade  opportunities, with  a  very  high  annual  growth  rate  for  electronic commerce throughout the world since the early 2000s. This  growth  is  no  longer  the  preserve  of  developed countries: in fast-growing countries, 3/uni00A0billion users should have internet access by 2022, compared to 2.1/uni00A0billion in 2017/uni00A0 (3) . Businesses  must  now  be  closer  to  their  end customers to avoid new intermediations. In addition, to differentiate themselves, the associated services play an essential  role.  This  means  that  digital  technology  is globally reshaping the competitive balance and the way that businesses interact with their stakeholders (customers, employees and suppliers).\n\n## The digital revolution and industry 1.1.3.2\n\nDigital  technology  is  also  revolutionizing  the  way  that factories are organized. It is producing a major, gradual change  in  production  methods,  by  providing  real-time access to a wealth of information on industrial facilities that  are  now  interconnected  and  enabling  extensive analysis of these data. The concept of 'Industry 4.0' is an integral part of the reality of companies today, thanks to the combination of intelligent data analysis, automation and augmented operators. Progress can thus be seen on two fronts: on the one hand, in the increase in productivity that results from reductions in inventories, breakdowns, lost  time  and  scrap  material;  and,  on  the  other,  in improved flexibility of production processes. Industry 4.0 also opens up the prospect of mass customization, which relies in particular on locating industrial assets as close as possible to end customers. Digital technology is also a lever for progress in terms of the environmental footprint of industrial sites, as it optimizes energy consumption and therefore reduces CO2 emissions.\n\n- (1) C40 Cities - https://www.c40.org/\n\n(2) Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy - https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\n\n- (3) United Nations: '6th/uni00A0Global Environmental Outlook', 2019.",

        "page_content": "## The digital revolution and construction 1.1.3.3\n\nWith digital technology, a profound rethinking of buildings and habitat is also underway. The digital integration of buildings is leading to technical changes in construction, particularly  the  increasing  use  of  Building  Information Modeling (BIM), which provides an integrated view of a building throughout all the stages of its life cycle through a 'digital twin'.\n\nAlso  facilitated  by  BIM  throughout  the  design  stage, prefab  or  off-site  construction  are  rising  (see  in  this chapter,  section  3.2.1.3)  thanks  to  new  technologies allowing for data collection and use.\n\nDomotics, which helps reducing energy consumption in buildings and improves security, allows for an increasingly comprehensive integration of smart equipment into daily life.\n\n## The Group's different markets 1.2\n\n## 1.2.1 New construction and renovation\n\nSaint-Gobain's  largest  market,  construction,  offers  growth  prospects  worldwide,  with  differing  challenges  and requirements depending on the geographic region.\n\n## Renovation 1.2.1.1\n\nIn mature markets, building renovation and energy efficiency are key challenges/uni00A0 (1) . The renovation sector is becoming more and more important. In France, the residential renovation market alone accounted for around \u20ac53/uni00A0billion in 2020, and nearly \u20ac420/uni00A0billion at the European level/uni00A0 (2) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In millions of euros, 2019/uni00A0prices.

They  are  currently accelerating. On its own, the health crisis that began in early 2020 has played a major role in bringing the subject of the relationship to work to the heart of discussions. Offices, commuting to and from home, remote working, management,  autonomy,  social  ties,  trust,  privacy:  the issues highlighted by the pandemic are multiple.\n\nFor businesses, it is a matter of being able to change, or even  reinvent,  their  approach  to  human  resources  and management.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nThis major trend is largely due to the need for energy efficiency  in  buildings,  which  is  considered  essential  to achieve  carbon  neutrality.  However,  the  majority  of European  buildings  of  2050  have  already  been  built/uni00A0 (1) . Renovation  will  therefore  be  increasingly  stimulated  by growing  energy  efficiency requirements, which are appearing  in  regulatory  changes  currently  being  made, and by energy renovation programs supported by public authorities.\n\nThe health crisis of 2020 had a dual impact on this sector: a  circumstantial  impact,  on  renovation  sites,  due  to containment measures; and a more structural impact, due to the adoption by many countries of recovery plans with a strong 'green' component. Due to their unprecedented scale, they will be structuring the market for several years. In France, the \u20ac100/uni00A0billion plan to support the economy in the face of the crisis therefore provides for a budget of \u20ac30/uni00A0billion for  ecological  transition/uni00A0 (2) and  its  priority sectors such as the energy renovation of buildings (private housing, public buildings and social housing), which alone will absorb nearly \u20ac7/uni00A0billion, potentially creating 55,000/uni00A0jobs over the next two years/uni00A0 (3) . In this context, the \"MaPrimeRenov\"  plan,  extended  in  2020  and  with  a budget of \u20ac2/uni00A0billion over the next two years, promotes the acceleration  of  energy  renovation;  the  authorities  have estimated that it could entail a total amount of \u20ac6/uni00A0billion worth of construction over two years. At European level, 30% of the recovery plan proposed by the Commission is dedicated to climate action.\n\nMore broadly, renovation plays an essential societal role by reducing the impact of buildings on the environment, providing occupants with access to decent housing and a comfortable living environment  and  preserving  the purchasing power of the building.\n\n## New build 1.2.1.2\n\nNew  build  is  a  major  growth  factor  that  is  related  to demographic  changes,  urbanization,  and  the  need  to replace existing buildings. On this market, growth should be more significant in emerging countries. The non-residential  new  construction  market  segment  is aligned with global economic and industrial cycles. After a decrease in many countries due do the Covid-19 crisis, new construction should bounce back in 2021 and revert to its overall growth rate.\n\nIn  this  construction  sector,  Saint-Gobain  is  positioned throughout the value chain, with brands present from the design of buildings to the operation of digital services to\n\nthe production of materials and their distribution and the provision services for craftsmen.  The  Group  offers solutions for sustainable construction and thermal comfort, light construction and energy efficiency, through such products as its insulation and glazing solutions. Its solutions also improve acoustic comfort (in the form of adapted plasterboard panels, glazing or acoustic ceilings), visual comfort (through the production of highly transparent Eclaz glazing), or indoor air quality.\n\nIn this sector, the Saint-Gobain brand enjoys a good level of recognition and is the second most cited by the public among the leaders in the construction sector/uni00A0. Saint-Gobain's global presence is also an important asset that allows the Group to benefit from natural diversification due to the 'out-of-sync' nature of construction cycles between geographical areas (4) .\n\n## Mobility 1.2.2\n\nThe  mobility  market,  individual  vehicles  especially,  is deeply  affected  by  the  health  crisis,  with  a  worldwide production drop of around 20% in 2020.\n\nIn this sector, Saint-Gobain  provides  products  and solutions with high added value, such as resistant glazing, air filtration or antennas integrated into windshields, or anti-virus solutions to make surfaces safer. It also adopts an approach of agility and openness, as it is necessary to be able to create links with the new market actors at the right time so that they become contacts, influencers and customers.\n\nWith  regard  to  public  transportation,  several  trends combine,  with  strong  and  continuous  growth  in  the market, largely under the influence of the rapid urbanization  of  the  population  at  the  global  level. Conversely, the health crisis of 2020 and the corresponding explosion in remote working could represent a change  in the relationship to public transportation even more than a circumstantial demand shock. In France, the seventh annual 'Observatoire de la Mobilit\u00e9' study published in November/uni00A02020/uni00A0stated that 30% of regular transit users plan to stop using it once the health crisis has passed/uni00A0 (5) .\n\nThe  aerospace  sector,  whose  two  largest  markets  are North America and Asia-Pacific, together accounting for over 70% of the market, suffered a significant decline in activity in 2020 mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with a projected impact of more than 8% between 2019 and 2020/uni00A0 (6) .\n\n- (1) 'A planet for all, a long-term strategic European vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy' in Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Investment Bank, November/uni00A028, 2018.\n\n- (3) French government: 'France Relance' - https://www.gouvernement.fr/france-relance\n- (4) Results of the Brand Barometer 2017 for 14/uni00A0countries.\n- (5) Union des Transports Publics et Rail: 'Mobility Observatory for 2020' https://www.utp.fr/actualite/edition-2020-de-lobservatoire-de-la-mobilite-les-resultats\n- (6) The Business Research Company: 'Aerospace & Defense Global Market Report 2020-30: Covid-19 Impact And Recovery' https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/aerospace-market",

        "page_content": "Against a backdrop of slow recovery in the aeronautics sector, the main topic is innovation. The need to transport more and more passengers as a result of the structural population increase trends, combined with the need to protect the environment, automatically creates an increasing  demand  for  new  materials  and  solutions, necessary components for the aircraft of the future. The Group's  aerospace  solutions  include  high-performance plastics  capable  of  withstanding  extreme  temperatures, ceramics used in aircraft engines, glazing and telecommunication radomes. Saint-Gobain's cockpit glazing, both glass and acrylic, are thus fitted in all types of aircraft.\n\n## Life Sciences 1.2.3\n\nThe healthcare market, and notably the pharmaceutical, medical  and  biotechnology  sectors,  offers  promising prospects, which have been strengthened by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The  aging  population  and  increased  medical care represent a key challenge: between 2019 and 2030, the  proportion  of  people  over  65/uni00A0years  of  age  in  the population of Europe and North America will rise from 18% to 22.1%/uni00A0 (1) . At the same time, new technologies such as biotechnologies are developing and medical techniques, such  as  liquid  management,  are  evolving.  These  two phenomena translate into a new need for the development of  solutions  and  materials  with  unique  properties  in laboratories or hospitals.\n\nLike the mobility market, the healthcare market is a sector in which the reliability of solutions and their classification and compliance with standards are crucial. The Group thus markets tailor-made, single-use solutions (tubes, connectors, pockets, filters, etc.) used in fluid management,  as  well  as  painting  cloths  with  sanitary characteristics that are particularly suited for healthcare environments. The Group also designs products for use in the medical imaging market (crystals and scintillators) and the cell therapy market.\n\n## Industry 1.2.4\n\nSaint-Gobain's industrial markets comprise a number of different  sectors  (energy,  metallurgy,  non-metal  raw materials,  mineral  extraction,  chemicals,  petrochemicals and  semi-conductors)  that  find  applications  in  defense and security, industrial equipment and household appliances. The vast majority of these markets are B-to-B, with varying degrees of growth depending on the market and the region of the world. Differentiation is achieved through  increased  research  into  new  technologies  and co-development with partner customers. These markets are also marked by the growing influence of automation and Industry 4.0 and are subject to profound transformations.\n\nThe  Group  is  developing  technical  solutions  specifically tailored to the various markets, mindful of current needs and emerging trends. Saint-Gobain also designs numerous high-performance  products  aimed  at  the  wind  energy sector such as seals for marine-based wind farms, and glass  fiber  textiles  to  improve  the  surface  condition  of turbine blades. The Group develops cutting-edge products, from waste recovery (refractory for incinerator liners) to operation and storage (gaskets, flexible roofs and insulation for drilling pump wires and cables).\n\nThe  Group  offers  chemical  and  petrochemical  market solutions  that  improve  chemical  reactions  due  to  the action of specifically designed catalyst substrates. Saint-Gobain offers a wide variety of solutions for other markets: polymer strips and films that have chemical and thermal  properties  with  multiple  industrial  applications, highly sophisticated refractory products for steel-making and metalworking, high-tech abrasive ceramic or diamond grain-based milling solutions, high-value materials cutting and  finishing as well as machine  components  or high-precision equipment for transport or motorization.\n\n2",

It requires not only to build dialogue, but to ensure that dialogue is constructive, transparent and based on mutual trust.\n\nHow can this principle be brought to life in practice? Factors such as the size of the Group, its global dimension and the variety of its business lines mean that dialogue must, above all, be organized in a decentralized manner, with each operational entity being responsible for conducting it within its own scope.\n\nHow can this dialogue be managed at Group level? Saint-Gobain has mapped its ecosystem, identifying and grouping its stakeholders by category (see illustration below). For each category, a Group function responsible for organizing the reporting of information on its expectations, at local or global level, and producing a summary of them, has been designated as the contact point. The preferred methods of dialogue were also listed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Categories

        "page_content": "## Saint-Gobain at the center of a volatile, uncertain 1.4 and complex world\n\nThe  combination  of  the  challenges  (climate  and  the environment, demography and urbanization, digitization) and crises of various kinds (health, economic, migration, political) that we are witnessing creates a picture of a world that is volatile, uncertain and complex all at once. Saint-Gobain's positioning is based on taking into account in the short and long term these underlying trends, which represent  both  opportunities  and  challenges  for  the construction of the world of tomorrow, and on an in-depth understanding  of  the  ecosystem  comprised  by  all  its stakeholders.\n\nFirst, for  the  Group,  through  its  commitments  (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 4.1 and chapter/uni00A04, section 2.2) and its active role in exerting a virtuous influence on its entire value chain, this means fully integrating the climate and environment into its strategic vision. In 2020, Saint-Gobain unveiled its roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050, with new objectives for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by  2030.  These  objectives  have  been  validated  by  the Science-Based Targets initiative/uni00A0 (1) (see chapter/uni00A03, section 4.1).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Group's  responsibility  as  a  leading economic player, the requirements of sustainable development and the transition to a low-carbon economy are  accelerating  the  transformation  of  business  models and offering many opportunities for Saint-Gobain, some of\n\nwhich have already materialized in terms of new products, new services and new ways of working with customers and partners.\n\nIt is on this convergence of risks and opportunities that the  Group's  approach  is  built,  that  its  purpose  is summarized. Saint-Gobain has integrated strong convictions into its value proposition and brand promise. The  search  for  well-being  and  performance  and  the immediate  benefits  of  its  solutions  for  customers  and end-users are part of the same movement as the search for sustainable and environmentally sound solutions that will be part of the answer to the major challenges that the world  will  have  to  face  in  the  coming  decades.  It  also means marketing products and services adapted to each region.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  for  an  international  group  such  as Saint-Gobain, it means profoundly transforming itself so that it is able to constantly adapt to an environment that has become  structurally  unstable,  by  building  and implementing strategies that include an uncertain world. The model that the Group has built combines the strength of a global group and a structure that gives the local level the autonomy  necessary  to  adapt  to  a  changing environment (see in this chapter, section 2.2.2); this model is a performance lever necessary to achieve profitable and sustainable growth.\n\n2",

It is the Group's vision to be the world leader in sustainable construction, improving daily life with  performance  solutions.  Saint-Gobain's objective is to combine profitable and sustainable growth in line with its own commitments by 2050 and as part of a broader societal commitment.\n\nThis pioneering role is illustrated by Saint-Gobain's efforts to positively influence its entire value chain, particularly in terms  of  the  circular  economy  where  the  Group  can leverage  its  unique  positioning  as  a  manufacturer  and distributor in the glass, plaster, and insulation businesses. For Saint-Gobain, the goal is not only to provide solutions demanded by the market at a given moment, but to play the role of an actor involved in the very transformation of that market and to contribute to changing it in a virtuous way. This means anticipating changes in standards and, through  research  and  development  and  innovation, shaping the solutions of the future in response to market changes. To give but a few examples:\n\n- in highly regulated sectors such as transportation and /uni25A0 health, the Group is striving to anticipate standards. For example, in 2018, Sekurit equipped a new all-electric vehicle with lightweight laminated glazing. By reducing the total mass of the vehicle, this glazing will help to reduce energy consumption. The glazing incorporates new electric lead-free welding technology developed by Saint-Gobain in anticipation of the application of the European  Directive  for  the  removal  of  lead  from welding in automotive glazing beginning in 2020;\n- Saint-Gobain in Finland is coordinating the /uni25A0 WOOL2LOOP  circular  economy  project,  the  first innovation project supported by the European Union via its Horizon 2020 financing program. WOOL2LOOP aims to recover mineral wool  waste  from  the construction and demolition sectors to convert it into new concrete-replacement materials, using geopolymer technology.  The  project  also  involves  demolition, sorting, analysis and processing of mineral wool waste. WOOL2LOOP acts across the entire value chain and involves the world's largest building materials producers, innovative companies in the circular economy field and research institutes;\n- the SGR Provence research center is a partner of the /uni25A0 EAGLE project, a European program launched in 2017 with the objective of developing more efficient gasoline engines. By reducing energy loss, automotive manufacturers were able to comply with the European standard  calling  for  a  reduction  in  CO2  emissions  to 95/uni00A0grams per  kilometer  in  2020,  as  well  as  with legislation on particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions for hybrid vehicles. This project brought together eight other industrial and university partners;\n- in  France,  the  Saint-Gobain  Sully  industrial  site  is /uni25A0 coordinating  a  research  project  over  the  period 2018-2023, with a budget of \u20ac1.3/uni00A0million, more than 70% of which is provided by the European  Union. Conducted  in  partnership  with  Savoie-Mont  Blanc University  as  part  of  the  Optiwind  project  led  by Dassault  Aviation,  this  initiative  aims  to  develop cutting-edge  technology  to  optimize  the  design  of aircraft windshields in terms of technical and operational performance/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## A vision based on distinctive points of view 2.2\n\n## CSR as a source of sustainable 2.2.1 value creation for the Group\n\n## A long-term commitment 2.2.1.1\n\nSaint-Gobain  maintains  the  highest  Corporate  Social Responsibility  standards,  emphasizing  its  culture  and values,  so  that  it  can  constantly  set  an  example  for compliance, respect for the environment and the health and  safety of everyone. The  Group  is  constantly strengthening its requirements in the areas of diversity and supporting the training of its staff, with the aim of creating the conditions for their involvement in all aspects of the Company's life. Saint-Gobain sees this integration of Corporate Social Responsibility as being the heart of its Group strategy and a continuous improvement process:\n\n## 2003: /uni25A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- signature of the United Nations Global Compact by /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain,\n- adoption of the Principles of Conduct and Action; /uni25A0\n- 2009: formalization of the compliance program; /uni25A0\n- 2015: setting of ambitious environmental objectives for /uni25A0 2025 (20% reduction of CO2 emissions, 80% reduction of water discharges, and 50% reduction of non-recovered waste);\n- 2020: development  of  the  roadmap  to  carbon /uni25A0 neutrality by 2050 and formalization of new environmental objectives for 2030.\n- (1) European Commission: 'Optimized cockpit windshield for large diameter business aircraft' - https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/785300/en",

At  the  global  level,  the strength of an international Group makes it possible to build up a pool of expertise to support its local activities in research and development, marketing, technological and industrial  performance,  and  performance  in  distribution (see in this chapter, section 2.2.3). It also makes it possible to  test  many  innovative  business  models  in  different contexts and to promote the exchange of best practices between  countries. Finally, regarding the portfolio, Saint-Gobain offers its customers a comprehensive range of products and services.\n\nThis positioning is distinctly different from its competitors. In  addition  to  its  in-depth  knowledge  of  local  markets, Saint-Gobain  distinguishes  itself  from  local  competitors through the innovation and operational excellence provided by its cross-functional operations at the global level. Thanks to the richness of its offerings and its ability to  offer  complete  solutions  adapted  to  each  customer segment, the Group distinguishes itself from its local and international competitors.\n\n## A focus on synergies in operations 2.2.3 and internal organization\n\nThe Group has adopted a new organizational structure that is closer to its customers to improve its commercial\n\nTHE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SDGs\n\nExpectations of greater comfort and well-being, and improvement of living conditions in general, are closely linked to the local culture in countries and regions. The adaptation of the o/ffering and the commitment of brands takes into account the expectations of local stakeholders.\n\nTo stand in solidarity with local stakeholders to tackle the societal challenges of communities and participate in collective e/fforts to improve living conditions, fight against inequality and include vulnerable populations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand operational efficiency and accelerate its growth while maintaining  the  objective  of  profitability. This new structure promotes the synergy of support functions: with unique  customer  services,  shared  online  stores  and common logistics, sales forces can work more efficiently and devote more time to cross-selling and upselling. It has also led to changes in commercial structures. For example:\n\n- in the United Kingdom, the Group unified its offer for /uni25A0 prefabrication within a single dedicated Business Unit;\n- in the United States, the Roofing and Siding sales teams /uni25A0 have  merged,  thus  increasing  regional  coverage  and freeing up resources to create a specialist non-residential market team;\n- in France,  a  new  entity  dedicated  to  the  global /uni25A0 prescription  systems  offering,  Saint-Gobain  Solutions France, was created to promote synergies between all of the Group's brands in the construction markets.\n\nThe search for synergies is also manifested through the creation of unique platforms such 'La Maison Saint-Gobain' in France to support end-customers in their renovation projects.\n\nFinally, the goal is to offer customers unified offerings and make  Saint-Gobain  a  one-stop  shop  for  a  given application.  In  Brazil,  the  'Fa\u00e7ade'  Business  Unit  thus gathers Placo \u00ae , Isover, Weber, Brasilit and Adfors solutions within a single offering. Using these synergies, Saint-Gobain  facilitates  the  customer  experience  by offering complete building systems along with exclusive services. The customer only has to place a single order to receive  all  of  the  products  at  the  worksite,  while  a Saint-Gobain  team  also  ensures  the  smoothness  of  the work on site.",

        "page_content": "Given  its  global  reach,  Saint-Gobain's  cross-selling  is expanding  and  supports  customers  worldwide.  Among these synergies:\n\n- on the automotive market, Sekurit's glass products, as /uni25A0 well as bearings and seals, are complementary products for Group customers;\n- in the aerospace market, it is the cockpit windows and /uni25A0 radomes that can be offered to the same customers by the Mobility Business Unit;\n- for industrial markets, adhesives, abrasives and tapes /uni25A0 are complementary  products  sold via the same distribution channels;\n- finally,  the  Group  draws  on  successful  research  and /uni25A0 development collaborations and transfers between its various businesses to develop and market innovative solutions and improve its services, such as:\n- fire-resistant plasterboards developed thanks to the /uni25A0 high-temperature expertise of the Ceramics Business Unit,\n- an electrochromic glass initially developed by Sekurit /uni25A0 for  the  automotive  market,  then  adapted  for  the construction markets,\n- an  external  thermal  insulation  composite  system /uni25A0 (ETICS)  developed  in  conjunction  with  different business sectors (Mortars, Gypsum, Insulation, Technical textiles),\n- a cross-functional program in acoustics (insulation, /uni25A0 mortars, ceilings, Sekurit glass, exterior glazing and for bearings),\n- a repair solution for furnaces, the result of a transfer /uni25A0 of expertise between Weber and Sefpro,\n- the use of artificial intelligence derived from /uni25A0 transactional data through algorithms developed for the distribution branches (pricing, sales recommendation, supply chain, etc.) that can be used for other Group business lines.\n\nIn addition, the centralization of certain key functions such as  industrial  performance,  marketing,  innovation  and research  and  development,  information  systems,  and shared  HR  and  finance  service  centers  facilitates  the improvement  of  the  Group's  performance  in  terms  of expertise,  critical  mass,  sharing  of  best  practices,  cost containment, widespread deployment of excellence programs, and technical flows and collaboration.\n\nThe sharing of knowledge and expertise is essential to fostering synergies and is facilitated by meetings between innovation and marketing professionals, as expressed in by the creation of 'The Hive' community, whose third annual meeting was held remotely in November/uni00A02020. Discussions were  held  on  topics  such  as  off-site construction,  data,  digital  construction  and  sustainable business development.\n\nAnother example is the global roll-out via the Unicampus platform (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 3.3.5) of a training offer that  includes  courses  on  the  main  central  functions (marketing, industrial performance, research and development, purchasing, etc.) combining theory, practice and experience sharing.\n\nFinally, synergies are also generated through the dissemination  of  a  culture  of  innovation,  which  has\n\nhistorically been expressed in different ways within the Group:\n\n- the Group's industrial business lines can thus benefit /uni25A0 from the experience of retailers in terms of digitizing their product and service offering for customers;\n- the regional businesses, in the construction markets, are /uni25A0 increasingly developing a co-development approach, a model  that  is  in  the  DNA  of  the  High  Performance Solutions businesses. They thus benefit from existing experiences  within  the  Group:  for  example,  the  joint development,  with  two  German  manufacturers,  of Actilaz  laser  technology,  which  is  central  to  ECLAZ high-performance glazing.\n\n## A solution-based approach 2.2.4\n\nThe combination of a global presence and an extensive offering enables Saint-Gobain to offer market players a solution-based approach. Beyond the traditional approach of meeting a specific need with a dedicated product, the objective  is  to  support  customers  in  their  quest  for performance on complex issues.\n\nThis approach is built on three pillars:\n\n- offering systems, i.e. , a combination of products that /uni25A0 guarantees  a  given  technical  performance  and  often combines benefits in terms of sustainable development and/or productivity. This is the case for the solutions developed  in  the  prefabrication  segment,  or  the Optimax Habito solution born from synergies between ISOVER  and  Placo \u00ae in  France.  Optimax  Habito \u00ae is  a unique system for insulating walls from the inside. In addition to the reduction in the number of products used, the benefits of this innovation for craftsmen are an average time-saving of 20% and a reduction in the risk of injury, but also a reduction in waste on worksite. Finally, these are materials that can be fully recovered via the Placo Recycling \u00ae and Isover Recycling channels;\n- offering services with ever more value to the Group's /uni25A0 customers, such as the data analysis service offered to Saint-Gobain  High  Performance  Solutions  customers, and the ones offered by the Group's retail chains to enable craftsmen to refocus on their core business, or the  services  associated  with  Building  Information Modeling (BIM);\n- developing solutions jointly with Saint-Gobain's clients. /uni25A0\n\nIn the example of the construction of a hospital, the Group is  able  to  propose  solutions  that  address  all  of  the project's issues, offering products and services that have value individually and as a system, by combining support services  with  upstream  project  management,  including BIM, impact-resistant partitions, architectural membranes, air treatment solutions, etc.\n\nIn the case of the renovation of a residential building, this means  being  able  to  combine  insulation  solutions, high-performance  glazing,  plasterboard  and  ventilation systems  and  to  offer  construction  or  support  waste recycling services for end-users.\n\nService offerings such as Kandu, which has already been rolled out in France and aims to improve air quality, heat, lighting  and  the  organization  of  workspaces  in  public spaces  (restaurants,  stores,  offices,  schools,  nurseries, etc.), also provide a holistic approach to the quality of indoor spaces.\n\n2",

This means providing sustainable solutions that protect the future of the planet and of its occupants, and enabling its professional customers to improve their performance.\n\n## Offering more sustainable solutions 3.1\n\nSaint-Gobain  designs,  produces  and  distributes  increasingly  sustainable  solutions  for  construction  markets  and  the industry. It does so as part of a product innovation effort guided by the anticipation of market trends, taking into account customer needs and compliance with the strictest transparency and security standards (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 3.2). These innovation  efforts  are  underpinned,  in  the  construction  market,  by  a  holistic  approach  to  what  makes  a  building sustainable. This original approach combines the environmental footprint of the building throughout its life cycle with the well-being and health of its occupants:\n\n- acting for the climate by contributing to the /uni25A0 decarbonization  of  the  markets  in  which  the  Group operates:\n- by reducing its carbon  footprint through  the /uni25A0 implementation of its roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050 (see chapter/uni00A03, section 2.2.1.2),\n- thanks  to  the  emissions  avoided  when  using  its /uni25A0 products,  such  as  energy-efficient  solutions  for buildings or lightened glazing for vehicles,\n- by proposing lightweight solutions to replace /uni25A0 construction methods that generate more greenhouse gas emissions, such as the F4-type light fa\u00e7ade in France, which makes it possible to divide water consumption and CO2 emissions in half,\n- by  supporting  the  development  of  segments  that /uni25A0 contribute to energy transition (electric cars, energy storage, solar and wind power),\n- by innovating with its partners across its entire value /uni25A0 chain, from the extraction of raw materials to the end of product life, including transportation;\n- limiting the impact on natural resources: /uni25A0\n- by reducing water consumption in operations and on /uni25A0 worksite, for example through the use of Webercol Flex  Eco  mortar,  composed  of  new  raw  materials from the recovery of industrial co-products, which reduces CO2 emissions by 50%, water consumption by 28%, and non-renewable energy use by 27%,\n- by increasing the use of recycled material in industrial /uni25A0 processes, in particular for the production of gypsum or glass,\n- by limiting the generation of waste on worksite, for /uni25A0 example via the  Lean  by  Placo  solution,  which includes  the  cutting  of  plasterboard  in  the  plant, thanks to the development of off-site or prefabricated construction,\n- by taking actions to collect waste on worksite, /uni25A0\n- by  contributing  to  the  development  of  recycling /uni25A0 channels,\n- ensuring health and well-being: /uni25A0\n- by taking into account thermal, acoustic and visual /uni25A0 comfort and indoor air quality for the end-user,\n- by  ensuring  an  optimal  level  of  safety  for  the /uni25A0 products placed on the market by the Group, for the end-user and the fitter.\n\nGenerally speaking, the solutions proposed by Saint-Gobain  reduce  resource  usage  intensity,  limit  the energy consumption of the buildings, vehicles or facilities they equip and have a low carbon footprint. Among the innovations marketed by the Group are:\n\n- ultra lightweight glazing developed for automobiles by /uni25A0 Sekurit, reducing the weight of a car by up to 6/uni00A0kg;\n- the  Gyproc  Ergolite  plasterboard  with  a  25%  weight /uni25A0 reduction for a reduced carbon content, all without any change in efficiency.\n\nThese  eco-designed  solutions  are  adapted  to  types  of customers, markets and regions, in particular the different types  of  climates.  In  Norway,  the  alliance  between  the Optimera brand and Hunton, a manufacturer of wood-fiber-based  products,  has  led  to  the  creation  of 'Green Panels'. Installed in service or residential buildings, these  panels  or  walls  are  made  from  wood  fiber  from Norwegian  forests.  They  are  a  response  to  a  growing demand for environmentally friendly insulation solutions and  solutions  capable  of  regulating  hydrometry  and improving  acoustics.  Together,  the  two  players  have invested  in  research  and  development  to  develop  this solution, which offsets the CO2 emissions emitted during its production.\n\nIn the construction market, the Group offers solutions for both  new  construction  and  renovation,  residential  and non-residential,  with  a  variety  of  construction  methods, climates, cultures and disparities between emerging and developed  countries.  In  these  markets,  the  Group  is particularly well positioned thanks to its comprehensive range of solutions for energy efficiency in buildings and its lighter, less resource-intensive construction, with a lower carbon footprint.\n\n- by increasing the lifespan of products; /uni25A0",

        "page_content": "In the mobility market, in the same way, user experience (in the case of individual vehicles, for both the passenger and the driver) and environmental footprint guide product innovation policy. Saint-Gobain puts its expertise to use for  its  industrial  customers,  such  as  car  manufacturers, taking into account the benefits for the end-user.\n\nIn addition to products, the Group is developing a range of services adapted to changes in these markets largely to support  the  development  of  the  circular  economy.  In France, La/uni00A0Plateforme du/uni00A0B\u00e2timent had already innovated\n\nThe mission\n\nin 2017 with a service called 'Les Ripeurs'. More recently, Point.P, a Saint-Gobain subsidiary, created the 'BatiReprise' service in collaboration with Suez, a waste management  company,  to  facilitate  the  collection  of construction  site  waste  in  eleven  sales  outlets  for  the purpose  of  raising  awareness  and  supporting  building craftsmen  in  the  act  of  sorting  and  recovering  waste. Point.P already has 76 own waste reception centers, which handle more than 100,000/uni00A0m/three.sup of waste per year.\n\n## Improving the performance of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's/uni00A0customers 3.2\n\n## For the construction professional: 3.2.1 improving productivity\n\nProductivity is the core concern in construction businesses. Thanks to its dual positioning as a manufacturer and a distributor, and to the diversity of its businesses, Saint-Gobain has multiple ways of supporting its customers, helping them choose the most appropriate solutions, and purchasing and implementing them. It can also train them with ever-increasing efficiency while taking their constraints into account.\n\n## Facilitating the work of craftsmen 3.2.1.1 through integrated services\n\nFor trade customers, saving time and being well-supported are essential. In-store services and digital services are becoming increasingly important. Here are a few examples:\n\n- in  France,  SOLU+,  a  tool  to  help  with  renovation /uni25A0 projects, assists professionals in making their estimates, costing projects and providing advice to customers. It can now be interfaced with the Tolteck solution, which allows craftsmen to generate quotes and invoices in a single flow;\n- in the United Kingdom, Saint-Gobain developed Build /uni25A0 Aviator, a services package to help manufacturers save time and gain efficiency. From design to planning and from sourcing to the final delivery, the Build Aviator app  guides  and  assists  customers  with  ecological building  solutions.  Professionals  can  thus  assess  a building's energy and carbon efficiency and obtain the necessary  calculations  and  reports  to  comply  with construction standards;\n- thanks  to  intermediation  platforms  developed  by /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain, in France via \"La Maison Saint-Gobain\", in Brazil, or the 3S application developed by Saint-Gobain Gyproc in Vietnam, trade customers can increase their visibility and grow their customer base;\n- Saint-Gobain  is  developing  reduced-format  trading /uni25A0 brands in the center of large urban areas to facilitate closer contact with worksites in downtown areas. For example,  the  Plataforma  de  la/uni00A0Construcci\u00f3n  in  Spain and  Point.P  in  France  have  begun  to  roll  out  new sales-outlet formats in city centers or areas near cities, close  to  customers  and  for  the  renovation  sector  in particular.\n\n## Improving worksite productivity 3.2.1.2 through innovative products\n\nThe  time  saved  is  of  benefit  mostly  to  the  work  of professionals on construction sites:\n\n- in the United Kingdom in 2020, Saint-Gobain launched /uni25A0 under the Weber brand a new imitation brick fa\u00e7ade cladding, co-developed with a British start-up, which is both lighter and more flexible, consisting of a fiberglass mesh coated with 95% natural minerals. Compared to traditional material, installation time is three times faster on average, resulting in lower labor costs; it is also an ideal  product  for  builders  of  prefabricated  buildings because  it  is  much  lighter  and  therefore  easier  to transport and handle;\n- in  the  same  vein,  in  eight  countries,  the  brand  now /uni25A0 offers its Weberdry PUR solution, a new waterproofing system  for  flat  roofs,  terraces,  balconies  and  water tanks, which is much easier to apply and has a much longer service life than existing products, an average of 25/uni00A0years compared  to  ten  years  for  conventional waterproofing membranes;\n- a ready-to-pour floor solution, the 'weberfloor service' /uni25A0 covers the entire process from the supply of powdered mortar to the mixing-pumping of floor plasters. Thanks to  the  'webertruck',  a  pump  truck  that  travels  on construction sites, the installation company focuses its resources solely on the application of products;\n- Saint-Gobain  also  designs  solutions  that  save  time /uni25A0 during installation, such as bulk glass wool or Weber's WeberCom Flex Confort glue.\n\n## Innovations for productivity 3.2.1.3\n\nThe Group  is innovating in emergent  aspects  of construction. A few examples of this are:\n\n## Prefabrication and off-site construction\n\nPrefabrication is a major trend that lies at the crossroads of two phenomena: a need to build more housing more quickly and, in some countries, a shortage of skilled labor in  the  building  professions.  Prefabrication  refers  to  all methods and processes that make it possible to construct all or part of a building outside the construction site.\n\n2",

Norgeshus has 118/uni00A0dealers covering all Norway and intends to build between 1,100 and 1,200 dwellings per year;\n- in the  United  States,  Saint-Gobain  also  signed  a /uni25A0 co-development  agreement  with  Unity  Homes,  a prefabricated home builder based in New Hampshire. These two partners are joining forces to revolutionize US residential construction methods and open a new innovation  channel  on  the  high-performance  habitat market;\n- in Spain, Saint-Gobain is involved in the construction of /uni25A0 a 108-bed hospital in Catalonia, designed solely on the basis of modular elements and pre-assembled in the factory, enabling the building to be built in just four months, compared with four years following traditional methods;\n- in  Denmark,  with  the  Br\u00f8drene  Dahl  and  ISOVER /uni25A0 brands, Saint-Gobain is involved in the construction of 478 prefabricated student housing units to be built in 2021 in Lyngby.\n\nIn terms of distribution activities, other Group specialist brands  have  invested  in  numerous  aspects  of  the prefabricated  market,  such  as  bathrooms,  roofing  and structural components.\n\n## 3D printing\n\nThe  Group  is  already  using  3D  printing  technologies, especially  for  the  creation  of  samples  and  prototyping. These technologies offer particularly interesting prospects for  reducing  environmental  impact  (for  lower  waste production)  and  facilitating  the  creation  of  complex shapes for a wide variety of applications:\n\n- the  Group  has  invested  in  the  Netherlands  with  its /uni25A0 partner BAM in a large-scale pilot line at the Weber Beamix  plant  in  Eindhoven.  After  several  years  of development and R&D, this activity is now entering a commercial phase, making it one of the most advanced in  the  world,  with  various  concrete  achievements  in 2020, including  bridges,  stairs,  street  furniture,  and even its first individual house, which will be occupied in 2021;\n- in  Singapore,  Hamilton  Holdings,  a  3D  construction /uni25A0 printing company, has partnered with Saint-Gobain and Ang  Cheng  Guan  Construction  (ACG)  to  create Hamilton Labs Additive Manufacturing & Robotics Hub to oversee 3D concrete printing. As part of this collaboration, Saint-Gobain is the exclusive supplier of materials and R&D. Ang Cheng Guan Construction will contribute a wide range of experience in buildings and construction. This collaboration also aims to promote university research and thus encourage technological innovations  in  buildings  and  construction  and  in  3D printing in particular.\n\n## Digital construction\n\nDigital design and construction represent a major trend in building  industry.  Driven  by  changes  in  the  legislative framework in many countries, building professionals are making  arrangements  to  reduce  their  costs,  improve quality and shorten timelines, working collaboratively with a unique digital model that not only embeds the building plans,  but  also  all  the  information  on  each  of  the components, including their properties and performance. This  enables  previews  and  forecasts  that  were  not previously  available:  building  efficiency,  durability,  the detection  of  design  errors,  etc.  The  challenge  is  to significantly reduce  the  total  cost  of  the  building throughout  the  life  cycle.  To  achieve  this,  building designers,  architects,  general  contractors,  etc.,  have  to download virtual 'objects' containing Saint-Gobain products, to incorporate them  into their Building Information  Model  (BIM).  Saint-Gobain  has  created  a structuring project called Product Information Management to develop a complete library of objects and offer various services to those who need them.\n\nThe WCM industrial performance program (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 2.2.1) fully integrates this digital dimension.\n\n## Providing training to professionals 3.2.1.4\n\nThe  Group  has  implemented  training  adapted  to  local businesses and markets. The Saint-Gobain teams can thus train  students,  building  companies,  trade  customers  or even a distribution network. Training structures such as Spazi Academy, in Italy, facilitate in-person training and e-learning solutions.\n\nSaint-Gobain inaugurated Weber Academy in Casablanca, Morocco, a school providing free training on the brand's solutions and  new  construction  methods  to  young graduates and trade customers to promote professionalism among local actors. In Indonesia, Saint-Gobain,  in  partnership  with INSEAD  Singapore, created the Distributor Development Program, a training course  for  Indonesian  building  materials  distributors, providing the opportunity to improve their knowledge of innovation, digital platforms, strategy and sales growth. In the Czech Republic, training centers and events provide training on Saint-Gobain brand solutions to 10,000/uni00A0installers per year.\n\nBesides technical training in products and solutions, the Saint-Gobain teams offer training in specific subjects such as renovation, modern conveniences, air quality or energy efficiency.  The  distribution  networks  have  developed specific counters for energy efficiency in certain branches and  sales  outlets  in  France  or  Northern  Europe  (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 4.1.6.3).\n\nIn France, Saint-Gobain has been rolling out a multi-channel  training  program  called  'Objective  RGE' (Recognized  Guarantor  of  the  Environment)  for  all craftsmen in its network. The novelty of 'Objective RGE' is that it offers craftsmen a real time-saver, allowing them to learn remotely on their computer, tablet or smartphone, combined with a certification system in Point.P branches. The  ambition  is  to  qualify  at  least  10,000  additional craftsmen in RGE by the end of 2022, compared to the current 2,000 per year. In addition to Point.P, all of the Group's specialized brands involved in energy renovation, notably Cedeo and SFIC, are involved.",

This is made possible by new working methods and new modes of production, and by digital manufacturing, which incorporates customers' needs from the earliest stages and allows the production of customized short series thanks to flexible and automated units and system interconnection.\n\n- In the United States, the Construction Industry Business /uni25A0 Unit's R&D team has been working with the University of  Massachusetts-Lowell  for  two  years  to  develop fabrics equipped with detectors capable of monitoring the  health  of  infrastructures  and  fabrics  capable  of monitoring the stresses that are applied to them and detect  cracks  or  damage  as  soon  as  they  appear, resulting in significant savings on maintenance costs. This is a typical example of successful co-development, as well as a solution to meet the needs of a very large market, the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers),  which  estimates  at  over  \u20ac1,8  trillion  the investment needed over the next decade to repair and upgrade infrastructure in the United States alone.\n- On  the  mobility  market,  Saint-Gobain  glazing  is /uni25A0 constantly being adapted to the needs of automobile manufacturers, particularly with regard to lightweight glass, heads-up display glass and anti-heat glass, not to mention glass in complex shapes, for which the Group's expertise is well known. All these solutions promote an optimal driving experience, with increased comfort and safety for both  driver  and  passengers.  Similarly, high-performance, polymer-based bearings, seals and foams  are  custom-designed  to  meet  the  needs  of automobile manufacturers, in terms of extending useful life  and  reducing  noise  and  weight.  Saint-Gobain's mobility  solutions  also  affect  the  production  phase using, for example, a wide range of abrasive products (adhesives, agglomerates  and  superabrasives)  for finishing and polishing automotive parts. These abrasive solutions are suitable for both developed and emerging markets.\n\n- Saint-Gobain is also working with partners to explore /uni25A0 solutions that will equip the autonomous vehicles of the future.  In  January/uni00A02020,  Sekurit,  in  partnership  with Cerence, a specialist in automotive artificial intelligence, presented a new intelligent windshield at the Las Vegas Consumer  Electronics  Show  (CES),  a  technological innovations showcase. Innovations such as transparent screens,  eye-tracking  and  voice  recognition  were integrated into a vehicle without control buttons, with driving  information  displayed  on  the  flat  glass.  The windshield improves the comfort and safety of vehicle occupants and is part of the future of mobility.\n- Saint-Gobain also explores future development /uni25A0 opportunities through partnerships with manufacturers. In  South  Korea,  the  Life  Sciences  Business  Unit  and Samsung BioLogics, the biopharmaceutical unit of the Samsung Group, signed a strategic partnership for the supply  of  single-use  systems.  Saint-Gobain  invested nearly \u20ac16/uni00A0million to build a state-of-the-art industrial facility for the manufacture of bioprocesses in 2020. It is located in the Songdo biocluster, in the outskirts of Seoul, and  bring  together  research  centers  and companies working in biotechnology. This investment enables the Life Sciences Business Unit to strengthen its customer focus and supply chain to better serve the Korean biopharmaceutical industries.\n- Lastly, this co-development model is accompanied by /uni25A0 an evolution of business models into more comprehensive  products  and  services  with  a  higher level  of  service.  Accordingly,  the  Ceramics  Business Unit  offers  diagnostic  and  maintenance  services  to manufacturers who use its refractories, thereby linking a connected product to an associated service.\n- Similarly, Saint-Gobain has joined forces with one of its /uni25A0 customers  to  co-develop  a  specific  filter  to  support newborn children who need nitric oxide.\n\nThroughout the life cycle of its products, Saint-Gobain can offer engineering, repair and recycling services. This truly highlights Saint-Gobain's ability to provide reliable, high-performance and cutting-edge solutions.\n\n2",

This provides a challenge for the Group: in many cases, 'contact' no longer takes the form of a scheduled, physical meeting, but is made via the  Group's  websites  or via social  networking,  at  the customer's instigation.\n\nThus, beyond in-person meetings with direct customers, there is a need to develop a digital strategy that allows the Group to capitalize on all the individual contact requests using a 'phygital' approach, which combines physical and digital  points  of  contact.  The  updating  of  websites  is crucial, to provide visitors using fixed or mobile devices with a high-quality experience that they find useful and encourages  them  to  extend  their  visit  to  the  site.  The purpose of the approach, for non-commercial sites, is to convert  as  many  visits  as  possible  into  commercial contacts. This procedure is deployed throughout the Group;  the  health  crisis experienced  in  2020  has contributed to the acceleration of this trend, reinforcing the  importance  of  e-commerce  (see  Chapter/uni00A01,  section 3.2).  Retailers,  for  their  part,  have,  in  most  of  their countries, made online sales offerings (e-commerce) more accessible with better designed and simpler-to-use sites with  ever  more  advanced  features  such  as  product searches and orders, information on inventories, locating sales  outlets,  click  &  collect,  or  scanning  products  on smartphones. A few examples illustrate this very well:\n\n- Sanitas Troesch, a Saint-Gobain brand in Switzerland /uni25A0 specializing  in  kitchen  and  bathroom  solutions,  has simplified its customer  experience  thanks  to  an e-commerce  site  for  craftsmen,  which  allows  order changes until 5/uni00A0p.m. the day before delivery, based on real-time inventory management;\n- in France, the Instaply service offered by La/uni00A0Plateforme /uni25A0 du/uni00A0B\u00e2timent was  highly  successful.  The  application allows  business  customers  to  communicate  by  text message  with  the  brand's  teams  to  ask  technical questions or order products directly;\n- in Denmark, the brand Br\u00f8drene Dahl, which specializes /uni25A0 in  plumbing,  sanitary  and  heating,  is  rolling  out  its Self-Service  app,  which  allows  customers  to  order directly  from  their  smartphone  or  tablet,  scan  their purchases  at  the  point  of  sale  and  to  pay,  all  of  it 'contactless'. Since its launch, two 'test' sales outlets have seen 10% of their sales come from the application. Since then, new sales outlets have been equipped.\n\nWhether it is for commercial or non-commercial websites, data analysis is fundamental in developing the sites in the direction  that  visitors  wish  to  see.  This  in-depth  work makes it possible to be as close as possible to customers and to develop value-added services. The more channels involved in interacting with the customer - websites, social\n\nnetworking pages, emails, forums, online chat, etc. - the more complex the customer's experience. Techniques for targeting and fostering loyalty among a client base are becoming  more  diverse.  Saint-Gobain's  omnichannel approach  therefore  aims  to  ensure  a  seamless  and consistent customer experience across physical and digital touch points, along the entire customer experience. All brands  and  trading  brands  have  rolled  out  digital strategies to differentiate their products and ensure brand visibility. The  wealth  of  information  available  online, real-time inventory checks by customers, the organization of logistics networks, and speed of product delivery are key factors in the success of retail sites. In some of the Group's activities, innovative systems are being developed that  enable  an  immersive  experience  thanks  to  virtual reality, such  as  the  3D  scanning  of  glass  furnaces developed by Saint-Gobain, which enable the creation of virtual models of industrial facilities, a valuable tool that allows  the  operator  to  reduce  the  duration  of  cold inspections between two production campaigns. The aim of all the digital tools developed by the Group is not only to foster better knowledge of the customer, but also to make the process easier for them and to meet their needs more easily and directly.\n\nThis  integration  of  digital  within  customer  journeys  is inseparable from the development of logistics. By pooling their  logistics  centers,  the  brands  can  optimize  their inventory management and carefully control supply to the different  sales  outlets,  for  continuous  improvement  in terms of product availability. Automation of the centers also means that thousands of order lines can be processed every day, reducing delivery times to 24/uni00A0hours, and even just 1/uni00A0hour in certain major conurbations. The brands are also  developing  integrated  logistics  solutions,  offering customers  end-to-end  logistics  for  a  construction  or renovation  site,  from  delivery  of  materials  to  waste collection. In terms of e-commerce activities, in addition to the  wealth  of  information  available  online,  real-time inventory  checks  by  customers,  the  organization  of logistics networks and speed of product delivery are key factors in the success of retail sites.\n\nThese  digital-induced  transformations  complement  the Group's efforts to guarantee the best customer experience in  physical  meeting  situations:  supporting  and  advising customers at sales outlets, sales visits, deliveries, as well as experiential venues or showrooms.\n\n## Offering personalized experiences 4.1.1.2 through the use of data\n\nCustomer activity online or in-store generates significant amounts  of  data.  The  statistical  analysis  of  these  data forms the basis for predictive models that enable a better response to end customer expectations. The bulk of data, or Big Data, once analyzed, becomes Smart Data, a set of intelligent and useful data for the brand and the customer, which must always be collected in compliance with the European  Regulation  on  Personal  Data,  or  GDPR  (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 1.3.4).",

        "page_content": "The  first  challenge  in  the  Smart  Data  approach  is  to strengthen relations with customers, getting to know them better to provide them with a better service. Consequently, the Saint-Gobain brands' main e-commerce sites in France and Scandinavia now make systematic use of suggestion-based selling: when a visitor is interested in a product, they are provided with a list of recommendations  based  on  the  product  combinations seen  in  shopping  baskets.  This  automatically  increases basket  values.  In  recent  years,  more  highly  developed approaches  emerged;  these  are  likely  to  become  more widespread.  Accordingly,  the  data  scientists  at  the Saint-Gobain  Research  Paris  datalab  have  developed  a method for systematic study of the semantics of customer reviews online. Using this method, hotels and restaurants with poor acoustics can now be identified, allowing the Habitat specification teams to target these establishments and offer them appropriate solutions.\n\nThe  fluid,  comprehensive  and  increasingly  personalized experiences  offered  by  Saint-Gobain  are  part  of  a commercial excellence approach that aims for the greatest possible customer satisfaction. The Group has put in place operational tools and organizational structures to achieve this.\n\n## Developing new business models 4.1.2\n\nSaint-Gobain is also focusing on the development of new business models. The Group has developed a structured approach  and  country  and  Business  Unit  teams  are provided with toolkits and encouraged to determine their value proposition, target customer  segments,  sales\n\nchannels, types of interaction, activities, key partners and resources, and costs and revenue sources.\n\nWhether they are additional services to direct customers or the development of service offerings for end customers or  influencers,  numerous  examples  of  new  business models have already been developed within the Group, including:\n\n- in Brazil, with the 'product as a service' scheme, an /uni25A0 offer of furnace refractories that includes a guaranteed performance and predictable pricing during the product's useful life;\n- launched  in  2018  in  France,  Kandu  services  for /uni25A0 professionals who want to improve the quality of their work or restaurant spaces that combine Saint-Gobain's expertise in building sciences and its original approach to  comfort  in  a  one-stop  shop,  through  customized support and technical solutions;\n- marketplaces  such  as  Toca  Obra  in  Brazil  and /uni25A0 Autovershop, which offer a broad customer base and enable synergies in purchasing and the supply chain;\n- intermediation platforms, through La/uni00A0Maison /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain  in  France,  NejRemeslnici  in  the  Czech Republic or Get Ninjas in Brazil;\n- waste take-back and recycling services, particularly in /uni25A0 the  gypsum  business,  where  they  exist  in  a  dozen countries; they enable market differentiation, but also allow  for  greater  control  over  the  quality  of  the materials collected and, in the long term, the availability of natural resources.\n\n## Innovate for sustainable differentiation 4.2\n\nResearch and innovation are at the heart of Saint-Gobain's strategy. The Group's ongoing actions enabled it to be ranked in the tenth time in a row among the world's top 100 most innovative organizations in the \"Top 100 Global Innovator\u2122\". This barometer assesses nearly 14,000/uni00A0companies on several criteria, including not only the number of patents filed, but also the influence on other innovations (the impact that an invention has on the filing of patents by other players), the percentage of successful patent  submissions,  and  the  global  legal  protection effort/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## A shared culture of innovation 4.2.1\n\nSaint-Gobain's  innovation  process  is  underpinned  by constant attention to customer expectations and needs, with the creation of value for them being the prerequisite for profitable growth for the Group. Innovation goes far beyond products; it also includes services and business models. Strategically, it must engage the entire organization around a mindset focused on innovation and must:\n\n- create the conditions for creativity by encouraging the /uni25A0 permanent detection of opportunities to solve problems encountered by the Group's customers and respond to them with new solutions;\n- relearn  the  processes  that  facilitate  creativity;  the /uni25A0 challenge here is to give freedom to divergent thinking, while  remaining  focused  on  the  rapid  production  of results, in an agile manner;\n- explore all of the ways that innovation is generated, not /uni25A0 only the innovation initiatives conducted for a long time by the research and development and marketing teams, but also intrapreneurship approaches and collaboration with external entities (companies, public organizations, or research structures) in an atmosphere of co-development and open innovation.\n\nInnovation is one of the five 'Attitudes', the pillars of the Group's  managerial  culture  (see  Chapter/uni00A03,  section  1.2). Being open-minded and thinking outside the box, taking original  paths,  questioning  practices  inherited  from  the past to suggest and experiment with new ones: these are some  of  the  skills  valued  by  all  of  Saint-Gobain's employees.\n\n2",

The Group  acts  on  a  daily  basis  to  give  employees  the resources to act and bring out their talents, work in a collaborative, networked, multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary manner, share best practices, experiment with agile methods or design thinking, seek skills outside their usual scope and interact and work with different  generations.  It  also  means,  in  very  practical terms,  promoting  intellectual  agility,  serendipity  and creative thinking through reinvented workplaces. Saint-Gobain  also  emphasizes  the  responsiveness  and ability  of  its  employees  to  adapt  to  change  through  a redesigned  management  system  that  includes  light reports, fast execution, and more delegation of decision-making.\n\nIn terms of method, the objective is to systematically favor the clients' point of view and the needs of the field, using tools such as personae , standard profiles that provide a better  understanding  of  the  key  market  targets,  their unresolved expectations and the areas of productivity not yet exploited. Openness to the external environment is crucial to anticipate changes on the ground as well as technological developments. Careful monitoring of market trends is therefore an essential step that may involve the implementation  of  a  structured  monitoring  of  practices and competition, regular visits to customers to find out about their daily lives, or even through the organization of learning  expeditions  to  innovative  companies  in  other sectors.\n\nFinally, innovation benefits from tools and methodologies that  are  particularly  useful  in  adjacent  and  disruptive projects where traditional working methods are reaching their limits. For Saint-Gobain, innovation is therefore the combination of a mindset shared by everyone, on the one hand, and the right tools and structures, on the other.\n\n## Strategic pillars of innovation 4.2.2\n\nThe  Group's  innovation  efforts  in  terms  of  products, services  and  manufacturing  processes  are  based  on  a number of strategic pillars:\n\n- for construction,  dynamic  and  intelligent  building /uni25A0 materials,  as  well  as  advanced  technologies  such  as prefabrication, 3D printing, or robotization;\n- for mobility: in-vehicle comfort  (noise,  vibrations, /uni25A0 aerodynamics, thermal comfort, etc.), weight reduction, new features and usages in terms of safety, information and entertainment;\n- for life sciences: development of personalized medicine, /uni25A0 new diagnoses;\n- in general, eco-innovation, or the design of solutions /uni25A0 with minimized impacts and optimized benefits on the environment and health;\n- but  also  innovation  in  manufacturing  processes  to /uni25A0 reduce  their  environmental  footprint,  such  as  the transition to low-carbon energy, heat recovery, or the design of 'zero carbon' plants;\n- innovation  in  the  design  of  integrated  services  for /uni25A0 craftsmen  or  project  managers  for  construction  or renovation projects;\n- finally,  innovation  also  involves  business  models,  as /uni25A0 evidenced, for example, in the aeronautics sector by the sale of cockpit glazing no longer individually but also according to the flight hours performed by the product.\n\n## Customer-oriented R&D 4.2.3\n\nInvestments  in  research  and  development  enable  the Group to maintain and expand its leading positions in its markets  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  performance  and operational  excellence.  In  2020,  the  Group  invested \u20ac428/uni00A0million in research and development, with more than 3,600/uni00A0people working on multiple research projects, the protection of the results of which led to over 400 new patents.\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  a  framework  of  eight  cross-functional R&D centers around the world, as well as numerous units dedicated to specific businesses or technologies. These eight centers - three in France and five others in Germany, the United States, China, India and Brazil - all offer a broad spectrum of expertise in materials and process sciences to the Group.\n\nThis structure, in which R&D teams are divided between cross-functional  centers  and  centers  dedicated  to  each business, makes it possible to combine a materials culture and  expertise  in  processes.  Projects  are  selected  and managed  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  business  lines  and countries.  Each  year,  this  involves  the  launch  of  new projects  but  also  the  completion  of  previous  projects through industrialization or commercial launch.\n\nIn terms of the benefits of innovation, beyond the specific aspects of each business line and the essential maintenance of key technology skills, special attention is paid to three priorities: attention to customer value, digital transformation,  and  the  response  to  the  challenges  of sustainable development.\n\n## Targeting innovation on customer needs 4.2.3.1\n\nImproving the relationship with customers is essential to identify opportunities more quickly for the Group to add value. Various tools and initiatives undergird this approach, such as deployment of training and methodologies, investments in test benches, development of  real  or  virtual  prototyping  resources  to  accelerate customer  validation,  and  creation  of  specific  locations. Examples  of  this  last  point  include  the  application laboratory inaugurated  in  2019  by  Saint-Gobain  in Compi\u00e8gne (France), and the new Saint-Gobain laboratory in Shanghai (China) dedicated to testing materials used in the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. Designed as  an  alternative  approach  to  innovation,  they  enable design  thinking  and  user  experience  approaches  to  be deployed  within  the  various  R&D  centers  for  the development of new products, systems and services as close as possible to customer needs. As a result, the R&D teams are able to run scenarios for the use of different prototypes and to evaluate, modify and propose solutions that meet the expectations of customers in the mobility or construction markets.",

It requires the development of new skills  within  R&D  teams  and  in  data  science,  robotics, electronics or virtual reality.\n\nThis  digital  transformation  accelerates  innovation  in  all markets, increasing the power of the end consumer and enabling the emergence of new services and new uses. In the construction markets, innovation is traditionally slow due to the very long life cycle of products, but digital transformation, combined  with  underlying  trends  in environmental  performance  and  rapid  urbanization,  is leading  to  the  continuous  emergence  of  new  services, enabling players to deliver new or renovated buildings and living places that are more efficient and more pleasant, at a better cost and within shorter timeframes.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as in the Saint-Gobain  Research  Paris  Datalab,  also  enables  the creation of new services driven by data and improving the performance of existing businesses, for distribution and industrial production, such as e-commerce development, automated pricing, logistic optimization, responsiveness of production  lines  and  reduction  of  energy  consumption. This  expertise  is  developed  by  central  R&D  in  close collaboration with the Group's business lines and teams working on information systems.\n\n## Meeting environmental challenges 4.2.3.3\n\nSignificant work was carried out in 2020 to structure a roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality in 2050. Specific work  was  carried  out  on  Saint-Gobain's  main  business\n\nlines in the three scopes/uni00A01, 2 and 3. This has led to the acceleration of the Group's R&D project program in order to  explore  ways  to  reduce  the  Saint-Gobain's  footprint through  product  design,  changes  in  processes,  energy vectors  and  raw  materials  used.  This  approach  aligns research  and  development  with  the  priorities  of  the Group's  strategy,  which  is  geared  towards  carbon neutrality and the preservation of resources.\n\nThe first area of work consists, on the basis of a product life cycle analysis, of:\n\n- working  internally  and  with  suppliers,  and  generally /uni25A0 speaking with the Saint-Gobain's entire ecosystem to design and technically validate resourceand energy-efficient products that remain high-performance through such means as making them lighter or incorporating recycled materials;\n- conceiving  of  recycling  and  disassembly  from  the /uni25A0 design phase;\n- using  the  numerous  technologies  of  the  Group  to /uni25A0 design  functional  systems  with  lower  environmental impacts, such as reduced-weight fa\u00e7ade solutions.\n\nThe second area of focus consists of ongoing work to improve processes, reduce energy consumption, increase yields and operating turnaround times, and the recovery and reuse of heat and fluids. In addition to these ongoing improvements,  research  is  being  carried  out  into  more disruptive  innovations  to  help  increase  the  use  of low-carbon energy sources and recycled materials.\n\nFinally, in line with Saint-Gobain's strategy and purpose, the increasing use of product life cycle analysis also gives the Group the culture to develop, in an ever-more efficient manner,  products  that  enable  Saint-Gobain  to  help  its customers reduce their environmental footprint themselves and make their ecological transition.\n\nTo support these priorities, cross-functional Group-wide R&D  programs  organize  shared  skills  and  enhance Saint-Gobain's  ability  to  develop  key  technologies  by anticipating major changes in techniques and markets.\n\n## Saint-Gobain R&D programs in 2021 4.2.3.4\n\n## TRANSVERSAL PROGRAMS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CORE TECHNOLOGIES\n\n- \u008b Organic and inorganic foams\n- \u008b Adhesives and adhesion\n- \u008b Wet coatings\n- \u008b Non-destructive testing for process control and product quality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROPOSED VALUE FOR THE GROUP'S CLIENTS\n\n- \u008b Building science\n- \u008b Sensors and connectivity for products and services\n\nDIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\n\n- \u008b Additive manufacturing and 3D printing\n- \u008b Data Science and artificial intelligence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\n- \u008b Reducing the carbon footprint of processes\n- \u008b Mineral binders with low carbon emissions\n\n2",

For example, a challenge won by two PhD students from G-SCOP in Grenoble co-organized as part of  the  initiative  led  by  ROADEF  (French  society  for operational research and decision-making support), which enabled  150  participating  researchers  to  work  on  an industrial issue for the Group, the optimization of flat glass cutting.\n\n## Cooperation with start-ups\n\nThrough  NOVA,  a  unique  structure  created  in  2006, Saint-Gobain plays an active role within the global start-up ecosystem.  NOVA's  aim  is  to  identify  opportunities  for long-term partnerships and to turn these into a reality, as well as to develop new ideas and business models. Since its creation, NOVA has studied 6,000/uni00A0start-ups and signed nearly 150/uni00A0partnerships.\n\nNOVA  focuses  its  efforts  on  the  field  of  advanced materials, but also works across the board on major topics of  interest  to  the  entire  Group  such  as  the  customer journey,  the  circular  economy,  sustainability  and  the performance of construction processes and new construction methods such as prefabrication and robotics or  connected  objects.  It  provides  targeted  support  to Saint-Gobain teams working on mobility, in particular on autonomous vehicles, or life sciences.\n\nNOVA's  vision  is  to  enable  disruptive  innovation  by working to identify opportunities to create shared value. NOVA works with Saint-Gobain teams to set up strategic co-development  partnerships,  distribution  or  marketing agreements, or licensing agreements with start-ups. Since the end of 2016, NOVA has extended its field of expertise by acquiring equity stakes in start-ups. Examples include Sweeten, an intermediation company in the United States, and  InDeco  (2019),  a  company  based  in  China  that specializes in the optimization of office spaces.\n\nSince 2019, NOVA has had its own budget and accelerated the acquisition of minority stakes in innovative companies. To  support  its  approach,  Saint-Gobain  is  a  partner, through NOVA, of several incubators, including:\n\n- Greentown  Labs  in  the  United  States,  specializing  in /uni25A0 green technologies;\n- Impulse Labs in France, which specializes in /uni25A0 construction businesses;\n- Cubo in Brazil, a specialist in digitization; /uni25A0\n- RWTH  Aechen  University  in  Germany,  a  prestigious /uni25A0 engineering school that integrates an excellent start-up incubator called RWTH Innovation;\n- Tus-Holdings in China, a company that develops, builds, /uni25A0 and  manages  TusPark,  the  largest  university  science park in the world;\n- Also in China, the Caohejing Hi-Tech Park Innovation /uni25A0 Center in Shanghai.\n\nFinally, NOVA is also limited partner in three investment funds  targeted  for  the  Group's  business lines and geographical regions: Navitas Capital for construction and Phoenix  Venture  Partners  (PVP)  for  material  sciences, both in the United States, and Environmental Technologies Fund (ETF) in Europe, focused on sustainable development.\n\nWhatever  the  form  of  collaboration  with  startups, Saint-Gobain's  philosophy  is  based  on  three  values:  an approach  that  benefits  all  stakeholders;  a  passion  for learning  and  researching  new  ideas;  and  an  open  and flexible approach to relationships. NOVA also acts as a window to the outside world, helping to connect internal teams  with  new  ways  of  working  and  with  innovation produced outside the Group.\n\n## An internal venturing approach\n\nSaint-Gobain encourages the intrapreneurial dynamic of its teams, with the goal of promoting the development and sharing of ideas to create new business opportunities and new initiatives by combining the Group's strengths with a mindset and methodologies closer to the functioning of a start-up.\n\nIn  Brazil,  the  internal  venturing  approach  is  structured around the InPulse program. The most promising ideas put forward by employees benefit from Group support and give rise to acceleration and financing initiatives. Elsewhere in the Group, calls for ideas and collaborative innovation platforms have also come to exist.\n\nBeyond  these  concrete  examples,  the  idea  is  also  to systematically promote within the teams constant adaptation to fast-moving changes, to develop the ability to  experiment,  to  adjust,  and  to  apply  resilience  and tenacity.",

        "page_content": "## Leveraging digital transformation 4.3\n\nThrough its offering of solutions and by changing the way it works,  interacts  with  customers  or  suppliers,  and produces  and  distributes  its  products,  Saint-Gobain  is integrating digital technology into its core business model. Digital technology offers many opportunities to intensify relationships with customers and prospects and to provide them with tailored services that enable them to become more  efficient  and  grow  their  business.  This  digital transformation more broadly encompasses the Group as a whole and has a strong impact on working methods as well as talent acquisition and training issues.\n\n## Managerial culture and skills 4.3.1\n\nFirst of all, digital technology  is  transforming  the company's  culture,  especially  its  managerial  culture. Management  methods  are  changing  to  give  more importance  to  the  culture  of  continuous  feedback.  The Group has thus developed a panoramic evaluation tool (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 3.3.7.1), and this type of evaluation is a mandatory part of management school training.\n\nDigital  technology  is  also  transforming  the  content  of missions. It enables increasing automation in certain areas, which allows the Group's employees, on industrial sites as well as sales outlets and headquarters, to devote less time to certain repetitive tasks with low added value. These developments make it essential for employees to be able to train independently and continuously via an e-learning platform. Training is available in up to 30/uni00A0languages on a platform  accessible  to  all  employees,  including via a personal  mobile  phone.  Generally  speaking,  the  Group attaches great importance to the training and support of its teams for the enhancement of their digital skills so that they can keep pace with market and business developments.\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  also  joined  forces  with  the  online coaching  start-up  MoovOne  to  accelerate  the  cultural, managerial  and  digital  transformation  initiated  several years ago. MoovOne and Saint-Gobain developed the new role of managers in three successful pilot projects. Today, the  offer,  which  encompasses  individual  and  group coaching,  is  available  on  an  international  scale.  The MoovOne platform is based on a community of over a hundred certified coaches who  speak  a  total of 23/uni00A0languages, thus ensuring the support of each manager in his or her native language.\n\nIn  a  context  where  the  profiles  of  recruits  and  future recruits are evolving, Saint-Gobain emphasizes  the development of human and behavioral skills, the ability to work in hybrid environments or to innovate as a team. With digital and refined data processing, career paths can be more easily individualized and the HR support policy personalized (see Chapter/uni00A03, section 3.3.7.1).\n\nIn industry 4.0, digital marketing and cybersecurity, the growth of digital has significantly increased recruitment needs. New professions have thus become very important, such as data specialists, user experience specialists and SEO specialists. In a context of competition with many companies not necessarily operating in the same fields of activity,  these  new  talents  are  precious  resources  that Saint-Gobain must succeed in attracting and retaining.\n\nFinally, digital transformation, already started at Saint-Gobain and accelerated as part of the Transform & Grow plan, has led to the rapid reorganization of teams around  tools  enabling  remote  work  in  an  efficient  and secure manner (see Chapter/uni00A01, section 3.3). It should be noted that the impact of Covid-19 on the structuring of work in companies will not change with the end of the health crisis. The flexibility, facilitated by digital technology,  that  it  has  imposed  is  bound  to  last,  with strong impacts on the managerial culture.\n\n## Using digital technology 4.3.2 to drive performance\n\n## Industry 4.0 4.3.2.1\n\nThe  Group  is  investing  in  industry  4.0  as  part  of  its operational excellence goals to maintain its industrial tool at  the  cutting  edge  of  the  sector.  The  organization  of factories  is  being  transformed  by  digital  technology. Machines  are  connected  in  real  time  and  data  analysis allows for better control of production processes, more rapid  resolution  of  any  technical  issues  and,  more generally,  an  increase  in  operational  efficiency.  Digital technology  makes  it  possible  to  customize  customer solutions  further  along  the  value  chain  and  opens  up further opportunities for co-development.\n\nThe future of industry will also be built on automation and the use of advanced  robots for industrial tasks. Collaborative robots and automated trollies safely perform repetitive tasks. Operators are also assisted by the use of augmented  reality,  which  is  particularly  effective  for maintenance and troubleshooting.\n\nWith production units where software and machine-tools interact directly with each other, a number of applications have been made possible, such as the real-time monitoring of production, automated  alert systems, predictive maintenance and the optimization of product quality by reducing both costs and the quantity of resources and energy  employed.  As  an  example,  the  Construction Industry Business Unit uses software based on artificial intelligence  to  optimize  the  operation  of  its  fiberglass furnaces.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nPerformance levers\n\nThe deployment of integrated industrial systems including data analysis, once tested, can be extended to other sites. In the Sekurit plant in Shanghai, an algorithm is piloting the glass forming process for vehicle side windows, analyzing millions of pieces of data collected on the production line: an application of the machine learning piloted in 2018 and rolled  out  to  other  Sekurit  sites  in  2020  and  2021. Generally speaking, Saint-Gobain rolls out its technology step  by  step,  firm  in  the  belief  that  initial,  low-cost advances can quickly lead to progress. Today, accessible and efficient solutions are used by 7,000/uni00A0operators in 100 Group factories worldwide. For example, an application has been developed to monitor performance in real time by  anticipating  deviations. Initially launched  at  the Eggborough  factory in the United Kingdom, this application has been rolled out to 25 flat glass factories throughout the world.\n\nReducing the cost of data storage and the price of sensors has contributed to the introduction of tools to assess and monitor production in real time, such as 'edge computing' solutions,  based  on  a  nano-computer  equipped  with open-source artificial intelligence software for key equipment. This approach, launched for example in the abrasives manufacturing plants in India, constitutes a first step  towards  the  development  of  multi-factory  global artificial intelligence solutions, thanks to the storage and enhancement of data.\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain began to extend to numerous plants around the world its Data and Analytics Academy (DnA) program, which is designed to help factories develop a data-driven  culture.  In  addition  to  data  specialists  and 'translators'  (experts  who  make  the  link  between  data\n\nanalysis  and  operations)  the  DnA  program  aims  to develop and implement training to create an initial base of skills among Group employees through a practice-based approach.  It  is  not  a  question  of  transforming  all employees into data specialists but rather demystifying the subject and enabling them to understand how to use it in  order  to  carry  out  predictive  maintenance,  improve flows,  save  energy  and  increase  plant  productivity  and flexibility; by providing them with training and coaching, the aim is to enable them to gain autonomy and achieve their local objectives.\n\nThe  DnA  program  was  developed  with  the  active participation of numerous  industrial  managers,  data specialists, WCM program managers and IT departments. Tested  in  2019  in  three  European  countries  (Poland, France and Spain), it is now being rolled out widely. The program has been adapted to the healthcare context, and in particular adapted for distance learning via collaborative tools.\n\n## Using digital technology 4.3.2.2 for better supplier interaction\n\nDigital technology is also changing the way we interact with suppliers. Digitizing supplier processes means centralizing and automating the Purchasing Department. Traditional  tasks  have  been  automated  by  means  of electronic auctions, with the use of online tools. Campaigns to monitor suppliers' e-reputation have also been  undertaken,  with  significant  outcomes,  to  identify potential problems and promote a policy of responsible purchasing.\n\n## Efficiently allocating the Group's resources 4.4\n\nIn terms of allocating financial resources, Saint-Gobain's approach  aims  both  to  target  investments  in  order  to stimulate growth and to maintain a portfolio that is both agile and value-creating.\n\n## Implementing an investment 4.4.1 policy targeting growth\n\n## Targeting the most promising 4.4.1.1 market segments\n\nTo best seize growth  opportunities, Saint-Gobain's investment policy focuses on targeting the most promising market segments, which can be broken down into three types: niche technologies with strong growth potential, ad hoc opportunities on the Group's principal markets and products with significant added value.\n\n## Investing in high-growth segments\n\nIn the Life Sciences Business Unit, Saint-Gobain invested in the  extension  of  its  Beaverton  plant  (Michigan,  United States). The doubling of capacities and three new clean rooms  will  enable  the  Group  to  respond  to  the  strong growth of the biopharmacy market. Beaverton produces silicone parts, tubes or single-use systems used for, among other purposes, the manufacture of vaccines or monoclonal  antibodies.  These  are  products  for  which\n\ndemand has continued to increase, especially since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Charny plant, in France, will double its slicon tube production  capacity.  A  first  1,400  square  meter  facility with  two  clean  rooms  and  a  production  line  is  being completed,  in  an  Industry  4.0  approach  combining robotics and automation.\n\n## Seizing growth opportunities in key markets\n\nIn the insulation market in France, Saint-Gobain is stepping up its efforts for bio-based insulation and has announced the doubling of wood fiber manufacturing capacities by 2023. The Mably wood fiber plant will see its production capacity increased to 19,000/uni00A0tons of insulation panels in 2021 and to 42,000/uni00A0tons by 2023, making it possible to meet growing demand from the biomaterials market, but also create jobs and strengthen local roots.\n\n## Strengthening high value-added product offering\n\nIn the automotive market, Sekurit is investing in ever more efficient installations to meet the growing demand for high added-value glazing. One of Chantereine's laminated glass lines in France was upgraded to meet the requirements of more  complex  shapes  and  to  integrate  the  'head-up' display function. A new production line has been launched in Saltillo (Mexico) to supply windshields and laminated roofs for electric vehicles.",

        "page_content": "## Investing primarily 4.4.1.2 in fast-growth economies\n\nIn Romania, the Isover site in Ploeisti has invested in a second  rockwool  production  line.  It  can  now  offer  its customers a wider range of products, since it is capable of manufacturing  high-density  wool  products,  particularly sought-after for external thermal  insulation (ETICS) systems.  This  work  also  provided  an  opportunity  to accelerate the plant's environmental strategy. by allowing it  to  consume  less  energy  thanks  to  natural  gas  and biomass as energy sources. It can also now recycle 100% of the waste produced internally.\n\nIn Asia, the biopharma market is experiencing dynamic global  growth.  The  Life  Sciences  Business  Unit  has invested  in  two  new  production  units,  in  Korea  and  in China. The first one includes a clean room dedicated to the integration of components into sterile assemblies used in various bioprocesses, as well as a molding press for C-Flex thermoplastics,  while  the  second  produces  bioprocess bags  used  for  preparing  and  storing  culture  media, stocking pharmaceutical products before final filling. This investment  answers  the  crucial  question  of  production capacity and its location to meet growing needs, further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Poland, after two years of work, the Saint-Gobain Glass plant launched  a  new  magnetron  line  (coater)  to manufacture  coated  glass  and  offer  high-performance, high-value solutions for both the residential and non-residential building markets.\n\n## Supporting digital transformation 4.4.1.3 and logistics\n\nDigital technology enables the Group's customers to be better  informed  and  more  demanding  and  enables  the Group  to  increase  its  productivity.  Saint-Gobain  is therefore seizing this opportunity to innovate and offer an ever-increasing amount of added value to its customers. A digital and logistical transformation was initiated several years ago to propose a customized offer with ever more efficient service.\n\n## Continuing the deployment of new IT systems\n\nMany digital solutions are backed by high-performance IT systems, which various Group entities are developing for greater performance. In distribution in particular, several brands are continuing to roll out these projects, such as Atlas in France and ICON in the United Kingdom. These systems aim at significant gains in productivity.\n\nThe Group's Purchasing function is continuing to roll out the Nazar\u00e9 project, which aims to create centralized data governance,  with  decentralized  'consumption'  in  the 70/uni00A0countries where  it  is  present.  The  internal  data disseminated  in  the  many  ERP  (Enterprise  Resource Planning) systems of the Group are collected and then installed in a central 'Data Lake', which is cleaned using algorithms and made available to users. The pooling of this data will make it possible to explore many opportunities such  as  optimizing  contracts  and  monitoring  their application, helping to develop negotiation and contracting strategies, analyzing monitoring and purchasing  performance,  or  the  automation  of  raw material inflation and deflation.\n\nIn addition, Saint-Gobain invests in improving the customer  experience.  SEFPRO  has  thus  developed  a\n\nremote inspection tool for products before receipt by the customer.  Equipped  with  glasses  and  a  headset,  a SEFPRO  operator  makes  a  complete  tour  of  the equipment, connected via a dedicated platform with the customer.  In  addition  to  saving  time  and  costs,  this technology offers great flexibility.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  is  also  investing  in  tools  to  support changes in working methods, with the deployment of the Office 365 software solution accelerated by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n## Ensuring agile and value-creating 4.4.2 portfolio management\n\nSaint-Gobain pursues a strategy of managing its business portfolio that is both dynamic and value-creating.\n\n## Continuing the strategy 4.4.2.1 of value-creating acquisitions\n\nIn 2020, the Group acquired 13/uni00A0entities for a total amount of \u20ac1,229/uni00A0million. The acquisition strategy focuses on three complementary  areas:  local  acquisitions  to  strengthen local leadership, particularly in regional businesses; niche technologies, particularly in High Performance Solutions; acquisitions to enter new regions.\n\n## Strengthening the local leadership of the Group's activities\n\nSaint-Gobain has made several acquisitions, enabling it to strengthen its position in key markets.\n\nFirst, on February/uni00A03, 2020, after obtaining the agreement of  its  shareholders  and  the  US  anti-trust  authorities, Saint-Gobain  finalized  the  acquisition  of  Continental Building  Products,  a  leading  player  in  the  plasterboard sector  in  North  America.  This  transaction  enabled  the Group to expand its asset portfolio and increase its ability to offer innovative solutions to a broader customer base, as  well  as  to  strengthen  its  presence  in  high-growth regions  in  the  United  States.  The  strong  fit  between corporate  cultures  and  operational  models  facilitates integration and accelerates value creation. As a result, cost synergies and performance improvements, estimated at least $50/uni00A0million by the end of the third year following the completion of the transaction, are being carried out at a pace faster than initially anticipated with ca. $20/uni00A0million for 2020.\n\nIn Europe, Saint-Gobain consolidated its leading position in  the  energy  renovation  market,  notably  through  the acquisition  of  Strikolith  in  the  Netherlands,  a  company specializing  in  the  production  of  exterior  insulation systems, interior finishing and renovation products and solutions. This acquisition enriches the Group's range of solutions, and in particular expands its offering in exterior thermal insulation systems and in construction chemicals in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Distribution, Saint-Gobain is continuing to strengthen its regional  network  in  the  Nordics,  for  example,  with  the acquisition  of  branches  in  Sweden  and  Norway,  and  is enriching its offering with the acquisition of the Danish start-up MobilePeople, which specializes in the Internet of Things,  thus  opening  up  new  market  opportunities, particularly for local authorities.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nPerformance levers\n\n## Niche technologies\n\nSaint-Gobain has also acquired companies  offering solutions with high growth potential.\n\nIn High Performance Solutions, the Life Sciences Business Unit expanded its capabilities in medical components with the  acquisition  of  MS  Techniques  and  Transluminal, companies based in Pompey, near Nancy (France). These companies  bring  to  Saint-Gobain  long  experience  in high-precision thermoplastic extrusion and expertise in the design  of  minimally  invasive  catheters,  with  a  strong specialization in the cardiovascular sector. In return, their design and production capacities will be strengthened by Saint-Gobain's expertise in materials, its financial strength and its global presence in the medical devices market.\n\nIn Germany, Saint-Gobain invested in the prefabrication market with the acquisition of Br\u00fcggemann Holzbau, one of the leading German timber construction specialists in the field of 2D production and energy-efficient construction.\n\n## New regions\n\nFinally, the Group's acquisition strategy makes it possible to seize opportunities to conquer new territories.\n\nThe acquisition of Zhambyl Gypsum, a manufacturer of dry construction mixes and plasterboard, allows Saint-Gobain to set up an industrial presence in a new country, Kazakhstan, and to strengthen its position in a rapidly growing  region.  This  acquisition  is  part  of Saint-Gobain's growth strategy in Russia, Ukraine and the CIS, through its extension of its presence in Central Asia to serve  local  customers  as  well  as  neighboring  countries such as Kyrgyzstan.\n\nIn Latin America, Saint-Gobain announced the strengthening of its partnership with El/uni00A0Volcan, which is already present in Chile, Colombia and Brazil, by extending it to two new  countries: Peru (in mortars and plasterboard) and Argentina (in plaster and plasterboard). In each of these countries, the Group will thus be able to implement  significant  synergies,  leading  to  increased competitiveness and a strengthened commercial offering in the region's construction markets, as has already been done successfully in Chile, Colombia and Brazil.\n\n## Continuing a disposal program to focus 4.4.2.2 the Group's strengths\n\nAfter  reaching  its  ambitious  disposal  target  in  2019, Saint-Gobain continued its portfolio rotation analysis to refocus the Group on its strategic activities, in the light of three key criteria: the outlook for the activity, contribution to value creation for Saint-Gobain and market conditions. In 2020,  seven/uni00A0disposals were  made,  amounting  to \u20ac1.3/uni00A0billion.\n\n- In March/uni00A02020, the  Group  sold  part  of  its  glass /uni25A0 transformation business in Germany to DIK Deutsche Industriekapital/uni00A0GmbH through the sale of seven sites. Saint-Gobain  Glassolutions  will  remain  present  in Germany  through  its  large  glass  transformation  sites intended for industrial customers, as well as through its sites with specific expertise, for example in the field of solar glass or curved glass.\n- In addition, in November/uni00A02020, Saint-Gobain /uni25A0 announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations  with  Mutares,  a  company  listed  on  the Frankfurt stock exchange, with a view to the disposal of Lapeyre, its subsidiary specializing in home improvement in France, based on a firm and irrevocable offer following a broad competitive process initiated in September/uni00A02019. This important step involves a period of consultations and approvals that should lead to a transaction that will be finalized in the first semester of 2021. The transaction is the conclusion of a rigorous and demanding selection process, and allows the Group to refocus its distribution activities in France on BtoB.\n- Saint-Gobain also announced, on January/uni00A04, 2021, that it /uni25A0 had  entered  into  exclusive  negotiations  with  BME (Building  Materials  Europe),  to  sell  its  distribution activities in the Netherlands. The transaction is subject to the approval of the European competition authority, as well as to the information and consultation of the employee representatives of the Dutch entities concerned. The transaction is expected to be finalized by the end of 2021.\n- Lastly,  in  May/uni00A02020  Saint-Gobain  sold  approximately /uni25A0 15.2/uni00A0million Sika shares held by its subsidiary Schenker-Winkler  Holding/uni00A0AG,  representing  its  entire stake of 10.75% of the share capital of Sika for a total amount  of  CHF/uni00A02.56/uni00A0billion (\u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion) (for  more information, see page/uni00A0246 of the Universal Registration Document  for  2019).  Achieving  such  a  return  on investment  is  a  very  positive  development for  the Group. As a result of this disposal, Saint-Gobain has generated net gains of \u20ac1.5 billion in cash since May 2018 (1) . The gains from this sale helped to strengthen Saint-Gobain's  balance  sheet,  financial  flexibility  and liquidity position.",

The Group is convinced that consideration of the common good, ethics and social and societal issues is an essential factor in generating sustainable growth.\n\nIn June 2020, the Board of Directors decided to create a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee. The creation of such a committee is justified in view of the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility for Saint-Gobain (see Chapter 5, Section 1.2.3).\n\nTo  create  positive  long-term  impact,  it  is  essential  to integrate the interests of stakeholders into the process, identify their expectations and ensure a constant dialogue for  strategic  choices  to  minimize  the  negative  impacts related to activities and the value chain, and increase the positive contribution to environmental, social and societal issues.\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain unveiled its purpose \"Making the world a better home\". The manifesto associated with this purpose  clearly  states  the  involvement  of  stakeholders and the desire to act with them.\n\nOur purpose is a call to action. Our approach is clearly focused on the future. Together with our customers, partners and all our stakeholders, it guides our action to unleash individual and collective aspirations, and enable everyone to live better in the world. It calls on us to innovate openly, with the ever-renewed ambition of better uniting humanity and nature for the common good.\n\nThe entire manifesto is presented in Chapter 1, Section 2.2.\n\n## Structuring and prioritizing issues: materiality analysis 1.1.1\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  published  by  the  Group  was reviewed in 2020 with the assistance of Mazars.\n\nThe same methodological principles were used:\n\n- identify priority  issues,  based  on  the  documentation /uni25A0 available on  the  Company,  its  activities  and  its environment;\n- share these issues with its main stakeholders; /uni25A0\n- prioritize these issues by  comparing  stakeholder /uni25A0 expectations against the vision of management.\n\nA methodology note is available on the Group website.\n\nThe assessment is based on information gathered during interviews  with  experts,  customer  surveys,  employee surveys, minutes of meetings with various stakeholders, and  internal  interviews.  For  example,  interviews  with external  stakeholders  conducted  in  the  context  of  the Group's purpose or the \"me@saint-gobain\" survey conducted among Group employees were included in the analysis, as were the Group's transformations as part of the Transform & Grow program.",

The materiality analysis contributed to the identification of the main CSR  risks and opportunities for the Group. Details on the methodology used  are  provided  in  the  Non-Financial  Performance Declaration (see Chapter 9, Section 3.3).\n\nTo conduct this analysis, the Group used:\n\n- the CSR materiality analysis; /uni25A0\n- the  internal Control  and  Audit  risk  identification /uni25A0 methodology,  which  has  been  adapted  to  long-term non-financial issues.\n\n## Ethics and compliance 1.2\n\n## Applying our Principles 1.2.1 of Conduct and Action\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action are the ethical code of conduct that forms the foundation of all of Saint-Gobain's policies and commitments (see Chapter 1, Section 2.3). They define the values and rules applicable to all Saint-Gobain  entities and  employees,  across  all employment  contract types (open-ended contracts, fixed-term contracts and temporary staff) but also to their subcontractor and suppliers.\n\nThis applies in particular to compliance policies, the human rights policy, the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) charter,  the  purchasing  and  supplier  charters  of  the responsible purchasing program, and the diversity policy.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  also  sets  out  the  procedures  for working  with  stakeholders,  with  a  particular  focus  on permanent  on-site  subcontractors,  other  subcontractors and suppliers. It is for this reason traduced in over 30 languages and can be viewed on the Group's website so that it is widely available to stakeholders.\n\nEach employee, including those on fixed-term contracts and  temporary  staff,  receives  information  during  their induction about the code of ethics in the local language. This may take various forms, depending on the country:\n\n- a welcome brochure with comments from the Human /uni25A0 Resources representative;\n- the code of ethics may be appended to the contract of /uni25A0 employment.\n\nIn-person training is provided in all countries where the Group operates. It is performed by an employee of the Ethics and Compliance department or by a trained local officer.  Modules  are  regularly  included  in  management school sessions. These sessions are tailored according to the  seniority  of  the  managers.  They  aim  to  involve  a discussion with managers about their day-to-day management practices, of problems encountered depending on the culture and of how decisions are guided by values.\n\nIn order  to  ensure  wide  deployment  in  countries, managers, usually HR or Compliance networks, are trained\n\nNine (1) long-term non-financial risks and opportunities have been identified:\n\n- diversity; /uni25A0\n- energy efficiency and carbon intensity of operations; /uni25A0\n- business ethics; /uni25A0\n- management of skills and talents; /uni25A0\n- supply chain; /uni25A0\n- integration of recycled materials into products; /uni25A0\n- energy  and  carbon  performance  of  products  and /uni25A0 services;\n- health and safety at work; /uni25A0\n- product safety. /uni25A0\n\nThe detail of the risks and opportunities, the policies and action plans, as well as the measurement of the Group's performance are detailed in the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (DPEF).\n\nto  provide  training  on  the  code  of  ethics.  They  can therefore organize sessions for all the employees or for external stakeholders such as suppliers.\n\nAn e-learning course called 'Adhere' is available for all employees and is compulsory for all managers.\n\nSaint-Gobain has set itself the objective of training each and  every  new  manager  in  the  code  of  ethics  and compliance policies within their first year. This objective is included in the CSR dashboard monitored by the Board of Directors (see Chapter 4, Section 2.1).\n\nDue to the health crisis, the training formats had to be adapted  to  digital format  in the hopes  that  the interactivity required to maintain discussion time for the experiences and difficulties encountered could be maintained.\n\n## Deploying our business ethics 1.2.2 programs\n\nAt Saint-Gobain, the purpose of compliance is to ensure obedience by all and at all times to the laws, regulations and international agreements applicable to the Group, the violation of which may  result in penalties (civil, administrative  or  criminal)  and/or  commercial,  financial and  reputational  damage  for  the  Company  and  its managers and employees.\n\nAnchored  in  a  risk-based  approach,  the  ethics  and compliance program has, since 2009, been based on the adoption  and  deployment  of  appropriate  and  effective tools  (internal  policies  and  procedures,  training,  alert, reporting,  audit)  and  the  promotion  of  appropriate behavior.\n\nThe  Group's  ethics  and  compliance  program  is  thus designed and implemented as a natural extension of the Group's values and commitments.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department is responsible for promoting the Principles of Conduct and Action and for designing  and  implementing  the  Group's  ethics  and compliance  program  in  the  areas  of  business  ethics, competition law, the fight against corruption and influence peddling, economic sanctions and export controls.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nIn ethics and compliance, the Board of Directors exercises control  over  Senior  Management.  As  such,  its  role  is twofold:\n\n- it ensures that ethics and compliance issues are taken /uni25A0 into account in major strategic choices;\n- it ensures that the ethics and compliance program is /uni25A0 properly implemented.\n\nThe  involvement  of  Senior  Management  is  crucial  for ethics and compliance. It promotes and disseminates the culture  of  compliance,  demonstrating  its  commitment through the following actions:\n\n- consideration  of  ethics  and  compliance  issues  in /uni25A0 strategic projects or decisions;\n- implementation of the ethics and compliance program /uni25A0 with  the  support  of  the  Ethics  and  Compliance Department;\n- internal  and  external  communication  of  its  overall /uni25A0 support for ethics and compliance programs, including\n\nA responsible approach involving stakeholders\n\nthe whistle-blowing system and zero-tolerance policies for corruption.\n\n## The Group's Ethics and Compliance Department\n\nIts mission is to design and implement the Group's ethics and compliance program in the areas of business ethics, competition law, the fight against corruption and influence peddling,  economic  sanctions  and  export  controls.  It identifies and assesses risks, and proposes policies, procedures  and  programs  to  control  and  reduce  those risks.  Finally,  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Department develops and provides training and communication for the programs.\n\nThe  Ethics  and  Compliance  Department  relies  on  a network of Ethics and Compliance Officers in regions and operations  whose  mission  is  to  ensure  the  effective deployment of programs within their scope.\n\nBeyond that, Business Compliance Correspondents (BCC) in  the  countries  and  Business  Units  have  the  role  of ensuring  the  dissemination  and  knowledge,  within  their scope, of the Group's ethics and compliance program and culture.\n\n## Main compliance and ethics policies 1.3\n\n## Compliance with anti-corruption 1.3.1 rules\n\nAround the world, corruption is undermining economies, increasing inequalities and slowing the transition towards a  more  sustainable  world.  The  active  fight  against  this scourge is of concern to everyone.\n\nSince 2003, Saint-Gobain has expressed its commitment to  the  fight  against  corruption  by  signing  the  Global Compact  of  the  United  Nations,  the  tenth  principle  of which  calls on companies  to  take  action  against corruption.\n\nBeyond that, the Group has since then set up a program to prevent the risks of corruption and influence peddling, including  strict  compliance  with  the  principle  of  zero tolerance.\n\nThis program is based on:\n\n- risk mapping; /uni25A0\n- policies and procedures; /uni25A0\n- training  sessions,  in  particular  the  e-learning  course /uni25A0 called \"ACT\", are taken by all managers when they are onboarded;\n- communication actions; /uni25A0\n- audits  conducted  internally  or  by  external  service /uni25A0 providers.\n\nIn 2020, the Group publicly disclosed the new version of its anti-corruption policy.\n\nThe purpose of this manual is to define and illustrate the various  types  of  behavior  to  be  prohibited,  review  the Group's  rules  and  the  best  practices  to  adopt,  i.e.,  the procedures relating to all areas in which corruption risks are  likely  to  materialize,  such  as  gifts  and  invitations, conflicts of interest, recruitment, mergers and acquisitions, or the validation of intermediaries.\n\nThis  policy  is  largely  illustrated  by  concrete  examples showing what is authorized or prohibited in the practice of professional life. It restates the fundamental principle: the fight  against  corruption  assumes  a  principle  of  \"zero tolerance\".\n\nWhile  it  has  been  given  full  commitment  both  by  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and by the Group's executive  committee,  and  has  been  signed  by  nearly 3,000  senior  employees,  it  also  assumes  that  each Saint-Gobain employee has a sense of responsibility in the fight against corruption. This is why the policy is based on concrete and educational examples and training programs are deployed.\n\nThe  management  of  the  anti-corruption  policy  is  the responsibility of the Group's senior management, which delegates  design  and  deployment  to  the  Ethics  and Compliance Department.\n\n## Compliance with competition law 1.3.2\n\nSaint-Gobain has put in place a competition law compliance program based on:\n\n- policies and procedures, notably regarding membership /uni25A0 of professional associations;\n- training sessions and information campaigns: practical /uni25A0 guides  are  made  available,  including  the  'Thread  of Competition'  available  on  the  Group's  website;  all managers complete the 'Comply' e-learning module for the first time during their induction, and must repeat it every two years; many in-person training sessions are provided by the General Secretary, Head of Ethics and Compliance,  as  well  as  the  Ethics  and  compliance managers;\n- audits conducted by third parties. /uni25A0\n\n3",

It is based on:\n\n- a Group-wide policy; /uni25A0\n- a dedicated network of Embargo Managers within the /uni25A0 regions and in the businesses;\n- a third-party verification tool; /uni25A0\n- training sessions and information campaigns: an /uni25A0 e-learning  course  is  taken  by  managers  exposed  to these  issues;  tools  are  available  online  to  monitor changes to laws and regulations;\n- many in-person training sessions are provided by the /uni25A0 General Secretary, Head of Compliance and members of the dedicated network;\n- audits conducted by third parties. /uni25A0\n\n## Personal data protection 1.3.4\n\nSaint-Gobain  pays  particular  attention  to  personal  data protection. In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Group's policy on this subject is publicly available on its website.\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to set out data collection, use, communication and confidentiality conditions.\n\nAs  Saint-Gobain's  activities  are  highly  decentralized,  a data protection governance system has been set up to answer daily questions locally. This network of employees is led by the central team. It is made up of 45 Privacy Advisors (usually legal experts or auditors) and around 600 Data Officers with more operational profiles.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  roll  out  a  data  protection management tool in its European entities. This platform makes it easier to manage GDPR compliance, by mapping data, evaluating the compliance of providers and tools. An impact study method has also been formalized, and the Privacy Advisors have received training in it.\n\n## Taxation 1.3.5\n\nSaint-Gobain acts in compliance with the tax laws of the countries in which it operates and fulfills its tax reporting and payment obligations in time. The Group has therefore not established structures whose purpose is tax evasion. It applies  tax  laws  and  regulations  with  honesty  and integrity.  Its  intragroup  transactions  comply  with  the so-called 'arm's length' principle.\n\nTherefore,  the  income  tax  paid  by  Saint-Gobain  is  in correlation with the places where it is based and thus the value created.\n\nSince  2019,  Saint-Gobain  has  been  taking  part  in  the initiative  for  a  tax  partnership  for  regular,  transparent dialogue  between  the  French  tax  authorities  and  large proactive companies.\n\n## Respect for human rights in the Group's activities 1.4\n\n## Commitments 1.4.1\n\nSaint-Gobain's  values,  formalized  by  the  Principles  of Conduct and Action, are an essential vector of mobilization for human rights due to their reference to international  conventions,  particularly  the  International Charter for Human Rights and the applicable conventions of the International Labour Organization.\n\nThe Group has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. The first two principles of the Global Compact invite companies to 'support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights' (principle No. 1) and 'make sure that their own companies are not complicit in human rights abuses' (principle No. 2).\n\nIn 2019, Saint-Gobain published its policy on respect for human rights. The policy has been presented to the Board of  Directors.  It  describes  how  the  Group  takes  into account human rights impacts and outlines the associated due diligence process. The whole approach is based on the recommendations of the United Nations, particularly the  guiding  principles  on  business  and  human  rights. Accordingly,  Saint-Gobain  is  committed  to  respecting human rights wherever it conducts its activities and in its supply chain.\n\n## Analysis of human rights risks in 1.4.2 the Group's activities\n\nThe main issues facing Saint-Gobain related to respect for human  rights  are  identified  according  to  the  United Nations reporting guidelines and concern the human rights that  are  likely  to  be  most  seriously  affected  by  the negative impact of the Company's activities and its value chain.\n\nThe method selected by Saint-Gobain to identify the risks of actual or potential negative impacts is based on the recommendations of the United Nations, particularly those relating to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It is also based on external sources recognized for their relevance. These sources are linked to international institutions such as the United Nations with the Human Development Index, specialist non-governmental organizations  such  as  the  Transparency  International Corruption Perceptions Index, or foundations such as The Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation to end forced labor.",

        "page_content": "The  analysis  followed  the  protocols  promoted  by  the Danish  Institute  for  Human  Rights  and  resulted  in  a mapping of the risks related to the Group's activities. The mapping of risks related to the supply chain and respect for human rights is described in the section on responsible purchasing (Chapter 3, Section 1.5).\n\nThe risk mapping covers the nature of the risks linked to activities and risks linked to the countries in which the Group  operates.  The  risks  linked  to  activities  were identified jointly between the CSR teams and the local management teams.\n\nThe main risks identified concern four areas: respect for employee rights, health and safety at work, respect for the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nThe  management  of  risks  associated  with  health  and safety at work is described in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.1, and risks  associated  with  respect  for  the  environment  in Chapter 3, Section 4.1.3.\n\nThe  management  of  corruption  risks  is  described  in Chapter 3, Section 1.3.1. The Group's anti-corruption policy was revised in 2020 and published on its website.\n\n## Measures to control risks 1.4.3 associated with employee rights\n\nRespect for the rights of employees is essential to ensure a  fair  and  equitable  working  environment  and  ensure personal  and  professional  fulfillment  (see  Chapter  3, Section 1.4.3). Respect for employees' rights is one of the nine Principles of Conduct and Action. In publishing its human  rights  policy,  Saint-Gobain  clearly  described  its commitment to the following principles: the fight against forced  labor,  the  fight  against  child  labor,  freedom  of association  and  the  fight  against  discrimination.  Since signing the United Nations Global Compact, Saint-Gobain has published an annual progress statement.\n\nThe Group's entities ensure that each employee performs their  work  on  the  basis  of  freely  agreed  terms  of employment  according  to  a  shared  and  accepted document  and  receives  the  payment  of  a  fair  wage\n\n## Responsible purchasing 1.5\n\nThe objective of the 'Responsible Purchasing' program is to  manage  and  reduce  the  environmental,  social  and societal risks associated with Saint-Gobain's supply chains.\n\nIn  an  environment  where  supply  chains  are  becoming more complex, and where the collective awareness of the impacts on stakeholders related to purchasing is growing, this program aims to integrate ethical requirements into the purchasing process, both for suppliers, based on the supplier charter, and for buyers, by applying the buyer charter.\n\nA responsible approach involving stakeholders\n\naccording to the hours worked. Freedom of association is guaranteed at all industrial sites and sales outlets.\n\nThe age of the employee is checked by local employees as part of the fight against child labor. An annual analysis of the HR database is performed to verify that employees under the age of 18 are employed under specific contracts related to their education, such as apprenticeship contracts.\n\nFinally,  Saint-Gobain  values  and  strives  for  diversity among  its  staff.  Mutual  respect  and  a  policy  of  equal treatment in terms of recruitment, access to promotions, professional  training  and  compensation  are  the  main levers  for  action.  Wherever  it  is  present,  the  Group undertakes  to  promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its forms: gender, nationalities, training, career paths, generational  diversity,  disabilities  and  ethnic  and  social origins.\n\nThe training module created to combat stereotypes and biases  related  to  diversity  was  updated  in  2020  for deployment to all employees in 2021.\n\nThe system for collecting grievances reported by local HR networks has been improved to encourage employees to express  themselves  directly  to  their  superiors  or  the human resources network. Entities declare any incidents of discrimination leading to a complaint or otherwise, in the course of judgment or finally judged and characterized as such. Every incident declared is examined and dealt with in the subsidiaries concerned. Group employees also have access to a whistleblowing system that guarantees their anonymity, which is described in Chapter 3, Section 1.7. Particular attention is paid to risks of harassment.\n\nIn addition to these measures, which affect all Saint-Gobain entities, a self-assessment questionnaire to identify  risk  management  programs  about  respect  for employee rights was sent to countries identified as being at risk. It confirmed that the procedures relating to salient matters for Saint-Gobain in the field of human rights were being applied.\n\nIt has been verified that in the countries identified as being at risk, the Group's employees have information on the code of ethics in their native language.\n\nThus,  ethical  criteria  respecting  human  rights,  working conditions  and  compliance  with  standards,  health  and safety  and  the  environment  are  integrated  into  the purchasing process. The responsible purchasing program is implemented with high standards in accordance with the  Group's  general  purchasing  principles  to  develop long-term  relationships  with  suppliers,  on  the  basis  of shared improvement plans.\n\n3",

The payment terms for VSE-SME suppliers have not been changed. The Purchasing policy is based on the establishment of medium- and long-term partnerships with suppliers. This remains the case during the health crisis.\n\n## Risk management 1.5.1\n\nThe purchases CSR risk mapping took place in 2016. Risks connected to the country of origin and risks connected to the purchase categories are integrated.\n\nRisks linked to human rights, particularly forced labor and child  labor,  and  corruption  risks  are  reared  to  the environment  of  the  countries  of  origin.  Risks  linked  to purchasing categories include environmental performance, specifically carbon and water footprints and health and safety. This mapping is based on recognized international sources to assess the risks specific to the countries and activities  concerned.  While  the  general  principles  and sources  are  identical,  the  impact  of  purchases  and  the risks  for  the  company  are  weighted  according  to  the nature of the purchase:\n\n- an  upstream  purchase,  managed  by  the  non-trade /uni25A0 purchasing team;\n- a  purchase  related  to  distribution  activity  offerings /uni25A0 managed by the marketing distribution teams and the trade purchasing teams.\n- In accordance with this procedure, purchasing categories\n- or suppliers with specific risks have been identified, such as:\n- purchases  of  certain  natural  raw  materials  such  as /uni25A0 wood or sand;\n- certain types of subcontractors that work directly on /uni25A0 the Group's sites;\n- purchases made in countries exposed to risks regarding /uni25A0 human rights in general and child labor, corruption and working conditions in particular.\n\n## Risk management and mitigation 1.5.2 measures\n\nIn 2020, the process and tools used to manage risks for trade and non-trade purchases were aligned. However, the action plans put in place are specific to each of the two purchasing teams, to maintain management methods and a  level  of  control  adapted  to  the  risks  and  potential negative impacts of each of the activities.\n\nIn addition to the measures taken, the purchasing teams made suppliers aware of the risks of COVID-19 for their employees  and  set  up  a  dialogue  on  the  measures  to protect their employees  and  the  prevention  plans deployed.\n\n## For non-trade purchases 1.5.2.1\n\nDepending on the level of risk identified, suppliers answer an evaluation questionnaire based on documentation, that is verified and evaluated by a third party and, depending on the results, an on-site CSR audit takes place. The entire approach  forms  part  of  a  constant  dialogue  with  the supplier and leads to the establishment of action plans and CSR  performance  improvement  plans.  In  2018,  the evaluation questionnaire and its related score scale were reviewed to check that they corresponded to the types and levels of risks identified by the mapping. Starting 2021, the minimum performance thresholds required of suppliers will be reassessed.\n\nThe Group has set itself the objective, for the 2017-2021 period, of assessing the CSR performance of more than 90% of suppliers deemed to pose a risk and which achieve annual consolidated net sales of more than \u20ac100,000 with the Group. The objective is to conduct around 40 to 50 CSR audits a year, mainly in emerging countries. These audits  may  lead  to  de-listings  if  critical  failings  are identified,  or  if  the  necessary  corrective  plans  are  not implemented within the agreed periods. The use of the \"SMETA  4-Pilars\"  standard  for  on-site  audits  has  been widespread,  so  that  suppliers'  auditing  efforts  can  be better shared with all of their customers.\n\nBased  on  the  results  of  the  assessments,  the  relevant buyer  implements  a  corrective  action  plan  with  the supplier, including priorities and deadlines for implementation.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with these action plans, a supplier  de-listing  policy  is  applicable,  after  which  the supplier will no longer have access to the Group's calls for tenders and all entities will withdraw from any ongoing partnerships.\n\nThe responsible purchasing policy is being rolled out to non-trade suppliers via a private digital platform developed  by  the  Group  and  entirely  dedicated  to responsible  purchasing.  Suppliers  have  access  to  it  to acknowledge  receipt  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Suppliers Charter, to send essential supporting documents electronically (wood certificates, quality certificates, ISO standards), to answer self-assessment questionnaires, to obtain  all information  on  Saint-Gobain's  responsible purchasing guidelines and to access details of their CSR evaluations or, where appropriate, CSR audits.\n\nThe  responsible purchasing approach  also  includes ongoing training for buyers on the Saint-Gobain Code of",

        "page_content": "Ethics,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  fight  against corruption,  the  working  conditions  of  employees  of suppliers, forced labor and child labor. Constant information on the sustainable development stakes is also communicated.\n\nThe Department of Non-Trade Purchasing has issued a 'Best  Practices'  brochure  for  all  purchasers,  to  remind them of the CSR best practices to be built into the whole of  the  purchasing  process.  This  document  incorporates the recommendations of the new ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement standard.\n\n## Trade purchases 1.5.2.2\n\nIn 2020, the procedures and tools were aligned with those already  in  place  for  non-trade  purchases.  Given  the different nature of purchases, certain risk criteria and their weighting  and  performance  monitoring  are  managed separately by the marketing and purchasing teams of the distribution  entities.  The  program  is  overseen  by  a dedicated team within the Group's responsible purchasing staff. Accordingly,  synergies  and  best  practices  for responsible  purchasing  are  shared  between  the  various buyers,  while  a  measure  of  performance  adapted  to operational risks and opportunities is maintained.\n\nThis was gradually implemented during the year through training  sessions  for  buyers.  Strategic  suppliers  are primarily affected by the deployment of the Responsible Purchasing program. This involves the European supplier partners of the distribution entities that make purchases of more than \u20ac3 million and the main suppliers of the brands in each country (1) . These identified suppliers cover more than 76% of trade purchases.\n\nAt the same time, the marketing and purchasing teams of the 'Building Distribution' Business Unit is continuing the qualification  audits  of  the  factories  of  their  own-brand suppliers, especially in India and China. The purpose of these audits is to assess their management system, the environmental,  social  and  legal  aspects  of  production activities, and to ensure the good quality of the products.\n\nFollowing each audit, the supplier receives a report as well as  recommendations  on  compliance  with  an  expected effective date or paths for improvement.\n\nIn  2021,  the  program  and  the  new  tools  will  be  fully deployed.  New  targets  for  2025  adapted  to  this  new organizational structure may be published.\n\n## Management of risks related to natural 1.5.2.3 raw materials\n\n## Sand\n\nPurchases of sand by Saint-Gobain are intended for glass and glass wool production, the manufacture of mortars, and  for  distribution activities. Over  90%  of  these purchases are from open and mechanized quarries.\n\nSuppliers undergo evaluations of their environmental and social  practices  as  part  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing policy.\n\nFinally,  Saint-Gobain  is  implementing  an  action  plan  to reduce the amount of sand it uses by replacing it with recycled materials as part of the program on the circular economy  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  4.2).  Since  2018,  an indicator to monitor the reduction of withdrawals of virgin raw materials (sand and gypsum) has been implemented (see Chapter 4, Section 2.1).\n\n## Timber purchases\n\nSaint-Gobain's activities have an impact on timber sector either through the supply of packaging (pallets and boxes) or by purchases of timber for construction markets as part of its distribution activities.\n\nEnvironmental and social risks, and those related to human rights adherence primarily affect trade purchasing. Since the start of the 2000s, the timber purchasing policy has been issued, managed and updated by the distribution teams. Decisions to no longer sell certain species or to exclude regions of origin are taken on the basis of IUCN (the  International  Union  for  Conversation  of  Nature) reports, specifically its Red List of Threatened Species. For other species or regions at risk, special certifications are required, such as the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) label.\n\nBuilding on this history of responsible timber purchases, the timber policy was updated in 2020 to better take into account  the  risks  associated  with  biodiversity  and deforestation issues, and to adapt policy governance to the new organizational structure of the Group after the implementation of the Transform & Grow program.\n\nEvery year, the Group produces an inventory of its timber purchases. 94.8% of purchases are responsible timber. In addition to the review of the timber policy, an audit of our inventory  by  a  third  party  specializing  in  deforestation issues was carried out at the end of the year. This audit confirmed  the  solidity  of  the  programs  to  secure purchases and compliance with the Timber policy. It also identified potential areas for improvement.\n\nAfter several years, Saint-Gobain did not complete in 2020 the CDP  (Carbon  Disclosure  Project)  questionnaire concerning forests. Saint-Gobain shares the objective of combating deforestation with the CDP through responsible  forest  management.  The  Group  wants  a transparent dialogue with the CDP so that the specific nature  of  construction  timber  is  better  valued  in  the ratings. Up to now, the questionnaire is focused on issues related to the use of palm oil or exotic species which are little or not present in the construction business. This way, the answers to the questionnaire and the assessment are not very representative of the conducted actions and their efficiency.\n\nSaint-Gobain  continues  to  conduct  a  transparent  and regular  dialogue  with  non-governmental  organizations (NGOs)  and  undergoes  independent  assessments  to improve  control  of  deforestation  risks  and  promote responsible forest management.\n\n3",

The  Group  and  most  of  its  subsidiaries belong  to  professional  associations  representing  their industry at the national or supranational level.\n\nIn France, for example, Saint-Gobain is directly involved in professional associations representing companies, such as Afep and Medef.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries also cooperate with various local associations and organizations involved in environmental, regulatory,  labor,  societal  or  economic  issues  in  the various countries. The subsidiaries have internal procedures in place to ensure that their participation in associations is recognized and referenced, and that employees who represent them in associations are trained in the rules of antitrust law.\n\nSaint-Gobain refrains from financing any political party.\n\nAs a way of ensuring that it is closely involved in the ongoing national and international debate on the environment and sustainable development, and that it can share  its  experience  in  these  areas  as  a  manufacturer, Saint-Gobain  has  been  a  member  of  Entreprises  pour l'Environnement  (Businesses  for  the  Environment,  EpE) since the organization was founded. EpE is a grouping of around  40  major  French  and  international  companies representing all sectors of the economy, who are keen to address the environment more effectively in their strategic decisions and in the way they do business.\n\nSaint-Gobain is active in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). WBCSD  is a worldwide grouping of 200 companies that deliberate on and  develop  solutions  for  a  more  sustainable  world. Saint-Gobain has been a member of the WBCSD Board since  2017,  with  responsibility  for  'climate,  energy,  the circular economy, towns and cities, and mobility'.\n\n## Multi-stakeholder partnerships 1.6.2\n\nAs  a  member  of  the  Global  Compact,  Saint-Gobain regularly reports on its progress in the areas covered by the Compact, to which it adheres at the 'GC Advanced' level, i.e., according  to  21  criteria.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar, Chairman and CEO of the Group, is a member of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Global  Compact  France. Saint-Gobain also encourages its partners, particularly its suppliers, to commit  to  the  Global  Compact's  ten principles.\n\nLikewise, the Group pays particular attention to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so as to make  progress  in  evaluating  the  real  impacts  that companies can have in working towards a fairer, more sustainable  world.  These  goals  also  make  possible  new multi-stakeholder collaborations, in which companies are engaged  locally  and  globally.  This  is  the  case  for  the following objectives especially:\n\n- SDG 8: 'Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable /uni25A0 economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all';\n- SDG 13: 'Take urgent action to combat climate change /uni25A0 and its impacts'.\n\nIn  September  2020,  Saint-Gobain  signed  the  United Nations  Global  Compact's  call  for  multilateralism  and renewed global cooperation in line with SDG 16 (\"Justice, peace and strong institutions\").\n\nFinally, Saint-Gobain  is  a  member  company  of  the Transparency International France Forum. Thus, Saint-Gobain supports the association's activities and has committed to rejecting and combatting corruption, in all its forms. The Group undertakes to make its best efforts to implement a solid prevention mechanism, inspired by the current best practices of the business world.\n\n## Actions for green and sustainable 1.6.3 growth\n\nSaint-Gobain  supports  the  implementation  of  ambitious political  frameworks  to  remove  technical  and  financial obstacles and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe recovery plans initiated by governments following the COVID  crisis  are  an  opportunity  to  combine  the  fight against  climate  change  with  economic  development actions  through  such  ways  as  initiatives  that  promote building renovation and energy efficiency. The decarbonization of buildings is essential to meet governments' greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\n\nEuropean  regulatory  projects  related  to  sustainable finance and in particular taxonomy are essential instruments  for  achieving  the  European  Union's  climate objectives,  provided  that  they  are  guided  by  scientific criteria and developed in a transparent manner.\n\nSaint-Gobain supports the work of the Commission and the sustainable finance platform to ensure that changes in the texts better reflect the specificities of the business sectors affected compared to current projects.",

The tool constitutes a sequenced operational roadmap for the development teams, where every step in the innovation process is reviewed by a committee set up for this purpose.  This  methodology  allows  for  the identification of and  prompt  attention  to  potential problems. Close monitoring of the progress achieved and product performance means that the process of innovation is faster and more secure.\n\nThe  EHS  (Environment,  Industrial  Hygiene  and  Safety) checklist introduced in 2008 has been incorporated into the 'Saint-Gobain stage gate process'. It allows for the qualitative  assessment  of  substances  integrated  into product formulations and the identification and reduction of EHS impacts associated with product life cycles. With regard to hazardous substances, the aim is to prevent the use of new hazardous substances and reduce their use in raw  materials  while  reducing  and  controlling  exposure levels.\n\nThe  innovation  process  incorporates  normative  and regulatory  requirements,  from  the  functional  marketing specifications  stage  which  sets  out  customer  needs. Compliance of a new product is checked throughout the process development stage, specifically during the stage gate validations.\n\nLocal marketing teams ensure that products comply with the legislation and standards applicable in the countries of commercialization. The process for launching new products, services and systems is specifically checked in the Internal Control Reference Framework (see Chapter 6, Section 2.5).\n\nFinally, the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) industrial excellence program (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.1) ensures the deployment of best practices in terms of quality and product compliance at industrial sites, based on the ISO 9001 standard approach.\n\nWith  regard  to  consumer  information,  the  Group's products  comply  with  current  regulations,  such  as  CE marking  in  Europe  or  the  requirement  for  chemical products to have labels and safety data sheets (SDS).\n\nSaint-Gobain  also  provides  non-mandatory  information specific to some of its products, such as:\n\n- voluntary safety data declaration sheets for unclassified /uni25A0 articles or substances;\n- the declaration in an IMDS (International Material Data /uni25A0 System) database for the automotive industry of the composition of the components and materials supplied;\n- specific labels such as the Environmental and Health /uni25A0 Data Sheet in France for construction products;\n- programs to monitor compliance with laws, standards /uni25A0 and voluntary codes relating to marketing\n\ncommunication,  including  advertising,  promotion  and sponsorship.\n\nBesides  the  legal  obligations  on  information  for  the customer chain (CE marking, DOP,  REACH,  etc.), Saint-Gobain provides additional instructions, such as how to improve fitting comfort and installation safety through a  range  of  channels  such  as  the  packaging  on  our products.\n\nAt European level, Saint-Gobain contributes to the work of the  European  Committee  for  Standardization  (CEN)  to design  normative  and  regulatory  systems.  In  the  same way, its active involvement in European inter-professional associations such as EURIMA, Eurogypsum and EMO gives it a full overview of normative developments in Europe, particularly thanks to its discussions with the European Commission  or  its  institutions such  as  the  ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) which is responsible for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation,Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations.\n\n## Eco-innovation and the 2.1.2 improvement of the sustainable performance of solutions\n\nTo develop increasingly sustainable solutions to provide a better response to new market expectations, the Group introduced  an  eco-innovation  initiative  in  2013,  with eco-innovation training.\n\nToday, eco-innovation is systematically integrated into the integration  processes  for  new  research  executives  and R&D  project  managers.  It  also  includes  special  training, which is intended mainly for marketing and R&D teams and integrated into Saint-Gobain University (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.5). It is offered as part of the Unicampus initiative.\n\nSince 2019, the process for developing new products and systems  requires  that  any  new  project  must  take  into account the challenges of sustainable development, and its  specifications  must  be  systematically  analyzed  by incorporating sustainable performance criteria.\n\nBased  on  an  innovative  and  rigorous  methodology, Saint-Gobain has developed the SCORE tool that assesses construction products according to sustainable performance criteria.\n\nSaint-Gobain's strategy is to move from a product-based offering to a solution-based offering, delivering benefits in terms of sustainability and performance to our customers with  service  provided  by  our  structures  locally  (for construction markets) or globally (for high-performance solutions).\n\nHowever,  the  performance  assessment  tools  available such as life cycle analysis or EPDs or the SCORE tool are product-oriented  and  measure  a  limited  number  of benefits.",

Construction  and HPS  Business  Unit  markets  (mobility,  health,  ceramics, etc.) are taken into account. Local teams are mobilized to identify and  measure  the  benefits  of  Saint-Gobain solutions.\n\nThe  objective  is  to  be  able  to  assess  the  overall contribution  of  the  Group's  portfolio  of  solutions  and measure specific benefits generated, such as the contribution to the fight against climate change or the preservation of natural resources.\n\n## Product transparency 2.1.3 (EPD and health)\n\nThe Group's industrial activities linked to the construction markets pursued the life cycle analyses for their products and published environmental product declarations (EPDs) verified by third parties, throughout the world. Over 100 new  EPDs  were  published  this  year.  With  over  1,255 verified EPDs published in over 33 countries, the Group is the  world's  leading  supplier  of  verified  EPDs  in  the construction sector.\n\nA  new  trend  that  originated  in  the  United  States  is developing  on  the  market  relating  to  version  4  of  the LEED  label  and  the  growing  influence  of  the  circular economy:  transparency  about  substances  contained  in construction products. On this issue, the Group is keen to\n\nOperational excellence\n\nprovide appropriate, rigorous responses that are consistent with existing regulations.\n\nDepending on the geographical area, Saint-Gobain meets customers' expectations through various means such as inventories  of  substances  in  products  and  declarations according to the HPD standard and \"Declare\" labels. At the  same  time,  the  Group  is  proactively  working  to develop a European standard to provide a framework that is harmonized  and  consistent with the regulatory framework  (REACH  and  CLP)  for  the  declaration  of substances contained in products and the identification of associated hazards.\n\nIndependently of the transparency initiatives, Saint-Gobain is committed to a global approach to reducing chemicals of concern in product composition and has included this parameter  in  its  SCORE  approach  for  assessing  the sustainable performance of products.\n\n## Customer satisfaction 2.1.4\n\nSeveral practices have been adopted by all the Group's activities to measure customer satisfaction:\n\n- after each interaction, actual and potential, direct and /uni25A0 indirect  customers  are  asked  to  complete  a  short questionnaire, to detect the main points of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and to determine the 'net promoter score', the only measure common to all; this refined measure will eventually make all of our customers our first decision-makers.\n- secondly, a more stringent, responsive measurement of /uni25A0 compliance  and  timeliness  (see  Chapter  3,  Section 2.2.1), since these two  parameters  recur  in all questionnaires as the most  frequent causes of dissatisfaction: customers demand above all else that suppliers keep their promises.\n\nThus, customer satisfaction measurements are carried out on a regular basis for all activities.\n\n3",

It is based on pillars which cover performance  improvement  methods  such  as  Lean,  Six Sigma and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) or 5S. This ongoing improvement program defines the logic, rigor and actions necessary to implement lasting improvements to performance and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe  WCM  program  ensures  rigorous  implementation  of Saint-Gobain's internal and external standards, including certification procedures such as ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 and 50001 for the environment, OHSAS 18001 and ILO OSH 2001 and ISO 45001 for health and safety or internal standards  such  as  the  OPEN  program  or Saint-Gobain Attitudes for Human Development and the risk prevention standard.\n\n## Governance of the program 2.2.1.1 and its implementation\n\nIts management, the monitoring of its implementation and the improvement of site performance are managed in a transversal and independent manner, in coordination with the industrial departments.  In  2019,  the  program's governance was formalized to ensure intelligent, pragmatic implementation, improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer service.\n\nThe introduction of the program by a site depends on its size, its strengths and weaknesses identified by an internal benchmark for each business, and its objectives in terms of economic or environmental performance, or of quality and customer service. Each site defines its own roadmap, in line with international reference frameworks, standards specific to its business required by customers and the improvement objectives that have been set.\n\nEach industrial department and each business is responsible for defining, leading and monitoring the results of the sites within its scope.\n\nA  network  of  WCM  expertise  has  been  implemented, enabling  a  better  circulation  of  the  program,  resource optimization  according  to  country,  region  or  business, formalization and sharing of expertise by pillar.\n\nA central team heads up the WCM network, trains the teams,  creates  and  applies  the  program  standards, circulates the tools and provides site-specific assistance on request.\n\n## The Saint-Gobain WCM model and its tools 2.2.1.2\n\nThe Saint-Gobain WCM program is based on eight pillars, each of which representing a center of excellence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe foundations of the program define the methods and tools:\n\n- analyzing losses to determine a priorization of actions; /uni25A0\n- resolving problems with logic, rigor and precision for /uni25A0 lasting improvement;\n- involving and engaging employees; /uni25A0\n- improving standards to make progress easier to deploy /uni25A0 and more robust over time.\n\nAchieving industrial excellence is a demanding undertaking which requires gradual implementation with methodology  and  constancy.  The  benefits  in  terms  of competitiveness,  improvement  of  customer  service  and employee commitment can be measured at each stage of the site path.\n\nRequirement  levels  have  been  used  to  determine  the principles  shared  by  the  whole  organization,  but  also tailored to the diverse range of the Group's industrial sites: sizes, businesses or local context.\n\nIn  addition  to  dashboards  that  measure  performance improvement, WCM audits check the robustness of the actions  implemented  and  the  durability  of  the  results obtained.\n\n## Risk management and performance 2.2.1.3 improvement results\n\nThe  WCM  program  therefore  delivers  a  substantial reduction  in  production  costs  at  the  same  time  as  a significant reduction in health/safety, environmental and industrial risks. The \"Quality\", \"Industrial Performance\" and \"Environment\"  pillars  contribute  significantly  towards reducing the Group's environmental footprint by reducing waste  generated  in  production  and  water  consumption and by optimizing energy efficiency.",

It  also  promotes  employee  engagement  and mobility. It is an essential prerequisite for the successful digital transformation of plants (see Chapter 2, Section 4.3).\n\nSimilarly,  competency  matrices  are  developed  in  the 'people  development'  pillar.  They  make  it  possible  to manage the Group's technical skills by adapting training programs  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  3.3.5),  employees' career  paths  and,  if  necessary,  the  search  for  external skills.\n\n## Purchases 2.2.2\n\nPurchasing is a key factor in the Group's competitiveness and its organization is adapted to the specific features of its activities and the countries where it is located to ensure its efficiency and manage supply chain risks. Purchasing meets  the  needs  of  the  Group's  manufacturing  and distribution activities.\n\nAlthough the Purchasing functions are based on shared policies and a common base, specifically the implementation of the Responsible Purchasing policy (see Chapter 3, Section 1.5), they do not participate at the same level in the Group's value chain:\n\n- non-trade  purchases:  purchasing  upstream  of  the /uni25A0 production  stage  (raw  materials,  energy,  chemical products, components, etc.), purchasing of equipment necessary for production (machines, civil engineering, etc.), all logistics expenses, as well as purchasing for support functions (IT, Marketing, HR, EHS, Communication, Finances, and Audit expenses, etc.);\n- trade purchases: purchasing downstream  of  the /uni25A0 production  to  ensure  the  offerings  of  the  Group's distribution brands.\n\nThe Group's purchasing policy is based on the establishment  of  medium-  and  long-term  partnerships with suppliers.\n\nBeyond the specific features connected with its activities, Saint-Gobain  recognizes  the  major  role  the  Purchasing Department  plays  in  competitiveness,  innovation  and sustainable performance. Buyers are especially committed to the 2030 CO2 roadmap, both for the control and the reduction of Scope 3 emissions and for the development of renewable or carbon-free energy purchases.\n\nIn the context of the coronavirus crisis, the Group's buyers have acted responsibly. The payment terms for VSE-SME suppliers have not been changed.\n\nThe Group has endeavored to develop the professionalism of its purchasers through training activities. A training path is open to all Group purchasers within the scope of the Purchasing  School.  More  specific  training  intended  for\n\nOperational excellence\n\ntrade purchasers supplements this program. This training, which  is  particularly  important  for  newcomers  in  the Purchasing  Department,  provides  them  with  tools  that enable  them,  and  their  teams,  to  achieve  behavioral excellence in their daily activities.\n\n## Managing industrial 2.2.3 and distribution risks\n\nSaint-Gobain's ambition is for each plant to be exemplary in many respects, in particular the health and safety of people and the protection of the environment. It is for these reasons that the Group ensures the protection of its assets  and  investments  against  the  risk  of  accidental events  and  endeavors  to  preserve  the  continuity  of operations in the face of the potential consequences of such events, whatever their origin.\n\nThe aim of the industrial and distribution risk prevention policy is to reduce the likelihood of such events occurring, minimize  the  seriousness  of  such  events  if  they  do materialize and finally protect the continuity of business operations. This policy applies to all Group sites.\n\nDefined and led by the Risk and Insurance Department, the policy is rolled out within the organization to the sites by prevention coordinators.\n\nA risk prevention manual is the Group's reference base and is available in some fifteen languages. It includes the applicable  standards,  procedures  and  technical  rules, methods  for  identifying  and  reducing  risks,  including natural risks, and the drafting of emergency and business continuity  plans.  This  manual  may  be  shared  with  the relevant stakeholders, such as permanent on-site subcontractors.\n\nA site's risk evaluation tool, called 'Risk Grading' is used by  all operational  sites  and  provides  an  objective assessment of the protection and prevention level. It takes into account both human factors (organization, procedures,  communication,  training,  etc.)  and  physical facilities. This means that each site is able to identify its areas  for  improvement,  develop  action  plans  including investments, and use the tool to measure progress.\n\nSaint-Gobain is rolling out business continuity plans for each  site  according  to  the  risk  evaluation  and  the vulnerability  of  processes  to  unforeseen  interruptions including an anticipation of the impacts of an accident so as to limit its effects. The aim is to fully or partially ensure customer  service  and  recover  operational  capacities  as quickly as possible.\n\nOn-site  subcontractors  are  involved  in  prevention  and must commit to a prevention plan.\n\nConcerning natural disasters, the Group uses a mapping tool that enables it to establish the exposure levels of sites depending  on  the  region  and  business  line.  There  is  a special  focus  on  sites  with  high  exposure  to  natural disasters. This tool also makes it possible to anticipate any necessary measures when setting up a new location.\n\n3",

It specifies the Environment, industrial Health and Safety (EHS) management system that needs to be put in place and explains the risk identification and management method for environmental and health and safety risks posed to employees and on-site subcontractors. It is coordinated with the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 requirements.\n\nWhether it is certified or not, each site of the Group carries out its own mapping of environmental, health and safety risks.\n\nTo support the EHS and ISO certification drive, the health and  safety  risk  assessment  is  subject  to  a  specific standard, that is circulated and updated by the Group's EHS Department. All sites must comply with this standard. In  2019,  it  was  updated  and  simplified,  to  include  the assessment of risks as a result of exposure to chemical agents and noise. In 2020, an appendix concerning work permits was added to provide better control for high-risk operations, in particular those carried out by subcontractors.  Two  guides  on  the risks  specific  to 'Working alone' and 'Restarting a site after a shutdown or reduction in activity' were also quickly made available as part of the measures associated with the prevention of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe environmental risk assessment standard was updated in 2020, and training sessions were organized to help with its implementation. Based on the ISO 14001 approach and reference, this standard allows for the standardization of the approach across all sites and guidance of the people in charge of the assessments to define the most relevant actions to ensure continuous improvement.\n\nThere is a digital version of the EHS risk assessment that includes  the  analysis,  assessment  and  risk  management measures. This tool enables the rollout, reliable implementation and monitoring of action plans across all Group sites.\n\nIn addition to the EHS Framework, the EHS risk matrix is included in the Internal Control Reference Framework (see Chapter 6, Section 2.5.3).\n\nAudits on compliance of the EHS management system are conducted by the EHS  Department  and  external certification measures complete the control system. The pilot  version  of  the  internal  EHS  audit  (ISA:  Integrated System Assessment) has been finalized and focused on certified sites. In addition, a simplified version adapted to non-certified ISO sites was launched in 2020. All internal EHS  ISA  auditors  have  been  trained  in  the  ISA-MINI simplified version.\n\nWhen an acquisition is made, the process of integrating the  new  entity  into  the  Group  includes  a  specific procedure for EHS policy implementation.\n\nLastly, the EHS training matrix, which defines the training to be provided based on the job held, is a particularly relevant tool to define employees' EHS training paths.\n\nIn addition to its EHS policy, Saint-Gobain has rolled out specific  policies  to  control  health  risks,  manage  water, energy and air emissions, sustainably manage resources, ensure biodiversity and monitor the other eight standards related  to  safety  risks  (management  of  subcontractors, working at heights, lock-out and tag-out, machine safety, forklifts, vehicles and pedestrians, loading and unloading, road risks).\n\nAn annual report on environmental and health and safety performance  is  verified  by  an  independent  third-party organization. It is published in Chapter 4, Section 2.4.",

        "page_content": "## Protecting the environment 2.3\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to protecting the environment. This means meeting the expectations of its stakeholders in this area and offering its customers the greatest possible added  value  with  the  lowest  possible  environmental impact.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  itself  two  long-term  objectives:  not have  any  environmental  accidents  and  minimize  the impact of its activities on the environment.\n\nThese objectives are conveyed by means of short- and medium-term  objectives  that  concern  the  five  main environmental challenges identified by the Group: resources;  energy,  atmospheric  emissions  and  climate; water;  biodiversity  and  the  use  of  soil;  environmental accidents and nuisances.\n\n## Energy and air emissions 2.3.1\n\nThe Group's policy on 'Energy, atmospheric emissions and climate change' aims to reduce its energy consumption and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  whether  through  its industrial processes, infrastructure or logistics, on all sites.\n\nTo coordinate measures to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1 and 2) (1) energy and climate managers have been appointed for the most energy-intensive  industrial  processes.  They  are  tasked with  analyzing  performance  gaps  relative  to  the  best performers  and  with  sharing  good  practices  to  be replicated across all sites.\n\nEach site must set the progress targets and monitoring procedures for managing  energy  and  atmospheric emissions, taking into account comparisons on processes between the different sites.\n\nThe deployment of the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) program (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.1) in all of the Group's industrial sites is another lever for progress.\n\nAll  of  these  actions  are  part  of  the  CO2  roadmap established  to  monitor  Saint-Gobain's  commitment  to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 (see Chapter 3, Section 4.1.5).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions 2.3.1.1\n\nThe Group's direct CO2 emissions (scope 1) are mostly connected  with  its industrial activities. These  CO2 emissions result from the combustion of fossil fuels and chemical reactions used in the manufacturing processes (e.g. the decarbonization of carbonates in the glass fusion processes). The Group's indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2) are essentially connected with its electricity purchases.\n\nThe use of recycled raw materials in industrial processes makes  it possible to reduce energy consumption, particularly for glass fusion. In the case of flat glass, energy consumption is reduced by 3% when the percentage of cullet is increased from 20% to 30% of raw materials. This reduction  in  energy  consumption  is  accompanied  by  a reduction in CO2 emissions (scope 1). Actions taken for the transition to the circular economy (see Chapter 3, Section 4.2) therefore also have positive effects on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nEnergy  efficiency  is  also  an  essential  factor  in  the environmental and financial performance of Saint-Gobain's sites which also enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Group is encouraging energy audits on its sites and is setting up a system for energy management drawing on ISO 50001 certification. At the end of 2020, 89 sites  in  the  scope  of  reporting  in  question  are  ISO 50001-certified,  which  represents  31%  of  the  Group's annual energy consumption. In addition, a procedure of energy audits was initiated, with the aim of improving the insulation of the Group's production facilities.\n\nSaint-Gobain places all its sites in a phase of continuous improvement.  In  this  respect,  they  aim  to  identify  and evaluate  the  Best  Techniques  and  Practices  Available (MTD)  and  then  progressively  upgrade  them  at  an economically  acceptable  cost,  in  accordance  with  the Group's environmental vision. An MTD deployment plan is defined, updated annually and included in the three-year strategic plan.\n\nThe actions implemented include optimizing energy use in response to needs (usage to power engines, lighting or the use of compressed gas) and the recovery of energy from our manufacturing processes.\n\n## The carbon impact of energy 2.3.1.2\n\nMore  than  three-quarters  of  the  Group's  total  energy consumption is directly linked to the use of fossil energies. The  ability  of  industrial  processes  to  move  from  using fossil  fuels  to  low-carbon  energy  solutions  -  electricity (when it is low-carbon), biogas, or even hydrogen - is therefore crucial.\n\nActions  plans  have  been  implemented  between  the purchasing teams (excluding distribution) in the countries, the  industrial  departments  and  the  local  environment managers to identify regular, reliable sources of renewable energy.\n\nOn its sites, Saint-Gobain is also developing projects using new energies (wind power, biomass, biogas, solar power, etc.). These developments may be made in association with external partners.\n\n3",

The Environment managers coordinate this strategy.\n\nWhen the primary measures are not sufficiently effective, dust emissions are controlled by investments in electrostatic precipitators or bag filters, depending on the type of industrial facility. This equipment also makes it possible to filter the heavy metals resulting from impurities contained in certain raw materials.\n\nSome  Saint-Gobain  factories,  mainly  the  glass  furnaces and  the  pipe-manufacturing  sites,  emit  substances  that participate in the acidification of the environment such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) or the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx).\n\nThe primary measures introduced to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions  include  the  reduction  in  energy  consumption and the use of fuels with a low sulfur content.\n\nPrimary measures  to  optimize  processes,  particularly combustion, make it possible to reduce NOx emissions at source.\n\nIn addition to these primary measures, equipment for the secondary treatment of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is also installed.\n\nSome  industrial  sites  are  affected  by  Volatile  Organic Compound (VOC) emissions as a result of their industrial process. On-site monitoring is based on measurements as needed. The aim is to check that emissions are below the limits set by the environmental operation permit; as such, it is heavily dependent on the local context. Raw materials optimization can reduce VOC emissions, while secondary measurements  via  a  decontamination  unit  may  also  be foreseen.\n\n## Water management 2.3.2\n\nWater is at the heart of the effects of climate change and keeping  it  available  for  populations,  agriculture  and industry is a challenge for the planet.\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  water  policy  ('Water  Policy')  was adopted in 2011 and updated in 2020. It affirms the desire to reduce the impacts of Saint-Gobain's activities on water resources, whether in terms of water uptake or discharge, as much as possible. Its long-term objective is to withdraw as little water as possible and to aim for 'zero discharge' of industrial water in liquid form, while avoiding generating new impacts for other natural environments and/or for other parties involved.\n\nTo  support  the  deployment  of  its  Water  Policy  on industrial sites, Saint-Gobain has defined a Water Standard that helps structure the action plans implemented by the sites. Its aim is to improve the way in which Saint-Gobain uses water and, whenever possible, reuse or recycle it. To that end, the Group makes every effort to:\n\n- reduce withdrawals from the natural environment; /uni25A0\n- not degrade water quality by reducing and controlling /uni25A0 discharges into the natural environment and preventing any accidental pollution;\n- not  compete  with  local  populations  for  access  to /uni25A0 drinking water.\n\nSaint-Gobain uses the World Resources Institute's (WRI) 'Aqueduct' atlas of the world, which allows each site to classify its water risk from 'low' to 'extremely high'. This atlas  is  based  not  only  on  qualitative  and  quantitative physical risks (such as water stress or flood risk), but also on stakeholder risk (like access to water).\n\nOn the basis of Aqueduct 2016 data, 60 sites representing around 10% of water withdrawals were located in high or very high risk areas. In 2020, Saint-Gobain updated the assessment of sites on the basis of Aqueduct 2020 data, and today, 200 Group sites representing around 16% of the  Group's  water  withdrawals  and  13%  of  the  Group's discharges  are  located  in  high  or  very  high  risk  areas. Among these sites, currently 34 sites (two in 2019) that consume more than 5,000 m/three.sup per year are in very high risk areas.\n\nThe Group also has a specific monitoring program for sites that contribute to over 80% of the Group's total water discharges. In 2020, this program involved 44 sites.\n\nThe main projects implemented in 2020 on those sites concerned  the  improvement  of  water  efficiency  in processes, water treatment systems and the installation of closed circuits for cooling water.\n\nThe Group's commitment to water preservation has led it to  participate  in  the  CDP  Water  Disclosure  since  2012, which aims to encourage businesses to report in detail on the risks and opportunities concerning water management and to report results transparently. In 2020, the Group obtained a \"B\" rating.\n\n## Resource management 2.3.3\n\nSaint-Gobain has the long-term ambition of not producing any non-recovered production waste and of maximizing the recycled content of its products. The Group believes that waste should be considered as a strategic resource and that recycled or bio-sourced materials should be used whenever possible as a substitute for non-renewable virgin resources.\n\nDeveloped in 2015, the sustainable resource management thematic policy aims to promote  the responsible management of resources to facilitate the transition to the circular economy. First and foremost, the good performance of a site can thus be defined as the most effective  way  to  optimize  the  resources  used.  This performance  is  also  reflected  in  the  reduction  of  the impact attributable to the use of resources throughout the life cycle of products and services.",

        "page_content": "The main focuses for the deployment of this policy are incorporating  as  much  reused,  recycled  or  bio-sourced content into its products as possible, generating as little production waste as possible, and recovering waste from its processes internally or externally.\n\nIn line with the Group's health policy and in compliance with  local  regulations,  the  management  of  hazardous waste  is  closely  monitored  to  protect  the  health  of employees, residents, customers and users of its products and services.\n\nBy  encouraging  cross-functional  actions  and  synergies between  its  various  industrial  and  distribution  business lines, Saint-Gobain is committed to providing innovative solutions and seizing opportunities related to the challenges of respectful management  of  materials, processing and efficient waste processing.\n\nThe  action  plans  specific  to  promoting  the  circular economy are outlined in Chapter 3, Section 4.2.\n\n## Incorporating as much reused, recycled 2.3.3.1 and bio-sourced content into its products as possible\n\nSome of the Group's products can be recycled indefinitely in a closed loop in their industrial process, which is then adapted  to  the  replacement  of  natural  raw  materials through recycled materials from either internal or external collection.  Therefore,  their  inclusion  in  the  products essentially depends on the existence of efficient, long-term collection networks.\n\n- Today, 22 countries throughout the world use plaster /uni25A0 waste from worksites to manufacture their plasterboard. Almost 250,000 tons of waste plasterboard  from  the  sites  were  recovered  and recycled  in  this  way  across  the  globe  in  2020, representing the equivalent of the annual output of 2 medium-sized factories.\n- Logistics have been optimized for glass products to /uni25A0 promote the recovery of cullet (glass debris) across the entire  value  chain  where  the  Group  is  present  and especially between glass processing sites (manufacturing of windshields or windows, for example) and glass furnaces.\n- Other  Group  products  can  already  tolerate  the /uni25A0 replacement  of  virgin  raw  materials  with  recycled materials  from  other  consumption  circuits, such  as, glass wool and cast iron pipe.\n- For many years, glass wool has included cullet in its /uni25A0 composition. In 2020, external cullet accounted for over 55% of all materials loaded into the furnaces (and more than 89% in Japan).\n- Similarly, the production of cast iron pipes and other /uni25A0 piping elements uses a 'second fusion' process which is carried out by fusing scrap and recovery cast iron. The annual quantities depend on their availability on the market.\n\n## Generating a minimum of production 2.3.3.2 waste and recovering it internally\n\nThe industrial sites are working to reduce the quantities of waste  generated  in  accordance  with  the  three  Rs hierarchy:  reduce,  reuse  and  recycle.  Incineration  and landfilling should be limited as much as possible.\n\nThe priority waste management actions initially relate to a reduction in the quantities of production waste generated. The  operational  excellence  demonstrated  in  the  WCM program (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.1), in particular quality and productivity, is the first action to reduce waste and optimize the use of resources.\n\nThe sites then seek to reuse production waste in their own industrial  process.  The  ceramics  production  plant  in Zhengzhou (China) has implemented a plan to analyze the nature and composition of its production waste, and has identified solutions to reuse it on the site. This approach also  makes  it  easier  to  research  external  recovery networks if no on-site solution has been found.\n\nLikewise, a glass plant in China has initiated a new process to recycle fine dust  from  processing  through  the electrofiltration of this smoke. Inspired by the pharmaceutical industry, it makes it possible to adjust the glass composition according to the amount and chemical analysis  of  the  dust  put  back  into  the  furnaces.  This process brings about a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill and optimizes glass compositions.\n\nFinally, a new technology has been tested on a rock wool production site in Romania which has resulted in all of its production waste being recycled in its industrial process.\n\n## Externally recovering the waste 2.3.3.3 from its processes\n\nEven for industrial processes favorable to the incorporation  of  recycled  materials,  optimizations  are possible. The plasterboard manufacturing plant in Vietnam has introduced a process to separate the paper from the plasterboard  during  a  waste  reprocessing  phase.  The plaster is reincorporated into the process when the paper is recycled  in  the  manufacture  of  cardboard  via  an external  recovery  network.  Production  waste  generated during  the  production  of  bitumen  membranes  in  the United States are recovered externally for use in addition to bitumen in road construction or renovation.\n\nSome of the waste generated during the production of mineral  wools  is  reprocessed  before  being  recovered externally  as  a  secondary  raw  material  for  the  roofing industry  or  for  certain  manufacturers  that  manufacture acoustic ceilings.\n\nThe Group is also involved in the creation of recycling networks with the help of external local partners.\n\nProgress  in  the  reduction  and  recycling  of  production waste  made  at  certain  Group  sites  shows  that  'zero non-recovered waste' is an achievable ambition.\n\n3",

Based  on  its  experience  in quarries,  the  Group  today  has  a  significant  internal expertise on the subject. In June 2018, the Group adopted a  biodiversity  policy  with  the  intention  of  preserving, restoring, strengthening and enhancing biodiversity, and to  that  end  encouraging  the  involvement  of  all  parties concerned.\n\nA mapping study of all the sites was conducted in 2016 using geographical tools to evaluate their sensitivity to the ecosystems  based  on  their  proximity  to  areas  of  high biodiversity  value.  The  protected  areas  considered  are areas recognized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (UICN) or more locally defined as Natura  2000  or  RAMSAR  areas.  In  2019,  the  study continued,  with  the  addition  of  criteria  such  as  the environmental impact of the sites, stakeholder expectations  and  the  biodiversity  initiatives already underway. This made it possible to finalize a list of around sixty priority sites in 2020 for the implementation of a biodiversity  management  plan  and  the  sharing  of  best practices.\n\nOut of the 143 underground or surface quarries operated by Saint-Gobain around the world, the vast majority are\n\nfor the production of gypsum (103 or 72%). A charter for the environment and biodiversity in the Group's quarries and  mines  was  published  in  2019,  capitalizing  on  the experience  acquired  over  many  years  for  Gypsum.  The Group's quarries are operated and then restored with the aim of preserving the environment in accordance with the local rules. During the operating and restoration period, the  effects  on  residents  and  on  the  environment  are reduced as much as possible: visual impact, dust, noise and vibration, consequences to road traffic and repercussions on the local natural environments. In 2020, 64%  of  the  Group's  active  quarries  already  had  a biodiversity management plan in place.\n\nFollowing up the introduction of the Biodiversity policy in 2018, an internal committee  was  created,  bringing together  the  relevant  industrial  activities  and  functions, such  as  purchasing  and  R&D.  In  2020,  the  biodiversity network was expanded to include biodiversity representatives from the sites defined as priority sites. To support the rollout of the policy, a training module has been created, which explains the biodiversity priorities and outlines best  practices  for  drawing  up  biodiversity management plans.\n\nAmong the local initiatives identified, in 2018, Saint-Gobain made a commitment to 'Act4nature', a French initiative for voluntary commitments by companies for biodiversity.",

This policy requires a compulsory  buy-in  from  all employees for Saint-Gobain's values as expressed in its code of ethics, the Principles of Conduct and Action.\n\nIn a more local, sustainable and digital world, Saint-Gobain's  human  resources  policy  must  allow  for rapid adaptation of structures and, in particular, in-depth management  of  changes  in  skills  requirements,  and support for employees in the face of large transformations, as well as talent attraction and retention.\n\nTo do this, it incorporates two dimensions:\n\n- global  coordination  tasked  with  defining  a  common /uni25A0 framework  for  all  Group  employees,  incorporating ethical values, respect for human rights, the deployment  of  managerial  principles  based  on  trust, accountability  and  collaboration,  and  the  offering  of training programs to better handle major cultural and market transformations, the establishment of ambitious and  demanding  health  and  safety  objectives,  social protection, diversity or any other subject that beings about decent working conditions for all;\n- local  implementation  by  the  HR  teams  in  charge  of /uni25A0 social dialogue, wage policy, local adaptation and the implementation of action plans to achieve the Group's objectives.\n\nIn addition to the HR operational performance indicators (see Chapter 4, Section 2.4), the success of this policy and the quality of social dialogue are measured each year in a survey  of  all  employees.  The  percentage  of  employees responding to the survey, their satisfaction with working conditions and their confidence in both the strategy and its implementation are signs of a strong commitment that affirms the Group's choice of a balance between local and global dimensions.\n\nThe monthly Human Resources Committee is chaired by the Senior Vice-President in charge of Human Resources and Digital Transformation. It brings together the Directors of the HR support functions, in particular the Vice-President of Social Affairs and the Vice-President of Group Talent and Executive Career Management, the main Vice-Presidents of Human Resources of the Regions and the Vice-President of Human Resources of the HPS entity. As a result, the local and global action plans are regularly monitored and the main HR indicators are analyzed.\n\nEach  year,  Saint-Gobain  submits  its  human  resources practices to the Top Employers Institute, an independent body  that  assesses  HR  and  ethics  performance  on  the basis of an evaluation questionnaire followed by audits of practices. For the sixth consecutive year, the Group is one of the 16 companies to have gained global recognition. Saint-Gobain  is  also  recognized  as  a  'Top  Employer' locally in 36  countries,  corresponding  to  91,6%  of employees.\n\n## Managerial practices: a global 3.1.1 ambition\n\nOver  the  last  few  years,  the  Group  has  experienced profound change, including the shift from a product-oriented rationale to a market-oriented rationale, creating a spirit of openness  within Saint-Gobain: outward-looking openness to be attentive to the world around it and provide responses to customers' needs and openness  within  the  business,  to  foster  dialogue  and innovation.\n\nFive 'Saint-Gobain Attitudes' constitute both a management method and a shared mindset throughout the Group:\n\n- cultivate customer intimacy: understanding and /uni25A0 anticipate the needs of external and internal customers and meet them a 'solution-oriented' approach;\n- act  like  an  entrepreneur:  focus  on  performance  and /uni25A0 results, cultivating a certain openness to new ideas and an ability to adapt to change;\n- innovate: demonstrate curiosity but also promote and /uni25A0 value diversity to foster the generation of fresh ideas;\n- be agile: be proactive and anticipate change, including /uni25A0 change related to digital technology, while maintaining a focus on results;\n- build an open and engaging culture: exercise /uni25A0 considerate  leadership  in  a  volatile,  uncertain  and complex world.\n\nThe 'Saint-Gobain Attitudes' have been embedded in the Group's HR tools and procedures such as the managerial guidelines, annual  appraisals  and  360\u00b0  assessments, induction  programs  for  new  arrivals,  training,  especially management training, and talent management.\n\nIn  addition,  a  new  way  of  leadership  based  on  trust, accountability and  collaboration  is encouraged  and includes new ways of working together. To develop this mindset,  managers  have  training  programs,  tools  to introduce new  collaborative working methods  and inspiring  examples  to  work  on  with  their  teams  (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.5).\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Excellence in human resources management\n\nThe employee satisfaction survey (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.8) made it possible to measure progress in employee perception  of  this  new  way  of  leadership.  80%  of  the Group's employees feel that they are involved in defining their objectives, 78% have confidence in management and 85% agree that their manager promotes teamwork and collaboration.  The  survey  was  conducted  in  the  fall  of 2020. These results were obtained while the health crisis forced  the  rapid  transition  to  remote  working  in  many countries and communication with teams via digital tools.\n\n## Local operational responsibility 3.1.2\n\nEach country implements the Group's policies and major commitments (health, safety, diversity, etc.) by adapting the action plans, stages of attainment and tools to the specific features  and  culture  of  its  region  without compromising  on  the  expected  performance  level.  HR policies are disseminated by the global HR network. The local teams have guides to support their deployment, and special training sessions  are  organized  by  the  HR Academy. Practical guides and practical training provided by the global support teams are available for the following topics in particular: employee dialogue, diversity, compensation and benefits, talent management, recruitment and integration, and mobility.\n\n## Protecting the health and safety of employees 3.2\n\nThe health and safety of employees are absolute priorities, and  Saint-Gobain  makes  them  central  to  its  corporate culture. It is important for everyone to participate in their own safety and the safety of all of their colleagues.\n\nThe  Group's  commitments  are  published  in  the  EHS Charter, which is available on the Group's website and sets out the four principles:\n\n- compliance with regulations and Saint-Gobain /uni25A0 standards;\n- exemplary behavior in processes, products and services /uni25A0 over the entire life cycle;\n- ongoing prevention and reduction of risks for /uni25A0 employees, temporary workers, subcontractors, visitors, customers and the environment;\n- ongoing dialogue with stakeholders. /uni25A0\n\nThis charter is accompanied by a letter of commitment from the Chief Executive Officer reminding everyone of the  goals  of  zero  occupational  accidents  and  zero occupational illnesses and the principles.\n\nThe management of health and safety risks is decribed in Chapter  3,  Section  2.2.4:  Managing  risks  related  to  the environment as well as Health and Safety in the Group's activities.\n\n## Employee health 3.2.1\n\nWith regards to health, in 2013, Saint-Gobain adopted a Health policy that is in continuity with the actions already undertaken by the Group. It establishes the guidelines of its action for protecting the health of its employees, its customers  and  users  of  its  products,  as  well  as  for residents  adjacent  to  its  sites.  All  the  Group's  sites throughout the world have to implement it, in accordance with their local regulations and in addition to the health and  industrial  hygiene  standards  and  tools  already  in place.\n\nSaint-Gobain's ambition is to reduce, as much as possible the risk level for the health of its employees, temporary workers and subcontractors working on its sites throughout the world. It is fundamental to know and draw up  an  exposure  profile  for  occupational  risks.  It  is  a question  of  ensuring  the  protection  of  employees  and deploying individual health surveillance adapted to the risk profile.\n\nTo ensure the same level of protection and medical care for all Saint-Gobain employees worldwide, the Group has established  mandatory  standards  and  recommendations for health and industrial hygiene. Each site adapts them according to its local specificities and requirements. They are  supplemented  by  specific  standards  for  certain activities and operating kits.\n\nThe recommendations on the organization of first aid and equipping entities with external automatic defibrillators have been communicated and monitoring takes place at Group  level  to  ensure  that  these  recommendations  are followed.\n\nIn addition to managing workplace health risks, be they of a chemical, physical, ergonomic or psychological nature, the Health policy also promotes the general health of all Group  employees,  through  actions  to  prevent  sickness linked to individual risk factors such as sedentary lifestyles or smoking and to promote health.\n\n## The Covid-19 health crisis 3.2.1.1\n\nThe management of the Covid-19 pandemic implemented throughout 2020 relied on human resources and physician networks as well as an EHS management system deployed in all countries and at all industrial and distribution sites. As soon as health risks were detected in China, global coordination of epidemic monitoring was set up, and these three networks worked in close collaboration to ensure scientific and regulatory monitoring, communicate prevention measures, and support and monitor deployment on all sites.\n\nIn  February  2020,  a  central  crisis  unit  consisting  of members of the Executive Committee, plus the vice-presidents of the major support functions, in particular the VPs of Medicine and Occupational Health and of Sustainable Development in charge of EHS, was put in place.\n\nTo face this unprecedented health crisis, Saint-Gobain set itself two priorities:\n\n- protect employees, temporary workers and /uni25A0 subcontractors on site from health risks in accordance with  the  requirements  of  the  health  authorities,  by incorporating local cultural specificities and being able, depending on the country, to apply additional protection measures such as the use of remote working in advance of decisions by local authorities;",

        "page_content": "- prevent  the  risks  of  psychological  impact  related  to /uni25A0 confinement  measures,  the  switch  to  telecommuting and other psychological risks.\n\nThus, Group procedures were deployed, including individual  protection  measures  such  as  the  wearing  of masks,  barrier  gestures,  temperature  measurement  and on-site tests and preventive measures such as cleaning procedures  and  frequent  cleaning,  ventilation  systems, management  of  high-risk  situations  on  site  such  as canteens  or  public  transportation  for  commutes  and monitoring of the reporting of cases by country.\n\nTo ensure prevention of psychological risks, the management teams used the Mental Well-Being tool (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.3) and manager guides to support the implementation of telecommuting, maintaining employee social bonds and motivation.\n\nFinally, general communications have been set up directly on the intranet site accessible to all employees to give updates on the pandemic, general scientific information, prevention  measures,  videos  and  e-learning  to  support managers in management of the crisis and regular updates on the Group's situation.\n\nHealth  alerts  specific  to  the  implementation  of  internal measures such as travel restrictions starting January 2020 and communication flashes informing them of the general situation were issued on a regular basis at a frequency appropriate to the management of the crisis.\n\n## Managing chemical risks 3.2.1.2\n\nFor  many  years,  Saint-Gobain  has  been  committed  to reducing  and  controlling  the  risks associated with chemicals (hazardous substances and products, and dust). Three  complementary  tools  have  been  developed  to support the sites in managing chemical risks:\n\n- the internal standard and its implementation guide on /uni25A0 the  assessment  and  control  of  the  risk  linked  to chemical agents enables industrial sites to carry out a periodic assessment of exposure to hazardous substances according to precise minimum rules. It is supplemented by risk management guides (ventilation and  personal  protective  equipment,  examples  of chemical management and storage procedures, activity-specific  product  inventories,  etc.)  as  well  as training kits;\n- the  SBASE  database  provides  a  list  of  chemical /uni25A0 substances  and  their  classifications.  This  database  is updated on an ongoing basis in response to changes in the classification of the different regulatory frameworks such as REACH in Europe. SBASE is managed by the Group's EHS Department;\n- the SAFHEAR management tool allows each industrial /uni25A0 site to prepare and document its own inventory of the chemical  substances  and  products  used  but  also potentially generated  during  industrial production processes. In the second phase, it allows sites to make and document exposures. This data is consolidated at Group level.\n\nThe inventory of the products and substances used by Group  entities  is  an  ongoing  process.  In  2020,  new indicators  from  the  Saint-Gobain  SAFHEAR  tool  were communicated to countries and businesses to help them\n\nmanage  chemical  risk  according  to  the  new  risk assessment and control standard implemented in September 2019. Since January 2021, these indicators are communicated  every  three  months  to  encourage  the updating  in  SAFHEAR  of  chemical  inventories  and  the results of risk assessments. At the end of 2020, 44% of sites have updated their inventory in SAFHEAR according to the new rules.\n\nA new organization has been set up at Group level to develop the competence of the EHS managers on site, through  training,  educational  materials  and  technical assistance.\n\nFinally, Saint-Gobain actively monitors the updates to the list of substances applying for authorization or subject to authorization  or  restriction.  The  Group  anticipates  the deadlines for substance authorization in Europe, in order to fulfill its obligations of substitution and communication to its customers.\n\nIn  non-EU  countries  subject  to  other  regulations  on chemicals  (PARCHEM  in  Switzerland,  Toxic  Substances Control Act in the USA, Canadian Environmental Protection  Act  and  the  Chemicals  Management  Plan  in Canada,  CHINA  REACH  in  China,  etc.),  Saint-Gobain applies the regulations in force and monitors any changes.\n\nTo complete the system, a multi-disciplinary cross-functional working party (doctors, hygienists, product  managers  and  environment  managers)  ensures technical, scientific and regulatory monitoring. It aims to identify  and  establish  control  over  substances  in  the nanoparticulate  state  used  within  the  Group,  and  in particular monitors the implementation of the practices recommended in the Code of Conduct on the handling of nanomaterials in the research and development centers.\n\nThis cross-functional control of chemical substances and products also forms part of the product innovation and stakeholder  communication  initiative,  with  a  particular focus on consumers (see Chapter 3, Section 2.1.3).\n\n## Management of noise and ergonomic 3.2.1.3 factors\n\nThe Group has followed a similar approach in terms of assessing  and  managing  noise  in  the  workplace  and ergonomic factors:\n\n- a noise assessment standard and a guide for /uni25A0 implementing technical and individual protection methods;\n- a grid for detecting ergonomic factors; /uni25A0\n- the  Group  finally  has  a  set  of  information  and /uni25A0 precautions as to the use of exoskeletons.\n\n## A steering indicator for health risks 3.2.1.4\n\nIn  parallel  with  the  indicators  monitoring  safety  (total recordable accident rate, or TRAR) and the environment (EvE), the Group has defined an indicator to control the risk to the health of its employees connected with their activities, in keeping with its health standards and as a priority  targeted  on  toxic  agents  and  noise  risks.  It constitutes  the  rate  of  potential  major  exposure  to  a health hazard.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Excellence in human resources management\n\nThis health indicator, known as HICE (Health Indicator for Occupational Exposure) is applied across all sites. The part of the indicator applied to noise-related risks will be rolled out in 2021 on the basis of the assessments made during the 2020 reporting.\n\n## Safety 3.2.2\n\nSaint-Gobain  ensures  that  all  employees  on  its  sites, including  temporary  workers  and  subcontractors,  have safe working conditions and environments by identifying, reducing and controlling risks.\n\nAt the highest level, the management has demonstrated its involvement in the development of a culture of safety within the Group. All meetings of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee include safety performance reviews.  The  operational  management  is  responsible everywhere and guarantees all aspects of safety: objectives,  action  plans  and  performance  measurement. To underline this commitment, part of managers' variable compensation is based on actions and results, in terms of security. The performance of safety inspections and the application of safety standards are also considered (see Chapter 5, 'Corporate governance').\n\nTo build on this result and sustain the overall effort, the TRAR indicator is included in the criteria for the long-term compensation plan as of 2017 (see Chapter 5, Section 2.4).\n\n## Day-to-day safety management 3.2.2.1\n\nThis  approach  affects  all  the  Group's  businesses  and endeavors to place safety at the heart of the corporate culture.\n\nWhen  a  serious  accident  occurs,  local  management informs their superiors. Once the victim has been rescued and  immediate  correction  action  has  been  taken,  an in-depth analysis of the accident is conducted, with the aim of determining the root causes (technical, human and organizational factors) and developing an action plan. This analysis is undertaken with the local management and an action plan is approved.\n\nThe results of the analysis and the key points identified are then shared via the worldwide  networks  of  EHS coordinators  but  also  with  management.  Alerts  are circulated and shared with the other sites, to make staff aware  of  certain  risks  and  encourage  them  to  ask themselves the following questions: \"Could an event like this happen on our site?\" or \"If yes, what can we do to prevent  it?\"  Sharing  information  in  this  way  helps  to strengthen  the  action  already  taken,  such  as  risk assessments  for  all  operations,  and  the  introduction  of internal standards.\n\nIn 2020, the identification of potentially serious events was strengthened  thanks  to  the  launch  at  Group  level  of  a guide on this subject. Those events had limited consequences,  but  it  had  the  potential  to  cause  much more  serious  damage  (such  as  a  fatal  accident)  if  the circumstances had been slightly different.\n\nSafety inspections are organized on all sites according to the  SMAT  (Safety  MAnagement  Tool)  standard.  These inspections  aim  to  encourage  open  dialogue  with  the person  visited,  on  the  subject  of  safety  and  health, following  the  observance  of  work practices  by  the inspector. The positive points are noted as a priority, as well as any dangerous acts or conditions, which form the subject  of  an  immediate  priority  action  or  an  action incorporated  into  an  action  plan.  A  guide  has  been\n\ndeveloped to help local teams train visitors and people visited and promote the exchange of best practices. In 2020, 383 031 SMAT visits took place within the Group, a ratio of 1,96 visits per employee, temporary worker and permanent subcontractor.\n\n## Results that continue to improve 3.2.2.2\n\nThe Group has seen a steady decline in the number of occupational accidents with and without lost time for its employees, temporary workers and subcontractors. This decrease  is  illustrated  by  the  change  in  the  TRAR indicator, which fell from 2.4 in 2018 to 2.2 in 2019 and to 1,8 in 2020.\n\nThe  reduction  in  the  number  of  accidents  recorded  in 2020 compared to 2019 is partly linked to the reduction in activity  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  But  the  main factor is undoubtedly the inclusion of anti-COVID barrier measures, which have strengthened risk assessments and supplemented  the  implementation  of  technical  security standards. The common  safety culture has been strengthened by barrier measures as a result.\n\nIn 2020, 75% of the entities did not declare any accidents, compared  with  72%  in  2019.  The  'Millionaires'  Club' comprises the most exemplary Group sites in terms of safety, with one million hours worked or five years without any accidents involving lost time specifically, including all the individuals present on a site (employees, temporary workers, subcontractors, visitors, etc.). In 2020, a total of 250 sites were in the 'Millionaires' Club' (compared to 254 at the end of 2019). It increases the standing of the units that have the best results and that demonstrate to all that the objective of zero work-related accidents is possible. Out of these sites, 81 are 'Silver Millionaires' (ten years with no lost-time accidents) and 20 are 'Gold Millionaires' (15 years with no lost-time accidents) compared to 84 and 19 on December 31, 2019.\n\n## Additional efforts required to manage 3.2.2.3 subcontractors and temporary staff\n\nSaint-Gobain's safety commitment applies not only to its employees and temporary staff, but also to subcontractors working on site. Two safety standards, 'Management of external businesses' and 'Work permits' are in place to manage  risks linked to the on-site presence of subcontractors.\n\nTwo  categories  of  subcontractors  are  distinguished  to adapt action plans to risks:\n\n- permanent subcontractors with which actions can be /uni25A0 conducted over the long term and for which the results have been included in the Group's overall results since 2017;\n- occasional subcontractors (worksite, maintenance, etc.) /uni25A0 for  which  a  prevention  plan  must  be  drawn  up  in advance and the introduction, control and supervision procedures improved. Accidents with and without lost time involving occasional subcontractors are recorded and reported.\n\nAn e-learning course called 'External company management' has been made available to the countries and site teams, along with communication tools to raise awareness of the risks linked to the on-site presence of subcontractors.\n\nFurthermore, the entire purchasing specialist network will have  specific  tools  to  closely  monitor  this  process: information and training, best practices, etc.",

        "page_content": "## Fostering employee commitment 3.3\n\n## Social dialogue 3.3.1\n\nSaint-Gobain has made the quality of social dialogue an essential criterion for the performance of its HR policy. The principle of consultation and negotiation, either directly with  employees  or  through  their  representatives,  is universal,  with  the  aim  of  translating  this  dialogue  into collective agreements. Freedom of association is one of the values embedded in Saint-Gobain's Code of Ethics and respect for it is a prerequisite for quality social dialogue.\n\nBecause social dialogue must provide concrete answers to the questions of working conditions, the specific expectations  of  employees,  and  the  deployment  of  HR action  plans,  it  is  mainly  carried  out  at  local  level  in accordance with the Group's HR policy (see Chapter 3, Section 3.1).\n\nSaint-Gobain CEOs in each country meet with employee representatives periodically to discuss strategy and local issues.\n\nEven though Saint-Gobain encourages social dialogue at a local  level,  Group  coordination  exists.  As  a  result,  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Saint-Gobain meets with the central union coordinators several times a year and chairs at least twice a year the Group Committee. At  European  level,  the  Chairman  and  CEO  chairs  the Convention  for  European  Social  Dialogue which  brings together  70  union  representatives  from  27  European countries annually. With the aid of an independent expert, this  Convention  makes  it  possible  to  supplement  the national  dialogue  by  dealing  with  subjects  of  common interest such as safety or the trend of employment on European  industrial  sites.  These  subjects  are  raised  in particular by the members of the Select Committee, which acts as spokesman for the Convention, who benefit from specific training to perform their role.\n\nThe employee satisfaction survey conducted in 2020 (see Chapter  3,  Section  3.3.8)  shows  that  over  80%  of employees believe that their working conditions are good and that the balance between personal and professional life is satisfying.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, the historic quality of social dialogue in the countries and regions made it possible for Saint-Gobain to be responsive and flexible to the local pandemic situation.\n\nIn an uncertain economic  context,  Saint-Gobain  is committed, as far as possible, to implementing solutions to safeguard employment and only to making job cuts as a last resort. The aim is initially to reorganize to deal with situations  on  a  temporary  basis,  as  in  the  case  of temporary lay-off, or to favor internal mobility agreements which, associated with incentive measures, make it possible  to  maintain  jobs  within  the  Group.  When restructuring  is  inevitable,  the  employees  affected  by workforce adjustments benefit from personalized support programs  which  may  result  in  training  associated  with retraining, assistance for geographic mobility or support for  the  execution  of  a  personal  project,  such  as  the creation of a business.\n\n## Wage policy and employee 3.3.2 benefits\n\nWage policies are set by the countries in line with market conditions. In most of the countries in which Saint-Gobain operates, minimum wages are set either within the legal framework or by negotiating collective bargaining agreements. In 2020, less than 1% of employees were not covered by one or other of these provisions. The Group favors the collective bargaining strategy which is a way of guaranteeing  a  minimum  standard  of  living  for  all employees depending on the local situation.\n\nA general framework setting common rules and principles to ensure a fair compensation for Saint-Gobain's employees was shared within the HR framework.\n\nAt the same time, employee shareholding offers employees  the  option  to  become  shareholders  under preferential conditions, either directly as individuals or via involvement  in  a  dedicated  collective  fund.  The  Group Savings Plan (GSP) enables them to acquire Saint-Gobain shares at a discount and, in some countries, an additional amount.  In  France,  to  encourage  a  team  spirit  and  to associate  each  person  with  the  success  of  the  Group, Saint-Gobain favors the conclusion of collective profit-sharing agreements. In 2020, employee shareholding  programs  were  available  in  46  countries. More than 88% of Saint-Gobain employees have access to these programs, and in some countries, retirees are also eligible.\n\nIn addition to these programs, Saint-Gobain has introduced long-term compensation plans, including stock options, performance shares and performance units (see Chapter 5, \"Corporate governance\").\n\nSaint-Gobain  also  seeks  to  offer  its  employees  social guarantees enabling them to protect themselves against the  uncertainties  of  life.  Launched  on  January  1,  2020, CARE by Saint-Gobain is a social protection program for all Group employees and their families. The coverage is defined to meet basic daily healthcare needs but also to support key moments of family life:\n\n- daily medical monitoring of families and access to care, /uni25A0 by covering health costs (doctor visits or hospitalization) at least at a rate of at least 80%;\n- the arrival of a child in his family, including adoption /uni25A0 procedures, by paying at least 14 weeks of maternity leave with full pay and 3 days of paternity leave with full pay;\n- death,  by  providing  the  family  with  financial  capital /uni25A0 representing at least one year of the employee's salary.\n\nThe program is being implemented on a country-by-country basis, and the aim is for all countries worldwide to be covered by the end of 2022. Parenthood measures were rolled out in 2020, and all Saint-Gobain employees currently enjoy minimum guaranteed parental leave at their full salaries.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "Excellence in human resources management\n\n## Well-being at work 3.3.3\n\nSaint-Gobain places fundamental importance on both the physical (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2) and mental health of its employees. In 2019, the Mental WellBeing (MWB) program  was  rolled  out  to  all  Group  managers.  The program takes the form of an interactive app and was designed  to  help  managers  optimize  the  psychological well-being  of  their  teams.  Each  manager  can  build  a tailored  program  for  his  or  her  team,  monitor  it  and exchange it with other managers or share relevant best practices drawn from their experience. There are six action areas: management  practices, change management, interpersonal environment, physical working environment, work-life balance, and personal well-being skills.\n\nThis interactive tool proposes best practices, collects the ones  identified  by  teams  worldwide,  and  provides  key information  so  that  each  team  can  implement  it.  Thus, specific  programs  can  be  initiated  locally  by  linking specific  issues  and  proposals  for  concrete  actions  to improve well-being at work. This concept was designed on the impetus  of  the  medical  and  workplace  health department and a multicultural working group, with a very diverse range of profiles (HR, EHS, communication, site managers, etc.) and with the involvement of the social partners.\n\nThis approach is linked to the Human Resources pillar of the  WCM  excellence  program  (see  Chapter  3,  Section 2.2.1). It is also embedded in the Saint-Gobain HR process: in the training provided by the school of management, the individual annual reviews for managers' forms, or in the specific  questions  in  the  yearly  survey  to  measure employee engagement.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  Saint-Gobain  wishes  to  create  a motivating and engaging work environment, respectful of the work/life balance for all employees. As such, flexible working and telecommuting are encouraged.\n\nThis  tool  was  particularly  useful  in  the  context  of  the COVID-19 crisis during the transition to telecommuting by a large number  of  employees.  The  well-being  of employees and maintaining personal relationships in this particularly stressful environment were priorities.\n\n## Diversity 3.3.4\n\nWith the diversification of its teams, the Group is able to adapt  to  the  world  around  it  and  to  understand  its challenges, to benefit from different skills and experiences while  developing  its  ability  to  innovate.  To  meet  its diversity and inclusion targets, Saint-Gobain is working to create an environment conducive to fairness and equality, which is crucial to employees' professional growth, while fostering training and the cohesion of high-performance operational teams. The main drivers of this strategy are managers  leading  by  example  and  the  policy  of  equal treatment in the fields of recruitment, vocational training and  compensation.  Wherever  it  is  present,  the  Group undertakes  to  promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its forms: gender, nationalities, training, career paths, generational  diversity,  disabilities  and  ethnic  and  social origins.\n\nSaint-Gobain embodies a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion; they are key CSR priorities for the Group (see  Chapter  3,  Section  1.4.3).  The  requirements  to  be followed are defined at Group level, while action plans to support  this  vision  are  rolled  out  locally.  An  overall diversity  indicator  incorporating  diversity  of  gender, nationality and professional experience is part of the CSR dashboard  (see  Chapter  4,  Section  2.1).  It  is  also  a performance component in the long-term compensation for Group managers (see Chapter 5, 'Corporate governance'). The Group is committed to maintaining a diversity  index  of  over  90%,  as  it  did  in  2020  with  a diversity index of 90.7%.\n\nTo encourage pluridisciplinarity and diversity of nationalities, emphasis is placed on the value of diversified career paths in areas of expertise (marketing, research and development, etc.), and on equal opportunities for local profiles. With regard to generation diversity, Saint-Gobain ensures a balance in the age composition of employees, making room for younger and older employees. There is a particular  focus  on  workplace  inclusion  pathways  for young  people:  in  2020,  nearly  1,600  apprentices  were employed by the Group in France.\n\nGenerally,  greater  diversity  requires  a  more  inclusive recruitment  process.  To  encourage  these  practices,  the 'Recruter sans discriminer' (Recruit without discrimination) e-learning module has been circulated to human  resources  teams  on  a  mandatory  basis  and distributed to Saint-Gobain managers in France since 2018. This training informs about the legal framework and good practices to be applied during the recruitment process. To date,  more  than  1,400  employees  have  completed  the training.\n\n## Disability 3.3.4.1\n\nThe recruitment and retention of people with disabilities are  important  subjects  for  Saint-Gobain.  First  of  all, disability awareness and training initiatives are in place in the various countries. Several subsidiaries offer workshops in  partnership  with  specialized  bodies.  The  Group  also implements  recruitment  policies  in  partnership  with various specialist agencies, applying a strict non-discrimination policy. For example, in France, several entities are in contact with ESATs (bodies promoting the inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities  in  society  and  the workplace) to support them in their efforts.\n\nOne of Saint-Gobain's objectives is to make everyday life easier for employees  with  disabilities by adapting workstations and hours. In the United Kingdom, Ireland and North America, personal support is in place to adapt working environments to individual needs.\n\n## Gender diversity 3.3.4.2\n\nThe increase in the gender diversity of teams is based on a voluntarist  recruitment  policy  and  on  action  plans  for occupational promotion, equal pay, training and work/life balance.\n\nGender diversity targets were set in 2016: 25% of women managers in 2020 and 25% of women senior managers in 2025. They are monitored each quarter by the Executive Committee. They have been developed by country and Business Units and are integrated into the performance criteria that determine the annual variable compensation of senior managers. At Group level, each monthly meeting of  the  Human  Resources  Committee  has  a  section dedicated  to  women  with  the  aim  of  boosting  career opportunities.",

        "page_content": "These objectives were strengthened in 2020 to promote the access of women to the Group's management bodies:\n\n- 30% women membership of Group Executive /uni25A0 Committee in 2025;\n- an  average  of  30%  women  membership  on  the /uni25A0 Executive Committees of Business Units in 2025.\n\nIn terms of training, an e-learning document on awareness of gender  diversity  issues,  entitled  Gender  Balance Awareness, has been drawn up in several languages and circulated  to  the  human  resources  and  management teams. This program was updated by the end of 2020 under a new e-learning format called Unconscious Bias.\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain launched a program to use Big Data to identify differences in the situation between men and women in the Group's organizational structure. In addition to  the  quantitative  indicators  available  in  non-financial reporting,  the  aim  is  to  identify  underlying  stereotypes that hinder the integration of women into management bodies or create systematic gaps in the situation.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Human  Resources  policy  (see Chapter 3, Section 3.1), each country has implemented an action plan.\n\nFinally, in 2020, the parenting component of the social protection program mentioned earlier, Care by Saint-Gobain,  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  3.3.2)  has  been rolled out in all countries where the Group operates, with a guarantee of at least 14 weeks of maternity leave at full pay.\n\nA systematic evaluation of the pay gap between men and women in equal positions is carried out. The ratios on the average pay gaps of the Group's employees are measured and published in Chapter 4, Section 2.4.\n\nIn 2020, the number of female managers changed from 24.2% to 25.3%. The Executive Committee consists of 25% women members (4 women out of 16 in 2020, compared to 4 out of 17 in 2019 and 3 out of 14 in 2018).\n\nIn  2020,  Saint-Gobain  was  included  on  the  Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year.\n\n## Training 3.3.5\n\nThroughout their working lives, the training provided by the Group must guarantee the employability and success of all employees. The objective is to facilitate the access to training through processes and offers that correspond to their needs and expectations.\n\nTraining is part of the Group's major transformations as it provides support for employees and availability for the skills necessary for the success of operational teams. The training policy is structured as follows:\n\n- support cultural transformation and leadership based /uni25A0 on  trust,  accountability  and  collaboration  to  acquire greater operational agility and to promote new ways of working offering greater efficiency and flexibility. This includes managerial training and talent development;\n\nExcellence in human resources management\n\n- accelerate  the  digital  transformation  in  operations, /uni25A0 Business Models and skills;\n- foster  growth  and  focus  on  customers:  sales  and /uni25A0 marketing  performance,  product  innovation,  services and Business Models;\n- ensure efficiency and operational excellence: industrial /uni25A0 performance,  purchasing  and  supply  chain,  EHS  and R&D;\n- roll out  compulsory  trainings  (compliance,  ethics, /uni25A0 cybersecurity,  etc.)  and  programs  dedicated  to  the Group's  professional  areas  (finance,  HR,  purchasing, marketing\u2026).\n\nIn 2020, in the context of a health crisis, the training teams succeeded  in  converting  the  vast  majority  of  planned in-person training into digital format. Also, new trainings have been made rapidly available to managers to help them manage the Covid crisis, in particular to support the rapid implementation of working from home.\n\nThe  annual  employee  satisfaction  survey  measures  the perceived adequacy of the training offered with the need to improve skills, easy access to the training offer and the personal feeling of being properly trained.\n\nThe level of satisfaction measured in 2020 is high as more than  two  thirds  of  respondents  have  validated  the relevance and effectiveness of the programs offered.\n\n## New leadership\n\nThe  School  of  Management  supports  managers  at  key stages of their professional life within the Group, through five progressive programs.\n\nThese programs have been redesigned to help participants build trust, accountability and collaboration in their  teams  as  well  as  their  transformational  leadership skills essential to the Group's sustainable growth. These programs also favor the attraction and retention of talents.\n\nTo supplement these programs for talents, digital tools and  training  programs  specific  to  this  new  managerial culture have been rolled out at Group and country level for all managers.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nIn 2020, the support programs for teams and employees were reviewed and reorganized according to the Group's targets and transformation objectives:\n\n- supporting  people  to  better  understand  new  digital /uni25A0 tools and improve efficiency;\n- the development of tools in operations, in particular the /uni25A0 integration of new tools;\n- digital culture, including the Data Analytics Academy /uni25A0 program  launched  to  develop  and  anchor  the  skills required  for  data  processing  and  their  use  in  the Group's operations, logistics and the business operations;\n- the  new  Business  Models  and  anticipation  of  new /uni25A0 technologies.\n\n3",

This program uses the camps format to provide training consisting mostly of sharing of practices,  with  a  minority  component  of  theoretical conceptualization.  This  format  promotes  collaboration, networking and interactive learning methods. It enables the  dissemination  of  a  shared  culture  of  operational excellence focused on customer needs and expectations. Thus, training sessions are mainly focused on marketing, sales and service offering to customers (innovation and offers, Sales and  Marketing  performance,  Customer Experience,  digital  marketing,  sustainable  construction, etc.) as well as innovation and research and development.\n\nThe  Unicampus  program  quickly  went  virtual.  Over  50 e-camps were held in 2020 with more than 1,880 people in attendance.\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nThe Unicampus program also offers many trainings about management  of  technical  skills  related  to  the  Group's businesses (Gypsum, Insulation, Mortars, etc.) and to the industrial excellence (WCM, supply chain, \u2026). The 'people development' pillar of the WCM program (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.1) helps to identify and monitor key competencies.\n\nTraining programs organized by technical trade streams ensure  the  management  and  updating  of  the  skills required to offer our customers high-performance, competitive and innovative products and services. These programs are generally developed and implemented by training teams organized by business line: glass, gypsum, insulation, mortars, pipe, etc.\n\nFor example, the Glass Technical Academy covers all glass manufacturing training, but also technical glass transformation training for construction and automobile applications.  Designed  and  delivered  by  around  70 experts, the training sessions provide in-depth technical content, practical exercises and site visits. This constitution  of  a  centers  of  excellence  around  the businesses enables the transfer of knowledge, sharing of best practices and the alignment of methods within the businesses.\n\nSimilarly to manufacturing, training programs are set up for the specific distribution businesses in countries where the Group has sales points.\n\n## Offering solutions tailored to individual expectations\n\nPrograms  are  designed  and  implemented  to  promote adaptation to individual preferences. Combining classroom training,  blended  training  or  e-learning  modules,  they enable  the  dissemination  of  the  Group's  policies  and processes and the sharing of best practices.\n\nSaint-Gobain University also offers individual development programs such as coaching and mentoring.\n\n## Talent attraction and retention 3.3.6\n\nThe 'Talent' element of the OPEN program is aimed at all employees to anticipate the Group's needs and support its strategy. It is the subject of a specific annual progress update  meeting  with  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee.\n\nThe  'SG  Talents'  program  identifies  managers  with significant development potential or key skills. Defined at all levels and in all Group businesses, it enables career plans  to  be  drawn  up,  encouraging  diversified  paths. Personal  reviews  and  succession  plans,  mentoring  and relations with the Group's target schools and universities all feed  into  and  reinforce  this  measure.  A  specific program has also been designed to support and develop experts within the Group.\n\nAs part of the drive to digitize human resources processes, a  project  using  machine  learning  applied  to  the  'SG Talents' program has been developed. In the first phase, the use of Big Data made it possible to verify that the selection of talents was adapted to the defined criteria and that the paths of the identified talents benefited from additional resources (part of mobility, training, etc.). The second  phase  is  more  focused  on  complementary elements  to  the  program:  the  search  for  talent  not identified by the traditional process, improving retention or a focus on soft skills research.\n\nCareer paths offered to its employees are an asset that Saint-Gobain  continues  to  advertise  to  students  and young graduates to attract the most appropriate talent, particularly through the Employer Brand, 'Invent Yourself. Reshape the World'.\n\nSpecific  programs  for  young  talent  coordinated  at  the local  level  are  being  developed  in  Germany,  Brazil,  the United States, India, China and the Nordic countries.\n\nThe implementation of the Transform & Grow program required  a  large  review  of  management  positions  at central  and  local  level.  The  principles  applied  in  the 'Talents'  component  of  the  OPEN  program  identified managers with the most suitable profiles and organized their mobility in a way that has proven to be particularly active.\n\nThe year 2020 saw the consolidation of the country/cluster organizations and there was a return to the mobility levels of managers of previous years (despite the constraints related to COVID).\n\nThe definition of the Group's purpose, like the definition of its  'zero  carbon'  roadmap,  is  a  force  of  attraction  for young talents, who are particularly demanding with regard to the sustainable dimension of our activities. They both constitute one of the foundations of the Group's employer promise.",

        "page_content": "## Employee development 3.3.7\n\nSaint-Gobain's ambition  is to grow  the  skills and know-how of its employees while still ensuring excellence in each of its businesses, but also to be an employer of reference, recognized for the richness of the career paths offered. It involves taking into account individual wishes and the requirements of the organization, offering adapted developing  paths,  whether  individual  or  collective,  or specific to one business line or cross-functional.\n\n## Listening to individual employees 3.3.7.1\n\nMore individually, Saint-Gobain has introduced an annual interview procedure which makes it possible to ensure the regularity and  quality  of  dialogue  with  employees. Individual  interviews  are  held  at  least  once  a  year  for management  and  are  gradually  being  expanded  to  all employees.\n\nFinally, with the help of external partners, Saint-Gobain has developed a 360\u00b0 assessment tool. This tool is available on request for any manager and is compulsory before taking part in any training in the Management School.\n\n## Mobility 3.3.7.2\n\nEvery  Saint-Gobain  employee,  no  matter  what  their position  in  the  company,  should  benefit  from  career enrichment. Their professional path at Saint-Gobain should be a positive marker of their career so they feel they are an ambassador for the Group. Promoting and enriching employees'  professional  mobility,  whether  geographic, functional or between Saint-Gobain activities, is a priority for accelerating the Group's growth:\n\n- it  is  an  essential  lever  to  bring  diversity,  innovate, /uni25A0 develop the individual and collective skills necessary for the  organizational  and  technological  requirements  of the Group's activities;\n- this also enables the sharing of market and customer /uni25A0 knowledge, exchange of different experiences, development of an open mindset and enrichment of the careers of its employees;\n- mobility should reconcile employees' professional /uni25A0 development  with  business  requirements.  Offering more career development opportunities builds employee loyalty and intensifies synergies, generating new solutions for customers.\n\nThe system deployed by Saint-Gobain to support mobility is  based  on  broad  communication  of  the  policy  and related actions, including a guide to support HR teams.\n\nThis  communication  is  based  on  a  Mobility  Charter, common  to  all  Group  entities,  allowing  movement management rules to be disseminated and harmonizing employee  review  practices.  Similarly,  all  employees  are invited to consult the job offers that are made and to apply for them. The online platform OpenJob has been developed  and  used  in  the  countries  to  meet  this requirement. This platform is accessible on mobile devices for all employees.\n\nIn  various  Group  entities,  mobility  committees  bring together human resources managers to share job offers\n\nExcellence in human resources management\n\nand exchange points of view of employees' development prospects. These mobility committees cover all employees and are reinforced for managers. The management teams also encourage employee mobility and include applications from employees from other activities in their succession plans.\n\nIn the event of geographic mobility, the Group offers all employees  support  for  themselves  and  their  families. Finally, within  the  scope  of  reorganization  projects, Saint-Gobain favors the conclusion of mobility agreements.\n\n## Employee satisfaction 3.3.8\n\nIncreasing employees' involvement in a context of change, both  generational  and  technological,  is  an  essential challenge for the Group. To meet this challenge, the Group places managerial attitude and involvement at the heart of this approach: managers motivate and develop the loyalty of employees by giving more meaning to their everyday work and by favoring a spirit of initiative.\n\nSince 2019, a unique tool to measure  employee commitment has been developed. It makes it possible to conduct surveys targeted on particular populations and/or themes,  for  example,  specifically  listening  to  managers during the transformation phases.\n\nThis platform is also used to conduct the annual global survey sent to all employees: me@saint-gobain.\n\nEmployees  are  asked  questions  covering  the  five  main focus areas of the HR policy and the current transformation programs:\n\n- energy: an energizing, collaborative working /uni25A0 environment;\n- active: an organization that fosters responsibility; /uni25A0\n- talent:  an  HR  organization  focused  on  developing /uni25A0 talent;\n- management: a management style based on influence; /uni25A0\n- inspiration: sharing clear objectives and a factual vision. /uni25A0\n\nWith a participation rate of 78% in 2020, over 120,000 employees took part.\n\nThe level of commitment measured is even higher despite the particular environment of 2020 and the health crisis.\n\nThe  commitment  index  reached  a  score  of  82%,  an improvement  of  three  points  compared  to  the  survey conducted in 2019. This index groups the results into four themes:\n\n- pride in working for Saint-Gobain; /uni25A0\n- short-term retention capacity; /uni25A0\n- recommendation; /uni25A0\n- the feeling of being appreciated and valued for their /uni25A0 work.\n\nIn accordance with the HR organization, each country or BU  is  able  to  obtain  results  for  its  own  scope  and  is responsible  for  circulating the results, and  starting dialogue with employees to define action plans to work on areas requiring improvement.\n\n3",

The  implementation  and  results  of  this strategy are included in scenarios to limit global warming to under 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, Saint-Gobain is focusing its action plans around the following areas:\n\n- design,  production  and  distribution  of  sustainable /uni25A0 products and solutions. In this way, in November 2020, Saint-Gobain  has  set  up  a  'Solutions  for  Growth' working group (see Chapter 3, Section 4.1.1), which aims to  better  assess  the  benefits  of  the  solutions  and understand the benefits of the means to accelerate the Group's innovation processes. Indeed, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires a change in lifestyles, which is linked to changes in the energy supply and to the scarcity of available natural resources. To address demographic growth and increased urbanization, cities will integrate new principles of construction, mobility and  personal  services  that  are  more  sustainable, affordable and close to the needs of end-users;\n- the  definition  and  implementation  in  2020  of  a /uni25A0 roadmap  towards  carbon  neutrality  by  2050  by incorporating intermediate objectives for 2030 approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) concerning  not  only  its  direct  and  indirect  impact (scope 1 and 2), but also its value chain;\n- identifying  and  creating  opportunities  in  partnership /uni25A0 with global and local players. The fight against climate change  requires  cooperation  among  all  stakeholders,\n\nparticularly governments, companies and civil society around a stringent international framework; In addition, Saint-Gobain's organizational structure, which is based on a unique combination of local and global, makes it possible to benefit from new opportunities that meet local  needs  while  being  part  of  global  dynamics, especially in terms of energy renovation;\n\n- risk  identification,  assessment  and  management.  in /uni25A0 response to climate risks, by acting locally (countries, regions, etc.), resilient local ecosystems that are more favorable to the development  of  a  low-carbon economy  can  be  used.  The  ability  to  forge  local partnerships is an asset in risk management.\n\n## Opportunities and risks related 4.1.2.1 to the Group's value chains, in construction especially\n\nThe identification and assessment of risks and opportunities related to climate change is an integral part of Saint-Gobain's global risk management and innovation processes. As such, Saint-Gobain has identified ten risks and five strategic opportunities related to climate change. Each risk and opportunity affects each segment of the Group's value chain differently, from the extraction of raw materials to their end of life. The tables below show how the  opportunities  and  risks  identified  by  Saint-Gobain impact each stage of the value chain while being part of global market dynamics and meeting consumer expectations. This approach has been aligned with TCFD recommendations.",

Likewise, /uni25A0 energy self-production, waste sorting and composting systems are installed: innovations are thus used to optimize energy efficiency;\n- The installation of smart meters and sensors makes it possible to monitor consumption and automatically regulate lighting, ventilation, /uni25A0 cooling and heating.\n\n3",

The /uni25A0 individual apartments are small, but benefit from large shared spaces (workspaces, fitness, kitchens, high-tech). A centralized monitoring system automatically adapts heat, lighting, ventilation and cooling. Shared appliances in kitchens and laundry rooms are very efficient and use little energy. The roof is equipped with photovoltaic panels and the insulation has been reinforced with recycled materials;\n- In the United States, the majority of the population lives in apartment buildings and private condominiums in the suburbs of a large /uni25A0 city, in buildings dating from the 1970s. Only a minority of individual apartments have been renovated. Energy consumption is not systematically monitored. However, installations have been put in place to mitigate the effects of climate change on the comfort of residents: the insulation of the walls and roof has been improved and double-glazed windows have been installed. Most devices are programmable, but none are shared.\n\n## 'Highway to Climate Hell' scenario\n\n## SUSTAINABLE CITY\n\nModel of existing city\n\nLondon, Rio de Janeiro, some US cities, Lagos, Lima, new Cairo\n\nSize\n\nThese immense cities occupy a vast territory and are home to three to five million inhabitants. In less developed countries, these growing cities are surrounded by large slums.\n\nMobility\n\nThe majority of the population lives in the suburbs and driving is the most used mode of transportation thanks to the extent of the road network.\n\n## METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSubsidized, affordable but low-quality housing is built to contain the endless expansion of slums in emerging countries. Poor quality is often accompanied by raised living spaces, a lack of daylight, thermal discomfort, high levels of noise pollution and inadequate ventilation of fresh air. Basic insulation solutions are still incompatible with the affordability required for such 'slum sanitation' approaches. Implementation of cooling processes as the only response to global warming. Access to basic services (wastewater, drinking water, electricity, sanitation, waste disposal) is an important step towards achieving the fundamental objectives of human development. Recycling, reuse and the circular economy can only be considered when these basic services have been fully realized.\n\n## Risk and opportunity management 4.1.3\n\nThe challenges related to climate change represent both risks  and  opportunities  for  Saint-Gobain.  The  Group's Sustainable Development Department oversees the management  of these risks and opportunities in collaboration with the other departments (see Chapter 5, Section 4.1.1.1). The system for identifying, assessing and managing global and local risks is detailed in Saint-Gobain's response to the CDP climate questionnaire.\n\nNone of the risks related to climate change is of major financial significance for the Group in 2020.\n\n## Risks related to climate change 4.1.3.1\n\n## Physical risks\n\nSaint-Gobain is exposed to several types of physical risks, such  as  the  increase  in  the  intensity  and  frequency  of extreme  events,  the  rise  in  sea  levels,  the  increase  in average  temperatures  and  changes  in  the  precipitation\n\npatterns. The Risk and Insurance Department continually assesses the risks to which the Group's sites are exposed worldwide and in particular the risks related to the effects of  climate  change  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  2.3.1  and Chapter 6, Section 1.1.6). The management of these risks is then reflected in the development and implementation of specific  policies  supporting  the  Group's  environmental commitments, such as water management and biodiversity  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  2.3.3  and  Section 2.3.5). In addition, Saint-Gobain ensures that physical risks are taken into account throughout its value chain. As part of its responsible purchasing program, the Group relies on a diversity of suppliers and supply sources to reduce the risk of transportation difficulties and  supply  chain disruptions  (see  Chapter  3,  Section  1.5).  Finally,  the Purchasing Department considers the risk of an increase in the price of raw materials or of energy and greenhouse gas emissions in its purchasing strategies (see Chapter 6, Section 1.1.5).",

The  Group  anticipates  the technological  risk  linked  to  the  substitution  of  existing products  by  low-carbon  options  by  investing  in  the development of disruptive technologies and eco-innovative solutions to meet the expectations of its customers. Two  internal carbon  prices have been introduced to support the viability of the Group's projects and strategy (see Chapter 3, Section 4.1.4.2).\n\nAt the local level, monitoring and compliance programs have  been  implemented  in  the  countries  by  the  EHS Department,  while  the  Legal  department  monitors  new environmental regulations (see Chapter 6, Section 1.1.6). In addition,  the  marketing  teams  ensure  that  the  Group's products  comply  with  local  environmental  regulations. (see  Chapter  3,  Section  2.1.1).  Similarly,  the  risks  of litigation related to climate change are assessed as part of our  existing  risk management  process.  In  addition, Saint-Gobain  monitors  changes  in  climate  reporting requirements to meet the expectations of its stakeholders (see Chapter 3, Section 4.1.5).\n\nFinally,  aware  of  the  impact  of  a  bad  reputation  on environmental matters, Saint-Gobain fully integrates reputational risk into its overall risk management policy. The Group is demonstrating its commitment to the climate through concrete targets for reducing its carbon emissions and  energy  consumption.  Finally,  the  needs  and  risks related  to  access  to  water  for  local  populations  are systematically taken into account in its action plans.\n\n## Opportunities 4.1.3.2\n\n## Improve resource management and energy efficiency\n\nSaint-Gobain  anticipates  the  risk  of  a  scarcity  of  raw materials by actively acting in the transition towards a greater circular economy (see Chapter 3, Section 4.2) and reducing water consumption (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.3). The  substitution  of  non-renewable  virgin  raw materials with renewable or recycled raw materials, the extension of the lifespan or use of our products or systems and the reduction of the intensity of materials are at the heart of the Group's innovation process and enable it to ensure the competitiveness of its solutions while anticipating  changes  in  the  preferences  of  its  end consumers and legislations.\n\nSaint-Gobain is also working to optimize and reduce its energy consumption through such means as investing in digital tools to adjust energy consumption as closely as possible to needs (see Chapter 2, Section 4.3.2.1).\n\n## Develop sustainable solutions\n\nAnticipation of the increase in the cost of high-emission products, which would follow the tightening of regulations and the change in preferences expected by consumers and customers, encourages Saint-Gobain to support the development  of  low-carbon  materials  and  methods throughout its value chain (see Chapter 2, Section 4.1.2).\n\nIn addition to its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations, Saint-Gobain participates through its commitment to the promotion of renewable energies and\n\ndevelops solutions to improve the energy efficiency of its customers  to  enable  them  to  meet  the  climate  and environmental  challenges  they  face  (see  Chapter  2, Section 1.1.1.3).\n\nMoreover, thanks to its strong exposure to the renovation market, the Group is ideally situated to play a decisive role in the national and European green recovery plans for the energy  transition,  which  should  support  Saint-Gobain's structural growth (see Chapter 2, Section 1.1.1.4).\n\n## Solutions 4.1.4\n\n## Designing innovative solutions 4.1.4.1 with carbon benefits\n\nSaint-Gobain is innovating to develop solutions to reduce the  carbon  footprint  of  buildings  throughout  their  life cycle:\n\n- by  reducing  their  energy  consumption  during  the /uni25A0 utilization  phase;  these  are  insulation  and  glazing solutions that improve energy efficiency;\n- by  reducing  the  carbon  impact  of  its  products  and /uni25A0 solutions,  particularly  by  developing  lighter  building solutions, increasing the amount of recycled materials used  to  manufacture  them  or  by  using  renewable energy to power its industrial processes.\n\nA  web  platform  called  Green  Buildings  Saint-Gobain enables the Group's customers to evaluate the contribution  of  its  products  and  solutions  to  obtaining LEED, BREEAM, WELL or international HQE certifications.\n\n## Measuring the carbon benefits of products 4.1.4.2 and solutions\n\nThe  innovative  solutions  developed  by  the  Group  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  lessen  the negative impacts of the construction sector on the climate and cut consumers' energy bills, while enhancing well-being. They therefore play an important role in the fight against climate change, as they permit through a reduction of energy demand to decrease the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted. Thus, the benefits offered by the Group's thermal insulation products and glass exceed significantly the impacts associated to their production in terms  of  energy  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions.\n\nIn partnership with EY, Saint-Gobain developed in 2015 a methodology that allows for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions prevented thanks to the utilization of its insulation  solutions  in  Europe.  The  calculations  realized with 2014 sales numbers were updated in 2017 with 2016 sales; the scope of Europe was enlarged to the world.\n\nIn 2020, the study was completely revised to update the methodology in line with the changes in carbon avoidance guidelines and standards. As a result, the new methodology  takes  into  account  the  situations  of  each region or country, in particular the climate, the existing building stock and the construction techniques available locally.\n\n3",

For example, the Group is investing in the fields of prefabrication and 3D printing.\n\nThe development of prefabricated or off-site construction solutions  encourages  the  use  of  lighter  construction methods using wood or metal structures as an alternative to traditional cement and brick constructions (see Chapter 2, Section 3.2.1.3).\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is also impacting markets related to mobility and energy. Thus, the Mobility BU is working both on solutions to support customers in the transition to vehicles that emit less and less CO2 and on  adapting  its  offer  to  the  development  of  hybrid  or 100% electric vehicles.\n\n## The 'Net zero carbon emissions' 4.1.5 program for 2050\n\nIn addition to the programs initiated at site level, reducing the carbon footprint of production and thus the impact of the products requires three major strategies:\n\n- an internal carbon price to speed up the transition to /uni25A0 low-carbon technologies;\n- innovation  and  R&D  programs  to  coordinate  and /uni25A0 expand  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  processes, reduce  the  energy  consumptions  and  ensure  the transition towards the use of decarbonized energies;\n- scope 3 control to identify the main emissions factors /uni25A0 and mitigate the overall impact of the products.\n\nIn 2020, in accordance with the Group's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Saint-Gobain published a roadmap with an action plan and intermediate objectives for the end of 2030.\n\n## An internal carbon price to speed up 4.1.5.1 the transition to low-carbon technologies\n\nSetting an internal carbon price enables the current or potential  impact  of  a  regulatory  carbon  price  on  the Group's activities to be assessed, opportunities for growth in  low-carbon  sectors  to  be  identified,  investments  in manufacturing and R&D to be refocused, and actions to reduce CO2 emissions to be ranked. Saint-Gobain set two internal  carbon  price  levels  in  2016.  The  first  internal carbon  price  level  per  ton  is  applied  to  industrial investments  above  a  certain  threshold,  investments associated  with  a  change  in  energy  source,  energy investments on an existing or greenfield site with a total annual energy consumption of over 10 GWh. The second carbon  price  level  is  used  for  R&D  investment  in breakthrough technology. This price level is of demonstrable  value in supporting low-carbon R&D projects.\n\nFollowing the communication of the roadmap for 2030 in November 2020, an update of the price levels was carried out for implementation starting in 2021. The price level applicable to investments will rise from \u20ac30 to \u20ac50 per ton of CO2 and the level applicable to R&D projects from \u20ac100 to \u20ac150 per ton of CO2.\n\nIn addition, a specific approach applicable to significant acquisitions  has  been  defined.  It  includes  any  effort required  to  ensure  that  the  carbon  impact  of  this acquisition is compatible with Saint-Gobain's direct and indirect emissions target trajectory.\n\nUnder the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the new rules reducing the free allocation of carbon allowances  from  2021  are  not  fully  known.  Based  on current information, the Group believes that it will be able to maintain self-sufficiency in quotas in the medium term given its current stock level of more than 7 million tons of allocations.\n\nEnsuring the control of its direct emissions and prudent management  of  previous allocations  are  two  principles that Saint-Gobain has applied since the introduction of European regulations, and will continue to do so in this new phase.\n\n## Innovate to optimize the industrial 4.1.5.2 processes and to favor the use of decarbonized energies\n\nIn  the  short  term,  the  actions  performed  involve  the reduction of energy consumption and, in the medium and long  term,  the  transition  to  the  use  of  decarbonized energy,  in  particular  the  transition  to  the  use  of  green electricity.\n\nThe WCM program (see Chapter 3, Section 2.2.1) and the specific action plans for continuous \"energy\" and \"CO2\" improvement (see Chapter 3, Section 2.3.1) structure the action plans.",

        "page_content": "Short- and medium-term actions also include investments in optimization and energy efficiency processes. Pragmatically, Saint-Gobain identifies and analyzes projects  for  which  rapid  gains  can  be  measured.  The analysis also takes into account the impact on competitiveness  and  applies  the  rules  related  to  the introduction  of  the  internal  carbon  price.  For  example, Saint-Gobain  encourages  the  installation  of  energy  and heat recovery systems.\n\nThese  low-carbon  solutions  can  address  each  of  the impacts  of  industrial  production:  raw  materials,  energy use,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  recovery,  carbon capture and recovery.\n\nFinally, the development of industry 4.0 (see Chapter 2, Section 4.3.2.1), in particular the use of data as close as possible to reality, makes it possible to manage energy consumption.\n\nThus, on energy, processes that are technically adaptable to  the  exclusive  use  of  electrical  energy  have  been identified. For these processes, the transition is facilitated by the development of local renewable electricity grids and the growing share of low-carbon electricity in national grids.  Energy  buyers  have  therefore  been  involved  in identifying  reliable  and  competitive  sources  of  green electricity in the countries in which we operate.\n\nThis transition to the use of decarbonized energies takes the form of direct investments such as the installation of solar  panels  in  India  that  generate  around  4  GWh  of renewable  electricity  or  the  use  of  market  mechanisms such as green certificates or Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). For example, in 2020, Saint-Gobain North America signed  an  agreement  with  Blooming  Grove  Wind  Farm that  covered  120  of  the  facility's  250  megawatts.  This agreement  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  carbon emissions of the Group's activities in the United States, since it represents a reduction in emissions of more than 20%.\n\nFor  processes  for  which  the  adaptation  to  the  use  of electrical energy is technically more complex, two axes of innovation are then deployed: one on the development of carbon-free energies (biogas, biomethane or hydrogen for example); and the other, to develop processes and make them  compatible  with  an  increasing  use  of  green electricity.\n\nTo support this effort towards carbon-neutral industrial processes, a budget of \u20ac100 million per year has been allocated to CAPEX and R&D investments for the next ten years.\n\n## Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0control 4.1.5.3\n\nIn parallel, Saint-Gobain has continued to evaluate the CO2 emissions of the entire value chain of its activities and has identified  the  main  categories  forming  scope  3  of  the Group's industrial activities and distribution:\n\n- purchases of raw materials; /uni25A0\n- transport and logistics; /uni25A0\n- purchases related to trade activities. /uni25A0\n\nContribution to environmental, social and societal issues\n\nIn collaboration with the Purchasing teams, suppliers were informed of the Group's carbon objectives. The principles used to assess the impact of the supply chain and the associated emission  factors have  been  coordinated globally and are now available to all buyers worldwide.\n\nThe program involves suppliers in negotiations conducted by  the  trade  and  non-trade  Purchasing  teams.  The objective is to identify common  approaches  and innovations that the Group could support to accelerate their availability.\n\nA  specific  program  on  transport  and  logistics  is  being rolled out on a country-by-country basis based on the availability  of  innovative  offers,  in  particular  non-road freight capacity (ship or rail), or a distribution network for decarbonized fuels for trucks.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders 4.1.6\n\n## Strong climate commitments 4.1.6.1\n\nSaint-Gobain is fully committed as a non-state actor to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and participates with its partners in the subsequent COP (Conferences of the Parties).\n\nIn September 2019, Saint-Gobain responded to a call for action issued by a broad coalition of business leaders, civil society representatives and UN leaders to help limit the rise in global temperature to a maximum of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Through its products and services, the Group  is  already  making  a  significant  contribution  to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in its building, mobility and industrial markets. Through  this  commitment,  Saint-Gobain  is  going  even further in reducing its impact. This 2050 vision is a key factor in advancing its medium- and long-term investment policy  as  well  as  its  industrial  roadmaps,  research  and development programs and product development strategy.\n\nSaint-Gobain  is  campaigning  for  the  introduction  of  a carbon price. This price must allow for a transition that keeps  the  level  playing  field  between  the  various companies and countries, notably through the establishment of a mechanism at the borders of Europe. Saint-Gobain has contributed to several projects on the subject at the European level within the ERT (European Roundtable  of  Industrialists)  and  within  the  AFEP  in France.\n\nLikewise, Saint-Gobain is supporting the strengthening of its climate commitment at the European level by revising its  objectives  for  2030  upwards,  notably  through  its support for the initiative led by the 'Corporate Leadership Group' in September 2020.\n\nAs part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, Saint-Gobain is a member of the Alliance of companies for water and climate change. This initiative supports the actions of cities and watersheds involved in the sustainable management of water resources and adaptation to the consequences of climate change.\n\n3",

Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar is one of the commissioners. The aim of the ETC is to accelerate the move to a low-carbon energy system that enables  strong  economic  growth,  while  limiting  global warming to levels well below 2\u00b0C.\n\nFurthermore, because construction is its largest market, Saint-Gobain is particularly active in promoting sustainable construction and is involved in energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nAll over the world, an ambitious political framework makes it possible  to  remove  technical  as  well  as  financial obstacles to the transformation of cities and buildings to make them sustainable.\n\nThis is the case at European  level, for example. Saint-Gobain  is  a  member  of  various  initiatives  and coalitions, and in particular has been a member of the LEVEL(S)  steering  committee  for  over  two  years.  The committee is an instrument developed by the European Commission  in  conjunction  with  the  industry  and  the public sector and aims to establish a 'common language' for sustainable construction, in order to take it beyond energy efficiency. The European Commission launched the pilot phase  of  LEVEL(S)  in  December  2017,  which continued in 2020.\n\nMarkets' transformation also means changing the entire construction market value chain. Many stakeholders share this desire to promote  more  sustainable  buildings. Saint-Gobain  is  building  partnerships  with  them.  The Green Building Councils (GBC) are a vital partner in this regard.  The  GBCs  form  a  global  network  of  national associations  of  construction  market  professionals  and players.  The  GBC  network  offers  a  fast  path  for  the deployment of sustainable construction technologies and dissemination of good practices, particularly via education for market players. They can create a collective momentum involving the various stakeholders (investors, builders, manufacturers, architects, etc.).\n\nGBCs have a geographical organization that allows each of Saint-Gobain's  units, at the local, national, and international levels, to actively contribute to their work. The Group is a member of 40 local GBCs worldwide, a partner of the European network of GBCs (ERN), and has chaired the Corporate Advisory Board of the World Green Building Council (WGBC) since 2017.\n\nSaint-Gobain  is committed  to  orienting  the  global construction industry toward a low-carbon trajectory. For this  reason,  Saint-Gobain  is  a  founding  member  of  the 'Global  Alliance  for  Building  and  Construction'  (GABC) and sits on its steering committee. Saint-Gobain is also a member of the project steering committee of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) for cities and buildings. Saint-Gobain is also involved in various  initiatives  to  help  cities  lead  this  transition,  for example by being a member of the steering committee of the 'Building Efficiency Accelerator' of the World Resources Institute.\n\n## Train clients locally, inform the end user 4.1.6.3\n\nSome of the training courses delivered by local teams (see Chapter  2,  Section  3.2.1.4)  cover  energy  efficiency  and reducing the environmental impact of buildings. Building distribution is particularly active in that area and plays a key role in supporting craftsmen, thereby facilitating the marketing and use of sustainable products. These services put in place by distribution accelerate the transition to more  sustainable  construction  and  reduce  the  carbon impact of buildings.\n\nIn France, the POINT.P network has implemented 'Energy Efficiency' counters in over 130 agencies. Sellers receive specific training, and tools such as a simulator to evaluate a  project's  energy  efficiency  are  made  available  to customers. A training program on how to save energy in the construction industry is offered (FeeBat), along with a support mechanism  for  official recognition of the effectiveness of the steps taken called Renoprim +.\n\nIn other countries, like the Netherlands, Norway or even Denmark, dedicated spaces are offered to installers and individuals to provide them with advice and training in the realm of renewable energies.\n\nBeyond  building  distribution,  training  structures  are offered by country. They are open to craftsmen, installers, architects  and  other  actors  of  the  construction  sector. They can also be associated with professional schools. In France, the sales and marketing teams are involved with eight apprenticeship training centers (CFAs) for partnerships for training services or support for trainers specific  to  the  establishment.  A  website  dedicated  to training  called  seformeravecsaint-gobain.com  offers  the possibility of training via e-learning or face-to-face. Guides called  \"Les  essentiels  de  l'habitat\"  allow  craftsmen  and professionals  to  train  and  learn  about  topics  such  as energy efficiency or the evolution of tomorrow's norms and standards for sustainable construction.\n\n## Objectives and performance 4.1.7 measurement\n\nSaint-Gobain has set objectives and implemented a set of indicators to monitor its climate change performance.\n\nThe  carbon-related  targets  are  detailed  in  the  'Carbon 2030'  roadmap.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Group's impact  on  greenhouse  gases  is  limited  to  the  carbon impact,  given  that  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases other than CO2 are not significant.\n\nAll other objectives and indicators that the Group uses to make progress in mitigating, managing and adapting to climate change issues are presented in a detailed table in Chapter 4. They have been validated by the independent organization  Science  Based  Target  Initiative  (SBTi)  and submitted  to  the  external  auditors.  Details  of  the methodology for calculating the indicators and targets are available in Chapter 9, Section 2.",

        "page_content": "## Circular economy 4.2\n\nThe circular economy is a resilient growth model suited to changes in available resources (scarcity of resources, new energy sources, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions etc.) and to societal changes (urbanization, demographics, etc.).  This  model  exists  closest  to  the  markets,  at  the regional  level.  Successfully  transitioning  to  the  circular economy  will  make  it  possible  to  continue  offering solutions and services over the long-term which take into account  environmental,  labor  and  societal  expectations and which balance well-being, sustainability and performance for stakeholders.\n\nSaint-Gobain's strategy to develop the circular economy has the following focus areas:\n\n- evolve products and solutions to reduce the intensity in /uni25A0 virgin raw materials and to promote  increased integration of recycled or renewable materials, extend their lifespan and facilitate their recycling or reuse in order to reduce the resource intensity of the solutions;\n- develop manufacturing processes; /uni25A0\n- work  with  stakeholders  to  change  society  and  to /uni25A0 develop new business models and value chains.\n\nThe subject of the circular economy is managed by the Vice President of Sustainable Development, in collaboration with the Industrial, Marketing and Research and Development Departments. Each country and BU are developing specific programs.\n\n## Developing the offer of products, 4.2.1 solutions, and services\n\nThe increasing implementation of the circular economy is changing value chains and ecosystems. From the design phase of products, solutions or services with the benefits expected by customers and end users to the management of the end of life of products, the Saint-Gobain offer must adapt  to  new  requirements:  include  more  recycled materials to reduce the use of virgin raw materials and the consequences  of  their  use,  particularly  on  biodiversity; extend the lifespan of products to reduce their environmental impact; facilitate the recycling or reuse of products to successfully meet market needs with a limited impact on natural resources.\n\nHence,  the  Saint-Gobain  portfolio  of  products  and solutions is analyzed in a transversal manner under the responsibility  of  the  marketing  teams.  There  are  three priorities:\n\n- replace  raw  materials  with  recycled  or  renewable /uni25A0 materials, including packaging;\n- change formulations to reduce the content of /uni25A0 dangerous substances and in some cases completely replace  them,  thus  avoiding  dissemination  of  the materials generated during the recycling process in the cycles;\n- improve  product  recyclability  and  system  including /uni25A0 their packaging, by integrating repairability and ease of end-of-life disassembly.\n\nLikewise, product design incorporates these eco-innovation principles (see Chapter 3, Section 2.1.2).\n\nThe SCORE tool makes it possible to assess and improve the sustainable performance of products (see Chapter 3, Section 2.1.2). The product's role in the circular economy is a  subject  category  on  which  the  evaluation  is  based, particularly the ability to include recycled materials. Their\n\nlife cycle analyses allow to measure  the  positive contribution  of  the  choices  made  on  the  reduction environmental impacts of products and services.\n\nMost of the Group's business lines strive to reduce the resource  intensity  of  their  products  by  reducing  the average weight of a single product unit without affecting their  technical  performance.  This  is  being  done,  for example, with automotive windshields and plasterboard. Several  countries  have  already  deployed  the  BANTAM program, which aims to lighten plasterboard by working on industrial processes and product formulations. Some factories have been able to reduce the weight of their standard  sheets  by  over  20%  compared  to  the  initial weight.\n\nThe SLIMWOOL program deployed worldwide since 2018 aims  to  optimize  the  weight  of  glass  wool  while guaranteeing the product's thermal performance.\n\nFinally, because construction already represents 40% of global  resources  consumption,  Saint-Gobain  is  actively and  collaboratively  participating  in  discussions  on  the evolution of construction methods  towards  lighter construction solutions integrating fewer materials for an at least equivalent performance.\n\n## Developing manufacturing 4.2.2 processes\n\nReducing  the  volume  of  raw  materials  used  for  each functional unit produced and cutting waste generated by industrial  processes  are  the  pillars  of  the  sustainable resources  management  policy  introduced  in  2015  (see Chapter  3,  Section  2.4.4)  with  the  intention  of  moving toward 'zero non-recovered waste'.\n\nSynergies among the Group's different industrial processes are used to optimize the reuse of waste and by-products.\n\nIn the countries in which the Group operates, the teams are gradually introducing services to recover waste from customer activities, in particular waste from renovation or demolition/deconstruction.\n\nThis waste is collected, sorted, and reprocessed before being reused in the manufacturing process in the place of natural raw materials.\n\nOverall synergies are possible across the businesses for each process or raw material to identify for each country the deposits, material qualities or good technical practices and favorable technical innovations.\n\nCross-business working groups including the manufacturing  and  technical  departments,  purchases, sustainable  development  experts  on  the  collection  and processing  of  recycled  materials  have  been  set  up  to develop these global synergies.\n\nThe  search  to  replace  as  many  non-recyclable  raw materials as possible is part of the technological performance  improvement  program  (see  Chapter  3, Section 2.2). The aim of these replacements must be to maintain the quality and competitiveness of the products and solutions and potentially improve them while reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nFor flat glass, the recycling of window glass, facade glass or automotive glass is infinitely possible as long as the collected glass elements meet the quality requirements of a float furnace, in particular that contaminants of all kinds are eliminated. The integration into products is therefore\n\n3",

If the plaster itself is indefinitely recyclable, the presence of paper on both sides of the board causes a negative impact on the manufacturing process and must therefore  be  eliminated  as  much  as  possible.  Some Saint-Gobain factories now reach 30% recycled content, mainly from construction or demolition plaster waste.\n\n## Develop new business models and 4.2.3 value chains\n\nIn many countries, Saint-Gobain is developing services for its customers which include waste and construction waste retrieval. Collected glass is recycled and used to make glazing or glass wool. Likewise, plaster waste collected can be recycled to make new plasterboards.\n\nThe presence in a country of distribution activities adds local synergies through the option of installing collection points close to sales outlets, making it easier to recycle customers' waste.\n\nAll of these services are provided directly by Saint-Gobain companies or in partnership with third-party companies.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  circular  economy  differ  in  each country  and  region  of  the  world.  These  developments depend on a great variety of factors, such as modes of consumption, infrastructure and the industrial fabric, the legal context and the technical and logistical conditions of waste management.\n\nSaint-Gobain organizations in the countries spearhead or take part in initiatives with local stakeholders: industrial initiatives involving an area, customers, and local authorities or communities.\n\nWithin their professional areas, Gypsum and Flat Glass for Buildings signed commitments with the French authorities on the recycling of waste plaster and glass.\n\nThe Commitment to Green Growth for flat glass signed by the trade associations in 2017 could lead to the collection and sorting of 80,000 tons of cullet per year in 2025 for the whole of the subsidiary in France.\n\nTo  meet  these  objectives,  in  2019,  Saint-Gobain  Glass France signed partnership agreements with five companies specialized in the recovery of windows at the end  of  their  useful  life.  In  addition  to  recovery,  these companies  sort  and  process  glass  to  facilitate  its reincorporation into glass floats.\n\nLastly, Saint-Gobain distribution activities in France have had a structure in place since January 1, 2017 to take back waste  from  the  same  types  of  construction  materials,\n\nproducts and equipment, which are sold to professionals, thereby becoming the first private network of collection points for waste from construction and civil engineering sites.\n\nIn 2017, the 'Plateforme du B\u00e2timent' brand offered trade customers a service called 'Les Ripeurs' which provides a solution to collect and recover waste directly from their worksites in the Paris region. Customers use a mobile app to  specify  the  type  of  waste,  provide  a  time  slot,  the address  of  their  worksite  and  their  preferred  waste removal method. Depending on the requirements, rubble bags or loose waste can be removed by 'les Ripeurs' in three hours if they are on the floor or the sidewalk. They can  also  collect  waste  left  in  a  provided  dumpster  or flexible container in 24 hours.\n\nIn 2019, the POINT.P brand launched a new worksite waste collection service: Batireprise. Waste collection centers are now  available  in  11  sales  outlets.  Their  aim  is  to  raise awareness and support construction trade customers in their waste sorting and recycling efforts. This service is provided in partnership with Suez.\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched its ILOOP project, supported by the European Union via its LIFE finance program. This project aims to contribute to gradually recovering glass wool  waste  generated  on  building  or  demolition  sites, which  currently  goes  to  landfill.  It  offers  an  innovative solution  for  closed  loop  recycling,  that  can  transform waste into a high-quality secondary raw material that is used to manufacture new glass wool. The project aims to offer building industry players new value chains to recycle glass wool in France, Benelux and part of Scandinavia, ultimately providing a profitable alternative to landfill.\n\nThis project, lasting 6.5 years, began at the end of 2019 and will continue until mid-2026. Its total amount is close to \u20ac13 million, and the level of planned subsidies exceeds \u20ac4 million.\n\nIn 2019, the Group also contributed to the WOOL2LOOP European  project to recover mineral wool waste. Saint-Gobain  Finland  Oy  is  coordinating  this  circular economy project, the first innovation project supported by the  European  Union  via  its  Horizon  2020  financing program.  WOOL2LOOP  aims  to  recover  mineral  wool waste  from  the  construction  and  demolition  sectors  to convert it into new concrete-replacement materials, using geopolymer technology. The project also involves demolition,  sorting,  analysis  and  processing  of  mineral wool waste. Around 2.5 million tons of mineral wool waste are generated each year in Europe by the construction and demolition sectors and sent to landfill, representing an annual cost of around \u20ac250 million for the construction sector.\n\nWOOL2LOOP  acts  across  the  entire  value  chain  and involves the world's largest construction materials producers, innovative companies in the circular economy field and research institutes.",

        "page_content": "## Local inclusion 4.3\n\n## Acting for an inclusive economy 4.3.1\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  developed  an  inclusive  growth  model that takes into account environmental, social and societal challenges and the expectations of its stakeholders. In an increasingly  local,  digital  and  sustainable  world,  the Group's  strategy  and  structure  is  adapting  to  these changes.\n\n## Direct jobs, indirect jobs and jobs generated by the Group\n\nSaint-Gobain  participates  to  economic  and  industrial dynamics in regions where the Group has established sites, as well as in suppliers' labor  pools.  Saint-Gobain's employment  footprint  can  thus  be  calculated  at  three levels:\n\n- direct jobs, which take into account the Group's paid /uni25A0 employment;\n- indirect  jobs,  which  take  into  account  employment /uni25A0 generated  by  purchases  of  the  Group  among  its suppliers and subcontractors;\n- induced  jobs,  which  take  into  account  employment /uni25A0 triggered  by  purchases  within  the  national  economy made by direct employees of the Group through the wages  they  receive  and  by  the  employees  of Saint-Gobain's suppliers to the extent of their solicitation in the purchasing frame of the Group.\n\nIn 2016, EY conducted a study for Saint-Gobain of the indirect  jobs  and  jobs  generated  by  the  Group,  which covered data for 2015 and more than 90% of the Group's purchases.\n\nThe study concluded that for 170,500 direct jobs in 2015, the Group generated more than 549,000 indirect jobs, in addition to more than 190,000 jobs induced.\n\n## Inclusive societal actions\n\nSaint-Gobain's  organization  is  based  on  strong  local decision-making autonomy and active collaboration with communities.  As  a  result,  the  deployment  of  global diversity and inclusion programs or programs with a social dimension is adapted to local situations to optimize their positive impacts for local populations. This is the case, for example, for the deployment of the 'health' pillar of the Care  by  Saint-Gobain  program  (see  Chapter  3,  Section 3.3.2).  This  program  guarantees  the  reimbursement  of 80% of employees' medical expenses (general medicine and hospitalization). The objective is to have all employees and their families (over 500,000 potential beneficiaries) covered by the end of 2022. The implementation of this program promotes the creation or improvement of local health  networks  in  regions  where  access  to  quality services is sometimes non-existent.\n\nSaint-Gobain  maintains  relationships  with  local  partners wherever it operates. It takes part in actions to stimulate local employment, support disadvantaged populations in the professional world and participate in the improvement of living places.\n\nIn the numerous countries where it is present, Saint-Gobain develops solutions adapted to the poorest populations. Programs are initiated locally depending on the  particular  situations  of  each  country.  The  solutions offered meet the criteria for sustainable and comfortable solutions  with  particular  attention  to  the  cost  price  of housing and the ease of implementation of materials. The resulting energy efficiency provides the future tenant with\n\nan  improved  quality  of  life  at  a  controlled  cost.  These programs are deployed in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Central America and India.\n\n## A network of players contributing 4.3.2 to inclusive action\n\nThe  companies,  activities  and  countries,  within  their respective perimeters  and  according  to  their  local challenges, implement sponsorship actions in the Group's key markets, but also in areas such as education, research, culture and health.\n\nTo  develop  these  actions,  Saint-Gobain  relies  on  local partnerships, in particular with non-profit organizations or associations.\n\n## The Saint-Gobain Foundation\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  International  Corporate  Foundation  is based on employee commitment. All Group employees both current and retired - can sponsor solidarity actions in two areas:\n\n- the professional integration of young adults in difficulty; /uni25A0\n- the  construction,  improvement  or  renovation,  in  the /uni25A0 general interest, of living places for people in precarious situations, contributing in particular to reducing energy consumption and preserving the environment.\n\nProjects must be carried out by a non-profit organization and be located near a Group site. The Foundation provides direct financial support to the projects selected. In 2020, the  Foundation's  annual  endowment  was  \u20ac2  million invested  in  projects.  In  addition,  employee  or  retired sponsors  facilitate  an  association's  access  to  additional partnerships  such  as  donations  of  materials,  access  to technical expertise in energy efficiency and other areas, and volunteer work.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Foundation has supported 281 projects, including 37 in 2020. The global health crisis has had an impact on the Foundation's projects. Some of the  projects  supported  had  to  be  postponed  by  the associations.\n\n## Local Foundations\n\n- In North America, the Saint-Gobain Corporation Foundation is active in organizing three programs:\n- matching  gifts,  allowing  up  to  50%  of  employees' /uni25A0 personal  donations  to  NGOs  or  to  education  to  be matched;\n- community gifts, whereby each industrial site located in /uni25A0 the United States or Canada makes a contribution to the  benefit  of  a  local  community;  donations  and initiatives  are  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  sites, according to local priorities and needs;\n- direct grants, a program of direct support to certain /uni25A0 non-governmental organizations for social and societal development, improving energy efficiency and preserving the environment.\n\nIn India, the Saint-Gobain India Foundation's mission is to improve the living conditions of the most disadvantaged populations  by  supporting  education-related  projects, targeted particularly at young girls. It is also active in the areas of learning, health and  the  environment.  In partnership  with  18  Non-Governmental  Organizations (NGOs), approximately 9,500 girls have benefited from these programs each year.\n\n3",

The Fondation Placoplatre supports the integration of young people through work in the building sector. It also supports programs related to the preservation of the environment and the development of cultural activities in the vicinity of the sites.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nEach entity and each country makes its choice of project support based on local issues. The actions take place in several  ways,  such  as  financial  donations,  donations  of materials, skills-based sponsorship or volunteering.\n\nAll of these actions with a strong local societal impact are not fully reported by the Group.\n\nOnly  a  portion  of  financial  donations  and  donations  of materials are collected. The assessment of the number of beneficiaries is also partial.\n\n## Actions focused on local needs 4.3.3\n\nActions to promote professional integration and education\n\nIn addition to the programs supported by the Saint-Gobain Foundation, many countries have set up partnerships  to  train  young  people,  in  the  building professions especially.\n\nIn  North  America,  Saint-Gobain  has  built  a  partnership with the NGO YouthBuild USA in response to a twofold ambition:  providing  former  out-of-school  young  adults with  the  opportunity  to  learn  green  habitat  skills  and participate in sustainable renovation projects while earning their high school equivalences. Thus, since 2011, the Group has been involved in the integration of young people into the construction sector and their exposure to it.\n\nLikewise, Saint-Gobain UK and Ireland supports Barnardo's YouthBuild Academy.\n\nEfforts are being made in South Africa to overcome the shortage  of  skills  in  ceiling  and  partition  installation through  the  'Saint-Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'.  This training program,  launched  in  2003  and  financially supported since 2016 by YouthBuild International, aims to share the know-how of Group employees with unemployed  youth  from  disadvantaged  communities, through  a  combination  of  theoretical  courses  and  the achievement of a local renovation project. The 'Saint-Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'  is  the  only  CETA (Construction  Education  Training  Authority)  accredited training  provider  with  accreditation  to  facilitate  the National Certificate: Ceiling & Partition Installation NQF 3 in  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  The  Group  sustainably  supports youth employment while contributing to the dynamism of its sector of activity. Since its creation, about 1,000 people have benefited from this program.\n\nIn France, Saint-Gobain inaugurated an apprenticeship training center (CFA) in 2020. Two channels have been developed: industrial maintenance and sales and marketing. For this first year, 70 young people took part in training. Starting in 2021, the Group wants to double the\n\nnumber of young people supported and eventually train nearly 250 young people.\n\nFinally, in India, the Saint-Gobain  India  Foundation supports  more  than  9,500  young  girls  in  targeted education programs.\n\n## Support for local development programs\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain mobilized to support the French recovery plan for the renovation of buildings by implementing four measures:\n\n- training  for  craftsmen:  roll  out  an  'Objective  RGE' /uni25A0 (Recognized  Guarantor  of  the  Environment)  training program by enabling craftsmen to train remotely and have access to a certification system;\n- available and clear information to help consumers and /uni25A0 the  general  public  familiarize  themselves  with  the challenges of renovation;\n- an offering of innovative and ecological solutions for /uni25A0 public buildings and private habitat, including support through comfort measurement and diagnostic services, initiatives to promote innovation in renovation and the increase in production capacity in bio-sourced insulation;\n- employee mobilization: a corporate philanthropy /uni25A0 scheme to enable employees to dedicate four days a year  to  supporting  initiatives  related  to  the  energy renovation of buildings.\n\nThe aim of this program is to qualify an additional 10,000 craftsmen by 2022, compared to the current 2,000 per year, and to increase the production capacity of the Isonat subsidiary  by  2023,  making  it  possible  to  insulate  the equivalent of an additional 9,000 houses per year, and almost 100,000 hours of sponsorship.\n\nOther countries support programs to combat unemployment, such as South Africa, where the Group took part in the national Y.E.S program to combat youth unemployment. Since March 2019, 59 black unemployed between the ages of 18 and 35 were employed and will be trained for 12 months.  This  allows  them  to  gain professional  experience  and  eventually  be  hired  by Saint-Gobain  or  an  associated  partner,  customer  or supplier.\n\n## Solidarity in emergency situations\n\nThe  year  2020  was  marked  by  a  global  pandemic. Saint-Gobain and its employees mobilized around three main  actions:  donations  to  research,  hospitals  and communities, donations of masks and protective equipment, and mobilization of the production system and of  industrial  synergies  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of hospitals or supply materials for medical devices.\n\nLikewise,  the  Group  mobilized  to  participate  in  the reconstruction of the city of Beirut after the explosions of August  4,  2020.  This  took  the  form  of  donations  of materials, projects funded by the Saint-Gobain Foundation and the mobilization of local teams to support reconstruction projects.",

Operating  WCR  represented  a  historic  low  of  18/uni00A0days' sales  at  December/uni00A031,  2020,  versus  27/uni00A0days'  sales  at end-December/uni00A02019, attributable in equal proportions to a structural gain and a one-off gain.\n\nof  Continental  Building  Products.

This dividend represents 48% of  recurring  net  income and  a  dividend  yield  of  3.5% based on the closing share price at December/uni00A031, 2020\n\n(\u20ac37.50). The ex-dividend date has been set at June/uni00A07 and the dividend will be paid on June/uni00A09, 2021.\n\nThe Board has moreover confirmed that it will maintain its policy  of  privileging  a  dividend  in  cash  targeting  a normalized  dividend  payout  rate  representing  between 35% and 40% of recurring net income, a rate that will be exceeded for the dividend payable in respect of 2020 in the context of the pandemic.\n\n## Completion of Transform & Grow 1.5\n\nThe Group's 'Transform & Grow' initiative has brought a profound transformation of the Group thanks to a lean, agile and customer-focused organization and to accelerated  portfolio  rotation  to  secure  profitable  and sustainable growth.\n\n## Structural cost savings\n\nThe  new  organization  by  country  and  by  market  had generated cost savings of \u20ac250/uni00A0million by end-2020, meeting its target a year earlier than planned, with savings of  \u20ac120/uni00A0million  in  2019  and  \u20ac130/uni00A0million  in  2020.  The positive  operating  margin  impact  is  around  60  basis points.\n\nThis  structural  improvement  in  the  Group's  cost  base results mainly from Europe (around 70%), High Performance  Solutions  (15%),  the  Americas  (10%)  and Asia-Pacific (5%). It was driven by simplified organizations (around  55%  of  cost  savings),  streamlined  central structures  and  support  functions  (around  25%  of  cost savings),  as  well  as  synergies  and  optimizations  within each country and market (around 20% of cost savings).\n\n## Ongoing accelerated rotation of the portfolio\n\nWith \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion in sales divested as of the end of 2020, the  Group  has  already  exceeded  its  initial  target:  the positive full-year impact on the operating margin is more than 40 basis points.\n\nSaint-Gobain continues to optimize its portfolio, and its total  divestments  now  represent  sales  in  excess  of \u20ac 4.6/uni00A0billion (for  over  \u20ac1/uni00A0billion  in  total  divestments),  of which  around  \u20ac1.2/uni00A0billion  in  additional  sales  is  in  the process of being divested, with Lapeyre (\u20ac641/uni00A0million) and Distribution Netherlands (\u20ac522/uni00A0million).\n\nThese  local  optimization  measures  should  continue, depending on the strengths and weakness identified by management teams in each country or market.\n\n## A stronger growth outlook\n\nHaving  aligned  its  organization  more  closely  with  its customers  in  each  country  or  market,  the  Group  has improved its growth profile, by offering a comprehensive range  of  integrated  solutions  for  each  segment  of  the construction (individual homes, apartment blocks, hospitals, schools) and industry sectors.",

In  this  market  environment,  and provided  there  is  no  new  impact  relating  to  the coronavirus pandemic, Saint-Gobain expects the following trends for its segments:\n\n- High  Performance  Solutions : continued  sequential /uni25A0 improvement  in  most  industrial  markets.  Businesses related  to  customer  investment  should  rally  steadily during the year, although are expected to remain down on the good level recorded in 2018;\n- Northern Europe: continued outperformance in /uni25A0 construction  and  support  from  stimulus  programs; Nordic  countries  and  Germany  should  benefit  from good momentum in renovation, except in the event of strict new lockdown measures; the UK should bounce back though the environment remains uncertain;\n- Southern  Europe  -  Middle  East  &  Africa :  continued /uni25A0 outperformance  in  construction  thanks  to  strong residential renovation  markets  and  support  from national  and  European  stimulus  plans  which  should particularly benefit the Group's energy-efficient renovation  solutions, notably  in  France,  although certain markets such as new construction remain down;\n- Americas : market growth, particularly new residential /uni25A0 construction, in both North America - as expected and Latin America;\n- Asia-Pacific : market  growth,  with  continued  good /uni25A0 momentum in China and a sharp rebound expected in India.\n\n## 2021/uni00A0priorities\n\n- Improvement in the Group's profitable growth profile, 1. driven by:\n- the continuation of its portfolio optimization /uni25A0 (divestments and acquisitions) and growth in plasterboard in North America fueled by Continental Building Products;\n- outperformance  versus  the  markets thanks  to  its /uni25A0 range of integrated solutions for customers in each country and end market, meeting the full breadth of needs of the construction world and industry;\n- strategy of differentiation and innovation to develop /uni25A0 solutions for sustainability and performance.\n\n- Rise of more than 100 basis points in the operating 2. margin  compared  to  the  2018/uni00A0margin  of  7.7%,  and ongoing strong discipline in terms of free cash flow generation:\n- constant focus on the price-cost spread, thanks to /uni25A0 strong  pricing  discipline,  amid  inflation  in  raw material and energy costs;\n- reduction in costs as part of additional /uni25A0 post-coronavirus adaptation measures , which should generate  \u20ac150/uni00A0million in cost savings in 2021, following \u20ac50/uni00A0million in second-half/uni00A02020;\n- continuation of the operational excellence program /uni25A0 aimed at offsetting inflation (excluding raw material and energy costs);\n- maintaining the structural drivers for improvement /uni25A0 in operating working capital requirement ;\n- capital expenditure of around  \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion, with /uni25A0 investments in additional capacity focused on high-growth markets; ongoing digital transformation;\n- continued reduction in non-operating costs . /uni25A0\n\nFor  2021,  the  Group  is  targeting  a  significant like-for-like increase in operating income, with an improvement of more than 100 basis points in the operating margin compared to the 7.7% margin in 2018  (assuming  that  volumes  return  to  their 2018/uni00A0levels), confirming the success of 'Transform & Grow'.\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to Saint-Gobain's financial condition, results, business,  strategy,  plans  and  outlook.

These new objectives for reducing emissions  from  scopes/uni00A01  and  2  and  from  scope/uni00A03  in absolute terms have been validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\nConcerning the monitoring of the CO2 emissions reduction objective (scope/uni00A01 and 2) at iso production by 2025, the deterioration of the results in 2020 is due to the need to maintain the glass furnaces in heating despite a reduced activity. Despite this result, Saint-Gobain remains on track to achieve the objective of a 20% reduction in emissions at iso production by the end of 2025.",

In some cases, these energy changes result in an increase in energy consumption  at  iso-production.  In  addition  to  these\n\ndecisions, the deterioration in results in 2020 is also due to the  need  to  keep  glass  furnaces  in  heating  despite reduced activity due to the Covid-19 crisis. Details of the Group's  actions  in  the  area  of  energy  efficiency  are available in Chapter 3, Section/uni00A02.3.1 and Section/uni00A04.1.\n\n4",

The result in 2020 is a new  assessment  of  the  Group's  impact:  the  evolution between 2019 and 2020 of our indicators on water-stressed areas is linked to this update and not to its operational performance.\n\nToday,  200  Group  sites  (compared  to  60  in  2019) representing  approximately  16%  (10%  in  2019)  of  the Group's  water  withdrawals  and  13%  of  its  discharges appear to be located in high or very high risk areas. Of these  sites,  34/uni00A0sites  (2  in  2019)  consuming  more  than 5,000/uni00A0m 3 per year are in very high-risk zones.\n\nThe deterioration in 2020 of the indicator for the reduction of water discharges at iso production by 2025 is due to the cooling process of the glass furnaces, which had to be kept hot even if the production is reduced. .\n\n| WATER                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2020                         | 2019                         | 2018                         | GRI   | SDG       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| Monitoring the goal to reduce water discharge by 80%  between 2010 and 2025                                                                                                              | -31.5%                       | -34.5%                       | -35.0%                       |       | 6         |\n| Total water withdrawal                                                                                                                                                                   | 45.4/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 48.9/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 52.8/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 303-1 | 6         |\n| Surface water withdrawal on sites with very high water stress (sites with >5,000/uni00A0m 3 /year) based on Aqueduct/uni00A02020 data Previous data on the Aqueduct/uni00A02016 database | 2.5/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3   | 57,763/uni00A0m 3            | 59,806/uni00A0m 3            | 303-2 | 6         |\n| Municipal water withdrawal                                                                                                                                                               | 15.4/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 16.1/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 16.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 303-1 | 6         |\n| Surface water withdrawal                                                                                                                                                                 | 11.3/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 12.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 15.1/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 303-1 | 6         |\n| Ground water withdrawal                                                                                                                                                                  | 16.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 17.8/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 19.0/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 303-1 | 6         |\n| Total water discharge                                                                                                                                                                    | 23.0/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 24.3* M of/uni00A0m 3        | 27.6/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 306-1 | 6         |\n| Water discharges into the surrounding environment                                                                                                                                        | 14.4/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 16.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 18.9/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3  | 306-1 | /uni00A06 |\n| Water discharges into the municipal waste water collection  system                                                                                                                       | 7.1/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3   | 8.5 M of/uni00A0m 3          | 8.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3   | 306-1 | 6         |\n| Quantity of water reused in production processes through  internal recycling systems                                                                                                     | 258.6/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3 | 275.5/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3 | 322.2/uni00A0M of/uni00A0m 3 |       | 6         |\n| Percentage of water reused in production processes through internal recycling systems                                                                                                    | 85%                          | 85%                          | 85%                          |       | 6         |\n\n- * Updated data.",

        "page_content": "## Independence, diversity policy 1.1.2 and representation of employee shareholders and employees on the Board of Directors\n\n## Independence\n\nThe  Board  has  reviewed  each  Director's  situation  with regard  to  all  the  independence  criteria  set  out  in  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  on  corporate  governance  of  listed companies,  with  which  the  Company  complies,  at  the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February/uni00A025, 2021, also scrutinized, as it does every year, with the same attention as it reviewed the other criteria, the business relationships that existed between the Saint-Gobain Group and the other companies or groups of companies where each Director holds office. The Board's review, described below,  concluded  that,  with  the  exception  of  Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Mrs. Dominique Leroy, Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard and Mr. Philippe Varin, none of these Directors, nor any company or group of companies within  which  they  hold  office  as  senior  executives  or exercise  Board  chairmanship  functions  (or    supervisory board)  has  any  business  relationship  with  Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain, its group or its management.\n\nThe Board then carried out a quantitative and qualitative review of the situation of Mrs. Dominique Leroy, member of  the  Management  Board  of  Deutsche  Telekom  for Europe, Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Chairman of BlackRock France,  Belgium  and  Luxembourg,  Mr.  Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault, and Mr. Philippe Varin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of  Suez,  and  of  the  business  relationships  maintained respectively between the Deutsche Telekom, BlackRock, Alliance  Renault  (Renault,  Nissan,  Mitsubishi)  and  Suez Groups on the one hand and Saint-Gobain on the other.\n\nThe business transactions between each of these groups and  Saint-Gobain,  including  business  activities  at  an international level, represent, regarding Deutsche Telekom, BlackRock  and  Suez,  less  than  0.1%  of  their  respective consolidated net sales, and regarding Alliance Renault, less than  0.1%  and  0.4%  of  the  respective  consolidated  net sales  of  Alliance  Renault  and  Saint-Gobain,  and  fall substantially below the 1% materiality threshold set by the Board.  Furthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  highlighted that, because of the structure of the Saint-Gobain Group,\n\nits  size  and  the  diversity  of  its  business  activities,  the Board's role was not designed to intervene in the business relationships  of  the  Group's  various  business  activities, which are managed in a decentralized manner by their respective heads. Mrs. Dominique Leroy, Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard and Mr. Philippe Varin, therefore, in their capacity as Directors of the Saint-Gobain Group, have no direct or indirect decision-making powers within the establishment of or for maintaining these business transactions. If, however, for any  extraordinary  reason,  such  an  issue  should  be discussed  by  the  Board,  the  Board's  internal  rules regarding conflict of interest are such that the Director concerned would be required to inform the Chairman and CEO and the Lead independent Director of his situation, and  to  abstain  from  participating  in  such  debates  or deliberations on the matter in question (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Board considered that Mrs. Dominique Leroy, Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Mr. Jean-Dominique  Senard  and  Mr.  Philippe  Varin  do  not have,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  significant  business relationships  with  the  Group  that  could  affect  their freedom of judgment or independence.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  is  a Director  as  an  individual  and  not  on  the  proposal  of BlackRock which, at December/uni00A031, 2020, held 4.9% of the share  capital  and  4.5%  of  the  voting  rights  of  the Company.  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  does  not  represent BlackRock at the Board of Directors.\n\nChapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.3 deals with conflicts of interest of members of the Board of Directors, and the absence of services contract between Directors and the Company or any company within the Group.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  concluded  from  its  review  of Directors' independence against the criteria set down by the AFEP-MEDEF Code that, as of February/uni00A01, 2021, nine Directors out of eleven ( i.e. 81.8%) completely satisfied the independence criteria, and were therefore considered to be independent Directors: I\u00eada Gomes Yell, Anne-Marie Idrac,  Pamela  Knapp,  Agn\u00e8s  Lemarchand,  Dominique Leroy,  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Gilles  Schnepp,  Philippe Varin  and  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli.  In  compliance  with  the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  Sibylle Daunis,  representing  employee  shareholders,  and  Lydie Cortes and Philippe Thibaudet, representing employees, were not included in calculating that proportion.\n\n5",

three members of the Board of Directors out of eleven ( i.e. 27%) are of foreign nationality (Mrs. Sibylle Daunis, representing the employee shareholders,  and  Mrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe Thibaudet, representing the employees, are not included to  establish  this  percentage).  Further,  the  majority  of Directors  has,  or  has  had,  very  strong  international exposure, managing groups with a significant proportion of their activities, or exercising significant duties, outside of France (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.1).\n\nIn addition, as part of its self-assessment conducted in 2020 (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.4), the Board of Directors was  of  the  opinion  that  its  composition  satisfactorily reflected the necessary diversity in terms of age, gender and  experience.  The  Board  believes  that  its  size  is adequate. The skills and experience of the Directors were\n\njudged to be varied and complementary, both in terms of their knowledge  of  the  industry  and  the  Group's businesses, as well as innovation/digital, which are now well  represented  with  Mrs.  Sibylle  Daunis  and  Mrs. Dominique Leroy, management, strategy, finance, governance and/or Corporate Social Responsibility (see biographies in Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.1).\n\nThe  Directors  believed  that  it  would  be  desirable,  for future  recruitments,  to  prioritize  two  search  criteria, namely:\n\n- a Director with a background in the construction, public /uni25A0 works  or  housing  value  chain  or  with  expertise  in Corporate  Social  Responsibility  or  innovation  and younger than the average age of the Board; or\n- an  Executive  Director  who  holds  office  or  has  such /uni25A0 experience  in  other  major  groups,  to  maintain  the proportion of Executive Directors at the Board.",

Indeed, in addition to his studies in the United States, Mr. Benoit Bazin spent several years there working in operational functions.\n\nThe decision of Board of Directors of February/uni00A025, 2021, in the context of the evolution in Saint-Gobain governance\n\nThe chart below summarizes the skills of the members of the Board of Directors as of February/uni00A01, 2021:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLastly, the Board intends to maintain balanced numbers of men  and  women  (see  the  paragraph  on  Gender  parity below).\n\n## Gender parity\n\nAs  of  February/uni00A01,  2021,  the  Board  includes  five  women among eleven members (45.5%), i.e. more than 40%, in accordance with the Law of January/uni00A027, 2011 on gender parity at Boards of Directors. In accordance with the law, Mrs. Sibylle Daunis, who represents employee shareholders,  and  employee  representatives  Mrs.  Lydie Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  are  not  counted  in calculating this proportion.\n\n## Representation of employee shareholders and employees\n\nMrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  were appointed  as  Employee  Directors  by  the  Company's Works Council ( Comit\u00e9 de Groupe ) in accordance with the Company's bylaws. These were amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2018 to provide for the appointment of two Employee Directors regardless of the size of the Board of Directors, even though, given its size, the law only required the appointment of one Employee\n\nDirector. This initiative, in anticipation of the PACTE Law published in May/uni00A02019, is fully in line with Saint-Gobain's culture of social dialogue.\n\nMrs. Sibylle Daunis, Director representing  employee shareholders, is also appointed in accordance with the law. The  Employee  Directors  and  the  Director  representing employee  shareholders  are  members  of  the  Board  of Directors in the same way as the other Directors and have voting rights. Subject to the laws applying specifically to them, these Directors are subject to all legal and statutory provisions, have the same rights and are subject to the same duties, as fixed, in particular, by the Board's internal rules, as those applicable to the other Directors.\n\nBy  law,  one  member  of  the  Economic  and  Social Committee (Mr. Vincent Cotrel, elected by the members of the  Economic  and  Social  Committee  and  representing employees) holds a seat on the Board of Directors in a consultative capacity.\n\nThe  Company  bylaws  and  the  Board's  internal  rules provide that each Director must hold a minimum of 800 registered  shares,  with  the  law  exempting  employee Directors, whether shareholders or not, from this type of obligation.\n\n5",

The Lead independent Director reviewed for this purpose the responses provided by each Director to the questionnaire sent to them.\n\nThe Board's internal rules address conflicts of interest in the event such a situation arises: the concerned Director has the duty to inform the Chairman and Chief Executive\n\nOfficer and the Lead independent Director thereof, and to refrain from participating in the discussions and deliberations on the subject in question (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\nMoreover,  in  accordance  with  Article/uni00A0L.22-10-12  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  the  Board  has  adopted  a procedure  for  regularly  assessing  whether  agreements relating  to  current  operations  and  entered  into  under normal conditions meet these conditions. In summary, this procedure consists of:\n\n- a reminder of the scope of the agreements at issue as /uni25A0 well  as  a  typology  of  the  agreements  that  may  be considered  current  for  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain (excluding agreements that may be entered into with Directors); and\n- the determination of the persons in charge, within the /uni25A0 General Secretariat, the Treasury and Financing Department, the Finance Department and the Corporate  Legal  Department,  of  the  classification  of such  agreements  depending  on  the  nature  of  the agreements in question.\n\nIn 2020,  no  agreement  was  entered  into  between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and any of its Directors, and no  agreement  meeting  the  criteria  for  classification  as related  party  agreements  was  entered  into  between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain on the one hand and the BNP Paribas Group or the Vinci Group on the other, of which Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Mr. Benoit Bazin are directors respectively (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A05).\n\n## Re-election of the Board of Directors and changes in its composition 1.1.4\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected in a staggered and balanced fashion as follows:\n\n| Date of expiration of the term of office                                                                                                     | Director and date of first election                                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December/uni00A031, 2020 | Pamela Knapp (June/uni00A02013) Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand (June/uni00A02013) Gilles Schnepp (June/uni00A02009) Philippe Varin (June/uni00A02013) |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December/uni00A031, 2021 | Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar (June/uni00A02006) Lydie Cortes (May/uni00A02018)                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                              | Philippe Thibaudet (May/uni00A02018) Anne-Marie Idrac (June/uni00A02011) Dominique Leroy (November/uni00A02017)                         |\n| approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December/uni00A031, 2022                                                       | Denis Ranque (June/uni00A02003)                                                                                                         |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                         |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting                                                                                         | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli (June/uni00A02020)                                                                                                |\n\nA  proposal  will  be  made  to  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting to be held on June 3, 2021 to renew the terms of office  as  Directors  of  Mrs.  Pamela  Knapp,  Mrs.  Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand and Mr. Gilles Schnepp. These Directors have shown  high  levels  of  attendance:  in  2020,  Mrs.  Pamela Knapp and Mr. Gilles Schnepp attended all meetings of the Board and all meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee and Mrs. Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand attended three of the five meetings  of  that  Committee.

as well as\n- the  Director  representing  the  main  shareholder  (the /uni25A0 Group Savings Plan Funds), and\n- the Employee Directors appointed by the Saint-Gobain /uni25A0 Group Works Council, in accordance with the bylaws of the Company and pursuant to the law.\n\nTo this should be added:\n\n- the  specific  role  played  in  respect  of  governance /uni25A0 matters and management of conflicts of interests by the Lead independent Director, a position held by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, an independent Director, who has very good knowledge of the Group (see below);\n- the role played by the Chief Operating Officer, who /uni25A0 took office on January/uni00A01, 2019 (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.3.1);\n- the ability of the Directors to meet in the absence of /uni25A0 the executive corporate officers during or after a Board meeting  (see  Chapter/uni00A05,  Section/uni00A01.2.2  and  Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2); and\n- the limitation of the powers of the Executive Directors /uni25A0 regarding all capital expenditures, restructuring, disposals,  acquisitions  and  financial  investment  and divestment projects in individual amounts greater than \u20ac150/uni00A0million, and  any  material  transaction  that  fall outside  the  scope  of  Saint-Gobain's  stated  strategy, which  require  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board  of Directors (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2 and Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2).\n\n## Evolution in Saint-Gobain governance and succession of the Group Chief Executed Officer as from July/uni00A01, 2021\n\nIn  line  with  best  corporate  governance  practices,  the Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  has been working extensively since 2019 under the responsibility of the Lead independent Director and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and with the assistance of an independent  recruitment  firm,  on preparing the succession of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2010.\n\nAs a result of this process, the Board of Directors deemed it  essential  for  Saint-Gobain  that  there  is  a  seamless transition, by separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, the Board decided unanimously:\n\n- to appoint Mr. Benoit Bazin as Chief executive officer as /uni25A0 from  July/uni00A01,  2021,  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de/uni00A0Chalendar  will continue  to  serve  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n- The Board also decided to recommend to the June/uni00A03, /uni25A0 2021 General Shareholders' Meeting the appointment of Mr.  Benoit  Bazin,  as  a  Director  of  Saint-Gobain  (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.4).\n\nThis corporate governance formula is recognised as the best practice to enable listed companies to ensure the transition during the necessary period in the context of the  succession  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Deliberations of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal rules provide for Board activities to include the following:\n\n- examination and approval of the Saint-Gobain Group /uni25A0 annual report and consolidated and corporate financial statements, both annual and interim;\n- examination and approval each year of the /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain Group budget;\n- examination and approval of the strategic orientations /uni25A0 of the Saint-Gobain Group at least once a year and monitoring of their implementation, taking into account the social and environmental challenges of its business;\n- prior approval of investment transactions, restructurings, /uni25A0 disposals, acquisitions, taking or selling of equity interests in individual amounts greater than \u20ac150/uni00A0million, and  any  significant  transaction  not  falling  within  the strategy announced by the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\n## Ability to debate without the presence of the Executive Directors\n\nThe  Board's  current  internal  rules  afford  Directors  the authority to meet without the presence of the Executive Directors during or after a session, in order to assess the performance of the Executive Directors and to reflect on the future of the Saint-Gobain's Group Management. Thus, each year, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shall leave the  sessions  of  the  Board  and  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee during such discussions (deliberations and votes) on issues involving the assessment of his performance  and  the  setting  of  his  variable compensation  (February  sessions),  as  well  as  during  the Board's assessment, the discussions on the combination of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO roles, on his  succession  plans  and  on  his  long-term  compensation scheme (November sessions). The same rules apply to the Chief Operating Officer. In 2020, in June and December, two meetings of the Board of Directors were held exclusively without the presence of the Executive corporate officers, both  devoted  to  the  succession  plan  of  the  General Management and the future governance of the Group.\n\nThe Board intends to continue to meet in 2021 without the presence of the Executive Directors to discuss governance issues more generally, beyond the issues of Executive Director compensation and the assessment of the Board. This option applies at the start of every meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Prior and permanent information for Directors\n\nAt each meeting, the Board is provided with an analysis of the Saint-Gobain Group's operating income and net debt situation, prepared as of the end of the month preceding the meeting, as well as an update on the Saint-Gobain stock price compared to the CAC/uni00A040 index and an industry index.\n\nBetween  meetings,  the  Directors  receive  copies  of  all press releases issued by Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and, as the case may be, any relevant information about events or  transactions  that  are  material  for  the  Saint-Gobain Group.  Directors  are  entitled  to  request  any  other documents they consider necessary to make an informed contribution to the Board's discussions; requests are put to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nThe Lead independent Director ensures that the Directors receive the relevant information to exercise their duties under the best possible conditions.\n\n## Directors' duties\n\nThe  internal  rules  stipulate  the  duties  of  Directors, specifically with regard to stock trading ethics (status of occasional  insider,  closed  periods,  reporting  of  trades involving  Saint-Gobain  securities  and  the  obligation  to hold their Saint-Gobain shares in registered form), with regard to confidentiality and the management of potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Other provisions in the internal rules\n\nFinally, the internal rules provide for the distribution of the annual  amount  allocated  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting as compensation for the work of the Directors and the right of Directors to additional training on the specific activities of the Saint-Gobain Group, its businesses, business lines, and social and environmental responsibility challenges.\n\n5",

During  each  meeting,  the  Board  also  reviewed  and approved the Group's strategic orientations or a specific aspect of the strategy, such as a comparison with the main  competitors  and  the  position  of  a  business  or  a Region  (in  particular  in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic  crisis)  after  having  heard,  if  necessary,  an operational manager from the relevant businesses or Regions.\n\nThe  Board  also  held  special  sessions  to  review  the proposed  sales  implemented  as  part  of  the  Group's portfolio optimization strategy, one of the two pillars of the Transform & Grow program, in particular the disposal of Saint-Gobain's entire stake in Sika or the projects of disposal of Lapeyre and the Distribution in the Netherlands (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2.2). It also reviewed proposed acquisitions, including  the  acquisition  of  Continental Building  Products  in  the  United  States  (see  Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2.1), and monitored its  integration.\n\nDuring the strategic seminar in September, the Board of Directors  discussed,  with  operational  managers,  the Group's businesses and Regions and in particular discussed the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's businesses, the allocation of capital, changes in the share price and devoted specific time for the CO2 roadmap toward carbon neutrality by 2050 announced to the market on November/uni00A012, 2020 and the setting of new targets and indicators for achieving that goal, after having heard  the  Vice  President  for  Sustainable  Development (see below).\n\nThe Board also monitored the continued implementation of the Transform & Grow plan as well as the progress of the cost reduction plan.\n\n## Financial management\n\nPursuant to its legal competency, the Board approved the annual and consolidated financial statements, as well as the  various  reports  relating  to  them,  after  hearing  the opinions of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Statutory Auditors. The Board also approved the draft Resolutions submitted to the General Shareholders'\n\nMeeting of June/uni00A04, 2020, in particular the proposal not to distribute  dividends  in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic  and  the  use  of  partial  employment,  and  the reports made available to shareholders and convened the General Meeting of the shareholders and holders of Titres Participatifs . It approved the report on payments made to Governments (extractive industries).\n\nIt approved the budget of the Saint-Gobain Group, various provisional  management  reports  and  documents,  and renewed  the  annual  authorizations  granted  to  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  to  issue  bonds, sureties and guarantees. It also approved, in accordance with  the  law,  the  procedure  applicable  to  the  current agreements  entered  into  under  normal  terms  and conditions  and  examined  the  related-party  agreements entered into during previous fiscal years, the execution of which was ongoing during fiscal year/uni00A02020.\n\nIt  implemented  the  Company's  share  buyback  program with  the  purpose  of  reaching,  as  early  as  December/uni00A01, 2020, the announced objective of reducing the number of shares outstanding to 530/uni00A0million.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\nThe Board of Directors undertook a review of the internal control and risk management processes in force within the Group, following analysis of the mapping of major financial and non-financial risks updated in 2020 by the Audit and Internal Control Department, and after hearing the report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee on these topics.\n\nIn particular, the Board of Directors reviewed the rollout of the  cyber  plan  in  the  context  of  the  follow-up  audit conducted by an external service provider regarding the cybersecurity  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group  and  of  the post-audit monitoring plan.\n\nOn  several  occasions,  it  reviewed  the  position  of  the Company  and  Group  with  regard  to  certain  risks, procedures,  litigation  (notably  in  relation  to  asbestos, competition, the Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom,  and  the  environment)  and  the  evolving regulatory environment.\n\nIn  particular,  it  examined  the  filing  and  followed  the implementation of the proceedings under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code of DBMP/uni00A0LLC, in an effort to achieve a certain, final and equitable Resolution of all current and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured or sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation (see Chapter/uni00A06, Section/uni00A01.4).\n\nThe Board of Directors also, after taking into account the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee and following the call for tenders organized in accordance with the regulations in force, selected the audit firm Deloitte, whose appointment as Statutory Auditor of the Company will be proposed to the General Shareholders' Meeting to be  called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the financial year/uni00A02021 in replacement of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (see work of the Audit and Risk Committee below).\n\nFinally,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviewed  the  services assigned to the Statutory Auditors and their network as authorized by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n5",

External experts, recognized internationally and in complementary fields of expertise, gave presentations to the Directors and discussed the following with them:\n\n- renewable energies in the 'clean' energy transition; /uni25A0\n- means  and  solutions  to  achieve  a  net  zero  carbon /uni25A0 economy by 2050.\n\nThe purpose of this seminar was to give each Director a better  understanding  of  the  challenges  related  to  the transformation  of  energy  and  industrial  systems  for  a zero-carbon  economy  by  2050  for  the  Saint-Gobain Group and the consequences for its strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  and  in  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, which was updated in January/uni00A02020, the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the General Management, determined  in  March  the  following  gender  diversity objectives within the governing bodies of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its subsidiaries by 2025:\n\n- 30% women  on the Executive Committee of /uni25A0 Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (compared to 25% as of February/uni00A01, 2021) and\n- overall, 30% of women on the Executive Committees of /uni25A0 the Business Units.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, it was decided to require that at least 30% of new hires be women and require gender diversity among spokespersons.\n\nFinally,  in  view  of  the  importance  of  Corporate  Social Responsibility  for  the  Saint-Gobain  Group,  the  Board decided to create, on June/uni00A04, 2020, a specialized ad hoc committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and under the supervision of the Lead independent Director, the Board formally conducted the annual assessment of its operations and discussed the results of this assessment (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.4).\n\nDuring two executive sessions, it discussed, on proposal of the Lead independent Director, the succession plan for the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  future governance of the Group (see Chapter 5, Section 1.2.1).\n\nIt reviewed the situation of Director independence. At the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, it also discussed changes in its size and composition due to  the  expiration  of  the  terms  of  certain  Directors.  It formulated its proposals for renewal of terms of office, and recommended the appointment of Mr. Benoit Bazin as a Director in view of the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A03, 2021 in the context of the future governance of the Group (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.4).\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of March/uni00A026, 2020, co-opted Mrs. Sibylle Daunis as a Director representing  the  employee  shareholders,  replacing  Mr. Jacques Pestre, who retired.\n\nLastly, it ruled on the training program for the Employees Directors.\n\n## Compensation of the corporate officers and long-term incentives for Executive corporate officers and employees\n\nThe  Board  approved  the  general  principles  of  the Compensation  policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer for 2020 and,  at  its  meeting  of  February/uni00A025,  2021,  for  2021  (see Chapter/uni00A05, Sections/uni00A02.2.1 and  2.2.2). In particular, it reviewed and approved the various components of the compensation of Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Benoit Bazin (fixed portion, variable portion and long-term compensation instruments) and the respective balance of those various components. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board of Directors decided, in April/uni00A02020, on proposal of the Executive corporate officers, to review and reduce by 25% their fixed compensation to be paid in 2020 and their variable compensation due in respect of the  2019  fiscal  year,  paid  in  2020,  for  as  long  as  the Group's employees would be subject to partial employment in the context of the emergency measures taken by the French Government. The amounts corresponding  to  this  reduction  of  compensation  were donated to the Paris public hospitals Foundation (Fondation de l'Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP)). On proposal of the Chief Operating Officer, the Board also cancelled the increase of the cap on his annual variable compensation initially decided.

        "page_content": "2020, the Board of Directors decided as of April/uni00A02020 to maintain  the  retained  quantifiable  objectives  that  had been set prior to the Covid-19 crisis but to use a different weighting and to add to the existing qualitative objectives a  fourth  objective  related  to  the  management  of  the Covid-19 pandemic crisis (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.2).\n\nThe Board also decided to implement and approve the main characteristics of the 2020 performance share plan and set the performance criteria of that plan that may benefit Executive corporate officers and certain categories of employees (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.4).\n\nIt  also  decided  to  -partially-  offset  the  impact  of  the Covid-19  pandemic  on  the  achievement  of  the  ROCE criterion for 2020 of certain ongoing long-term compensation plans ( i.e. 2017, 2018 and 2019). This offset, which the Board of Directors deemed necessary in order to ensure the motivation and retention of the beneficiaries of the impacted plans, will only be implemented for the performance share plans (and not for the 2017, 2018 and 2019/uni00A0stock option plans which are also impacted) and will be limited to the impact on operating income recognized in the first half of 2020 only, to ensure that the interests between  the  beneficiaries  and  the  shareholders  that govern the implementation of those plans remain aligned (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.4).\n\nIn a similar move of solidarity as the Executive corporate officers, the Board of Directors also decided to reduce the amount of the compensation to be due to the Directors for the same period as for the Executive corporate officers in  2020,  to  the  benefit  of  charities  with  the  aim  of supporting fragile populations impacted by the pandemic (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.1).\n\nAs  part  of  the  ongoing  development  of  employee shareholders,  the  Board resolved  to  again  offer  its employees  and  former  employees  the  opportunity  to subscribe  to,  under  certain  conditions,  a  share  capital increase reserved for them in 2021, up to a maximum of 5.9/uni00A0million shares, i.e. slightly more than 1% of share capital at a maximum (see Chapter/uni00A07, Section/uni00A02.3).\n\n## Principal activities of the Committees 1.2.3.2 during fiscal year/uni00A02020\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe  Board  has  established  three  Committees  aims  at improving its operations and effectively contributing to the preparation of its deliberations: the Audit and Risk Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, which was created on June/uni00A04, 2020, date on which the Strategy and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Committee  was dissolved.  The  creation  of  such  an ad  hoc specialized Committee was justified as regards to the importance of Corporate  Social  Responsibility  for  the  Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nThese Committees do not have their own decision-making authority  (barring  specific  provision  otherwise  provided for  by  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as regards  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee's  approval  of non-audit  services  assigned  to  the  Statutory  Auditors), and  report  to  the  Board  regarding  their  activities, conclusions and proposals.\n\nThe Board's internal rules incorporate the rules governing the composition, prerogatives and responsibilities of each Committee, as described below.\n\nThe  activities  of  these  three  Committees  during  fiscal year/uni00A02020 were regularly presented to the Board in the form of activity reports and proposals.\n\n## Composition of Committees\n\nThe Board's practice is to allow some time for all new Directors  to  adapt  before  proposing  them  to  join  a committee,  since  active  participation  on  a  committee requires  familiarity  with  the  operation  of  the  Board  of Directors and its committees, and the ability to understand the major challenges with which the Company is faced.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  thus considers,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  the  opportunity  to propose to Directors their participation in one of the three Committees,  depending  upon  the  most  appropriate schedule. Further, in its examination of the composition of the  Committees  and  appointment  of  new  Directors  to these Committees, the Board ensures compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code with regard to  the  proportion  of  independent  Directors  on  these Committees.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee\n\n## Composition\n\n/uni00A0\n\nChairman\n\nPhilippe/uni00A0Varin\n\nMembers\n\nPamela Knapp\n\nAgn\u00e8s/uni00A0Lemarchand\n\nGilles/uni00A0Schnepp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt February/uni00A01, 2021, all of the members of the Audit and Risk  Committee  (100%),  including  its  Chairman,  were independent Directors. No Executive Directors sit on the Committee.\n\nBy  virtue  of  their  current  or  past  positions  as  finance directors and/or Chief Executive Officers, each Committee member  has  considerable  experience  and  high-level expertise in financial and  accounting  matters  (see biographies in Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.1).

The fourteen Directors in office as of that date were consulted and participated in the Board's assessment process. The Lead Director conducted the self-assessment and reported  the  results  of  this  assessment  by  making proposals to the Board of Directors of November 2020 which  were  discussed  during  an  executive  session  on December/uni00A010,  2020,  also  devoted  to  the  evolution  in Saint-Gobain governance.\n\nThe Lead independent Director, the Chairwoman of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee  and  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  discussed  the effective  contributions  of  each  of  the  Directors  to  the work of the Board with regard to their skills and their respective participation in that work. The  detailed questionnaire  to  which  each  Director  responds,  which concerns the functioning of the Board in particular, allows them, if they wish so, to freely express their assessment of the other Directors' individual contributions. The Directors' individual contributions are also closely examined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and then by the Board, on the occasion of the renewal of the terms of Directors  and  recomposition  of  the  Committees,  as needed.\n\n## General observations\n\nThe  assessment  highlighted  the  satisfaction  of  the Directors,  noting  the  clear  progress  made  over  several years and, in particular, in the context of the implementation  of  the  Transform  &  Grow  plan.  This positive perception is therefore confirmed.\n\nThe  Directors  are  unanimously  of  the  opinion  that  the dynamics of the Board, characterized by the interaction of the  Directors  in  the  decision-making  process  for  all matters  within  their  remit,  and  with  the  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, as well as the performance of the Board, characterized by the quality of the decisions taken, are absolutely satisfactory.\n\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Board operates well,  that  it  is  independent,  competent  with  a  high proportion of Directors with general management experience, is balanced and diverse in its composition, and addresses all topics within its remit. They highlighted the real  implication  of  the  Board  in  the  discussion  and approval of the strategy which was materialized by the active role into the strategic repositioning appreciated by all  the  Directors.  They  are  satisfied  with  the  relevance, quality, transparency and clarity of the information made available to them for the performance of their duties, with regard  in  particular to the implementation  of  the Saint-Gobain Group's Transform & Grow  program, evolution  in  the  share  price  or  the  monitoring  of  the financial performance.\n\nManagement's responsiveness to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the information and involvement of the Board in the management of this crisis and the implementation of measures  during  the  first  half  of  2020  to  preserve employee health and safety, business continuity and the consolidation of the Group's liquidity were also praised.\n\nThe Directors also praised the seminar devoted to climate change and would like them to continue.\n\nThey noted the constructiveness of dialogue, despite the holding of remote meetings in 2020 due to the health situation, and the freedom of discussion within the Board and  with  senior  management,  in  particular  Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de/uni00A0Chalendar and  Benoit  Bazin,  whose availability, the transparent operation of the Board, and the availability of executives is praised.\n\nThe  Directors  stressed  the  very  good  acclimation  and development of Mr. Benoit Bazin in his role and the quality of his contribution to the discussions within the Board of Directors. In particular, Mr. Benoit Bazin has demonstrated his ability to lead the Group alongside the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in times of crisis, with a clear vision of  risks  and  operational  priorities  and  his  clear  and mobilizing messages transmitted within the organization. The effective and balanced relationship between Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de/uni00A0Chalendar  and  Benoit  Bazin  was  also emphasized.\n\nThey  also  emphasized  the  effective  contribution  of  the employee  Directors  and  the  effective  operation  and quality of the work of the Board Committees.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board's  size  has  been  progressively  reduced,  from 18/uni00A0members in December/uni00A02014 due to the incorporation of two Employee Directors whose appointment was required by law, to 17/uni00A0members after the 2015 General Shareholders' Meeting, 16/uni00A0members after the 2016 General Shareholders'  Meeting,  then  14/uni00A0members  since  the  2017 General Shareholders' Meeting (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.1.4). It is now considered adequate.\n\nAs part of the assessment of the Board carried out during 2020, the expertise and experience of the Directors were deemed varied and complementary, in terms of knowledge of the industry and the Group's Businesses and in terms  of  innovation/digital,  which  are  now  well represented with Mrs. Sibylle Daunis and Mrs. Dominique Leroy, management, strategy, finance, governance and/or Corporate Social Responsibility knowledge.\n\nThe  Directors  believed  that  it  would  be  desirable,  for future  recruitments,  to  prioritize  two  search  criteria, namely:\n\n- a Director with a background in the construction, public /uni25A0 works  or  housing  value  chain  or  with  expertise  in Corporate  Social  Responsibility  or  innovation  and involved in the rejuvenation of the Board; or\n- an  Executive  Director  who  hold  office  or  have  such /uni25A0 experience  in  other  major  groups,  to  maintain  the proportion of Executive Directors on the Board.\n\nIt is considered  desirable,  despite  the  international experience  of  the  majority  of  the  Board  members,  to increase  the  proportion  of  foreign  nationals  or  profiles with operational experience in a high growth region for the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Lead independent Director are unanimously considered adequate. The Directors believe that his work complements the work of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee's very well. The personality of the Lead independent Director and his discreet and efficient  mode  of  operation  are  appreciated  and  the quality of his work has been noted, as well as his role with investors.",

More specifically, they concerned the  strengthening  of  digital/e-commerce  skills  with  the co-optation  of  Mrs.  Sibylle  Daunis  and  the  continued deepening of the following topics: climate change and its strategic impact, value creation, stock price trends, as well as the regular monitoring of the implementation of the Transform  &  Grow  plan,  and  potential  or  ongoing acquisitions and disposals.\n\nIn  order  to  sustain  progress,  the  Board  adopted  the following  conclusions  on  the  proposal  of  the  Lead independent Director, resulting from the assessment:\n\n- for  future  recruitments,  look  for  a  profile  with  a /uni25A0 background  in  the  construction,  public  works  or housing  value  chain  or  with  expertise  in  Corporate Social Responsibility or innovation and younger than the average age of the Board, or an Executive Director who  holds  office  or  have  such  experience  in  other major  groups.  It  is  also  desirable  to  increase  the proportion of foreign nationals or profiles with operational experience in a high growth region for the Saint-Gobain Group;\n- implement the Group's future governance; /uni25A0\n- continue  to  examine  the  following  topics  in  greater /uni25A0 detail: climate change and its strategic impact, value creation, stock price trends (including environmental, social  and  governance  impact),  innovation,  growth levers;\n- regularly monitor the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic /uni25A0 on the Group and its strategy;\n- regularly monitor the implementation of the Transform /uni25A0 & Grow plan, and potential or ongoing acquisitions and disposals, cost savings and growth progress;\n- continue the practice of executive sessions; /uni25A0\n- organize  training  sessions  on  topics  of  interest  to /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain's activities (such as biodiversity).\n\n## Directors' induction process 1.2.5\n\nThe Board of Directors meets once a year at one of the Group's  plants  or  research  centers.  Given  the  health situation, the visit by the Board  of  Directors  of Saint-Gobain Recherche Provence in Cavaillon, scheduled for May/uni00A02020, had to be canceled.\n\nEach new Director may ask for training on the topic of his or  her  choice  and  visit  the  Group's  plants,  distribution facilities or research centers. In this context, new Directors may also visit various industrial or Building Distribution sites, and any Director may, at his or her request, meet with members of the Executive Committee (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A04.2).\n\nFurther,  employee  Directors  benefit  from  the  law  on supplementary training, the content of which is set every year by the Board of Directors, after consultation of such Employee Directors.\n\n5",

The operational  organization  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group's Management  is  provided  by  an  Executive  Committee chaired by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A04.2).\n\n## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSince the combination of the offices of Chief Executive Officer of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain with Chairman of the Board of Directors on June/uni00A03, 2010, the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been held by Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar, whose term as Director was renewed by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2018 (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.1).\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest authority to act under all circumstances on behalf of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain within the scope of its corporate purpose and subject to the limits set by law, the bylaws and/or internal rules of the Board of Directors (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2 and Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1). On the balance of powers within the Board of Directors to ensure proper compliance with the rules of governance, see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.1.\n\n## Chief Operating Officer\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  November/uni00A022,  2018,  the  Board  of Directors,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer and  the  recommendation  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, appointed Mr. Benoit Bazin as Chief Operating Officer effective January/uni00A01, 2019.

He was also a Director and member of the Audit and Risk Committee of Essilor between 2009 and 2017, and Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee from May/uni00A02016 to March/uni00A02017.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer is subject to the same power limitations as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (See Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.2 and Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1).\n\nNote: the Board of Directors decided, in its meeting of February/uni00A025, 2021, that, in the context of the succession of Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de/uni00A0Chalendar,  to  ensure  a  seamless transition,  to  separate  the  roles  of  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  as  from  July/uni00A01, 2021  between  Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Mr. Benoit Bazin and, as from this date, Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors, while Mr. Benoit  Bazin  will  be  Chief  Executive  Officer  as  sole Executive corporate officer (see Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.1).\n\n## Executive Committee 1.3.2\n\nAs part of the transformation of the Saint-Gobain Group announced on November/uni00A026, 2018, the General Management  Committee  was  replaced  as  of  January/uni00A01, 2019 by an Executive Committee. This Committee, whose composition reflects the new organizational structure of the  Saint-Gobain  Group,  comprises  16/uni00A0members  as  of January/uni00A01, 2021 (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A02). In addition to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating  Officer,  the  main  operational  and  functional managers of the Saint-Gobain Group are members (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A03).\n\nThe  mission  of  the  Executive  Committee  is  to  review operational management, coordinate project management and  implement  Saint-Gobain  Group  strategy.

They also ensure that it evolves taking into account the Group's performance and market practices.\n\nThe  compensation  package  of  the  Executive  corporate officers  is  determined  by  taking  into  account  all  pay components (fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, multi-year variable compensation, compensation for loss of office and pension benefits), with a view to achieving a balanced mix of these components.\n\nWhen setting the various components of the compensation  of  the  Executive  corporate  officers,  the Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into  consideration  the benchmarks of CAC/uni00A040 companies comparable to Saint-Gobain in terms of sales, workforce and international scope of operations.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  seeks  to  ensure  that  the granting  of  long-term  compensation  instruments  (stock options, performance shares and performance units, as the case  may  be)  to  the  Executive  corporate  officers  in  a given fiscal year does not represent a disproportionate share of their maximum total compensation in respect of that  fiscal  year  and  has  conditioned  these  grants  to demanding ceiling and holding rules.\n\n## Compensation and benefits allocated to the Executive corporate officers 2.2.2\n\n## Summary of the compensation and benefits paid or granted to the Executive corporate officers 2.2.2.1 for the 2020 fiscal year\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principles  set  out  above,  the compensation  policies  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer for 2020 were approved by the Board of Directors at its meetings of  November/uni00A021,  2019,  February/uni00A027,  2020  and  April/uni00A023, 2020, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese policies were approved by the General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June/uni00A04,  2020  (eleventh  and twelfth Resolutions).\n\nAs  a  reminder,  in  March/uni00A02020,  Messrs.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar  and  Benoit  Bazin  wished  to  show  their solidarity  with  the  efforts  being  made  by  the  Group's employees and stakeholders impacted by this unprecedented crisis. As a consequence, they informed the Board of Directors of their decision to waive 25% of their compensation to be paid in 2020, i.e. 25% of their variable compensation due in respect of the 2019 fiscal year/uni00A0-/uni00A0to be paid after the approval of the June/uni00A04, 2020, General Shareholders' Meeting/uni00A0-/uni00A0and 25% of their fixed compensation  to  be  paid  in  2020,  for  as  long  as  the Group's employees would be subject to partial employment in the context of the emergency measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Benoit Bazin also informed the Board of Directors of his decision to waive, in respect of the 2020 fiscal year, the increase of the cap on his annual variable compensation from 120% (in 2019) to 150% of his fixed compensation that the Board had initially decided.\n\nThe  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  and  the Board of Directors have acknowledged these decisions in their April/uni00A022, 2020  and  April/uni00A023, 2020  respective meetings  and  unanimously  praised  it.  On  proposal  of Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Benoit Bazin, the Board  of  Directors  decided  to  review  and  reduce accordingly their fixed compensation for 2020 (and, as a reminder,  their  variable  annual  compensation  due  in respect of 2019), and, on proposal of Mr. Benoit Bazin, that the cap for the annual variable compensation of the Chief Operating Officer to remain set, as in the 2019 fiscal year, at 120% of his fixed compensation, excluding for the fixed compensation  any  exceptional  reduction  applied  in connection with the coronavirus, i.e. 750,000 euros.\n\nSince partial employment under the emergency measures taken by the Government ceased on June/uni00A030, 2020, the fixed and variable compensation granted to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Chalendar for 2020, taking into account the reductions in the context of the Covid-crisis, amounted to 2,395,850 euros (excluding the reduction, it would have amounted to 2,483,350 euros) and to 2,624,584 euros for 2019 (excluding the reduction, it would have amounted to 2,736,630  euros),  i.e.  a  total  compensation  (fixed  and variable compensation, performance shares and benefits in kind) of 4,579,187 euros for 2020 (excluding the reduction, it would have amounted to 4,666,687 euros) and 4,431,524 euros  for  2019  (excluding  the  reduction,  it  would  have amounted  to  4,543,570  euros).  The  reductions  in  Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar's compensation for 2019 and 2020  therefore  amounted  to  almost  200,000  euros. Excluding the reduction in the variable compensation for 2019 decided by the Board of Directors due to Covid-19, the  change  in  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar's  total compensation between 2019 and 2020 would have been of 0.8%.\n\nThe fixed and variable compensation granted to Mr. Benoit Bazin for 2020, taking into account the reductions in the context of the Covid-crisis, amounted to 1,261,496 euros (excluding  the  reduction,  it  would  have  amounted  to 1,457,730 euros) and  to  1,378,493  euros  for  2019 (excluding  the  reduction,  it  would  have  amounted  to 1,427,925  euros),  i.e.  a  total  compensation  (fixed  and variable compensation, performance shares and benefits in kind) of 2,656,207  euros  for  2020  (excluding  the reduction, it would have amounted to 2,852,441 euros) and 2,281,882 euros for 2019 (excluding the reduction, it would have amounted to 2,331,314 euros). The reductions in Mr. Benoit Bazin 's compensation for 2019 and 2020 therefore amounted  to  almost  245,000  euros.  Excluding  the reduction in the variable compensation for 2019 decided by the Board of Directors due to Covid-19, the change in the Chief Operating Officer's total compensation between 2019 and 2020 would have been of 13.9%, without taking into account the cancellation of the increase in the cap of the  variable  compensation  from  120%  to  150%  initially decided by the Board of Directors in February 2020.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nManagement and Directors compensation\n\nThe total amount corresponding to the reductions in the compensation of the Executive corporate officers related to  the  Covid  crisis,  i.e.  \u20ac445,000,  was  donated  by Saint-Gobain  to  the  Paris  public  hospitals  Foundation (Fondation de l'Assistance Publique- - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP)).\n\nThe  following  tables  present  a  summary  of  the  total compensation,  stock  options  and  performance  shares granted to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar, Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  to  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin,  Chief Operating Officer, for the fiscal years ended December/uni00A031, 2019  and  December/uni00A031, 2020.  No  stock  options  or performance  units  were  granted  to  them  in  2019  and 2020.\n\nDespite  the  reductions  in  their  fixed  and  variable compensation  granted  under  the  conditions  described above,  these  tables  show  an  increase  in  the  total compensation of the Executive corporate officers in 2020 compared to 2019, which is mainly related to the value of the performance shares granted:\n\n- fixed  compensation:  decreased  by  7.3%  due  to  the /uni25A0 reduction requested by Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin (see above);\n- variable compensation: /uni25A0\n\nAs mentioned above, by requesting that their compensation  \"paid  in  2020\"  be  reduced,  Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin wanted this reduction to apply not only to their fixed compensation paid  in  2020  but  also  to  their  variable  compensation granted in respect of 2019, which was paid in 2020. As a result  of  the  reduction  in  the  variable  compensation granted for 2019, the difference between the compensation  granted  for  2019  and  the  compensation granted for 2020 was increased by the decided reduction (which amounts to 112,046 euros for Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar).  Excluding  this  reduction  of  the  variable remuneration granted for 2019, the increase in 2020 of the total  compensation  of  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar granted  for  2020  compared  to  that  granted  for  2019 (increase amounting to 147,663 euros) would have been of 35,617 euros.\n\nNotwithstanding  this  factor,  the  variable  compensation granted to Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin for 2020 has decreased substantially compared to 2019: it is down by 9.9% (16.5% if calculated excluding the reduction  in  their  variable  granted  for  2019  that  was decided as a result of the Covid-19 crisis). The reduction in the variable compensation granted for 2020 is linked to the rate of achievement of their quantifiable objectives (see table below) which account for 2/3 of the variable part: Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin informed the Nomination and Remuneration Committee at its meeting held in February 2021 of their wish that the Board does not amend these quantifiable objectives, even though they had been defined on the basis of a pre-crisis\n\nbudget for Covid-19, and had therefore become - given the radical impact of this crisis - totally unattainable in terms of operating income and recurring net income.\n\nMr.  Benoit  Bazin's  decision  to  waive  in  April  2020,  in respect of the 2020 fiscal year, the increase of the cap on his annual variable compensation from 120% to 150% of his fixed compensation that the Board had initially decided (see above) also represented a reduction of 141,000 euros in his variable part granted for 2020;\n\n- performance  shares  granted:  their  value  increased, /uni25A0 mainly due to the increase of the Saint-Gobain share price in 2020, which also benefited to all Saint-Gobain shareholders.\n\nThe  Board  has  historically  chosen  not  to  adjust  the number of shares granted to Executive corporate officers according to the share price at the grant date, considering that granting more shares when the share price falls was difficult  to  justify  and  could  create  windfall  effects. Similarly, granting fewer shares when the share price rises does not ensure the desired alignment between shareholders and Executive corporate officers.\n\nFor an equal number of shares, the increase in the IFRS value of the performance shares between the grant dates -November  2019  and  November  2020  -  is  mainly explained by the increase of the Saint-Gobain share price over this period, both in absolute terms and relative to the CAC  40  index.  Thus,  although  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar's performance shares grant remained constant in terms of number of shares granted in 2020 compared to 2019, in terms of IFRS value, it increased by almost 20%. For Mr. Bazin, the increase - in November 2020 - of his performance share allocation, in view of the excellent work done during the crisis and the recovery of Saint-Gobain and its share price in the second half of 2020, as well as his exemplary remuneration at the height of the Covid crisis in the spring of 2020 - is 28% in terms of number of shares granted and almost 50% in terms of value, taking into account the increase in the IFRS value.\n\nThis does not refer to compensation paid or to be paid but to  the  valuation  of  performance  shares  allocated  in November 2020, the number of which that will effectively be  acquired  will  depend  on  the  achievement  of  the performance conditions to be assessed over 4 years, and which cannot be sold before the end of this vesting period and at a value that will depend on the share price at that date (this valuation is established in accordance with IFRS standards - with the help of a bank with regard to the stock market criterion - and verified by the auditors).\n\nThus, the increase in the total compensation of Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Benoit Bazin between 2019 and 2020, even though they have decided to substantially reduce their compensation paid in 2020 (fixed 2020 and variable for 2019), is mainly due to the increase of the Saint-Gobain  share  price,  which  also  benefited  to  all shareholders.",

It is expressed as a percentage of the annual fixed compensation.\n\n- At its meeting of February/uni00A027, 2020, on the recommendation  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee, the Board decided to maintain the cap for Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de/uni00A0Chalendar's  variable  compensation  for 2020,  at  170%  of  his  annual  fixed  compensation  (cap unchanged since 2014).\n\nAt the same meeting, the Board of Directors had decided, on  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee,  to  increase  the  cap  on  the  annual  variable compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin, Chief Operating Officer, from 120% to 150% of his fixed compensation. The Board of Directors noted the successful implementation by Mr. Benoit Bazin of the Transform & Grow plan/uni00A0-/uni00A0the targets set  having  been  satisfied  or  even  exceeded/uni00A0-/uni00A0and  the efficient  and  sustainable  implementation  of  the  new organization. This level of annual variable compensation was  at  the  median  of  the  benchmark  of  similar  large companies in terms of sales, workforce and international scope  of  operations.  In  the  context  of  the  coronavirus pandemic,  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  informed  the  Board  of Directors of his decision to also waive, in respect of the 2020 fiscal year, the increase of the cap on his annual variable compensation from 120% (in 2019) to 150% of his fixed compensation that the Board had initially decided. The  Board  and  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee have acknowledged this decision and unanimously  praised  it.  The  Board  of  Directors  has decided, accordingly, that the cap for the annual variable compensation of the Chief Operating Officer in respect of the 2020 fiscal year would therefore remain set at 120% of\n\nhis fixed compensation, excluding for the fixed compensation  any  exceptional  reduction  applied  in connection with the coronavirus, i.e. \u20ac750,000.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  fixed  at  its  meeting  of  April/uni00A023, 2020, in view of the priority actions to be carried out in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic crisis for 2020 in terms of liquidity and cash management, on the proposal of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the components and objectives of the variable compensation of Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Benoit Bazin for 2020 as follows (structure unchanged for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2014 and for the Chief Operating Officer since

In particular and beyond expectations given the unusual context, the following transactions were carried out:\n- the sale, in May/uni00A02020, of its full stake of 10.75% of /uni25A0 Sika's  share  capital,  for  a  total  of  CHF2.56/uni00A0billion which enabled Saint-Gobain to strengthen its balance sheet,  increase  its  financial  flexibility  and  liquidity position  in  a  market  environment  that  remained uncertain at that date;\n- the entry into exclusive negotiations: /uni25A0\n- in November/uni00A02020, with Mutares, listed in Frankfurt, -in view of the sale of Lapeyre;\n- in January/uni00A02021, with BME  (Building Materials -Europe),  in  view  of  the  sale  of  its  distribution activities  in  the  Netherlands;  these  two  sales  are intended to be finalized in 2021 (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2.2);\n- several acquisitions, including the finalization of the /uni25A0 Continental Building Products  acquisition  which integration is progressing faster than anticipated and which results are in line with the expectations despite the health situation (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2.1);\n- very good further implementation of the Transform & /uni25A0 Grow plan:\n- further implementation in several areas, in 2020, of /uni25A0 the new  organization (completion of business mergers, further 'back-office' optimization, launch of growth  initiatives  to  develop  solutions  combining several products, etc.);\n- optimization of the relationships between the central /uni25A0 and local teams to improve growth synergies, innovation or target identification in selected segments (see Chapter/uni00A01, Sections/uni00A03.3. and Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A02.2.2 and 2.2.3);\n- generation, with a year earlier than planned, of the /uni25A0 initial target of cost savings of \u20ac250/uni00A0million, participating  to  the  improvement  of  the  operating margin of the Group in the 2020 second semester (see Chapter/uni00A04, Section 1.5);\n- continuation of the internal communication to share /uni25A0 the  successes  and  promote  good  practices:  the employee satisfaction survey revealed a high level of engagement and recommendation. The new organization, strengthened by the deployment of a new mode of leadership based on trust, empowerment  and  collaboration  (see  Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A03.1.1.)/uni00A0has proved particularly relevant in times of/uni00A0crisis;\n\n- very good further digital transformation of the Group: /uni25A0\n- in 2020, the Group continued to deploy its strategic /uni25A0 priorities, in particular in the 'Industry/uni00A04.0' manufacturing  processes  (e.g.  reduction  of  energy consumption  on  production  lines,  see  Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.3.2.1),  the  use  of  commercial  data  ('big data',  see  Chapter/uni00A02,  Section/uni00A04.1.1.2)  and  logistics optimization;\n- in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, certain digital /uni25A0 tools have rapidly gained momentum (organization of several thousand customer webinars, remote work of 36,000/uni00A0employees, strong increase of e-commerce,  strong  development  of  the  use  of digital applications by factories, etc.);\n- lastly, despite the health crisis, the Group continued /uni25A0 to  recruit  digital  experts,  and  the  DnA  academy ('digital  &  analytics')  has  gained  momentum,  with 700/uni00A0employees  trained  in  the  use  of  data  in  their immediate working environment in industrial production (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.3.2.1);\n- very  good  implementation  of  the  corporate  social /uni25A0 responsibility policy:\n- very  positive  evolution  in  the  frequency  rate  of /uni25A0 accidents with and without work stoppage of more than 24/uni00A0hours (TF2) compared  to  2019  (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A03.2);\n- increase  in  the  representation  of  women  among /uni25A0 managers and executives enabling them to be on the expected  trajectory  of  the  diversity  target  figures (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A03.3);\n- very good rates of Compliance e-learning trainings /uni25A0 on the three priority matters: competition, anti-corruption and embargo, and continuation of the actions of prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A01.4.2);\n- continuation  of  the  implementation  of  the  GDPR /uni25A0 regulation with, in particular, the animation of a 'Data Privacy' network (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A01.3.4), the continuation of the implementation of the personal data management platform (One Trust); the implementation of process to manage GDPR risks in terms of cybersecurity and mergers and acquisitions and development of an e-learning;\n- identification of 2030/uni00A0targets in the context of the /uni25A0 CO2  roadmap  towards  carbon  neutrality  by  2050: the  2030/uni00A0roadmap  was  proposed  to  the  Board  of Directors  in  September/uni00A02020,  the  carbon  targets were  then  validated  by  the  Science  Based  Target Initiative in October/uni00A02020 and published in November/uni00A02020 (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A04.1);",

        "page_content": "- excellent management of the Covid-19 crisis: /uni25A0\n- setting  up  as  from  March/uni00A015,  2020  of  a  crisis /uni25A0 management  unit  with  frequent  meetings  of  the Executive Committee, opened to specialists, in order to share best practices and regular meetings of the Board  of  Directors  to  make  progress  reports (Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.3.1);\n- extensive  social  dialogue,  country  by  country  and /uni25A0 also at European level, which enabled the set-up of actions  to  protect  the  health  of  employees  and stakeholders as close as possible to the ground;\n- rapid measures to strengthen the Group's financing /uni25A0 sources and preserve cash (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A03.2 and Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.3.1);\n- numerous solidarity actions (donations of masks and /uni25A0 equipment, financial donations to the Fondation de l'Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux  de  Paris  and  to charitable organizations of the sums corresponding to  reductions  of  the  compensations  of  Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Benoit Bazin and the Directors) (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A03.2 and Chapter/uni00A05, Sections/uni00A02.1 and 2.2).\n\nIn all, Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar's total compensation (fixed  and  variable)  for  fiscal  year/uni00A02020  amounted  to \u20ac2,395,850,  a  decrease  of  12.5%  compared  to  2019 (pre-reduction  due  to  the  Covid-19).  As  a  reminder,  the annual  variable  compensation  paid  in  2020  for  fiscal year/uni00A02019 to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar for his mandate as  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  amounted  to \u20ac1,424,584,  as  approved  by  the  Ordinary  Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A04, 2020 (eighth Resolution). Excluding any reduction, it would have amounted to \u20ac1,536,630.\n\nIn total, for the fiscal year/uni00A02020, the total compensation (fixed  and  variable)  of  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  amounted  to \u20ac1,261,496, a decrease  of  11.7%  compared  to  2019 (pre-reduction due to the Covid-19). As a reminder, the annual  variable  compensation  paid  in  2020  for  fiscal year/uni00A02019 to  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  for  his  term  as  Chief Operating Officer amounted, after reduction, to \u20ac628,493 as  approved  by  the  Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June/uni00A04, 2020 (ninth Resolution). Excluding any reduction, it would have amounted to \u20ac677,925.\n\nAssuming that the cap on the annual variable portion of Mr. Benoit Bazin's compensation for fiscal year 2020 had been increased to 150% as initially decided by the Board, Mr. Benoit Bazin would have received an annual variable compensation for that fiscal year in the amount of 707,730 euros. The  difference  between  the  variable  annual compensation  due  for  the  2020  fiscal  year  and  this theoretical variable annual compensation with a cap set at 150% of the fixed annual compensation, i.e. approximately 140,000 euros, was donated by Saint-Gobain to the Paris public  hospitals  Foundation  ( Fondation  de  l'Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) ).\n\n## Long-term remuneration policy\n\n## Cap on the executive corporate officer's grants relative to their total compensation\n\nIn addition to the restrictions set out below, the Board of Directors resolved, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  that  at  the  time  they  would  be  granted  to  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating\n\nOfficer,  the  2020/uni00A0grants  of  stock  options,  performance shares and performance units could not represent a value (according to IFRS standards) greater than 85% of the Executive corporate officers' total gross maximum compensation for the same year (fixed compensation plus maximum variable compensation for the same year), as in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, performance shares granted to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer amounted to a total value (according to IFRS standards), at the time of their grant, of \u20ac2,179,664 and \u20ac1,392,563 corresponding to 67.3% and 84.4% respectively of their 2020/uni00A0total maximum gross compensation. As regards the Chief Operating Officer, this percentage would have been 74.3%  without  the  decrease  of  the  cap  on  his  annual variable  compensation  from  150%  to  120%  of  his  fixed compensation,  on  his  proposal,  in  the  context  of  the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nNo stock option or performance unit plan was implemented in 2020.\n\n## Cap on the executive corporate officer's grants relative to the overall allocation envelope\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February/uni00A027,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors decided, as in previous years, that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer could not receive more than 10% and 5% respectively of the overall grants of performance shares and performance units under long-term compensation plans to be set up in 2020.\n\n## Hedging rules\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief Operating Officer formally committed not to hedge their risk either on stock options or on shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, on performance shares or on performance  units  they  have  been  or  will  be  granted during their term of office as Executive corporate officers, until  the  cessation  of  their  duties.  To  the  best  of  the Company's knowledge, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer have not hedged their risk.\n\n## Closed periods\n\nIn their capacity as Executive corporate officers and by virtue  of  the  applicable  regulations  as  reminded  in  the Board's internal rules (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A01.1.2), Messrs. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Benoit Bazin must refrain from  carrying  out  any  transactions  on  Saint-Gobain securities for thirty days prior to Board meetings during which the annual consolidated financial statements and the half-year consolidated financial statements are examined, for fifteen days prior to the release of quarterly consolidated sales and on the day following the release of the  full  and  half-year  results.  Outside  of  these  periods, they are also required, as are the other Directors, to abide by the provisions on the prevention of insider trading.\n\n## Stock options\n\nThe tables below present the stock options exercised by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer during the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nNo stock option plan was implemented in 2020.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nManagement and Directors compensation\n\nThe  difference  between  the  ratios  on  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain's  average  compensation  and  on  average compensation in France is mainly due to the distribution structure of the employees in the scopes concerned: thus, while in 2020, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain comprised 82% of  managers  (including  all  members  of  the  Executive Committee of the Saint-Gobain Group except those based in a foreign country) and 18% of administrative employees, the French scope comprised 22% of managers, 52% of administrative employees and 26% of blue-collar workers.\n\n## Method used to calculate compensation ratios\n\nTo  calculate  the  compensation  ratios  presented  above, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain referred to the guidelines on compensation  multiples  published  by  the  AFEP  on January/uni00A028, 2020. The compensation components and the methodology selected are shown below.\n\n## Compensation components selected\n\nFor Executive corporate officers: all compensation paid or awarded  during  or  for  the  fiscal  year  in  question, submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting (Say on Pay ex post ) (1) , namely:\n\n- the  fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  given  fiscal /uni25A0 year;\n- the annual variable compensation granted in respect of /uni25A0 the same fiscal year;\n- any  exceptional  compensation  paid  during  the  same /uni25A0 fiscal year;\n- long-term compensation instruments granted during /uni25A0 the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- benefits in kind (company car) granted during the same /uni25A0 fiscal year (book value);\n- it being specified that Executive corporate officers are /uni25A0 not  granted  any  compensation  in  respect  of  their Directors' term of office within the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\n## For employees:\n\n- the fixed gross compensation paid during the given /uni25A0 fiscal year;\n- for reasons of information availability on the publication /uni25A0 date of the Universal Registration Document, the annual gross variable (annual bonus, profit-sharing, incentive schemes, payments into the Group savings account, as applicable) and exceptional (premiums) compensation paid during the same fiscal year;\n- long-term  compensation  instruments  granted  during /uni25A0 the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- benefits  in  kind  granted  during  the  same  fiscal  year /uni25A0 (book value);\n- to ensure consistency with the compensation /uni25A0 components paid to the Executive corporate officers, termination of office indemnities are not included.\n- (1) See this Chapter 5, Sections 2.2.3.1 and 2.2.3.2 for further details concerning the gross amount paid or granted during the 2020 financial year to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\n\n## Employees taken into account\n\nOnly the employees who have entered into an indefinite or fixed-term  employment  contract  with  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain or a consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France and who have been  continuously  employed  in  these  companies  from January/uni00A01 to December/uni00A031 of the fiscal year in question were taken into account when calculating the ratios. The employees who have entered into a part-time employment contract with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain or a consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France were not taken into account when calculating the ratios but represent less than 3% of the workforce on the considered perimeter.\n\n## Concept of full time equivalent\n\nTo determine the average and median compensation paid to  employees  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  the consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group registered in France on a full-time equivalent basis, the methodologies already in use within the Group for the employee  data reporting  reviewed by  the  independent third party in charge of reviewing extrafinancial information were used (see Chapter/uni00A09, Section/uni00A02.1).\n\n## Changes in scope\n\nWithin the French perimeter, the consolidated companies sold during a given fiscal year are excluded from the ratios calculations of that fiscal year. The acquired companies which  were  in  the  process  of  being  consolidated  on December/uni00A031, 2020 are excluded from the ratios calculations, but represent less than 1% of the total number of  employees  of  the  consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France.\n\n## Covid-19 effect on the calculation of compensation ratios\n\nThe  compensation  of  Executive  corporate  officers  for fiscal  years/uni00A02019  and  2020  taken  into  account  for  the calculation of the compensation ratios for 2019 and 2020 were impacted by the reductions of 25% of their fixed compensation  for  2020  and  25%  of  their  variable compensation for 2019 (see above) decided by the Board of Directors for as long as the Group's employees were subject  to  partial  employment  in  the  context  of  the emergency measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCompensation  paid  by  the  French  State  in  2020  to employees  of  Saint-Gobain  Group  entities  subject  to partial  employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic are taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation ratios for 2020  as  if  that  compensation  had  been  paid  by  the Saint-Gobain Group.",

It is determined and reviewed, among other things, based on the results of specific surveys from specialized consultants commissioned by Group's Senior Management.\n\nIn  addition  to  a  fixed  portion,  it  consists  of  a  variable compensation  set  at  a  reasonable  proportion  of  total compensation,  the  purpose  of  which  is  to  reflect  the manager's  personal  contribution  to  the  Group's  growth and results.\n\nThis principle has now been extended to all managerial staff.  The  performance  objectives  used  are  based  on financial indicators such as Return On Investment (ROI) and  Return  On  Capital  Employed  (ROCE),  as  well  as personal objectives such as developing a certain type of business or entering a new geographic market. Most often, a safety indicator is also applied.\n\nIn this way, management compensation is clearly linked to performance and to the achievement of objectives that promotes  a  high  level  of  personal  commitment.  Each manager's compensation can fluctuate significantly from one year to the next, based on the results achieved.\n\nTotal  gross  compensation  received  in  2020  from  the Group's French and foreign companies by members of the Executive Committee as composed at December/uni00A031, 2020 (excluding the Executive corporate officers and excluding long-term  compensation  components),  amounted  to \u20ac9.5/uni00A0million (versus \u20ac7.9/uni00A0million in 2019), including \u20ac3.2/uni00A0million  (versus  \u20ac2.2/uni00A0million  in  2019)  gross  variable compensation in respect of 2019, an increase compared to the gross variable compensation in respect of 2018. No termination benefits were received by the members of the Executive Committee as composed on December/uni00A031, 2020 (same as in 2019).\n\nPensions  and  other  post-employment  benefits  (Defined Benefit Obligations in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to the members of the Executive Committee as composed at December/uni00A031, 2020 (including the Executive corporate officers) totaled \u20ac46.3/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020 (versus \u20ac41.5/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nCompensation  allocated  to  Directors  representing  the Group (particularly members of Group's Senior Management) in Group companies other than Compagnie de  Saint-Gobain  are  either  reverted  to  their  employer company, or paid directly to that company.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, senior managers, whether  or  not  members  of  the  Executive  Committee, were invited to follow on a voluntary basis the solidarity initiative initiated by Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de/uni00A0Chalendar and Mr. Benoit Bazin, by donating the corresponding reduction of compensation they would have suffered, should they had been placed under partial employment measures in France, for the period during which the Group's employees had been partially employed in the context of the emergency measures taken by the French Government to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, each country CEO, depending on the modalities, rules and efforts that may be required in their different countries, was invited to reflect on how to implement a mechanism  that  would  show  the  solidarity  of  senior managers at these critical moments; this resulted in local initiatives, on  a  voluntary  basis,  which  were  widely deployed within the Group.\n\nThe amounts shown above do not take into account all these voluntary initiatives.\n\n## Long-term compensation plans (performance shares, 2.4 stock options and performance units)\n\n## Allocation policy 2.4.1\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Group's  long-term  Compensation policy is to retain and motivate Group's Senior Management,  officers  and  employees,  and  to  associate them with the Group's performance, in particular through conditional  allocations  of  performance  shares,  stock options or performance units to reflect their fulfillment of the Group's long-term strategy.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors authorizes  the  features  of  the  performance  share  and stock  option  plans,  as  well  as  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries, and, in the past, approved the principle of long-term compensation plans in the form of performance units to be implemented, if need be, by the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer.  These  plans  are  subject  to  a service condition and to the strict internal and/or relative performance  criteria  set  by  the  Board  (see  below  for details of each allocation).\n\nIn 2020, it was decided, as in 2019, to only implement a performance share plan. This plan applied to 2,311 of the Group's managers and officers, in France and overseas: managers with outstanding performance and high-potential managers (2,248), the main functional and operational  heads  of  the  Entities  and  Regions  (49), Executive Committee  (14)  (excluding  the  executive corporate  officers).  Grants  to  the  Executive  corporate officers are detailed in the paragraph  'Long-term remuneration policy' in Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A02.2.2.2.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  of  this  plan  are  of  55  different nationalities and work in 65/uni00A0countries.\n\nThe  performance  share  plan  entitles  beneficiaries  to existing shares and therefore has no impact in terms of dilution. No stock option or performance unit plan was set up during fiscal year/uni00A02020.\n\nThe other instruments designed to associate employees with business results are presented in Chapter/uni00A07, Section/uni00A02.3 and Chapter/uni00A04, Section/uni00A02.4.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nManagement and Directors compensation\n\n## Consideration of the impact 2.4.2 of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis\n\nIn the exceptional circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and in light of the structure of the long-term compensation plans (performance condition appreciated over a three-year period and importance of the operating income  through  the  high  weighting  -70%  or  65% depending  on  the  plan  -  of  the  ROCE  criterion),  the decrease in the Group's operating income in 2020 due to the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic would have had a very significant impact on the long-term compensation plans  implemented  in  2017,  2018  and  2019.  Indeed,  the operating result for the first half of 2020 amounted to 827 million euros, which represented a decrease of 811 million euros (or -49.5%) compared to the operating result for the first half  of  2019,  which  amounted  to  1,638  million. Furthermore,  the  beneficiaries  concerned  (almost  2,200 Group  employees)  have  seen  a  sharp  decrease  in  the other components of their compensation tied to earnings figures  (in  particular  the  operating  income)  or  due  to solidarity measures.\n\nAs permitted by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code in exceptional circumstances, and pursuant to the plans which grant the Board of Directors powers to adjust targets  in  the  event  of  such  exceptional  circumstances justifying so, the Board recognized the need to offset - at least partially -the significant impact of this unprecedented  global  event  of  an  exceptional  scale  in order to ensure:\n\n- the motivation and retention of the beneficiaries of the /uni25A0 affected plans; and\n- that  the  interests  of  the  beneficiaries  and  those  of /uni25A0 shareholders remain aligned (since the ROCE criterion could be met and had no further effect),\n\nwhich are the key goals of the long term incentive plans. In view of the objectives pursued (motivation, retention and alignment)  and  the  wish  to  keep  an  alea  on  the achievement of the criterion in the second half of 2020, the Board of Directors considered it necessary to take this decision during the year.\n\nThe Board of Directors has taken into account the fact that on average over the past five years, Saint-Gobain has been in the lower quartile of CAC/uni00A040 companies in terms of its effective burn rate, i.e. , the number of performance shares that vest after applying the performance conditions (1) . The Board chose only to partially offset the impacts of the pandemic for the performance share plans - which concern over 2,000/uni00A0employees - but not for the stock  option  plans  for  2017,  2018  or  2019,  which  are nonetheless also severely impacted.\n\nActing on proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and in order to maintain a contingency with respect to the achievement of the ROCE criterion over full-year/uni00A02020, the Board of Directors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain,  at  its  meeting  on  September/uni00A024,  2020, decided:\n\n- to -partiallyoffset the impact  of  the  Covid-19 /uni25A0 pandemic  on  the  operating  income  for  2020  by excluding the impact recognized in the first half of the year/uni00A02020 only;\n- to this end, increase the 2020 operating income taken /uni25A0 into account in the numerator in the calculation of the 2020/uni00A0ROCE by \u20ac785/uni00A0million, an amount lower than the recognized  difference  of  \u20ac811/uni00A0million between  the actual operating income for the first half of 2019 and that of 2020 ; corresponding to the estimated negative impact  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  on  the  operating income for the first half of 2020.\n\nThe  Board  therefore  maintained  the  challenging  aspect and  seriousness  of  the  ROCE  criterion  by  allowing  the uncertainties  of  the  second  half  of  the  year/uni00A02020  to remain.\n\nSubject to the above, it should be noted that no changes were  made  to  the  affected  plans  (2017,  2018,  and 2019/uni00A0plans).\n\n## Performance Share Plans 2.4.3\n\nPerformance share plans have been set up by the Board of Directors every year since 2009.\n\nUnder  the  authorization  granted  by  the  twenty-fourth Resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A06, 2019, at its meeting of November/uni00A026, 2020 the Board of Directors resolved to implement a performance share plan, following analysis and  the  recommendation  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThis plan covers 2,313/uni00A0managers and officers of the Group in  France  and  abroad,  who  were  granted  a  total  of 1,268,295 performance shares (including the grant to the Executive corporate officers).\n\nIt should be noted that, as in 2019, no stock option plans or performance units were put in place in 2020, as all beneficiaries received performance shares.\n\nThe duration of the vesting period was set at four years, with delivery of the shares to occur on the fourth day after the close of this period.\n\nThe performance criteria applicable to the performance share plan implemented on November/uni00A026, 2020 include, as has  been  the  case  since  2015,  an  internal  performance condition linked to Saint-Gobain Group's Return on Capital Employed, including goodwill, and a relative performance condition linked to the performance of the Saint-Gobain stock price compared to the performance of the CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0stock market index. Furthermore, following dialog with investors, the long term compensation plans put in place  since  2017  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, now include a criterion relating to Corporate Social Responsibility. These  criteria have  been  considered relevant  by  the  Board  of  Directors  as  they  reflect  the operational, financial and non-financial performance of the Saint-Gobain  Group  and  ensure  an  alignment  of  the beneficiaries with the interest of Saint-Gobain shareholders.\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors decided, on the proposal of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  to increase the weighting of the Corporate Social Responsibility  criterion  from  15%  to  20%  to  reflect  the importance  for  the  Group  and  its  employees  of  the commitments it has made as regards climate and carbon neutrality and also reflect the market's expectations with regard to these same topics. Accordingly, the weighting of the sub-criterion relating to the reduction  of  CO2 emissions  was  increased  from  5%  to  10%,  with  the sub-criteria relating to TRAR and diversity remaining, as in previous years, weighted at 5% each; the weighting of the ROCE  internal  performance  criterion  was  consequently adjusted downward from 65% to 60%.",

This Severance Indemnity shall be due in the event of termination of his employment contract (i)/uni00A0under conditions giving rise to payment of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity') or (ii)/uni00A0in the event of resignation from his employment contract following a Forced Resignation (1) , provided that termination of the employment contract is notified within 12/uni00A0months following the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nNo Severance Indemnity will be due if the termination of the office or employment contract occurs because of a gross or serious misconduct or serious misconduct not related to his duties, or a resignation that is not a Forced Resignation. Similarly, no Severance Indemnity will be due if he has the possibility to claim retirement benefits.\n\nIn the event of a Forced Resignation from his duties as Chief Operating Officer, Benoit Bazin may notify the company that this Forced Resignation also constitutes a notice of resignation from his salaried functions; in this case, there will be no grounds for payment by the company of an Indemnity related to the Employment Contract (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity'). However, a Forced Resignation shall trigger the payment of the Severance Indemnity within the limits and conditions set out in this section.\n\nA Severance Indemnity constitutes a contractual indemnity. It shall be made in addition to the Indemnity related to the Employment  Contract,  which  relates  to  the  seniority  acquired  as  an  employee  and  is  not  subject  to  performance conditions. The Severance Indemnity is subject to the performance conditions described below.\n\n## Amount of the Severance Indemnity\n\nIts gross amount must be such that the sum of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract, the Non-compete Indemnity (if applicable) and the Severance Indemnity does not, under any circumstances, exceed double the Reference Compensation (as defined below under 'Non-compete Indemnity') (the 'Overall Cap').\n\nThe gross amount of the Severance Indemnity shall be equal to the difference between twice the amount of the Reference Compensation and the sum of the Indemnity related to the Employment Contract and (if applicable) the Non-compete Indemnity.\n\n## Performance condition\n\nThe payment of the Severance Indemnity shall be subject to the fulfillment of a performance condition defined as the grant by the Board of Directors, on average for all previous three full fiscal years during which he held the position of Chief Operating Officer that ended prior to the date of termination of his duties, of a variable compensation portion at least equal to half of the maximum amount set for that variable portion.\n\nThe payment of the Severance Indemnity shall be subject to the prior recognition by the Board of Directors, after consultation with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, of the fulfillment of said performance condition assessed on the date of termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer, and the waiver of all proceedings and actions by Benoit Bazin.\n\n5",

This clause stipulates a firm and irrevocable non-compete commitment from Benoit Bazin to the benefit of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, for a period of one year following the termination  of  his  employment  contract,  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  provided  that  such  termination  occurs  within 12/uni00A0months following the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer.\n\n## Amount of the Non-compete Indemnity\n\nIn consideration of this undertaking, Benoit Bazin shall receive a Non-compete Indemnity, including any paid leave indemnity, of an amount equal to, unless it is reduced under the circumstances specified in the following paragraph, Benoit Bazin's gross total annual compensation as Chief Operating Officer, defined as the sum of the fixed portion of his compensation, on an annual basis, as Chief Operating Officer received on the date of termination of his duties, and of the average of the variable portion of his annual compensation as Chief Operating Officer paid or to be paid for the three latest consecutive full fiscal years available during which he held the position of Chief Operating Officer that ended prior to the date of termination of his duties (this gross total annual compensation is defined as the 'Reference Compensation').\n\nWithout prejudice to the Overall Cap defined in the description of the Severance Indemnity above, the combination of this Non-compete Indemnity, the statutory indemnity or the indemnity related to the collective bargaining agreement that would be paid to Benoit Bazin in the event of dismissal, and any other indemnity related to the termination of the employment contract (the statutory indemnity and any other indemnity are jointly defined, with the exception of the Severance Indemnity, as the 'Indemnity related to the Employment Contract') may not be greater than twice the amount of the Reference Compensation. For this purpose, in the event of a termination of his employment contract resulting in the payment of an Indemnity related to the Employment Contract, the gross amount of the Non-compete Indemnity due to Benoit Bazin shall, if necessary, be reduced proportionally in light of the surplus amount.\n\n## Payment\n\nThis Non-compete Indemnity shall be paid monthly starting from the departure of Benoit Bazin.

        "page_content": "Risk factors\n\n## Risk factors 1.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group conducts its affairs in a constantly evolving environment. It is therefore exposed to risks, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial position, results and outlook. This chapter presents the main risks to which the Group believes  it  is  exposed,  as  of  the  date  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nUniversal  Registration  Document,  are  mentioned  in  the first place within each of the risk categories mentioned below, in line with an evaluation based on their impact and likelihood. Saint-Gobain's evaluation of the impact of the risks  may  be  modified  at  any  time,  particularly  if  new internal or external events occur.\n\nDue  to  the  Group's  multiple  geographic  locations,  the diversity of its markets and product ranges, as well as its development,  the  Saint-Gobain  Group  is  exposed  to different categories of risks. Pursuant to the provisions of Article/uni00A016 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the most important risk factors (identified with an asterisk), at the date of this\n\nIt should be noted that there are other risks which may exist or arise, of which the Group is not aware as of the date  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  or  the occurrence of which has not been considered as of that date as being likely to have a material adverse effect on the Group, its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.\n\n## Risks specific to the Group and its operations 1.1\n\n## Risks associated with economic 1.1.1 cycles*\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  markets  are  cyclical  in  nature.  A significant portion of the Group's activities are linked to investment  in the construction sector, namely  the renovation (48%/uni00A0 (1) of 2020/uni00A0sales), new residential construction  (22%/uni00A0 (1) of  2020/uni00A0sales)  and  non-residential construction (10%/uni00A0 (1) of 2020/uni00A0sales) markets, which generally  follow  the  cyclical  nature  of  the  economic climate. Consequently, the Group's results are sensitive to the macroeconomic conditions of the geographic zones, both at regional and local levels, where the Group is active. Since the Group is established in 70/uni00A0countries around the world (especially in Western Europe, North America, Latin America including Brazil, Asia and the Middle East/Africa), a deterioration in the global economic environment due, for example, to a severe economic downturn or a major recession in any of these geographic regions is likely to have a negative impact on the consumption of the Group's products in the regions concerned, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's sales, results, free cash-flow generation and outlook.\n\n## Risks associated with the Group's 1.1.2 international operations*\n\nThe Group is active worldwide, including outside Western Europe and North America. It is notably present in Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, in Brazil in particular. About 20% of the Group's consolidated sales were generated in these areas in 2020. Generally speaking, the Group's activities in these regions carry higher risks than in Western European countries and North America, due to the existence of greater economic and political instability,  as  well  as  greater  exposure  to  social  and infrastructure disruptions than in more mature markets.\n\nThus,  the  direct  and  indirect  consequences  of  political instability or of an unstable economic or regulatory\n\n(1) Saint-Gobain end-market estimate.\n\nenvironment in which the Group operates, in a country in which the Group is active or markets its products, could have a material adverse impact on investment levels in that country's construction sector, and consequently on the  Group's  businesses,  financial  position,  results  or outlook.\n\nIn this regard, the current Covid-19 pandemic which began in China in December/uni00A02019 and which has caused a global economic crisis and major economic disruptions in many countries in which the Group operates, has significantly impacted the results of the Group's operations in the first half of 2020 (see the press release on the first half 2020 results dated July/uni00A030, 2020 reporting an operating income of  \u20ac827/uni00A0million,  down  -49.2%  like-for-like).  Even  if  the second half of the year 2020 saw a strong improvement of the  operating  income  in  a  macroeconomic  and  health environment still marked by uncertainties related to the pandemic (see Section/uni00A01.6 of Chapter/uni00A04), the introduction of new restrictive measures in the context of new waves of the pandemic to limit their spread and contain them, could  lead  to  new  economic  slowdowns  in  markets  in which the Group operates, or affect global production or local supply or transport chains, or more generally impact the global economy again, which could have an adverse impact on the Group's financial situation, results or outlook (see  Section/uni00A01.6  of  Chapter/uni00A04).  However,  most  of  the Group's businesses are local, with products manufactured and sold locally and a significant portion of its supplies sourced locally.\n\nMoreover, legal or regulatory changes applicable to the Group's activities (involving, among other things, taxation, restrictions on capital transfers, customs duties, intellectual property and import and export licenses, the employment system or health, safety or the environment) could  significantly  increase  the  Group's  costs  in  the various countries in which it is active, or limit its ability to freely transfer its capital, and consequently have a material adverse impact on its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  the  Group  operates  in  an  uncertain  geopolitical climate where trade tensions, notably between China and the United States, are becoming increasingly prominent. The  Group  mainly  operates  in  local  markets  (see Section/uni00A01.2.1 of Chapter/uni00A02), although some of its manufacturing  activities  have  global  value  chains  (see Sections/uni00A01.2.2 to 1.2.4 of Chapter/uni00A02) and could be subject to political  and  trade  tensions,  such  as  the  automotive industry.  Further  deterioration  of  global  trade  relations could therefore have an adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook in these business sectors.\n\n## Risks associated with innovation 1.1.3 and the digital revolution\n\nThe  Group  has  placed  innovation  at  the  heart  of  its strategy (see Section/uni00A04 of Chapter/uni00A02) in order to remain competitive  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  operational excellence and financial and non-financial performance.\n\nCertain  markets  in  which  the  Group  operates  have undergone  rapid  change  with  the  introduction  of  new products and solutions (for instance, off-site manufacturing, 3D printing and digital construction - see Section/uni00A03.2.1.3 of Chapter/uni00A02), new  technologies  and communication and distribution channels (see Section/uni00A04.1 of Chapter/uni00A02). The success of the Group depends on its capacity to keep pace with these changes at all times and integrate these new  technologies  into  its product offerings,  in  order  to  respond  effectively  to  customers' needs.\n\nThus,  in  November/uni00A02018, the  Group  established  the Transform & Grow program to promote local decision-making  as  part  of  the  strengthening  of  its regional businesses while maintaining a global structure for  its  global  businesses,  in  line  with  its  principles  of flexibility and proximity to customers (see Section/uni00A04 of Chapter/uni00A01). One of the challenges for the establishment of the Transform & Grow program as regards innovation and digital transformation is the optimal reconciling, on the one hand, of initiatives and the coordination of marketing policies and strategic innovations on a global scale and, on the other, of the necessary local adaptations or initiatives to meet the needs of local markets and customers in the most  relevant  and  efficient  way  possible  (in  particular sales channels and logistical services\u2026). The Group may not be in a position to respond fully to these challenges, which could adversely affect its sales, results or outlook.\n\nThe Group's innovation policy notably also comprises an ambitious  marketing  approach  which  seeks  to  better understand, anticipate and respond to customer requirements,  working  where  applicable  directly  with research and development to supply customized solutions. This  policy  of  marketing  innovation  and  operational excellence requires significant investments in research and development (\u20ac428/uni00A0million as at December/uni00A031, 2020, i.e. 35% of the Group's total investments) as well as a tailored recruitment and training policy, especially in new professions  associated  with  the  digital  boom  (digital marketing,  professions  related  to  the  use  of  data  and Industry 4.0 for example - see Section/uni00A04.2.2 of Chapter/uni00A02), the expected benefits of which cannot be guaranteed.\n\nThe Group's sales, operating margins and results could be affected  if  it  fails  to  invest  or  invests  insufficiently  in appropriate technologies related to digital transformation, or its incapacity to rapidly bring new products to market, if the Group's new products do not adequately address customer  needs  or  if  competing  products  are  quickly introduced.\n\n## Intellectual property risk 1.1.4\n\nThe  growth  in  the  Group's  activities  relies  on  the protection  of  its  manufacturing  secrets  (more  than 450/uni00A0patents registered in 2020 and a long-term quality and relevance contributing to Saint-Gobain being classified, for the tenth consecutive year, as one of the 100 most innovative organizations worldwide by the Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators TM of Clarivate Analytics), brands and models, and other intellectual property rights (for a description of the Group's portfolio of patents and brands, see Sections/uni00A01.4, 4.1 and 4.2 of Chapter/uni00A01). If the Group was unable  to  obtain,  protect  and  preserve  its  intellectual property rights, or its freedom to operate, this could result in the loss of its exclusive rights to use technologies and processes, which could have a material adverse effect on its results.\n\nThe Group has an active policy for the protection of its intellectual property rights but cannot rule out the risk of its products being counterfeited, the appropriation or illicit use of its intellectual property rights or an unfavorable ruling by the courts.\n\nThe Group may be forced to take legal action against third parties  suspected  of  breaching  its  rights.  Any  such proceedings may give rise to significant costs and hamper growth in sales of the products manufactured using the rights concerned or force the Group to incur additional expenses to develop other technologies that do not use the disputed technology.\n\n## Risks associated with changes 1.1.5 in the cost of energy and raw materials\n\nThe Group's industrial activities, some of which consume high levels of energy, for instance, such as building and automobile glass, Insulation or Gypsum (see Section/uni00A03 of Chapter/uni00A01  for  a  description  of  these  activities),  or  are dependent on certain raw materials, could be impacted by a significant increase in prices resulting from difficulties in sourcing raw materials and/or energy (e.g. natural gas or electricity),  or  by  the  occurrence  of  natural  disasters extreme weather conditions, or geopolitical circumstances. For instance, at December/uni00A031, 2020, the Group's irrevocable commitments to purchase raw materials and energy represented \u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A04.5.1 of the consolidated financial statements).\n\nIts ability to pass on these cost increases to its customers depends  to  a  large  extent  on  market  conditions  and practices.  Even  in  the  event  of  repercussions  for  the Group, it may only pass these on to its customers in part and/or  gradually  over  time.  The  Group's  inability  to immediately and/or fully pass on increases in the cost of raw materials and/or energy in the short term could have a  material  adverse  effect  on  its  operations,  financial position or results.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "Risk factors\n\nThe Group has set up hedging arrangements for some of the risks associated with the cost of energy and/or raw materials (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A09.1 Financial Risks to the consolidated financial statements). Nevertheless, it cannot  guarantee  that  these  hedges,  which  themselves represent  a  cost  for  the  Group,  will  fully  cover  any additional  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  future  price increases in the cost of energy and/or raw materials; they will depend on the underlying cost assumptions applied by the Group.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks 1.1.6\n\nThe  Group  could  incur  significant  expenses  and  be exposed  to  environmental  liabilities  as  a  result  of  its operation of past, present or future industrial sites (see Note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements, Section/uni00A01 of Chapter/uni00A08).\n\nThe  industrial  and  environmental  risks  arising  from  the operation of some sites primarily relate to the storage of certain hazardous substances.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2020, eight sites were classified under Directive No./uni00A02012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous  substances,  known  as 'Seveso/uni00A0III'. These industrial sites are subject to specific regulations  and  close  supervision  by  the  competent authorities  and  the  Group's  Environment,  Health  and Safety Department.\n\nThese sites include Balsta (Gypsum) in Sweden, storing liquid  natural  gas,  Etolikon  (Gypsum)  in  Greece  and Stjordal (Insulation) in Norway, storing liquefied petroleum gas, Mannheim (Flat Glass) in Germany, storing petroleum products, and Sully-sur-Loire (Sekurit-Transport) in France, storing combustive liquids, which fall under the 'low threshold' defined by the 'Seveso/uni00A0III' Directive. Three other  facilities  are  classified  as  'upper  threshold':  the Bagneaux-sur-Loing  site  (Flat  Glass)  in  France,  which stores arsenic (AS2O3), the Carrascal del Rio site (Flat Glass) in Spain, which stores hydrofluoric acid (HF), and the site in Boston, Lincolnshire (Building Distribution) in the United Kingdom, which stores petroleum products.\n\nAfter identifying accident risks and their potential impact on the environment, preventive measures were implemented  at  these  facilities,  covering  the  design  and construction  of  storage  areas,  as  well  as  the  manner  in which they are used and maintained. Internal contingency plans have been developed to respond to incidents. The financial consequences of personal injury and damage to property that may arise by accident from plant operations are  covered  by  the  current  Group  civil  liability  and environment impairment liability insurance programs (for a description of these programs, see Chapter/uni00A06, Section/uni00A01.5.2), with the exception of the Bagneaux-sur-Loing plant, which\n\nis insured under a specific policy subscribed by the joint venture operating the facility. In the event of an industrial accident,  compensation  payments  to  victims  would  be organized jointly by the company, the insurance broker and the insurer.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group also has to deal with risks relating to chronic pollution, and could therefore be required to incur expenses to restore active or closed industrial sites, whether  in  operation  or  closed,  or  clean  up  the environment. At December/uni00A031, 2020, 75 European Group sites  are  classified  as  'IED'  installations  as  defined  by Directive  2010/75/EU  on  industrial  emissions,  and  are subject  to  integrated  pollution  prevention  and  control regulations.\n\nA breach of these regulations could result in fines or other civil, administrative or criminal penalties, specifically the withdrawal  of  permits  and  licenses  needed  for  the activities in question to continue operation, which could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  sales, results, free cash flow generation and its outlook.\n\nLastly,  changes  in  environmental  regulations,  including their interpretation, and consideration of climate change risks (see Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A04.1) could cause the Group to incur significant expenses and/or investments.\n\n## Risks associated with external 1.1.7 growth\n\nThe Group's strategy is based, in part, on external growth, in  particular  by  acquiring  businesses  or  assets,  taking equity  interests  or  establishing  joint  ventures  in  the Group's business lines and in geographic regions where the  Group  seeks  to  establish  or  strengthen  itself  (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4). In this respect, the Group announced on November/uni00A012, 2019 that it had entered into an  agreement  to  acquire  100%  of  the  share  capital  of Continental Building Products, US specialist in plasterboard. This transaction was finalized on February/uni00A03, 2020 (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2).\n\nHowever, the Group may not be in a position to identify attractive  targets  or  to  enter  into  transactions  at  the optimal  time  and/or  under  satisfactory  conditions  (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04.4.2 for a description of the business portfolio management strategy). The expected benefits of these external growth operations depend, in part, on the realization of expected synergies and integration of the activities of the acquired companies, and on relationships with other participants in the joint ventures. The Group gives no guarantees as to these objectives, which, if not fulfilled within  the  expected  timeframes  and  at  the expected levels, could affect the Group's financial position, results and outlook (see Chapter/uni00A01, Section/uni00A03).",

        "page_content": "## Risks associated with information 1.1.8 systems\n\nDaily management of the Group's activities, specifically the conduct  of  its  commercial,  industrial,  logistics and accounting  processes,  particularly  in  its  Distribution activities, requires the proper functioning of all technical infrastructure  and  computer  applications.  The  risk  of system malfunction or interruption, which may be external or internal in origin (computer viruses or hacking, service providers'  defaults,  blackouts  or  network  shutdowns, natural disasters, human error, etc.), cannot be underestimated. It should be recalled that, in June/uni00A02017, the  Group,  as  per  numerous  other  companies  and organizations in France and abroad, was affected by the NotPetya cyber-attack, which required IT systems to be disconnected in order to prevent the spread of the virus, as well as the introduction of alternative processes in all of the Saint-Gobain businesses. The impact of the cyber-attack on operating income for the 2017 fiscal year was calculated to be \u20ac-80/uni00A0million, approximately half of\n\n## Group structural risks 1.2\n\n## Risks associated with the Group's 1.2.1 pension commitments and similar commitments*\n\nThe Group makes significant accounting accruals to cover pension and other post-employment benefit plans, mainly in Western Europe (particularly France, Germany and the United Kingdom) and in North America (United States and Canada), most of these plans are closed to new entrants. At December/uni00A031, 2020, the total amount of commitments in respect of pension  plans  stood  at  \u20ac12.5/uni00A0billion (Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A05.3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe  provision  for  pension  plans  recognized  in  the consolidated balance sheet (\u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020)  may  be  affected  by  adverse  changes  in  the actuarial  assumptions  used  to  calculate  the  projected benefit obligation, by a reduction in the discount rates used  to  measure  future  commitments,  a  change  in  life expectancy  or  higher  inflation,  or  a  fall  in  the  market values of plan assets, consisting mainly of equities and bonds.\n\n## Risks associated with cost 1.2.2 reduction and restructuring\n\nThe Group has undertaken a variety of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives.\n\nWhile further savings are planned, there is no guarantee that the forecast reductions will be achieved or that the related  restructuring  costs  will  not  be  higher  than originally budgeted.\n\nwhich  affected  Building  Distribution  and  the  remainder affecting the industrial businesses. All of the information systems  were  back  up  and  running  within  ten  days, without any data being lost or compromised.\n\nWith a view to learning from NotPetya and minimizing the impact  of  this  type  of  malfunction,  the  Information Systems  Department,  as  part  of  a  cyber-defense  plan, introduced  strict  rules  relating  to  the  governance  and security of information  systems,  both  in  terms  of infrastructure and  applications,  data  protection  and business continuity plans. This plan is deployed at Group level, controlled  by  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department  and  by  external  audits  (see  Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.3:  work  of  the  Audit  and  Risks  Committee). Furthermore,  a  new  insurance  program  covering  the Group's cyber risks has been set up end of 2017.\n\nThe occurrence of such malfunctions may adversely affect the Group's operations, the protection of its know-how and its financial results.\n\nIn  particular,  certain  restructuring  operations  and  other initiatives  may  cost  more  than  expected,  or  the  cost savings may be less than expected or take longer than expected to achieve. An increase in restructuring costs and/or  the  Group's  inability  to  achieve  the  expected savings  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the Group's results and outlook.\n\n## Risks associated with goodwill 1.2.3 and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nBrands and goodwill make up a significant proportion of the Group's intangible assets, representing (\u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion and \u20ac10/uni00A0billion, respectively, at December/uni00A031, 2020). In line with Group  accounting  policies,  goodwill  and  certain  other intangible assets with indefinite use lives are tested for impairment  periodically and  whenever  there  is  an indication  that  their  carrying  amount  may  not  be  fully recoverable.  Goodwill  and  other  identified  intangible assets may become impaired as a result of worse-than-expected  Group  performance,  unfavorable market conditions, unfavorable legal or regulatory changes  or  many  other  factors.  The  recognition  of impairment  losses  on  goodwill  could  have  an  adverse effect on consolidated net income.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (\u20ac11.1/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2020) represent roughly one-quarter of total assets and may become impaired in the event of adverse changes in the business (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A06 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n6",

In  particular,  in  a  crisis environment, the Group might be unable to raise the financing or refinancing needed to cover its investment plans on the credit or capital markets, or to obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms. For more\n\ninformation on this liquidity risk and the other financial risks to which the Group is exposed, please see note/uni00A09.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, presented in Chapter/uni00A08 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Legal risk 1.4\n\n## Risks associated with legal 1.4.1 and administrative procedures\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  risks  of  litigation  and  claims arising  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  most significant disputes pending or for which the Group has received notifications are described below. These proceedings may result in a conviction, the payment of substantial damages, regulatory or even criminal sanctions,  and  may  tarnish  the  Group's  reputation  and thus have a significant negative impact on the Group's image, financial position and operating results. The total provision  for  litigation  and  proceedings  amounted  to \u20ac66/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031,  2020  (see  Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Anti-trust law and related proceedings* 1.4.1.1\n\nLegal provisions covering competition apply to the Group companies in countries in which it operates. Violation of competition law exposes the Group to fines and, in certain countries, potential criminal sanctions on the Group and its employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to  have  significant  impact  on  the  Group's  reputation, financial position and operating results.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has long applied the principle of zero tolerance. A plan for compliance with competition law has been in place within the  Group  since  2007.  The  content  of  this  plan  is described further in Section/uni00A01.3.3. of Chapter/uni00A03.\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November/uni00A02011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May/uni00A02014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe  total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is CHF/uni00A080/uni00A0million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF/uni00A028.8/uni00A0million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision\n\non May/uni00A02, 2016 and continues to firmly refute the claims made.  The  hearing  took  place  before  the  Federal Administrative Court on January/uni00A021, 2020 and the date on which  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  will  issue  its decision is not yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December/uni00A031, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July/uni00A028, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement  of  objections  to  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May/uni00A011, 2016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for  further  investigation  in  light  of  the  arguments  put forward  by  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain.  In  October/uni00A02018,  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSaint-Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain rejected the allegations in their response to the second statement of objections filed in January/uni00A02019.\n\nA new report was sent by the Authority at the end of 2019, which gave rise to comments  in  response  from Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain on February/uni00A011, 2020.\n\nThe hearing before the Competition Authority was held on October/uni00A06, 2020. By decision dated January/uni00A014, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive  practices  were  not  established  and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nActis appealed this decision to the Paris Court of Appeal on February 26, 2021.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March/uni00A02013  a damages  claim  on  Saint-Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre scientifique  et  technique  du/uni00A0b\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before the Paris Civil Court ( Tribunal de grande instance ) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority.  In  an  order  dated  December/uni00A016,  2014,  the pre-trial  judge  declared  a  stay  of  proceedings  while waiting for the decision from the Competition Authority, procedure which remains stayed as of the date of this Universal Registration Document.",

        "page_content": "## Asbestos-related litigation 1.4.1.2\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, seven further individual lawsuits were filed in 2020 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) of Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM - which in the past had carried out fiber-cement operations -for asbestos-related occupational diseases that affect or have affected them. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 837 such lawsuits had been issued against the two companies since  1996  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary compensation over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 800 of these 837/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed in terms of both liability and quantum. In all  these  cases,  the  employers  were  held  liable  on  the grounds of 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nCompensation paid by Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM in settlement of these lawsuits totaled approximately \u20ac6.2/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to \u20ac5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nConcerning  the  37/uni00A0lawsuits  outstanding  against  Everite and  Saint-Gobain  PAM  as  of  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the procedures relating to the merits of all the cases were at different  stages,  with  five  in  the  process  of  being investigated by the French Social Security authorities and 32 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ) or Appeal Courts.\n\nIn addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, 258 similar suits had been filed since the outset of the litigation by current or former employees, or persons claiming through them, of 13 French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies  that  are  no  longer  part  of  the  Group),  in particular  by  current  or  former  employees  who  used equipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect  themselves against heat from furnaces.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 224/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed. In 141 of these cases, the employer was held liable for 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nAt the same date, compensation paid by these companies totaled  approximately  \u20ac8.7/uni00A0million  as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020 (compared to \u20ac8/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nAs regards the 34/uni00A0suits outstanding as of December/uni00A031, 2020,  five  cases  were  still  being  investigated  by  the French Social Security authorities, 28 were being tried including 22 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ), five before the Appeal Courts and one before the Cour  de  cassation . Lastly,  one  action  has  been cancelled but the plaintiff may request its restoration at any time within a two-year period following its cancellation.\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's French subsidiaries, including six that operate or have operated facilities in France classified as containing asbestos, are the subject of damages claims that are different from those described above.\n\n'Facilities classified as containing asbestos' are defined as industrial  facilities,  that  have  been  closed  or  are  still operating, which previously manufactured materials containing  asbestos  or  used  protection  and  insulation\n\nequipment containing asbestos and that are included by ministerial  decree  on  the  official  list  of  facilities  whose current or former employees  are  entitled to the early-retirement benefit paid to asbestos workers (ACAATA).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 824/uni00A0lawsuits had been brought  by  current  or  former  employees  claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of  their  alleged  exposure  to  asbestos.  None  of  these plaintiffs were suffering from an asbestos-related disease and  some  of  them  were  not  receiving  the  ACAATA benefit.  Of  these  824/uni00A0suits,  721  have  been  definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of \u20ac7.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (as at December/uni00A031, 2019). The  remaining  103/uni00A0lawsuits are pending before the Amiens Appeal Court.\n\nIt should be clarified that the above figures do not take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe  provision  related  to  asbestos-related  litigation  in France amounted to around \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to  \u20ac4.1/uni00A0million as  of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent Resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western  District  of  North  Carolina  in  Charlotte.  The purpose  of  the  filing  is  to  achieve  a  certain,  final  and equitable Resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section/uni00A0524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve a fair and equitable Resolution of its asbestos-related  liabilities.  Upon  establishment  of  the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will  be  able  to  receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally resolve DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately three to eight/uni00A0years, all asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis action was taken as a result of the increasing risks presented in the US tort system. Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims  against  DBMP/uni00A0LLC,  with  no  foreseeable  end  in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\n6",

Around 1,200/uni00A0contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  A  first instance decision was rendered in connection with the first suit in July/uni00A02020, rejecting the claims of the plaintiffs. The latter have nevertheless appealed the decision. The suit related to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari (State of S\u00e3o Paulo) by the Labor prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered in September/uni00A02020 partly in favor of the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5/uni00A0million (\u20ac0.8/uni00A0million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November/uni00A02017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes 1.4.1.3\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells  near  current  Saint-Gobain  Performance  Plastics (SG/uni00A0PPL) facilities in Hoosick  Falls  (New  York)  and Merrimack (New Hampshire), and two former facilities in North Bennington (Vermont) in the United States. PFOA and  PTFE  (polytetrafluorethylene)  have  never  been manufactured by these plants. SG/uni00A0PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG/uni00A0PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  both  completed  and  on-going  construction  of water  line  extensions  in  certain  communities  in  the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going  and  the  scope  of  responsibility  for  SG/uni00A0PPL arising  from  environmental  remediation  and  clean-up obligations at these sites has not yet been established. Without  admitting  liability,  SG/uni00A0PPL  has  signed  consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG/uni00A0PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG/uni00A0PPL.\n\nOn  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company  in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac31.2/uni00A0million (see  Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A08 to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Other contingent liabilities 1.4.1.4\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex provides insulation materials for specific applications for the building and construction industry.\n\nInsulation materials  from  two  Celotex  ranges  were purchased via distributors  and  used  in  refurbishing Grenfell Tower, London in 2015/2016, including as one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and  installed  (by  third  parties)  on  the  tower's  external facade (for more information, refer to the following page: https://www.saint-gobain.com/fr/finance, glyph<c=2,font=/CMJDHG+ArialMT> sidebar glyph<c=2,font=/CMJDHG+ArialMT> 'Grenfell Tower Celotex').",

        "page_content": "Following the Grenfell Tower fire on June/uni00A014, 2017, a Public Inquiry is underway, which is considering, among other things, the modifications made to the building as part of the refurbishment,  the  role  played  by  the  various construction professionals, and the information provided by the manufacturers of the products used. The Inquiry is conducting its work in two phases: its phase/uni00A01 report was published on October/uni00A030, 2019 and phase/uni00A02 commenced in January/uni00A02020 and is expected to continue into 2022. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in connection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December/uni00A031,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants/uni00A0-/uni00A0who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry/uni00A0-/uni00A0have been issued and have been, or are expected to be, stayed prior to the service of full pleadings, in view of the ongoing Public Inquiry. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability  in  connection  with  the  production,  marketing, supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently  unclear  and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes 1.4.1.5\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses  (see  Chapter/uni00A08,  Section/uni00A01,  note/uni00A04.5.2  to  the consolidated financial statements). Apart from the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12/uni00A0months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group (see Chapter/uni00A08, Section/uni00A01, note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements related to provisions for claims and litigation).\n\n## Insurance 1.5\n\nThe Group transfers its risks to the insurance market when this is the most efficient solution. Default by one or more of the Group's insurers could therefore lead to financial losses.\n\nThe Group's policy is to implement preventive programs and purchase insurance coverage to protect its assets and revenue. This policy is embedded within a Group doctrine, which  takes  into  account  current  conditions  in  the insurance  market.  It  is  determined,  coordinated  and overseen  by  the  Risks  and  Insurance  Department.  It defines  insurance  criteria  for  the  most  significant  risks, such  as  property  and  business  interruption,  as  well  as general  and  product  liability.  With  this  in  mind,  a  new\n\n## Risk of regulatory changes 1.4.2\n\nThe Group is not subject to any specific regulations that could have an impact on its financial position, although the Group  companies  that  operate  industrial  sites  are generally  required  to  comply  with  the  specific  national laws and regulations of the country where such sites are located. It is therefore, for example, with regard to France, subject to regulations applicable to classified sites, and certain regulations relating to the environment, aimed at reducing  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  in  particular  with  a view to meeting the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  under  the  Paris  Agreement  which  came  into force on November/uni00A04, 2016.\n\nA certain number of legislative measures are already in place in certain countries and regions in which the Group operates. As such, at European level, Directive 2003/87/EC of October/uni00A013, 2003, known as the 'Quotas Directive', has set a cap on carbon dioxide emissions and a quota trading system for certain large production sites. Notwithstanding  the  Group's  efforts  to  reduce  CO2 emissions, and  broadly,  the  use  of  best  available techniques for its investments (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section/uni00A04 and Chapter/uni00A03, Section/uni00A04), changes in regulations applicable  to  the  Group's  activities  could  impact  the operation  of  its  production  sites,  which  could  have  a material adverse effect on its operation, financial position or results.\n\nLaws and regulations applicable to the Group and to the materials and products it uses in its activities may change in a manner that may be unfavorable to the Group. The introduction  of  stricter  regulations  or  more  diligent enforcement  of  existing  regulations  may  affect  the conditions under which the Group operates its businesses, which  could  increase  its  operating  expenses,  limit  the scope of its activities or act as a brake on business growth. More generally, the Group cannot guarantee that there will be no rapid or significant regulatory changes in the future with a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results.\n\ninsurance program to cover the Group's cyber risks was implemented at the end of 2017.\n\nFor  other  types  of  coverage,  such  as  automobile  fleet insurance, the Risks and Insurance Department advises the individual operating  units  on  policy  content  broker selection and which market to consult. These are called 'high-frequency'  risks,  for  which  claims  are  monitored internally and appropriate action taken. The 2020/uni00A0policies were the 2019/uni00A0renewed policies.\n\nThe captive insurance company set up to cover property risks was highly successful and delivered real benefits for the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired during the year have been integrated into existing insurance programs.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "Risk factors\n\n## Property and business 1.5.1 interruption insurance\n\nThe Group's non-excluded property and casualty risks and business interruption risks arising from accidental damage to insured assets are covered by a worldwide insurance program.\n\nThe programs meet the insurance criteria laid down by the department, specifically:\n\n- all policies are 'all risks' policies with named exclusions; /uni25A0\n- claims  limits  of  liability  are  based  on  worst-case /uni25A0 scenarios where safety systems operate effectively;\n- deductibles are proportionate to the size of the site /uni25A0 concerned and cannot be qualified as self-insurance.\n\nThese  criteria take into account  current  insurance offerings, which exclude certain risks and cover natural disasters like floods, storms, earthquakes or tsunamis only up to a certain amount.\n\nIn extreme scenarios, such events could have a substantial uninsured financial impact in terms of both reconstruction costs and lost production costs.\n\nThe Risks and Insurance Department's policy is based on the findings of the annual  audits  carried  out  by independent  prevention  experts  recognized  by  the Group's insurers. These audits give a clear picture of the risk exposure of the main sites in the event of a fire or other incident, and provide an estimate of the financial consequences in a worst-case scenario.\n\nIndividual claims in excess of \u20ac12.5/uni00A0million are transferred to the insurance market for all Group subsidiaries.\n\nClaims  up  to  this  amount  are  self-insured  through  the Group's  captive  insurance  company,  which  purchases reinsurance  coverage  against  increases  in  frequency and/or severity rates.\n\n## Liability insurance 1.5.2\n\nA  program  provides  coverage  for  third-party  personal injury and property damage claims for which the Group would  be  legally  held  liable.  This  program  comprises several programs for the lower tranches of coverage.\n\nThe  first  program  covers  all  subsidiaries  and  has  a coverage  limit  of  \u20ac100/uni00A0million.  Those  located  in  North America are subject to a deductible of US$50/uni00A0million. The program's exclusions are consistent with market practice and concern in particular potentially carcinogenic substances and gradual pollution.\n\nIn order to satisfy local regulatory requirements, a policy is taken  out  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  has  a significant presence. Local policies are backed up by the master policy issued in Paris, which can be activated when local coverage proves inadequate.\n\nThe second program, with a cover limit of US$50/uni00A0million, concerns the subsidiaries located in North America. This program is structured differently to deal with the specific nature of liability risks in the United States. It is divided into several lines of coverage, requiring it to be placed, if needed, on the London insurance market. Exclusions are in line with current market practice in the United States and primarily concern  contractual  liability, pollution and third-party consequential loss.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  two  programs  described  above,  a number of supplementary programs have been set up in order  to  bring  the  total  coverage  limit  to  a  level considered compatible with the Group's businesses.\n\nWithin  the  operating  units,  action  is  taken  to  raise awareness  of  civil  liability  risks,  and  the  units  are motivated to control costs by assuming a deductible that does not, however, constitute self-insurance. The Group also runs a risk prevention program at its operating units with the support of the Environment, Health and Safety Department.\n\nFurthermore, to meet the environmental requirements set out  in  Directive  2004/35/EC  of  April/uni00A021, 2004  on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, the Group has since 2017  had  a  specific  policy  with  a  limit  increased  from \u20ac25/uni00A0million to \u20ac75/uni00A0million per year as from July/uni00A01, 2020. This policy offers worldwide cover, excluding the United States, for the Group's civil environmental liability arising in relation to damage  affecting natural resources (protected natural species and habitats, soil and water) as a result of its activities.\n\n## Exceptions 1.5.3\n\nJoint ventures not controlled by the Group and minority interests  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  above policies. These insurance policies are taken out separately.",

        "page_content": "## Internal control 2.\n\nEach of the Group's companies evaluates the main risks affecting the shaping of its strategy, the smooth running of its operations, compliance with laws and regulations and resilience to external events.\n\nAs such, the general aims of internal control include:\n\n- management of the company's operational risks; /uni25A0\n- proper  implementation  of  processes  and  reliable /uni25A0 financial information;\n- compliance, in accordance with the Group's programs, /uni25A0 particularly on antitrust law, laws on embargoes and trade  sanctions  and  the  fight  against  corruption  (in accordance with the recommendations of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise Anticorruption (AFA), the French Anticorruption Agency);\n- anti-fraud. /uni25A0\n\nEach  level  of  the  organization  plays  a  role  in  internal control, as internal control and risk management affect all Group  employees.  The  three  lines  of  defense  model  is therefore adopted by Saint-Gobain:\n\n- in  the  first  line  of  defense,  companies  employ  an /uni25A0 internal control and risk management system tailored to their situation, at the initiative of the Chief executive officers and  local  managerial  structures  (Regions, countries and activities). The companies have access to Shared  Services  Centers  (Finance,  Payroll)  and  IT expertise. It is essential that there is a segregation of tasks between these organizations for successful skills optimization and transaction security;\n- in the second line, Group Internal Control establishes an /uni25A0 internal control reference framework applicable to all, in addition to specific guidelines prepared by the Group's corporate departments.\n- and in the third line involves verification of the proper /uni25A0 application of the internal control principles which is carried  out  in-house  by  the  Audit  Department  and externally by the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's internal control 2.1 and risk management system\n\n## The aims of internal control 2.1.1 and risk management\n\nThe Saint-Gobain internal control and risk management system  is  part  of  the  legal  framework  applicable  to companies listed on the Euronext Paris regulated market, and is inspired by the reference framework on the internal control and risk management system of the AMF (French Financial  Markets  Authority)  and  the  'Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (COSO).\n\nSaint-Gobain Group's internal control and risk management  system  is  supported  by  a  continuous improvement process and an Internal Control Reference Framework. This is a whole set of resources, behaviors, procedures  and  actions  tailored  to  each  company's specific characteristics which:\n\n- enables it to appropriately address material operational, /uni25A0 financial or compliance risks;\n- helps  it  to  manage  its  operations  and  meet  its /uni25A0 objectives;\n- improves  the  efficiency  of  its  operations  and  ensure /uni25A0 that its resources are used to best effect.\n\nIt  is  more  specifically  designed  to  provide  assurance concerning:\n\n- application of General Management's instructions and /uni25A0 orientations;\n- compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to /uni25A0 the company;\n- the efficiency and effectiveness of internal operating, /uni25A0 industrial, marketing, financial and other processes;\n- the  protection  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  in /uni25A0 particular the prevention of fraud;\n- the reliability of financial information. /uni25A0\n\nBy promoting constant improvement in all entities, internal control  creates  value  and  accentuates  the  companies' performance.\n\n## The internal control and risk 2.1.2 management environment\n\n## The Group's core values 2.1.2.1\n\nInternal control is based on values and rules of conduct which are formalized in:\n\n- the  Saint-Gobain  Group  Principles  of  Conduct  and /uni25A0 Action:  professional  commitment,  respect  for  others, integrity,  loyalty,  solidarity,  compliance  with  the  law, respect for the environment, protection of health and safety at work and employee rights (see Saint-Gobain Today  -  Chapter/uni00A01).  The  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action are distributed to all Group employees;\n- the Group  Human  Rights  policy  (see  Section/uni00A01, /uni25A0 Chapter/uni00A03);\n- the Saint-Gobain Attitudes: being close to customers, /uni25A0 acting  as  an  entrepreneur,  innovating,  being  flexible, building an open and engaging culture;\n- the  Group's  compliance  program:  law  on  antitrust, /uni25A0 embargoes  and  trade  sanctions,  the  fight  against corruption, influence peddling and fraud, professional associations, conflicts of interest, gifts policy, etc. (see Section/uni00A02.5.6 of  Chapter/uni00A06 -  Tools  of  the  Group's culture of compliance).\n\n6",

        "page_content": "Internal control\n\nExecutives leading by example, and control at all levels in implementing the Principles is essential in disseminating these values, which all Group employees must adhere to.\n\n## The organizational model 2.1.2.2\n\nThe implementation of an internal control system requires:\n\n- appropriate organization which provides a framework /uni25A0 for the planning, execution, monitoring and management of operations;\n- clearly defined roles and responsibilities, according to a /uni25A0 human  resources  management  policy  which  recruits people  with  the  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  to perform  their  jobs,  providing  them  with  training  to develop employees' knowledge;\n- rotation  and  succession  plans  for  key  positions  and /uni25A0 replacement solutions during temporary absences;\n- powers of attorney granted to suitable people in line /uni25A0 with the principle of task segregation.\n\n## The dissemination of policies 2.1.2.3 and programs\n\nThe policies and programs devised by the Group's General Management  are  disseminated  within  each  corporate department. The Regions, countries and activities formalize guidelines and directives within their scope of responsibility in line with the Group's own guidelines and directives, ensuring that they are applied when conducting operations.\n\n## Information systems 2.1.2.4\n\nThe Group's organizations and their operations rely to a large extent on information systems, information-sharing and  the  digitization  of  processes.  Information  systems must therefore be efficiently protected in terms of both physical  and  logical  security.  The  Saint-Gobain  Group companies thus comply with the safety rules set out by the Group Information Systems Department and Internal Control  (automated  controls  described  in  detail  in  the 'ITAC' reference base).\n\n## Internal control and risk 2.1.3 management process\n\nWithin Saint-Gobain, internal control is a continuous and ongoing process that integrates risk management procedures.\n\nDue  to  the  constantly  changing  environment  and  the regulatory  context,  the  companies  must  take  steps  to identify,  evaluate,  process  and  monitor  any  risks  which may affect them.\n\n## At Group-entity level 2.1.3.1\n\nThe risk management process can be summarized in four stages:\n\n- analysis  of  the  main  identifiable  risks.  The  company /uni25A0 analyzes its main risks, and thus identifies what could hinder it meeting its objectives, as well as dangers that could harm its interests or have a major impact on its internal control situation;\n- developing controls that are proportionate to the risks /uni25A0 involved in each process;\n- communicating  the  objectives  of  internal  control  to /uni25A0 employees and implementing controls;\n- permanent  oversight  of  and  regular  checks  on  the /uni25A0 effectiveness of internal control: a compliance declaration is signed each year by the Chief executive officers according to the perimeter defined for each annual campaign.\n\nThis process is outlined in the Internal Control Reference Framework (see Chapter/uni00A06, Section/uni00A02.5.1 - Internal Control Reference Framework) applicable to all Group entities.\n\n## At Compagnie de Saint-Gobain level 2.1.3.2\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  and  Business  Control  Department updates  the  Group's  risk  mapping  every  year.  These updates  draw  on  the  contributions  of  the  various management levels, and the results are submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nOversight controls and effectiveness checks may lead to corrective action being taken, and to changes, as needed, to the internal control and risk management system.",

It also promotes the pursuit of added value and enhanced performance, in line with the Group's focus areas and programs (notably in anticipation of the digitization of company processes).\n\nTherefore, the Audit and Internal Control Department is involved  in  the  Group's  compliance  program  and  is primarily responsible for the following:\n\n- designing the Group's internal control and risk /uni25A0 management system;\n- coordinating  the  implementation  of  this  system,  in /uni25A0 liaison with the company's corporate departments and operational  management  structures.  To  do  this,  the Audit  and  Internal  Control  Department  relies  on  the issuing  and  checking  of  the  compliance  statements signed  by  the  general  managers  for  the  applicable management levels;\n- carrying out audits in line with the audit plan approved /uni25A0 by the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group Internal Audit Department applies the international standards of the profession as described in  the  Professional  Internal  Auditing  Standards  (RPAI), 2020/uni00A0version, and thus complies with the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (CRIPP) of  the  Institute  of  Internal  Auditors  (IIA).  The  Group's Audit Department was certified in 2020 by the IFACI, the French branch of the/uni00A0IIA.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department had 72/uni00A0staff, split between audit and internal control.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## The internal control and risk management system 2.3 in the Group entities\n\nEach  entity  is  responsible  for  implementing  an  internal control system that is appropriate to its needs and aligned with the Group's internal control system. Each Managing Director is responsible for:\n\n- the relevance and effectiveness of the internal control /uni25A0 system in place within their entity;\n- its compliance with the Group's internal control system; /uni25A0\n- appropriate  management  of  the  risks  faced  by  their /uni25A0 entity.\n\nThis  responsibility  cannot  be  delegated.  Management exercises  this  by  relying  on  the  company's  functional Directors, operational staff and the site Directors.\n\nTo  build  an  internal  control  system  adapted  to  their activity, the Chief executive officers of the companies aim to:\n\n- establish the fundamental bases for internal control and /uni25A0 risk management,  and  in  particular  the  controls described in the Internal Control Reference Framework;\n- adapt the internal control and risk management system /uni25A0 by analyzing specific risks and enhancing the internal control  system  to  include  checks  tailored  to  the management of identified risks;\n- roll  out  the  internal  control  and  risk  management /uni25A0 system on all of the sites;\n- oversee  the  internal  control  and  risk  management /uni25A0 system.\n\n## The procedure for monitoring the internal control 2.4 and risk management system\n\nThe Audit and Internal Control Department monitors the internal control and risk management systems using four main factors:\n\n- compliance statement; /uni25A0\n- internal audits; /uni25A0\n- action plan monitoring; /uni25A0\n- monitoring of fraud and incidents. /uni25A0\n\nThe results of this oversight are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Compliance statement 2.4.1\n\nThe Managing Directors, for the applicable management levels report to the Group's General Management on their levels  of  internal  control via an  annual  compliance statement.\n\nThe  form  includes  a  certain  number  of  key  checks extracted from the Internal Control Reference Framework.\n\nThe Managing Director must provide assurances that:\n\n- s/he has carried out the selected checks properly and /uni25A0 efficiently;\n- the action plans arising from the self-assessment have /uni25A0 been activated and implemented within the given time frames;\n- major internal control events, fraud and violations of /uni25A0 the  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  have  been reported to the Audit and Internal Control Department.\n\nFinally, the Managing Directors make a personal commitment to the accuracy of the self-assessment by signing a letter of commitment at the end of the form.\n\nThe declarations of compliance and the action plans are gathered, summarized and monitored by the Audit and Internal  Control  Department.  They  are  covered  in  an\n\nannual report to the Group's Management team and the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Internal audits 2.4.2\n\nInternal audits are centralized at Compagnie de Saint-Gobain  level. The  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department's  Director  reports  to  the  Chairman  of  the Group. Internal auditors located at the Group's headquarters  or  in  the  countries  report  directly  to  the Audit and Internal Control Department and work under its authority.\n\nThe audits are scheduled based on long-term, pre-determined  criteria,  in  line  with  a  yearly  audit  plan which is designed taking into account the requirements of the company's General Management, corporate departments and operational departments. The audit plan prepared by the Audit and Internal Control Department is approved by the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\nThe aim of the audits is to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Group and  its  subsidiaries  and  to  carry  out  cross-business missions  with  an  operational  benefit.  Generally,  they include an examination of the internal control environment, risk analysis system, internal control organization and procedures and information systems of one or more processes.\n\nThe auditors use IT tools provided to them to analyze the data systematically (data analytics) and share the results operationally with the entities:\n\n- a performance-oriented tool for process analysis that /uni25A0 can  be  used  to  analyze  and  represent  an  entity's organizational structure and its processes, to identify bottlenecks and irregularities in process flows;\n- a compliance-oriented data analysis tool that is useful /uni25A0 in targeted  searches  for  inconsistencies  with  the internal control rules in place.\n\n6",

The  report  is  then  sent  to  the Group's General Management  and  the operational department to which the entity reports.\n\nThe year 2020 was marked by the Covid-19 health crisis, which disrupted the normal course of business. However, the audits were maintained in the majority of cases thanks to the launch of a special remote audit work program that adapted the audit system and conducted missions in a new form.\n\n## Action plans follow-up 2.4.3\n\nAn action plan management and monitoring database is used  to  centralize  the  suits  filed to remedy  any non-compliance  issues  identified  during  the  compliance statement campaign, and about the action plans drawn up following  audits  performed  by  the  internal  audit.  Since 2019, the audit tool also enables the entities to launch action  plans  autonomously,  as  part  of  the  dynamic management of their internal control.\n\nThis means that each Group company has access to a centralized operational platform it can use to manage its action plans by reporting the corrective measures taken and  the  progress  made  compared  with  the  predefined implementation schedule. The corporate departments can also use the system to monitor these action plans.\n\nFurthermore,  a  dashboard  circulated  at  the  Group's different management levels makes it possible to monitor the results of the compliance statements, internal audit grades and the progress of the related action plans.\n\n## Monitoring of fraud and internal 2.4.4 control incidents\n\nFraud  and  other  major  internal  control  incidents  are closely monitored by the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\n## Events that must be declared to the Group 2.4.4.1\n\n- accounting  anomalies  and  alterations  which  damage /uni25A0 the integrity of the financial information, irrespective of whether they are favorable or unfavorable to the entity or the Group;\n- misappropriation  or  jeopardizing  of  assets,  whether /uni25A0 tangible or intangible;\n- events  likely  to  be  construed  as  acts  of  passive  or /uni25A0 active corruption, or influence peddling;\n- violations of laws and regulations; /uni25A0\n- other violations of the Principles of Conduct and /uni25A0 Action.\n\n## Alerts procedure 2.4.4.2\n\nAll incidents must be reported immediately using a standard  form  available  on  the  company's  (Fraud  and Security) intranet. These reports are then passed on to the members  of  the  Audit  and  Risks  Committee,  and  the relevant  functional  and  operational  departments.  The Group's Fraud Officer ensures monitoring by applying a single,  centralized  procedure  which  all  of  the  Group's subsidiaries must follow.\n\nNo employee may be punished, dismissed or subject to any direct or indirect discrimination for reporting events presumed in good faith to be fraudulent.",

Each ICRF control is referenced against the relevant risk sub-categories. Each process  contains  a  control/risk  matrix  used  to  refer specifically to risk types by control and contributing to understanding the control system.\n\nSection/uni00A03  of  the  Internal  Control  Reference  Framework presents the list of mandatory controls to be implemented by all Group subsidiaries (240/uni00A0controls in the 2020/uni00A0version).\n\n## The Mini ICRF 2.5.1.2\n\nThis framework has the same structure as the standard ICRF with 17/uni00A0chapters. It sets out 100/uni00A0controls, which have been carefully selected and developed for small entities. The  Mini  ICRF  also  presents  a  practical  tool  for  the consolidation of newly-acquired companies.\n\n## The ITAC 2.5.1.3\n\nThe  Automated  Control  Reference  Framework  (ITAC) supplements  the  Group's  Internal  Control  Reference Framework (ICRF) and lists the controls that are wholly or partially  automatable,  the  implementation  of  which  is mandatory. The Group companies are responsible for the implementation  of  this  reference  framework  in  the business applications within their scope (e.g. SAP) in order to  guarantee  the  perpetuation  of  the  control,  limit  its recurring costs and minimize the risk of human error or fraud.\n\nIn the 2020/uni00A0edition of the ITAC standard, which covers eight  processes,  there  are  90/uni00A0controls  listed.  They  are divided into three categories: automated process, automated workflow approval and automated reporting (R).\n\nTwo  additional  manuals  were  added  to  the  Group's Internal Control Reference Framework in the first half of 2020:\n\n## The new ICQRF manual 2.5.1.4\n\nThe  new  ICQRF  (Internal  Control  Quality  Reference Framework)  manual,  which  deals  with  internal  control applied to quality.\n\n6",

In its current edition, the purpose of the ACRF is instead to train the Group's internal auditors in this topic.\n\nAll of the reference frameworks are available on the IABC (Internal Audit and Business Control) Intranet.\n\nOther tools are also available on the Intranet site to help entities implement the controls (tool box: typical procedures, flow diagrams, library of controls) and best practices.\n\nThe best practices are compiled by:\n\n- the Internal Audit Department - auditors gather best /uni25A0 practices during their audit missions;\n- the  Internal  Control  Department,  using  a  system  of /uni25A0 external  monitoring  (notably  the  Institut  fran\u00e7ais  de l'audit et du contr\u00f4le interne, IFACI);\n- entities that agree to share their tools. /uni25A0\n\n## The Accounting Standards 2.5.2 and Pension Liabilities Department\n\nThe Accounting Standards and Pension Liabilities Department  presents  all  financial,  administrative  and management procedures applicable to Group companies.\n\nThese procedures, accessible via the Group Intranet, are based on two main themes:\n\n- Group organization and procedures; /uni25A0\n- financial and accounting standards. /uni25A0\n\nThis Department is also in charge of coordinating the work to calculate the Group's pension provisions and carries out a detailed review  of  the  commitments  of  French companies in collaboration with the actuaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt has also been responsible for the monitoring of 'IFRS/uni00A016' leases using a global database of all of the Group's leases (about 55,000/uni00A0contracts).\n\nThe  work  of  the  Accounting  Standards  and  Pension Liabilities Department is the subject of a report presented biannually to the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\n## Environment, Health and Safety 2.5.3 (EHS) Reference Manual\n\nA  new  version  of  the  EHS  Reference  Framework  was made available in 2020. The framework describes the EHS management system to be put in place to achieve the EHS objectives and achieve an autonomous and interdependent EHS culture. It is based on the principle of continuous  improvement.  It  takes  into  account  the following:\n\n- international management standards in the three areas /uni25A0 of  EHS:  ISO/uni00A045001:2018  for  health  and  safety  and ISO/uni00A014001:2015 for the environment;\n- the specific requirements of SAINT-GOBAIN, in /uni25A0 particular the Group's EHS standards.\n\nIt is based on the conviction that the implementation of an effective EHS management system in the branches is a necessary  condition  for  the  long-term  improvement  of their EHS performance.\n\nThe framework serves as a reference for the audit of the EHS management systems (ESPR audit on the Distribution scope and the new ISA (Integrated System Assessment) audit  launched  in  2018  for  the  industrial  scope).  A streamlined audit system, called ISA-MINI, which is more suitable for branches whose management system is not ISO-certified, was developed in 2020 and will be gradually deployed in 2021. The review of Saint-Gobain EHS audits at  Distribution  sites  will  be  conducted  in  2021  using feedback from the ISA-MINI audits.\n\nThis year, an agenda was proposed to the countries by the EHS team at the central level for the ISA and ISA-MINI audits to standardize the approaches between the various countries and reduce audit-related burdens. The number of EHS audits in the field was significantly reduced in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nFurthermore, the EHS Department continues to work with its network to develop and update Group EHS standards, which  describe  the  minimum  applicable  requirements and/or  methodologies.  These  standards  help  to  ensure that risks are assessed and controlled on the same basis in all Group entities, irrespective of the country and the local laws and regulations (see Section of Chapter/uni00A03). Implementation guides, sample procedures, training packs, standards implementation assessment questionnaires, and computer tools have been developed to support the application  of  the  standards  at  the  sites.  In  2020,  an appendix concerning the Work Permit was added to the 'Health and  Safety  Risk Assessment  and  Control' standard. A new version of the 'Work-Related Road Risks' standard has been made available, as have updated versions for the guides for the implementation of 'Work Permits', 'Working Alone' and 'Safety Management Audit Tool  (SMAT)  visits'.  An  environmental  risk  assessment standard was circulated with a guide and training sessions were conducted. All of these implementation guides give examples  of  best  practices  on  how  to  implement  the minimum requirements and can also be used as training materials,  thus  facilitating  the  work  and  increasing  the efficiency of the EHS networks of the various countries and businesses.",

This information is prepared using standards and principles in force. These are generally accepted principles such  as  the  going  concern  principle,  the  principles  of consistent application of accounting policies, alignment of the opening balance sheet with the prior-period closing balance sheet, recognition of expenses in the same period as  the  income  to  which  they  relate,  segregation  of accounting periods and substance over form.\n\n## Accounting organization 2.6.2\n\nThe  accounting  organization  is  based  on  the  rules, methods and procedures set out in the Group's doctrine memos.  It enables the monthly  reconciliation and substantiation of the accounts and the true and fair view of the events which are represented. The organization also has an advisory role and works upstream to anticipate the accounting impacts of events and the regulatory changes that are likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe  chart  of  accounts  is  aligned  with  the  Company's needs  in  terms  of  classification  of  transactions,  and complies with the materiality principle. It is linked to the Group's Financial Information system.\n\n## Internal control 2.6.3\n\nInternal control is based on periodic assessments of the process for preparing accounting and financial information.\n\nIn addition  to  controlling  compliance  with  payment authorization procedures and the double signature rule for secure  payment  means,  the  Accounting  Department contributes to internal control by acting as guarantor in respect of responsibilities defined by General Management and  formalized  through  a  cost  accounting  system organized  by  cost  center.  Specifically, cost center managers receive monthly schedules listing the expenses incurred  under  their  signature,  allowing  them  to  check these expenses  and  also  to  compare  actual  and year-to-date expenses with the initial budget.\n\nA summary of these cost accounting reports is sent to the Finance Department and the Group's General Management at the end of each month.\n\nMeasures are implemented to strengthen the arrangements for managing accounting risks and contributing to the reliability of the financial statements.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  since  2016,  Group  units  have  been subject to a Balance Sheet Review (BSR) procedure under the direction of the Group Financial Control Department, to increase the level of accounting control by the Finance Department of each entity.\n\n## Group consolidated financial 2.6.4 statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group  Consolidation  and  Reporting  Department.  The department is also responsible for updating consolidation procedures, training, and integrating the subsidiaries into the  consolidation  process,  processing  information,  and utilizing, maintaining and developing consolidation systems  and  the  Financial  Information  System  for  the Group and for regions and HPS.\n\n## Group standards 2.6.5\n\nThe Consolidation Department is responsible for providing information  and  periodic  training  to  subsidiaries  in conjunction  with  the  Regions  and  HPS.  Using  the consolidation manual, a number of data input manuals, an intranet site and an online training application in French and English. New consolidation instructions are issued for each monthly closing, describing the changes compared with  the  previous  period-end  and  enhancements  to reporting systems, standards and procedures, in collaboration with the Group's Accounting Standards and Pension Liabilities Department.\n\nEach year, the Consolidation Department offers training sessions.\n\n## Organization of the Group's 2.6.6 consolidation process\n\nFor fiscal year 2020,  the  consolidation has been reorganized to comply with the new Group Transform & Grow  Structure.

It has been used for monthly reporting since January/uni00A02020.\n\n## Processing information and 2.6.7 control of the financial statements\n\nEach subsidiary submits its accounts in accordance with the timetable set by the Company.  The  financial statements are checked and processed at Region and HPS level, then transmitted to the Consolidation Department, which performs an overall review of the Group's financial statements  and  records  the  necessary  consolidation adjustments. These consolidated accounts are submitted to General Management every month.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are then examined by the external auditors in accordance with professional Auditing Standards.\n\n6",

Most recently, on December/uni00A030, 2020, BlackRock/uni00A0Inc., acting on behalf of customers and funds it manages, disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers -  AMF)  that  on  December/uni00A029,  2020,  it  had dropped below the threshold of 5% of the share capital of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, holding 4.96% of the share capital and 4.51% of the voting rights on behalf of those customers and funds.\n\nBlackRock,/uni00A0Inc. specified that this threshold crossing was the result of a reduction in the number of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain shares that BlackRock,/uni00A0Inc. held as collateral and took into account the holding of 408,967/uni00A0contracts for  differences  (cash  unwinding  derivatives),  without established maturity, involving an equivalent number of Saint-Gobain shares, paid exclusively in cash.\n\nIn  addition,  BlackRock/uni00A0Inc.  disclosed  that  it  also  holds 4,281,352 Saint-Gobain shares on behalf of customers who have retained the exercise of voting rights.\n\n## Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts 2.2.2 et Consignations\n\nDuring  fiscal  year  2020,  the Caisse  des  D\u00e9p\u00f4ts  et Consignations made several threshold disclosures stating that  it  had  exceeded  or  dropped  below  the  5%  legal threshold. Most recently, on December/uni00A09, 2020, the Caisse des  D\u00e9p\u00f4ts  et  Consignations disclosed  to  the  French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers -  AMF)  that  it  had  dropped,  directly  and indirectly below the threshold of 5% of the voting rights of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, holding, directly and indirectly  through  CNP  Assurances,  which  it  controls, 4.02% of the share capital and 4.88% of the voting rights.\n\nThe Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations specified that this threshold  crossing  was  the  result  of  the  return  of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain shares held as collateral by CNP Assurances.\n\n## Statutory disclosure thresholds 2.2.3\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  received  several  notifications during the year in respect of the obligation set out in the Company's  bylaws  to  disclose  any  and  all  changes  in interest to above or below 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights, or any multiple thereof. Those disclosure notifications, upwards  or  downwards,  were  received following the sale of shares or changes in Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's shares and voting rights.\n\n## Employee ownership structure 2.3\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, Group employees held 9.1% of the capital  and  15.4%  of  the  voting  rights  attached  to Compagnie  Saint-Gobain  shares  through  the  Group Savings Plan. The Funds of the Group Savings Plan are thus the Group's main shareholder.\n\nThe Group Savings Plan ( Plan d'\u00c9pargne Groupe , PEG) is a key feature of Saint-Gobain's social contract. It represents an excellent means of giving employees a stake in the Group's success and profits.\n\nIn 2020, 6,099,996/uni00A0shares were issued under a standard PEG offering Group employees two classic formulae with a five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  for  a  total  of  \u20ac140.5/uni00A0million\n\n(compared  with  5,999,997/uni00A0shares  and  \u20ac154.1/uni00A0million  in 2019).\n\nIn  France,  58.8%  of  employees  invested  in  the  PEG through  a  corporate  mutual  fund  ( fond  commun  de placement d'entreprise , 'FCPE'). Employees in 27 other European countries and 18/uni00A0countries outside Europe were also given the opportunity to take part in the PEG. In total, 41,297 Group employees participated in the PEG in 2020.\n\nA new plan will be launched in 2021. It will give employees the opportunity to acquire up to 5,922,504, i.e. just over 1% of the share capital, with a five- or ten-year lock-up.",

The  total  potential  cost  was  US$/uni00A0173/uni00A0million  at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n7",

        "page_content": "## Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic NOTE 2/uni00A0\n\nThe  Group  was  severely  affected  by  the  Covid-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020. However, trading in the second half of the year was almost back to normal levels for most of its businesses.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  measures  taken  by  the  Group  to address the crisis caused by the pandemic were the result of  both  swift  decisions  taken  locally  and  coordinated international  action  based  on  the  experience  of  our different  countries  and  in  line  with  the  Group's  new organization by country and by market.\n\nThe  measures  were  rolled  out  in  compliance  with  the Group's main priorities:\n\n- protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  employees  and /uni25A0 other stakeholders across the globe, introducing strict social  distancing  measures  adapted  to  its  different businesses and encouraging remote working wherever possible;\n- strengthening the Group's liquidity, with new sources of /uni25A0 financing  put  in  place  to  maintain  a  robust  cash position;\n- preserving  free  cash  flow  generation  through  strict /uni25A0 measures to adapt production facilities, reduce costs and discretionary spending and closely monitor working capital, and exceptionally, deciding not to pay a dividend in 2020;\n- continuing to serve our customers, with increased use /uni25A0 of digital channels since the start of the crisis, completed by the launch of new services to adapt our solutions  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  post-coronavirus world;\n- ensuring  -  well  ahead  of  time  -  that  the  necessary /uni25A0 conditions  were  in  place  for  the  restart  of  our commercial, industrial and logistics operations, allowing us to support the recovery as effectively as possible as soon as lockdown measures were lifted.\n\n## Adapting production facilities 2.1 and making use of schemes designed to support businesses hit by the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nWhile  prioritizing  the  health  and  safety  of  all  of  its employees  and  stakeholders,  the  Group  ensured  the continuity  of  its  operations  in  each  of  the  countries  in which it does business by swiftly adapting to changes in demand  linked  to  the  health  situation  and  to  local government decisions.\n\nAs well as adjusting its production levels and rolling out measures  to  cut  costs,  the  Group  also  made  use  of government-backed business support schemes. It benefited  -  mainly  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  -  from furlough schemes in the countries where such measures\n\nwere  introduced,  with  the  positive  \u20ac169/uni00A0million  impact recognized as a deduction from the corresponding salaries and payroll taxes.\n\nThe costs of the measures taken to address the Covid-19 crisis are reflected in full in operating income. These costs result  from  purchases  of  protective  equipment  (masks, hand sanitizers, tests, etc .) and from adapting production to demand (fixed costs not absorbed due to the downturn in business). Additional specific expenditure related to the Covid-19 pandemic was estimated at \u20ac88/uni00A0million (of which more than half in Europe, primarily in Southern Europe ME  &  Africa), including \u20ac62/uni00A0million for protective equipment.  The  balance  reflects  miscellaneous  costs  of travel  cancellations,  staff  overtime  and  miscellaneous outside services such as cleaning.\n\n## Management compensation\n\nIn March/uni00A02020, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and  the  Chief  Operating  Officer  wished  to  show  their solidarity  with  the  efforts  being  made  by  the  Group's employees and stakeholders impacted by the unprecedented  crisis.  Consequently,  they  informed  the Board of Directors of their decision to waive 25% of their compensation to be paid in 2020, i.e. 25% of their variable compensation in respect of the 2019 fiscal year and 25% of their  fixed  compensation  for  2020,  for  as  long  as  the Group's employees were subject to partial employment in the  context  of  the  emergency  measures  taken  by  the French Government to halt the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.  At  their  April/uni00A022,  2020  and  April/uni00A023,  2020 respective  meetings,  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors acknowledged this decision and unanimously praised it. Upon proposal of the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief Operating  Officer,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to review and reduce accordingly their variable compensation due in respect of the 2019 fiscal year and their fixed compensation for 2020.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided,  in  its  April/uni00A023,  2020 meeting  and  in  a  similar  move  of  solidarity  as  the executive corporate officers, to join this effort by also reducing by 25% the amount of the compensation that will be due to the Directors for the same period as for the executive corporate officers.\n\nThe  amounts  corresponding  to  these  compensation reductions  were  donated  by  Saint-Gobain  to  the  Paris public  hospitals  foundation  ( Fondation  de  L'Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, or APHP) for an amount of \u20ac305,000, to charities supporting vulnerable populations affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, namely the humanitarian medical association 'The Alliance for International  Medical  Action'  (ALIMA),  the Abb\u00e9  Pierre Foundation, the Secours Populaire , and to employees in extreme difficulty in Brazil.",

        "page_content": "## Strengthening the Group's 2.2 liquidity\n\n## New sources of financing\n\nFrom March, the Group bolstered the structure of its debt in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, reinforcing its sources of financing through:\n\n- a  \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion bond  issued  on  April/uni00A03,  consisting  of /uni25A0 \u20ac750/uni00A0million with a 3-year maturity and a 1.75% coupon and \u20ac750/uni00A0million with a 7.5-year maturity and a 2.375% coupon;\n- a syndicated credit line totaling \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, including /uni25A0 \u20ac1/uni00A0billion  drawn  for  a  bond  repayment  of  the  same amount at the end of March, in addition to \u20ac4.0/uni00A0billion in confirmed and undrawn back-up credit lines;\n- access  to  the  new  commercial  paper  Pandemic /uni25A0 Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) launched by the European Central Bank on March/uni00A018, 2020.\n\nIn light of its robust cash position in the second half of the year, at the end of September the Group canceled the short-term  syndicated  credit  line  it  had  arranged  in March/uni00A02020 for an initial amount of \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, which had been subsequently reduced to \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion (undrawn) at the end of June.\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\nGiven the context of the coronavirus pandemic and the introduction  of  furlough  measures,  during  its  April/uni00A023, 2020  meeting,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  not  to recommend any dividend distribution to the June/uni00A04, 2020 Shareholders'  Meeting.  Although  the  Group  recently further strengthened its liquidity, the Board of Directors considered that this exceptional decision was in the best interests  of  the  Group  and  its  stakeholders,  given  the uncertainty as to the impact and duration of the crisis, and the caution required at this time.\n\nAs announced in April, the Board of Directors' meeting of November/uni00A026,  2020  reviewed  the  Group's  shareholder return policy. Based on the sales and results growth in the third quarter and the good start to the fourth quarter, the Board announced that it would be recommending to the June/uni00A03, 2021 Shareholders' Meeting that it set the dividend in respect of 2020 - payable in June/uni00A02021 - at \u20ac1.33 per share, to be paid in cash, i.e., the level of the dividend paid in June/uni00A02019.\n\nThe Board of Directors also confirmed that it would be maintaining its policy of favoring a dividend in cash and targeting a normalized dividend payout rate representing between 35% and 40% of recurring net income, a rate that will be exceeded for the dividend payable in respect of 2020.\n\n## Other specific measures taken to strengthen the Group's liquidity\n\nAs the economic situation gradually improves in certain countries, the Group's sale of its interest in Sika at the end of May helped boost cash by \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion (see note/uni00A03.2, 'Changes in Group structure').\n\nVarious countries benefited from postponements of tax and social security payments, with the exception of France where these measures were not used. At December/uni00A031, 2020, there were no longer any significant amounts of deferred tax and social security payments within the Group.\n\n## Impairment review in light 2.3 of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\n- Impairment review of property, plant and equipment /uni25A0 and intangible assets\n\nThe  impacts  of  the  pandemic  -  though  much  less significant in the second half - were taken into account when measuring these assets at the reporting date, using the approach described in note/uni00A06.5. The start of 2021 has validated the projections used for the impairment tests at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n- Impairment review of other non-current assets /uni25A0\n\nThe impacts of the Covid-19 health crisis were also taken into account when measuring other non-current assets. In particular, this led to adjustments in the carrying amount of investments in equity-accounted companies to reflect their estimated value.\n\n- Impacts  of  the  Covid-19  crisis  on  the  recognition  of /uni25A0 deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards\n\nDue to short-term uncertainties related to the Covid-19 health  crisis,  the  Group  measured  deferred  tax  assets based on an analysis of the tax position in each country concerned. The additional reduction in deferred tax assets on  tax  loss  carryforwards  in  France  recognized  in  an amount of \u20ac58/uni00A0million at end-June/uni00A02020 was maintained at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n- Impairment  review  of  current  assets:  impacts  of  the /uni25A0 Covid-19 pandemic on impairment provisions for trade accounts receivable and on the value of inventories\n\nThe review of trade accounts receivable in light of the Covid-19 crisis did not highlight any major default risks (see note/uni00A04.4.2 'Operating and non-operating receivables and payables').\n\nFixed costs relating to idle capacity attributable to the Covid-19 crisis were not included in calculating the value of inventories and were classified within operating items.\n\n8",

It did not have a material impact on the Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n- Impacts  of  the  Covid-19  crisis  on  the  calculation  of /uni25A0 supplier and customer discounts\n\nThe consequences of the Covid-19 health crisis were taken into  account  when  calculating  supplier  discounts  to  be recognized in operating income (as a deduction from cost of  sales)  by  entities  in  the  Distribution  business  (see note/uni00A04.1.3 'Business income') and customer discounts to be recognized as a deduction from sales by entities in the Industry business.\n\n- Reduction in business travel costs /uni25A0\n\nOperating  income  includes  business  travel  cost  savings resulting from the reduction in, or cancellation of, business trips in most countries where the Group does business.\n\n- Provisions for management bonuses /uni25A0\n\nIn  first-half/uni00A02020,  budgeted  management  bonuses  were revised  in  light  of  the  impact  of  Covid-19  on  annual earnings forecasts. As earnings improved in the second half of the year, the provisions were adjusted accordingly at December/uni00A031, 2020 (see note/uni00A05.4.3).\n\nThe impacts described above reflect the current Covid-19 environment. 2020 was a year of stark contrasts, with the strong negative impacts of the pandemic in the six months to June/uni00A030 partly countered by more limited impacts in the second half. These impacts may change in the coming months  depending  on  the  pandemic's  development, duration, magnitude and available medical treatment, as well  as  on  its  consequences  for  the  Group's  partners (customers, suppliers, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## Scope of consolidation NOTE 3/uni00A0\n\n## Accounting principles related 3.1 to consolidation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of  Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain and  of  all companies controlled by the Group, as well as those of jointly controlled companies and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence.\n\n## Consolidation methods 3.1.1\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  exercises  exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nJoint  arrangements  that  meet  the  definition  of  joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method. Balance sheet  and  income  statement  items  relating  to  joint arrangements that meet the definition of joint operations are consolidated line-by-line based on the amount actually contributed by the Group.\n\n## Equity accounting\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  directly  or  indirectly exercises significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  the  income  of  equity-accounted companies is shown on two separate lines of the income statement.  The  income  of  equity-accounted  companies whose  main  business  activity  is  in  keeping  with  the Group's core operational business is presented in business income  under  'Share  in  net  income  of  core  business equity-accounted companies' while the income of other equity-accounted companies is shown under 'Share in net income of non-core business equity-accounted companies' in pre-tax income.\n\n## Business combinations 3.1.2\n\n## Step acquisitions and partial disposals\n\nWhen the Group acquires control of an entity in which it already holds an equity interest, the transaction is treated as a step acquisition (an acquisition in stages), as follows: (i)/uni00A0as a disposal of all the previously-held interest, with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the consolidated financial statements, and (ii)/uni00A0as an acquisition of all of the shares, with recognition of the corresponding goodwill  on  the  entire  interest  (previous  and  new acquisitions).\n\nWhen  the  Group  disposes  of  a  portion  of  an  equity interest  leading  to  the  loss  of  control  (but  retains  a non-controlling interest), the transaction is also treated as both  a  disposal  and  an  acquisition,  as  follows:  (i)/uni00A0as  a disposal  of  the  entire  interest,  with  recognition  of  any resulting gain  or  loss  in  the  consolidated  financial statements, and (ii)/uni00A0as an acquisition of a non-controlling interest, measured at fair value.\n\n## Potential voting rights and share purchase commitments\n\nwhether  the  Group  exclusively  controls  an  entity  only when the Group has control.\n\nWhen  calculating  its  percentage  interest  in  controlled companies, the Group considers the impact of cross put and call options on minority interests in the companies concerned. This approach gives rise to the recognition in the financial statements of an investment-related liability, included within other provisions and non-current liabilities, corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  the  estimated exercise  price  of  the  put  option,  with  a  corresponding reduction  in  non-controlling  interests  and  shareholders' equity. Any subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized by adjusting equity.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A010, non-controlling interests are considered as a shareholder category (single economic entity approach). As a result, changes in minority interests with no loss of control  continue  to  be  recorded  in  the  statement  of changes  in  equity  and  have  no  impact  on  the  income statement or balance sheet, except for changes in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Non-current assets and liabilities held for 3.1.3 sale - Discontinued operations\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  that  are  immediately  available  for sale, and for which a sale is highly probable within the next 12/uni00A0months, are classified as non-current  assets  and liabilities held for sale. When several assets are held for sale in a single transaction, they are accounted for as a disposal group, which also includes any liabilities directly associated  with  those  assets.  The  assets  or  disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation/amortization ceases when non-current assets are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately on two lines of the consolidated balance sheet, and income and expenses continue to be recognized in the consolidated income statement on a line-by-line basis. The reclassified assets are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to  sell  and  their  net  book  value.  At  the  end  of  each reporting period, the value of the assets and liabilities held for sale is reviewed to determine whether any provision adjustments should be recorded due to a change in their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAn  operation  is  classified  as  discontinued  when  it represents a separate major line of business for the Group, and when the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale have been met, or when the Group has sold the asset. Discontinued operations are reported on a single line in the  Group's  income  statement.  This  line  shows  the after-tax net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal and the gains or losses net of taxes realized on the disposals of these operations. In addition, cash flows generated by the discontinued operations are reported, by type of operation, on a separate line in the consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows  for  the  relevant periods.\n\nPotential  voting  rights  conferred  by  call  options  on minority interests are taken into account in determining\n\n8",

        "page_content": "2020 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Intragroup transactions 3.1.4\n\nAll  intragroup  transactions  in  the  balance  sheet  and income statement are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Translation of the financial statements 3.1.5 of foreign companies\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in euros,  which  is  Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain's  functional and presentation currency.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone are  translated  into  euros  at  the  closing  exchange  rate, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\n\nThe Group's share of any translation gains or losses is included in equity under 'Cumulative translation adjustments' until the assets or liabilities and all foreign operations  to  which  they  relate  are  sold,  liquidated  or deconsolidated. In this case, these translation differences are either taken to the income statement, if the transaction results in a loss of control, or recognized directly in the statement of changes in equity, if the change in minority interests does not result in a loss of control.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions 3.1.6\n\nExpenses and income from operations in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are translated at the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  transaction  date. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and  any  exchange differences are recorded  in  the  income  statement. However,  exchange  differences  relating  to  loans  and borrowings between consolidated Group companies are recorded  in  equity,  net  of  tax,  under  'Cumulative translation  adjustments',  as  they  are  in  substance  an integral part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\n\n## Hyperinflation 3.1.7\n\nUnder  IAS/uni00A029,  'Financial  Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary Economies',  financial  statements  prepared  based  on historical cost must be restated. This involves applying a general price index that enables the financial statements to  be  presented  in  the  measuring  unit  in  force  at  the reporting date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities must therefore  be  adjusted  for  inflation  in  order  to  reflect changes  in  purchasing  power  at  the  reporting  date. Similarly, the income statement is adjusted for inflation during  the  period.  Monetary  items  do  not  need  to  be restated as they already reflect purchasing power at the reporting date.\n\n## 3.1.7.1 Argentina\n\nArgentina  has  been  classified  as  a  hyperinflationary economy since July/uni00A01, 2018. IAS/uni00A029 therefore applies to entities  using  the  Argentine  peso  as  their  functional\n\ncurrency  (based  on  the  table  of  indices  issued  by FACPCE).\n\n## 3.1.7.2 Lebanon\n\nThe  financial  and  political  crisis  in  Lebanon  has  been growing since the end of 2019. As a result, inflation in the country has risen sharply, topping 100% in 2020 compared to a rate of 10% or lower up to the end of 2019 (since December/uni00A01997, the Lebanese pound has been indexed to the  US  dollar  at  USD/uni00A01  =  LBP/uni00A01,507.5).  Since  economic forecasts do not anticipate any improvement in the short term, Lebanon has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy  since  October/uni00A02020.  As  from  December/uni00A031, 2020, IAS/uni00A029 is therefore applicable to entities using the Lebanese pound as their functional currency. However, as the Group's exposure to Lebanon is not material (sales in the country represent less than 1% of total Group revenue), IAS/uni00A029 will be applied to the Group's Lebanese companies with effect from January/uni00A01, 2021.\n\n## Changes in Group structure 3.2\n\nSignificant changes in the Group's structure during 2020 and  2019  are  presented  below  and  a  list  of  the  main consolidated companies at December/uni00A031, 2020 is provided in note/uni00A014 'Principal consolidated companies'.\n\n## Transactions carried out in 2020 3.2.1\n\nIn 2020, Saint-Gobain acquired 13 consolidated companies for a total purchase price of \u20ac1,229/uni00A0million. The Group also sold  six  consolidated  companies  for  a  sale  price  of \u20ac11/uni00A0million.\n\n## 3.2.1.1 Main acquisitions in 2020\n\nAcquisitions in 2020 represent full-year sales of around \u20ac500/uni00A0million and \u20ac110/uni00A0million in Ebitda.\n\n- On  January/uni00A030,  2020,  Saint-Gobain  announced  that /uni25A0 Continental  Building  Products  (NYSE:  CBPX),  a  key player in the plasterboard industry in North America, obtained  shareholder  approval  to  be  acquired  by Saint-Gobain and that the American anti-trust authorities authorized the transaction. The acquisition was finalized on February/uni00A03, 2020.\n\nUpon  completion  of  the  operation,  Saint-Gobain acquired  all  of  the  shares  of  Continental  Building Products  for  US$37.00  per  share  in  a  transaction valued at approximately US$1.4/uni00A0billion (around \u20ac1.3/uni00A0billion).\n\nThe process of identifying and measuring the assets acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  their  fair  value began  during  first-half  2020  and  was  finalized  at December/uni00A031,  2020.  Goodwill  relating  to  Continental Building Products cannot  be  amortized  for  tax purposes and its amount as measured by the Group is final.",

The acquisition  broadens  the  Group's  product  portfolio, allowing it to provide innovative solutions to a wider customer base.\n\nThis acquisition represents pro forma full-year sales of \u20ac421/uni00A0million (USD/uni00A0480/uni00A0million) and \u20ac98/uni00A0million (USD/uni00A0112/uni00A0million) in Ebitda for 2020.\n\n- On September/uni00A01, 2020, Saint-Gobain acquired Strikolith /uni25A0 in  the  Netherlands,  a  company  specialized  in  the production  of  external  insulation  systems,  interior finishings and renovation products and solutions. The complementarity of Strikolith with Saint-Gobain's existing  businesses  enhances  the  Group's  range  of solutions  in  External  Thermal  Insulation  Composite Systems (ETICS) and in construction chemicals in the Netherlands.\n- On  September/uni00A07,  2020,  Saint-Gobain  acquired  two /uni25A0 subsidiaries of the family-owned  MS  Group:  MS Techniques, which specializes in high-precision tubing for medical applications, and Transluminal, a specialist in  R&D  and  sales  in  the  area  of  minimally  invasive catheter design expertise for OEMs.\n\nThe Group began its process of identifying and measuring the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  their  fair value within the scope of the Strikolith and MS Group acquisitions  during  the  last  quarter  of  2020  and  will finalize the purchase price accounting within 12/uni00A0months of the acquisition date.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Main disposals and deconsolidations in 2020\n\nDisposals  in  2020  represent  full-year  sales  of  around \u20ac130/uni00A0million.\n\nThe main company  deconsolidations in 2020  are summarized below:\n\n- following the commencement of the proceeding under /uni25A0 Chapter/uni00A011 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January/uni00A023, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  and  its wholly-owned subsidiary Millwork & Panel/uni00A0LLC were no longer consolidated in the Group's financial statements (see note/uni00A08.2.2.2 on the asbestos-related liabilities in the United States). This did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated income;\n- on  March/uni00A010, 2020,  Saint-Gobain  divested  part  of /uni25A0 Glasssolutions, its glass processing business in Germany, to DIK Deutsche Industriekapital/uni00A0GmbH;\n- in May/uni00A02018, Saint-Gobain  had  acquired  a  10.75% /uni25A0 interest  in  Sika  indirectly  through  the  acquisition  of 100%  of  Schenker-Winkler  Holding/uni00A0AG  (SWH)  shares held  by  the  Burkard  family,  as  part  of  a  global agreement  with  the  Burkard  family  and  Sika  (see Section/uni00A05.4.2, Chapter/uni00A02 of the 2018 Registration Document and Section/uni00A02.2, note/uni00A02 to the consolidated financial statements in Chapter/uni00A08 of the 2019 Universal Registration Document).\n\nFollowing expiration of the two-year lock-up period set out in the May/uni00A02018 agreement with Sika, and as Sika decided  not  to  exercise  its  right  of  first  offer,  on May/uni00A027, 2020  Saint-Gobain  announced  that  it  had completed the sale of approximately 15.2/uni00A0million Sika shares held through its subsidiary SWH, representing its entire 10.75% stake in Sika's share capital, for a total amount of CHF/uni00A02.56/uni00A0billion (\u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion). The sale took the form  of  a  private  placement  with  qualified institutional investors.\n\nThe shares in Sika were classified as equity investments, and the Group chose to recognize changes in the fair value of the shares within other comprehensive income directly in equity.\n\n8",

Disposals represented full-year sales of around \u20ac2.9/uni00A0billion.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale 3.3\n\nOn  November/uni00A09,  2020,  Saint-Gobain  announced  that  it had  entered  into  exclusive  negotiations  with  Mutares, listed in Frankfurt, in preparation for the sale of Lapeyre (Southern  Europe  -  ME  &  Africa  segment),  its  home improvement business in France, on the basis of a firm and binding offer. This important step sets in motion a period of consultations and approvals (particularly with employee representatives),  with  the  transaction  expected  to  be completed in the first half of 2021. The Group will inject \u20ac245/uni00A0million into Lapeyre in order to give it a strong cash position ahead of its sale.\n\nSimilarly, on January/uni00A04, 2021, Saint-Gobain announced that it was  in  exclusive  negotiations  with  BME  (Building Materials Europe) in preparation for the sale of Saint-Gobain  Distribution  The  Netherlands  (SGD  NL, Southern  Europe  -  ME  &  Africa  segment).

The transaction is subject to approval by the European competition authorities and  to  communication  and consultation  obligations  with  regard  to  the  employee representatives of the relevant Dutch entities. The sale is expected to be finalized by the end of 2021.\n\nThese  disposals  are  part  of  Saint-Gobain's  portfolio optimization strategy, which is designed to improve the Group's growth and profitability profile.\n\nSince  the  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  meet  the qualifying  criteria  (see  Section/uni00A03.1.3),  the  balance  sheet accounts  of  Lapeyre  and  SGD  NL  were  combined  and measured within assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated  balance  sheet  at  December/uni00A031,  2020,  in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05. For confidentiality reasons, the position of each individual company at December/uni00A031, 2020 is not disclosed. These entities in the process of being sold were not considered as discontinued operations within the meaning of IFRS/uni00A05 as they do not represent a major line of business for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Information concerning the Group's operating activities NOTE 4/uni00A0\n\n## Income statement items 4.1\n\n## Revenue recognition 4.1.1\n\nRevenue generated by the sale of goods or services is recognized net of rebates, discounts and sales taxes when control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer. Revenue generated by the sale of goods is primarily recognized at the time the goods are delivered. Revenue generated by the sale of services is recognized when the services have been rendered, or based on the stage of completion of the services, as calculated based on costs incurred. Similarly, within the Distribution entities, estimated  returns  are  recognized  as  a  deduction  from revenue (sales) and reclassified within inventories for their net carrying amount, since there is a possibility that goods will be returned within the allotted timeframe. A liability relating  to  future  refunds  for  goods  returned  is  also recognized.\n\nRevenue  generated  under  construction  contracts  is accounted for by the Group's companies on a percentage-of-completion  basis,  as  calculated  based  on costs incurred. The related costs are expensed as incurred. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately.\n\nConstruction contract revenues are not material in relation to total consolidated sales.\n\n## Operating income 4.1.2\n\nOperating income is a measure of the performance of the Group's different reporting segments and has been used by the Group as its key external and internal management indicator  for  many  years.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are included in operating income, as are changes in the fair value of financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting when they relate to operating items. The share of income of core business equity-accounted companies is also posted under operating income.\n\nSupplier discounts granted to entities in the Distribution business are included in operating income as a reduction of  cost  of  sales.  Contractual  supplier  discounts  are customary  practice  in  the  industrial  goods  distribution sector. These discounts are mostly calculated by applying a  contractually  guaranteed  rate  by  product  type  to volumes purchased. The calculation is made automatically, based  on  the  supplier  invoices.  Consequently,  little judgment is needed when determining the amounts to be recognized in the income statement for these discounts. Other discounts are calculated based on a step mechanism  linked  to  specified  targets,  whereby  the percentage discount increases as the entity achieves the various targets over a given period. In this case, judgment\n\nis required based on historical data, past performance and future trends in order to determine the discount to be recognized  in  the  income  statement.  Such  judgment  is exercised in a prudent manner and consistently from one period to the next.\n\n## Business income 4.1.3\n\nBusiness income includes all income and expenses other than financial income and expense, the Group's share in net income  of  non-core  business  equity-accounted companies, and income taxes.\n\nBusiness income is detailed by type below:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                                                                                        | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                                                                                                                   | 38,128   | 42,573   |\n| Personnel expenses:                                                                                                     |          |          |\n| Salaries and payroll taxes/uni00A0 (1)                                                                                  | (7,625)  | (8,336)  |\n| Share-based payments/uni00A0 (2)                                                                                        | (45)     | (33)     |\n| Pensions and employee benefit  obligations/uni00A0 (2)                                                                  | (222)    | (158)    |\n| Depreciation and amortization of property,  plant and equipment, intangible assets and  right-of-use assets/uni00A0 (3) | (1,902)  | (1,901)  |\n| Share in net income of core business  equity-accounted companies                                                        | 13       | 24       |\n| Other/uni00A0 (4)                                                                                                       | (25,492) | (28,779) |\n| OPERATING INCOME                                                                                                        | 2,855    | 3,390    |\n| Other business income                                                                                                   | 88       | 196      |\n| Other business expense/uni00A0 (3)                                                                                      | (1,511)  | (1,033)  |\n| OTHER BUSINESS INCOME AND EXPENSE                                                                                       | (1,423)  | (837)    |\n| BUSINESS INCOME                                                                                                         | 1,432    | 2,553    |",

Based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at December/uni00A031 (536,452,195/uni00A0shares in 2020 and 542,079,771/uni00A0shares in 2019), recurring earnings per share amounted to \u20ac2.74 in 2020 and \u20ac3.53 in 2019.\n\nThe  difference  between  net  income  and  recurring  net income corresponds to the following items:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                                                                                                             | 2020    | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| GROUP SHARE OF NET INCOME                                                                                                                    | 456     | 1,406  |\n| Less:                                                                                                                                        |         |        |\n| Gains (losses) on disposals of assets                                                                                                        | (28)    | (2)    |\n| Impairment of assets and other                                                                                                               | (1,007) | (414)  |\n| Changes in provisions for non-recurring  items                                                                                               | (42)    | (128)  |\n| Impact of non-controlling interests                                                                                                          | 1       | (1)    |\n| Tax on disposal gains and losses, asset  impairment, non-recurring provisions and  write-downs of deferred taxes on tax loss  carry-forwards | 62      | 36     |\n| GROUP SHARE OF RECURRING NET  INCOME                                                                                                         | 1,470   | 1,915  |\n\n## Working capital 4.4\n\nWorking capital can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                                                   | Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| INVENTORIES, NET                                                                   | 5,362                  | 6,200                  |\n| TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET                                                     | 4,597                  | 4,813                  |\n| Other operating receivables                                                        | 1,206                  | 1,471                  |\n| Other non-operating receivables                                                    | 63                     | 138                    |\n| OTHER RECEIVABLES, NET                                                             | 1,269                  | 1,609                  |\n| CURRENT TAX RECEIVABLE                                                             | 147                    | 194                    |\n| TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE                                                             | 5,897                  | 6,000                  |\n| Other operating payables                                                           | 3,454                  | 3,457                  |\n| Other non-operating payables                                                       | 457                    | 547                    |\n| OTHER PAYABLES                                                                     | 3,911                  | 4,004                  |\n| CURRENT TAX LIABILITIES                                                            | 175                    | 156                    |\n| Operating working capital                                                          | 1,814                  | 3,027                  |\n| Non-operating working capital (including  current tax receivables and liabilities) | (422)                  | (371)                  |\n| WORKING CAPITAL                                                                    | 1,392                  | 2,656                  |\n\n## Inventories 4.4.1\n\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes purchase costs  (net  of  supplier  discounts),  processing  costs  and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is generally determined using the weighted-average cost method, and in some  cases  the  First-In-First-Out  (FIFO)  method. Inventory costs may also include the transfer from equity of  any  gains/losses  on  qualifying  cash  flow  hedges  of foreign currency purchases of raw materials. Net realizable value is the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated completion and selling costs. No account is taken in the inventory valuation process of the impact of below-normal capacity utilization rates.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2020  and  2019,  inventories  were  as follows:\n\n| (in EUR million)                       | Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Gross value                            |                        |                        |\n| Raw materials                          | 1,368                  | 1,494                  |\n| Work in progress                       | 308                    | 344                    |\n| Finished goods                         | 4,170                  | 4,856                  |\n| GROSS/uni00A0INVENTORIES               | 5,846                  | 6,694                  |\n| Provisions for impairment              |                        |                        |\n| Raw materials                          | (175)                  | (191)                  |\n| Work in progress                       | (15)                   | (16)                   |\n| Finished goods                         | (294)                  | (287)                  |\n| TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR/uni00A0IMPAIRMENT | (484)                  | (494)                  |\n| INVENTORIES, NET                       | 5,362                  | 6,200                  |",

Impairment  losses  on  inventories recorded in the 2020 income statement totaled \u20ac222/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0\u20ac229/uni00A0million). Reversals of impairment losses on inventories amounted to \u20ac175/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac198/uni00A0million).\n\nThe decrease in inventories at December/uni00A031, 2020 reflects the close monitoring of purchases and production during and outside lockdown periods, coupled with solid sales towards the end of the year.\n\n## Operating and non-operating receivables 4.4.2 and payables\n\nTrade  accounts  receivable  and  payable  and  other receivables  and  payables  are  stated  at  their  carrying amount,  which  approximates  their  fair  value  as  they generally  have  maturities  of  less  than  three  months. Provisions for impairment are booked to cover the risk of total or partial non-recovery, within the limit of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group deems that its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to its diversified business line-up, broad customer base and global presence. Past-due trade receivables  are  regularly  monitored  and  analyzed,  and impairment losses recognized are adjusted where appropriate.\n\nThe  Group  has  various  securitization  and  factoring programs for its trade receivables.

As  a  result,  no provision has been recorded in this respect in the Group's financial statements.\n\n2021/uni00A0marks  the  start  of  Phase/uni00A0IV  of  the  CO2  emissions market (EU ETS).

There  are  also  additional pension obligations in certain Group companies, both in France and in other countries.\n\nThe Group's obligation for the payment of pensions and length-of-service awards is determined at the end of the reporting  period  by  independent  actuaries  using  the projected unit credit method (taking into account changes in salaries until retirement) and the economic conditions in each  country.  These  obligations  may  be  financed  by pension funds, with a provision recognized in the balance sheet for the unfunded portion.\n\nWhen plan assets exceed the defined benefit obligation, the excess is recognized in other non-current assets under 'Net pension assets'. The asset ceiling corresponds to the maximum future economic benefit. Changes in the asset ceiling are recognized in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments and the difference between the funds' actual and estimated (calculated) rates of return. They are recognized against equity as and when they arise.\n\nThe interest cost of these obligations and the return on the related plan assets are measured by the Group using the discount rate applied to estimate the obligation at the beginning of the period, and are recognized as financial income or expense.\n\nThe Group's main defined benefit plans are as follows:\n\nIn France, employees receive length-of-service awards on retirement based on years of service and the calculation methods prescribed in the applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn addition to length-of-service awards, there are three defined benefit plans, all of which are final salary plans. These  plans  were  closed  to  new  entrants  by  the companies concerned between 1969 and 1997. Effective March/uni00A01, 2012,  a  defined  benefit  plan  complying  with Article/uni00A0L.137-11 of France's Social Security Code ( Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ) was set up by Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain.  Pursuant  to  an  order  of  July/uni00A04,  2019 issued in the wake of France's Pacte law setting out an action plan for business growth and transformation, this plan  was  closed  and  any  vested  rights  frozen  at December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nIn Germany, retirement plans provide pensions and death and disability benefits for employees. These plans have been closed to new entrants since 1996. Since January/uni00A01997, new employees have been offered pension plans based on contributions financed jointly by employer and employee.\n\n8",

These defined benefit plans - which are based on employees' average salaries over their final years of employment have been closed to new entrants since 2001.\n\nIn  the  United  States  and  Canada,  the  Group's  defined benefit plans are final salary plans. Since January/uni00A01, 2001, new employees have been offered a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the United States and Spain, retired employees receive benefits other than pensions, mainly concerning healthcare benefits. The Group's obligation under these plans  is  determined  using  the  actuarial  method  and  is covered by a provision recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits cover all other employee benefits. These benefits primarily include long-service awards in France, jubilee awards in Germany,\n\ndeferred  compensation,  provisions  for  social  security benefits in the United States, and termination benefits in different countries. The related defined benefit obligation is generally calculated on an actuarial basis using the same rules as for pension obligations. Actuarial gains and losses relating to these benefits are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions used to measure 5.3.2 defined benefit obligations and plan assets\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Interest rate assumptions\n\nAssumptions related to mortality, employee turnover and future  salary  increases  take  into  account  the  economic conditions specific to each country and Group company. The discount rates are established by region or country based on observed bond rates at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nFor  the  Eurozone,  two  discount  rates  were  calculated based on the term of the plans using a yield curve model developed by the consultants Mercer: one rate for plans with a term of 14/uni00A0years or less and one for plans with a term of over 14/uni00A0years.\n\nThe rates used in 2020 for the Group's main plans are the following:\n\n|                  | France           | France          | Eurozone         | Eurozone        | United Kingdom   | United States   |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term plans | Long-term plans | Short-term plans | Long-term plans |                  |                 |\n| Discount rate    | 0.70%            | 1.11%           | 0.70%            | 1.11%           | 1.20%            | 2.30%           |\n| Salary increases |                  | 3.10%           |                  | 1.20% to 2.30%  | 2.00%*           | 3.00%           |\n| Inflation rate   |                  | 1.50%           |                  | 0.90% to 1.60%  | 2.15%            | 2.20%           |\n\nThe rates used in 2019 for the Group's main plans were the following:\n\n|                  | France           | France          | Eurozone         | Eurozone        | United Kingdom United States   | United Kingdom United States   |       |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term plans | Long-term plans | Short-term plans | Long-term plans |                                |                                |       |\n| Discount rate    | 1.01%            | 1.39%           | 1.01%            | 1.39%           | 2.00%                          |                                | 3.20% |\n| Salary increases |                  | 2.50%           |                  | 1.80% to 2.40%  |                                | 2.00%*                         | 3.00% |\n| Inflation rate   |                  | 1.50%           |                  | 1.00% to 1.70%  |                                | 1.90%                          | 2.20% |\n\nAs the above three regions account for substantially all of the pension obligation, the revised actuarial assumptions, notably the discount and inflation rates, contributed to an increase in the obligation, and therefore the provision, in an amount of \u20ac1,070/uni00A0million.\n\nThe  actual  return  on  plan  assets  for  almost  all  plans amounts to \u20ac1,290/uni00A0million. It is \u20ac1,086/uni00A0million higher than the expected return, leading to a decrease in the provision of the same amount.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Sensitivity of assumptions\n\nA 0.5-point decrease (increase) in the discount rate would lead to an increase (decrease)  in  defined  benefit obligations of around \u20ac210/uni00A0million for the United States\n\nplans, \u20ac190/uni00A0million for the Eurozone plans and \u20ac480/uni00A0million for the United Kingdom plans. A 0.5-point increase  in  the  inflation  rate  would  lead  to  an  overall increase in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac610/uni00A0million.\n\nThe  same  assumptions  concerning  mortality,  employee turnover  and  interest  rates  are  used  to  determine  the Group's  defined  benefit  obligations  for  other  long-term employee benefits. In the United States, retirees' healthcare costs are projected to rise between 4.50% and 5.59% per year, depending on the age of the beneficiary. A 1-point increase in this rate would lead to an increase of around  \u20ac30/uni00A0million in the  related  projected  benefit obligation.",

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint-Gobain shares at a preferential subscription price. These shares are held either directly or through the employee saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject to a mandatory five- or ten-year lock-up, except following the occurrence of certain events. The Board of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain. It corresponds to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20/uni00A0trading days preceding the date  of  the  decision,  subject  to  a  20%  discount,  in\n\naccordance  with  applicable  laws, the Shareholders' Meeting Resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  compensation  cost  recorded  in  accordance  with IFRS/uni00A02 is measured by reference to the fair value of a discount offered on restricted stock ( i.e. , stock subject to a lock-up).  The  cost  of  the  lock-up  for  the  employee  is defined as the cost of a two-step strategy that involves first selling the restricted stock forward five or ten years and then purchasing the same number of shares on the spot market and financing the purchase with debt. The borrowing cost is estimated at the rate that would be charged by a bank to an individual with an average risk profile for a general-purpose, five- or ten-year consumer loan  repayable  at  maturity.  The  cost  of  the  plans  is recognized in full at the end of the subscription period.\n\nIn  2020,  Saint-Gobain  implemented  a  new  PEG  ( Plan \u00c9pargne Groupe ). The terms of the 2020/uni00A0PEG are identical to the 2019/uni00A0PEG and are described below.\n\nIn 2020, 6,099,996 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription price of \u20ac23.03 (2019: 5,999,997/uni00A0shares at an average  price  of  \u20ac25.69),  representing  a  share  capital increase  of  \u20ac139/uni00A0million  (\u20ac153/uni00A0million  in  2019),  net  of transaction fees.\n\nAn amount of \u20ac3.7/uni00A0million was expensed in respect of the plans in 2020, compared to a zero expense in 2019 owing to the lock-in cost.\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  main  features  of  the standard plans, the amounts invested in the plans and the valuation assumptions applied in 2020 and 2019:\n\n| /uni00A0                                                                         | 2020                                         | 2019                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Plan characteristics                                                             |                                              |                                              |\n| Date of Shareholders' Meeting                                                    | June/uni00A06, 2019 (17th/uni00A0Resolution) | June/uni00A07, 2018 (17th/uni00A0Resolution) |\n| Date of the Chief Executive Officer's decision fixing the subscription price     | June/uni00A015                               | March/uni00A018                              |\n| Plan duration  (in years)                                                        | 5 or 10                                      | 5 or 10                                      |\n| Reference price  (in EUR)                                                        | 28.79                                        | 32.11                                        |\n| Subscription price  (in EUR)                                                     | 23.03                                        | 25.69                                        |\n| Discount  (in %)                                                                 | 20.00%                                       | 20.00%                                       |\n| Total discount on the date of the Chief Executive Officer's decision  (in %) (a) | 24.57%                                       | 22.02%                                       |\n| Employee investments (in EUR million)                                            | 140.5                                        | 154.1                                        |\n| Total number of shares subscribed                                                | 6,099,996                                    | 5,999,997                                    |\n| Valuation assumptions (5-year maturity)                                          |                                              |                                              |\n| Interest rate applicable to employees*                                           | 4.80%                                        | 4.85%                                        |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                                          | -0.45%                                       | -0.17%                                       |\n| Repo rate                                                                        | 0.29%                                        | 0.48%                                        |\n| Lock-up discount  (in %) (b)                                                     | 21.77%                                       | 22.11%                                       |\n| Total cost to the Group  (in %) (a-b)                                            | 2.80%                                        | -0.09%                                       |\n\n- A 0.5-point decline in borrowing costs for the employee would increase the expense as calculated in accordance with IFRS/uni00A02 by \u20ac2.2/uni00A0million in * 2020.\n\nAs the introduction of the new PEG was postponed compared to previous years due to the pandemic, the capital increase took place in August/uni00A02020.\n\n8",

During this period, none of the options received may be exercised. Options must be exercised  within  10/uni00A0years  of  the  grant  date.  Except  in specified circumstances, grantees forfeit these options if they leave the Group.\n\nAmong the plans outstanding at December/uni00A031, 2020, the 2012/uni00A0plan offers subscription options, while the 2013, 2015 and 2016 plans offer purchase options. For plans launched in 2017 and 2018, the Board of Directors has decided that it  would  determine  the  type  of  option  (subscription  or purchase) at the latest on the day before the start of the exercise period, with any options exercised prior to such decision considered as subscription options.\n\nSince 2009, a performance condition has applied for all grantees in plans.\n\nAs in 2019, no stock options were awarded in 2020.\n\nThe following table presents changes in the number of outstanding options:\n\n| /uni00A0                                         | \u20ac4 par value shares   |   Average exercise price (in EUR) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2018 | 1,848,007             |                             38.78 |\n| Options granted                                  | 0                     |                              0    |\n| Options exercised                                | (310,204)             |                             36.33 |\n| Options forfeited                                | (480,281)             |                             37.4  |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2019 | 1,057,522             |                             40.12 |\n| Options granted                                  | 0                     |                              0    |\n| Options exercised                                | 0                     |                              0    |\n| Options forfeited*                               | (212,998)             |                             40.43 |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2020 | 844,524               |                             40.04 |\n\n- Including 206,498/uni00A0options granted under the 2016/uni00A0stock option plan * that lapsed because the performance conditions were not met, and 6,500/uni00A0options relating to rights under said plan that were withdrawn.\n\nThe  cost  of  stock  option  plans  is  calculated  using  the Black & Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe following inputs were used:\n\n- volatility assumptions  that  take  into  account  the /uni25A0 historical  volatility  of  the  share  price  over  a  rolling 10-year period, as well as implied volatility from traded share options.

These plans are subject to eligibility criteria based on the grantee's period of service (service conditions) with the Group as well as performance criteria (performance conditions), which are described below. The IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0share-based payment expense takes into account these criteria as well as the lock-up feature. It is recognized over the vesting period, which covers a maximum of four years.\n\nSince 2012, performance unit plans have been set up for certain employees in France. These plans are also subject to service and performance conditions. The IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0share-based payment expense therefore takes into account these factors, as well as the fact that the units are cash-settled. IFRS/uni00A02/uni00A0stipulates that for cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the granted instruments are initially measured at fair value at the grant date, then remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with  the  expense  adjusted  accordingly  pro  rata  to  the rights that have vested at the reporting date. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the rights.\n\nIn the exceptional circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and in light of the structure of the long-term compensation plans (performance condition appreciated over a three-year period and importance of the operating income through the ROCE criterion), the decrease in the Group's operating income in 2020 due to the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic would have had a major impact on  the  long-term  compensation  plans  implemented  in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the beneficiaries concerned (almost 2,200 Group employees) have seen a sharp decrease in other components of their compensation tied to earnings figures (in particular the operating income) or due to solidarity measures.\n\nAs permitted by the AFEP-MEDEF Code in exceptional circumstances, and pursuant to the plans which grant the Board of Directors powers to adjust targets in the event of\n\nsuch exceptional circumstances justifying so, the Board recognized the need to offset - at least partially - the significant impact of this unprecedented global event of an exceptional scale in order to ensure:\n\n- - the motivation and retention of the beneficiaries of the affected plans; and\n- -  that  the  interests  of  the  beneficiaries  and  those  of shareholders  remain  aligned  (since  the  ROCE  criterion cannot be met and has no further effect);\n\nwhich are the key goals of the plans.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also taken into account the fact that on average over the past five years, Saint-Gobain has been in the lower quartile of CAC/uni00A040 companies in terms  of  its  effective  burn  rate, i.e. , the  number  of performance shares that vest after applying performance conditions  (source:  Willis  Towers  Watson  study).  The Board chose only to partially offset the impacts of the pandemic for its performance share plans - which concern over 2,000/uni00A0employees - and not for its stock option plans for 2017, 2018 or 2019, which are nonetheless also severely impacted.\n\nActing on a proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and in order to maintain a contingency with respect to the achievement of the ROCE criterion over full-year/uni00A02020, the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain, at its meeting on September/uni00A024, 2020, decided  to  partially  offset  the  impact  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic on operating income for 2020 by excluding the impact recognized in the first half of the year/uni00A02020 only.\n\nThe Board therefore maintained the challenging aspect and  seriousness  of  the  ROCE  criterion  by  allowing  the uncertainties  of  the  second  half  of  the  year/uni00A02020  to remain.\n\nSubject to the above, it should be noted that no changes were  made  to  the  affected  plans  (2017,  2018,  and 2019/uni00A0plans).\n\n## 5.4.3.1 Performance share plans\n\nAt  December/uni00A031, 2020,  there  were  four  outstanding performance share plans, approved by the Board of Directors in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and on November/uni00A026, 2020. A total of 1,420/uni00A0shares remain to be delivered under the  2016/uni00A0plan in  connection  with  ongoing  succession\n\n8",

IFRS allows a 12-month period after the acquisition date ('measurement period') to identify the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity that were not recognized in  the  initial  accounting  for  the  combination,  and  to retroactively modify the amounts initially allocated.\n\nThe final acquisition price ('consideration transferred' in IFRS/uni00A03R), including,  as  appropriate,  the  estimated  fair value  of  any  earn-out  payments  or  other  deferred consideration ('contingent consideration' in IFRS/uni00A03R), is determined  in  the  12/uni00A0months  following  the  acquisition. Under IFRS/uni00A03R, any adjustments to the acquisition price beyond this 12-month period are recorded in the income statement.  Directly  attributable  acquisition  costs  are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn addition, goodwill is recognized only at the date that control is achieved. Any subsequent increase in ownership\n\ninterest  (without  change  of  control)  is  recorded  as  a change in equity without adjusting goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between (i)/uni00A0the acquisition-date fair value plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree  -  measured  either  at  fair  value  (full  goodwill method) or at the proportionate interest in the fair value of  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  (partial  goodwill method) - and (ii)/uni00A0the net amount of assets and liabilities acquired at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Group generally applies the partial goodwill method and the amount of goodwill calculated under the full goodwill method is not therefore material.\n\nAny excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the assets and liabilities of the acquired  entity  is  recorded  as  goodwill.  Any  negative difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value  of  the  net  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  is recognized in the income statement during the year of acquisition.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2020 and 2019 are detailed below:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                           | Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| At January/uni00A01                                        |                        |                        |\n| Gross value                                                | 12,495                 | 12,396                 |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (2,466)                | (2,406)                |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 10,029                 | 9,990                  |\n| Changes during the year                                    |                        |                        |\n| Impairment                                                 | (201)                  | (104)                  |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation | (484)                  | 138                    |\n| Changes in Group structure                                 | 719                    | 5                      |\n| Assets held for sale                                       | (35)                   | 0                      |\n| TOTAL CHANGES                                              | (1)                    | 39                     |\n| At December/uni00A031                                      |                        |                        |\n| Gross value                                                | 12,229                 | 12,495                 |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (2,201)                | (2,466)                |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 10,028                 | 10,029                 |\n\nIn 2020,  changes  in  Group  structure  mainly  reflect first-time consolidations  following  the  acquisition  of Continental Building Products (see note/uni00A03.2) for \u20ac637/uni00A0million and of MS Techniques and Transluminal. They also result from acquisitions carried out at the end of 2019 (consolidated in 2020), in particular High Tech Metal Seals (HTMS)  and  Sonex.  Impairment  losses  amount  to \u20ac201/uni00A0million, relating  mainly  to  the  United  Kingdom Distribution business and assets held for sale (see note/uni00A06.5 on impairment reviews). Currency translation adjustments primarily  reflect  the  impacts  of  fluctuations  in  the  US dollar, pound sterling, Brazilian real, Norwegian krone, Thai baht and South African rand.\n\nIn  2019,  changes  in  Group  structure  related  mainly  to newly consolidated companies and deconsolidated\n\ndivested companies, and concern all segments. Impairment essentially concerned assets sold in the year. The  2019  translation  adjustments  and  restatements  for hyperinflation primarily reflected the impacts of fluctuations in the pound sterling, US dollar, Thai baht, Argentine peso, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona.\n\n## Other intangible assets 6.2\n\nOther intangible assets primarily include brands, customer relationships, intellectual property, software, patents and development costs. They are measured at historical cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.\n\n8",

These brands are not amortized but are tested systematically for impairment on an annual basis. Other brands are amortized over their useful lives, not exceeding 40/uni00A0years.\n\nCustomer  relationships  are  amortized  over  the  attrition period used to valuate these assets.\n\nCosts incurred to develop software in-house - primarily configuration,  programming  and  testing  costs  -  are\n\nrecognized as intangible assets. Patents and purchased computer  software  are  amortized  over  their  estimated useful lives, not exceeding 20/uni00A0years for patents and three to five years for software.\n\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs meeting the recognition criteria under IAS/uni00A038 are included  in  intangible  assets  and  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives (not exceeding five years) from the date

These provisions are reviewed periodically and may be discounted over the expected  useful  lives  of  the  assets  concerned.  The component is depreciated over the same useful life as that used for mines and quarries.\n\nGovernment grants for purchases of property plant and equipment are recorded under 'Other payables' and taken to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of the  relevant  assets.  They  are  included  within  operating items on the line corresponding to the nature of the asset.\n\nChanges in property, plant and equipment in 2020 and 2019 are analyzed below:\n\n| (in EUR

        "page_content": "2020 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn 2020, changes in Group structure relate mainly to the first-time consolidation of Continental Building Products. Translation adjustments and restatements for hyperinflation primarily reflect the impacts of fluctuations in the Brazilian real, US dollar, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, pound sterling, Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Argentine peso.\n\nIn  2019,  changes  in  Group  structure  related  to  newly consolidated  companies  and  deconsolidated  divested companies,  and  concern  all  segments.  Impairment  was essentially recognized on assets sold in the year. The 2019 translation adjustments and restatements for hyperinflation primarily reflected the impacts of fluctuations  in  the  pound  sterling,  US  dollar,  Argentine peso, Mexican peso and Russian ruble.\n\n## Right-of-use assets linked to 6.4 leases\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group has chosen to apply IFRS/uni00A016 using the full retrospective method at January/uni00A01, 2019 (i.e., with effect  from  January/uni00A01,  2018)  and  has  restated  all  of  its leases that were identified ahead of first-time application of the standard. Entities' historical lease contracts were restated with effect from the date on which the entities were first consolidated by the Group.\n\nThe  following  recognition  exemptions  proposed  by IFRS/uni00A016 have been used by the Group:\n\n- leases with a lease term of 12/uni00A0months or less; /uni25A0\n- leases where the underlying asset has a value of less /uni25A0 than US$5,000 when new.\n\n## Property leases\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period of the lease, plus any renewal (or termination) options that the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  (or  not  to exercise).  The  Group  determined  whether  or  not  lease renewal (or termination) options were reasonably certain to  be  exercised  based  on  the  location  of,  and  any improvements  inseparable  from,  the  leased  asset.  The lease term at inception for '3/6/9-year' commercial leases in  France  is  generally  nine  years.  The  Group  did  not identify any material leases with similar characteristics in other countries.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2019  and  with  retroactive  effect  from January/uni00A01, 2018, Saint-Gobain took account of the IFRIC's November/uni00A02019 agenda decision in reviewing the terms of its automatically renewable leases, considering the importance of the underlying assets to its operations.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the incremental  borrowing  rate.  This  rate  is  applied  at  the commencement of the lease or at the date of the decision to  renew  the  lease.  The  Group  calculated  the  rate applicable  to  each  lease  contract  on  the  basis  of  its duration, which reflects the payment profile of the lease liability.\n\nThe useful life of non-movable leasehold improvements cannot exceed the useful life of the right-of-use assets to which they relate.\n\n## Leases other than property leases\n\nThe  main  leases  identified  correspond  to  leases  of vehicles, machinery and production equipment.\n\nThe lease capitalization period (lease term) represents the non-cancelable period of the lease. Where leases provide for a renewal  (or  termination) option, the Group determined whether or not that option was reasonably certain to be exercised based on the ease with which the leased asset could be replaced and its criticality.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the lease liability is calculated using the same approach as for property leases.\n\nThe  implicit  interest  rate  of  the  lease  is  used  as  the discount  rate  only  in  the  case  of  non-property  lease contracts  and  only  if  the  legal  documentation  of  the contract stipulates it explicitly.\n\nAlthough  leases  can  generally  incorporate  indexation clauses,  lease  liabilities  are  measured  based  solely  on indexes known at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2020, right-of-use assets under leases relate mainly to land and buildings for \u20ac2,367/uni00A0million and to machinery and equipment for \u20ac535/uni00A0million.\n\nLease payments made under low-value and/or short-term leases,  along  with  variable  lease  payments  or  lease payments  falling  outside  the  scope  of  IFRS/uni00A016,  totaled \u20ac108/uni00A0million in 2020 (\u20ac115/uni00A0million in 2019).",

These tests consist of comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less  costs  to  sell  and  its  value  in  use,  calculated  by reference to the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.\n\nFor property, plant and equipment, amortizable intangible assets  and  right-of-use  assets,  an  impairment  test  is performed whenever revenues from the asset decline or the asset generates operating losses due to either internal or  external  factors,  and  no  material  improvement  is forecast  in  the  annual  budget  or  the  relevant  business plan.\n\nFor  goodwill  and  other  unamortized  intangible  assets (including brands with indefinite useful lives), an impairment test is performed at least annually based on financial forecasts. Goodwill is reviewed systematically and exhaustively  at  the  level  of  each  cash-generating  unit (CGU).\n\nIn 2020, the Group had 27/uni00A0CGUs compared to 28 in 2019, following Lapeyre's classification within assets and liabilities held for sale (see note/uni00A03.3). Note that SGD The Netherlands does not represent a separate CGU.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their net carrying amount.\n\nThe method used for these impairment tests is consistent with  that  employed  by  the  Group  for  the  valuation  of companies acquired in business combinations or acquisitions of equity interests. The carrying amount of the CGUs is compared to their value in use, corresponding to the  net  present  value  of  future  cash  flows  excluding interest but including tax. It is determined  using assumptions  made  by  senior  management  based  on estimates and judgments including future changes in sales, profitability, investments and other cash flows arising from the  use  of  the  corresponding  assets,  as  well  as  the discount rate applied to future cash flows. Cash flows for the last year of the business plan beyond the three-year forecast period are rolled forward over the following two years. For impairment tests of goodwill, normative cash flows (corresponding to cash flows at the mid-point in the business cycle) are then projected to perpetuity using a low  annual  growth  rate  (between  1.5%  and  2%  barring exceptional cases). The average cost of capital remained unchanged in 2020, at 6.85%. This rate corresponds to the\n\n8",

The discount rates applied in 2020 were 6.85% for Western Europe and North America, 7.85% for Eastern Europe and emerging Asia-Pacific and 8.75% for South America, Russia and the Middle East.\n\n## CGU impairment tests 6.5.2\n\nWhen  the  annual  impairment  test  reveals  that  the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\nImpairment  losses  on  goodwill  can  never  be  reversed through income. For property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, an impairment loss recognized in prior  periods  may  be  reversed,  taking  into  account depreciation/amortization  adjustments,  if  there  is  an indication that the impairment no longer exists and that the recoverable amount of the asset concerned exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nDuring the impairment  tests, different assumptions measuring  the  method's  sensitivity  are  systematically tested using the following inputs:\n\n- 0.5-point increase or decrease in the discount rate /uni25A0 applied to cash flows;\n- 0.5-point increase or decrease in the annual average /uni25A0 rate of growth in cash flows projected to perpetuity;\n- 1-point  decrease  in  the  operating  income  rate  for /uni25A0 Industrial activities and 0.5-point decrease for Distribution activities.\n\nThe first half of 2020 was markedly affected by Covid-19, prompting a sharp downturn in trading between March and the end of May. However, the extent of the downturn was different for each CGU. In Europe, which represents more  than  two-thirds  of  the  Group's  sales,  trading bottomed out in April before rallying gradually but firmly as from mid-May.\n\nIn these unprecedented circumstances, the Group analyzed impairment at June/uni00A030 based on qualitative inputs ( i.e. , the feasibility and long-term viability of each CGU's business model - potentially involving a downward revision of normative business and profitability inputs - as well as the potential magnitude and duration of the crisis triggered by Covid-19) and quantitative inputs (analysis of existing headroom at December/uni00A031, 2019 and the known\n\nsensitivity of each CGU to a change in the discount rate, perpetuity growth rate and profitability rate). Based on this analysis, it distinguished between:\n\n- CGUs impacted in the short term by the Covid-19 crisis, /uni25A0 but essentially in line with wider economic trends, and whose medium- to long-term outlook appears to be unaffected;\n- CGUs which were already considered as 'sensitive' at /uni25A0 December/uni00A031, 2019.  These  CGUs  were  tested  for impairment at end-June.\n\nThe sustained pace of business in the second half of 2020 and the recovery for most of the Group's CGUs validated the Group's decision as of June/uni00A030 not to consider the Covid-19 pandemic in itself as evidence of impairment.\n\nIn this respect, the projections used for the impairment tests for 2021 consider a return to close to normal trading levels.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, a 0.5-point increase in the discount rate  for  all  CGUs  would  have  led  to  approximately \u20ac22/uni00A0million in additional impairment of non-current assets, concerning  mainly  the  United  Kingdom  Distribution business, while a 0.5-point decrease in the average annual cash flow growth rate projected to perpetuity for all CGUs would  have  resulted  in  additional  non-current  asset impairment of around \u20ac6/uni00A0million, also mainly affecting the Distribution business in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe impact of a 1-point decrease in the operating income rate for all Industrial CGUs  would  have  generated additional non-current asset impairment  of  roughly \u20ac149/uni00A0million, primarily  relating  to  entities  in  the  Pipe business  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  Flat  Glass  entities  in Southern  Europe.  A  0.5-point  decrease  in  the  rate  for Distribution  activities  would  have  generated  additional impairment of around \u20ac167/uni00A0million for the United Kingdom Distribution business.\n\nOwing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group decided to perform an additional one-off sensitivity analysis, incorporating broader criteria, i.e. :\n\n- 0.75-point  increase  or  decrease  in  the  discount  rate /uni25A0 applied to cash flows;\n- a 1.5-point decrease in the operating income rate for /uni25A0 Industrial activities and a 1-point decrease for Distribution activities.",

The  impairment  reflects  several factors  which  adversely  affect  the  CGU's  short-  to medium-term outlook. These include increased competition exacerbated by stronger pressure on margins and profitability, in turn amplified by the impact of the Covid-19  crisis  on  the  Group's  first-half/uni00A02020  results. Despite an upturn in trading volumes in the second half of the year, the outlook for this business remains cautious owing  to  Brexit-related  uncertainties.  The  assumptions used at June/uni00A030 remained relevant at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe  Group  confirms  the  medium-term  recovery  and profitability outlook for its three Pipe CGUs. The CGUs remain  sensitive  to  a  change  in  the  discount  rate, perpetuity growth rate and profitability rate to the same extent as at December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nThe  value  of  assets  held  for  sale  was  adjusted  in  the context of their announced sale (see note/uni00A03.3), which led to the recognition of an impairment loss for an amount of \u20ac235/uni00A0million, including \u20ac34/uni00A0million relating to goodwill.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## 8.1.1 Provisions for claims and litigation\n\nThe  decrease  in  provisions  for  claims  and  litigation  at December/uni00A031, 2020 primarily reflects the deconsolidation of  DBMP/uni00A0LLC,  which  carried  on  its  books  the  legacy asbestos-related  claims  against  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation. The offsetting entry for this decrease is a rise in provisions for other risks, which mainly results from the financing commitments undertaken by CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC in favor of DBMP/uni00A0LLC (see notes/uni00A08.1.6 and 8.2.2.2 discussing asbestos-related liabilities in the United States).\n\nProvisions  for  claims  and  litigation  essentially  covered PFOA-related  proceedings  and  asbestos  lawsuits  filed against the Group in the United States. These provisions are  described  in  further  detail  in  note/uni00A08.2  'Contingent liabilities and litigation'.\n\n## 8.1.2 Provisions for environmental risks\n\nThese  provisions  cover  costs  relating  to  environmental protection  measures,  as  well  as  site  rehabilitation  and clean-up costs.\n\n## 8.1.3 Provisions for restructuring costs\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs amounted to \u20ac129/uni00A0million  at  December/uni00A031,  2020  (December/uni00A031,  2019: \u20ac98/uni00A0million), including net additions of \u20ac105/uni00A0million during the year.\n\n## 8.1.4 Provisions for personnel expenses\n\nThese  provisions  primarily  cover  indemnities  due  to employees that are unrelated to the Group's reorganization plans.\n\n## 8.1.5 Provisions for customer warranties\n\nThese provisions cover the Group's commitments under warranties  granted  to  customers  mainly  in  the  United States. They are determined on a statistical basis using a range  of  criteria  and  take  into  account  contractual warranty payments made in prior years in the business and region concerned. In addition, specific provisions may be set aside for identified contingencies in the context of a specific claim.\n\n## 8.1.6 Provisions for other contingencies\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, provisions for other contingencies amount to \u20ac524/uni00A0million (December/uni00A031, 2019: \u20ac162/uni00A0million) and  mainly  concern  the  United  States  (\u20ac411/uni00A0million), France (\u20ac38/uni00A0million) and Brazil (\u20ac32/uni00A0million).\n\n## 8.1.7 Investment-related liabilities\n\nInvestment-related liabilities correspond to commitments to  purchase  minority  interests,  liabilities  relating  to  the acquisition of shares in Group companies, and minority shareholder puts.\n\nIn 2020, changes in investment-related liabilities primarily concerned minority shareholder puts.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and litigation 8.2\n\n## 8.2.1 Antitrust law and related proceedings\n\n## 8.2.1.1 Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November/uni00A02011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May/uni00A02014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe  total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is CHF/uni00A080/uni00A0million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF/uni00A028.8/uni00A0million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May/uni00A02, 2016 and continues to firmly refute the claims made.  The  hearing  took  place  before  the  Federal Administrative Court on January/uni00A021, 2020 and the date on which  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  will  issue  its decision is not yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December/uni00A031, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## 8.2.1.2 Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July/uni00A028, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement  of  objections  to  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May/uni00A011, 2016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for  further  investigation  in  light  of  the  arguments  put forward by Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain. In October/uni00A02018, Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.\n\nSaint-Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain rejected the allegations in their response to the second statement of objections filed in January/uni00A02019.\n\nA new report was sent by the Authority at the end of 2019, which gave rise to comments  in  response  from Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain on February/uni00A011, 2020.\n\nThe hearing before the Competition Authority was held on October/uni00A06, 2020. By decision dated January/uni00A014, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive  practices  were  not  established  and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nThe period opened for lodging an appeal is pending as of the closing date of these financial statements.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March/uni00A02013  a damages  claim  on  Saint-Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre Scientifique  et  Technique  du/uni00A0B\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before the Paris Civil Court ( Tribunal de grande instance ) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority.  In  an  order  dated  December/uni00A016,  2014,  the pre-trial  judge  declared  a  stay  of  proceedings  while waiting for the decision from the Competition Authority, procedure which remains stayed as of the closing date of these financial statements.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## 8.2.2 Asbestos-related litigation\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## 8.2.2.1 Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, seven further individual lawsuits were filed in 2020 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) of Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM - which in the past had carried out fiber-cement operations -for asbestos-related occupational diseases that affect or have affected them. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 837 such lawsuits had been issued against the two companies since  1996  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary compensation over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 800 of these 837/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed in terms of both liability and quantum. In all  these  cases,  the  employers  were  held  liable  on  the grounds of 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nCompensation paid by Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM in settlement of these lawsuits totaled approximately \u20ac6.2/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to \u20ac5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nConcerning  the  37/uni00A0lawsuits  outstanding  against  Everite and  Saint-Gobain  PAM  as  of  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the procedures relating to the merits of all the cases were at different  stages,  with  five  in  the  process  of  being investigated by the French Social Security authorities and 32 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ) or Appeal Courts.\n\nIn addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, 258 similar suits had been filed since the outset of the litigation by current or former employees, or persons claiming through them, of 13 French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies  that  are  no  longer  part  of  the  Group),  in particular  by  current  or  former  employees  who  used equipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect  themselves against heat from furnaces.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 224/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed. In 141 of these cases, the employer was held liable for 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nAt the same date, compensation paid by these companies totaled  approximately  \u20ac8.7/uni00A0million  as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020 (compared to \u20ac8/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nAs regards the 34/uni00A0suits outstanding as of December/uni00A031, 2020, five  cases  were  still  being  investigated  by  the French Social Security authorities, 28 were being tried including 22 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ), five before the Appeal Courts and one before the Cour  de  cassation . Lastly,  one  action  has  been cancelled but the plaintiff may request its restoration at any time within a two-year period following its cancellation.\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's French subsidiaries, including six that operate or have operated facilities in France classified as containing asbestos, are the subject of damages claims that are different from those described above.\n\n'Facilities classified as containing asbestos' are defined as industrial  facilities,  that  have  been  closed  or  are  still operating, which previously manufactured materials containing  asbestos  or  used  protection  and  insulation equipment containing asbestos and that are included by ministerial  decree  on  the  official  list  of  facilities  whose current or former employees  are  entitled to the early-retirement benefit paid to asbestos workers (ACAATA).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 824/uni00A0lawsuits had been brought  by  current  or  former  employees  claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of  their  alleged  exposure  to  asbestos.  None  of  these plaintiffs were suffering from an asbestos-related disease and  some  of  them  were  not  receiving  the  ACAATA benefit.  Of  these  824/uni00A0suits,  721  have  been  definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of \u20ac7.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (as at December/uni00A031, 2019). The  remaining  103/uni00A0lawsuits are pending before the Amiens Appeal Court.\n\nIt should be clarified that the above figures do not take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe  provision  related  to  asbestos-related  litigation  in France amounted to around \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to  \u20ac4.1/uni00A0million as  of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## 8.2.2.2 Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western  District  of  North  Carolina  in  Charlotte.  The purpose  of  the  filing  is  to  achieve  a  certain,  final  and equitable Resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP/uni00A0LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section/uni00A0524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial numbers of asbestos-related claims - to achieve a fair and equitable Resolution of its asbestos-related  liabilities.  Upon  establishment  of  the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will  be  able  to  receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally resolve DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately 3 to 8/uni00A0years, all asbestos litigation will be stayed and all related costs suspended, providing  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  with  the  time  and  protection  to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.",

        "page_content": "This action was taken as a result of the increasing risks presented in the US tort system. Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims  against  DBMP/uni00A0LLC,  with  no  foreseeable  end  in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\n## Impact on the Group's financial statements\n\nFollowing the commencement of the proceeding under Chapter/uni00A011  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January/uni00A023, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel/uni00A0LLC,  and  in particular the provision for asbestos-related litigation in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC and DBMP/uni00A0LLC by which CertainTeed/uni00A0LLC  has  agreed  to  fund  the  costs  of  the Chapter/uni00A011 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent DBMP/uni00A0LLC is unable to do so in full, the  Group  recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial statements  a  debt  against  DBMP/uni00A0LLC  amounting  to USD/uni00A0432/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  income  for  2020  is  not impacted by the ongoing Chapter/uni00A011 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result of this bankruptcy proceeding, all legal costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in  relation  to  such  claims  have  been  taken  in  2020 (USD/uni00A099/uni00A0million, corresponding to \u20ac88/uni00A0million, in 2019).\n\n## 8.2.2.3 Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former  employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from asbestos-related occupational illnesses are offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200/uni00A0contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  A  first instance decision was rendered in connection with the first suit in July/uni00A02020, rejecting the claims of the plaintiffs. The latter have nevertheless appealed the decision. The suit related to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered  in  September/uni00A02020  partly  in  favor  of  the\n\nplaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted  to  the  plaintiffs,  for  an  amount  reduced  to BRL/uni00A05/uni00A0million (\u20ac0.8/uni00A0million). Brasilit has  appealed  the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November/uni00A02017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## 8.2.3 Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured by these plants. SG PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  both  completed  and  on-going  construction  of water  line  extensions  in  certain  communities  in  the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going  and  the  scope  of  responsibility  for  SG  PPL arising  from  environmental  remediation  and  clean-up obligations at these sites has not yet been established. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG PPL.\n\nOn  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company  in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac31.2/uni00A0million.\n\n8",

The Inquiry is conducting its work in two phases: its phase/uni00A01 report was published on October/uni00A030, 2019 and phase/uni00A02 commenced in January/uni00A02020 and is expected to continue into 2022. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in connection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until\n\nor  after  December/uni00A031,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry - have been issued and have been, or are expected to be, stayed prior to the service of full pleadings, in view of the ongoing Public Inquiry. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability  in  connection  with  the  production,  marketing, supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently  unclear  and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## 8.2.5 Other proceedings and disputes\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses (see note/uni00A04.5.2). Apart from the proceedings and  litigation  described  above,  to  the  best  of  the Company's  knowledge,  no  other  government,  court  or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12/uni00A0months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group.\n\n## Financing and financial instruments NOTE 9/uni00A0\n\n## Financial risks 9.1\n\n## 9.1.1 Liquidity risk\n\n## 9.1.1.1 Liquidity risk on financing\n\nIn a crisis environment, the Group might be unable to raise the financing or refinancing needed  to  cover  its investment plans on the credit or capital markets, or to obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\n\nThe Group's overall exposure to liquidity risk on its net debt is managed  by  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department of Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain, the Group's parent company. The subsidiaries generally enter into shortor long-term financing arrangements with Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain  or  with  the  regional  cash pools.\n\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that the Group's financing will be rolled over at maturity and to optimize borrowing costs. Long-term debt therefore systematically represents a high percentage of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such a way that replacement capital market issues are spread over time.\n\nThe  Group's  main  source  of  long-term  financing  is constituted  by  bond  issues  which  generally  are  issued under the Medium Term Notes program. The Group also\n\nuses lease financing, perpetual bonds, participating securities, a long-term securitization program and bank borrowings.\n\nShort-term  debt  is  composed  of  borrowings  under Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP), and occasionally Euro Commercial Paper and US Commercial Paper, but also includes receivables securitization programs  and  bank  financing.  The  Group  also  has factoring programs. Financial assets comprise marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCompagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain's liquidity position is secured by confirmed syndicated lines of credit.\n\nA breakdown of long- and short-term debt by type and maturity  is  provided  in  note/uni00A09.3,  which  also  details  the main  characteristics  of  the  Group's  financing  programs and confirmed credit lines.\n\nSaint-Gobain's long-term debt issues have been rated BBB with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's since April/uni00A030, 2014 and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's since June/uni00A02, 2014.\n\nThere  is  no  guarantee  that  the  Company  will  be  in  a position to maintain its credit risk ratings at current levels. Any deterioration in the Group's credit risk rating could limit its capacity to raise funds and could lead to higher rates of interest on future borrowings.",

To reduce liquidity and high volatility risks,  whenever  possible,  the  Group  invests  in  money market and/or bond funds.\n\n## 9.1.2 Financial counterparty credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of default by the financial institutions  that  manage  its  cash  or  other  financial instruments, since such default could lead to losses for the Group.\n\nThe  Group  limits  its  exposure  to  risk  of  default  by  its counterparties by dealing solely with reputable financial institutions and regularly monitoring their credit ratings. However, the credit quality of a financial counterparty can change rapidly, and a high credit rating cannot eliminate the risk of a rapid deterioration of its financial position. As a result, the Group's policy in relation to the selection and monitoring  of  its  counterparties  is  unable  to  entirely eliminate exposure to a risk of default.\n\nTo limit the Group's exposure to counterparty credit risk, the  Treasury  and  Financing  Department  deals  primarily with counterparties with a long-term rating of A- or above from Standard & Poor's or A3 or above from Moody's. Concentrations of credit risk are also closely monitored to ensure that they remain at reasonable levels, taking into account the relative CDS ('Credit Default Swap') level of each counterparty.\n\n## 9.1.3 Market risks\n\n## 9.1.3.1 Energy and commodity risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  changes  in  the  price  of  the energy  it  consumes  and  the  raw  materials  used  in  its activities. Its energy and commodity hedging programs may  be  insufficient  to  protect  the  Group  against significant or unforeseen price swings that could result from the prevailing financial and economic environment.\n\nThe  Group  may  limit  its  exposure  to  energy  price fluctuations by using swaps and options to hedge part of its fuel oil, natural gas and electricity purchases. The swaps and  options  are  mainly  contracted  in  the  functional currency of the entities concerned. Hedges of fuel oil, gas and  electricity  purchases  are  contracted  in  accordance with the Group's purchasing policy.\n\nThese hedges (excluding fixed-price purchases negotiated directly with suppliers by the Purchasing Department) are generally arranged by the Group Treasury and Financing Department (or with regional Treasury Departments) in accordance with instructions received from the Purchasing Department.\n\n2020 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFrom time to time, the Group may enter into contracts to hedge purchases of certain commodities or engage in the CO2  emissions  market,  in  accordance  with  the  same principles as those outlined above for energy purchases.\n\nNote/uni00A09.4 provides a breakdown of instruments used to hedge energy and commodity risks.\n\n## 9.1.3.2 Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Group's  overall  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  on consolidated  debt  is  managed  by  the  Treasury  and Financing Department of Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain.\n\nThe  Group's  policy  is  aimed  at  fixing  the  cost  of  its medium-term debt against interest rate risk and optimizing borrowing costs. According to Group policy, the derivative financial instruments used to hedge these risks  can  include  interest  rate  swaps,  cross-currency swaps, options - including caps, floors and swaptions and forward rate agreements.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  sensitivity  at  December/uni00A031, 2020 of pre-tax income and pre-tax equity to fluctuations in the interest rate on the Group's net debt after hedging:\n\n| (in EUR million)                           | Impact on pre-tax income   | Impact on pre-tax equity   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Interest rate increase of 50               |                            |                            |\n| basis points                               | 27                         | 5                          |\n| Interest rate decrease of 50  basis points | (27)                       | (5)                        |\n\nNote/uni00A09.4 to the consolidated financial statements provides a breakdown of interest rate risk hedging instruments and of gross debt by type of interest (fixed or variable) after hedging.\n\n## 9.1.3.3 Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe currency hedging policies described below could be insufficient to protect the Group against unexpected or sharper  than  expected  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates resulting from economic and financial market conditions.\n\nForeign exchange risks are managed by hedging virtually all transactions entered  into by  Group  entities  in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the particular  entity.  Compagnie  de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain  and  its subsidiaries  may  use  forward  contracts  and  options  to hedge  exposures  arising  from  current  and  forecast transactions.\n\n8",

Premiums  and  issuance  costs  are amortized using the effective interest method.\n\n## 9.3.1.2 Short-term debt\n\nBesides the current portion of long-term debt described above, short-term debt includes financing programs such as  commercial  paper,  short-term  securitization,  bank\n\noverdrafts and other short-term financial liabilities including the fair value of derivatives related to debt and accrued interest on borrowings.\n\nShort-term debt, excluding derivatives related to debt, is measured at amortized cost at the end of the reporting period. Premiums and issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 9.3.1.3 Lease liabilities\n\nLease  liabilities  represent  obligations  to  make  lease payments in accordance with IFRS/uni00A016.\n\n## 9.3.1.4 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  mainly  consist  of  bank accounts  and  marketable  securities  that  are  short-term (i.e.,/uni00A0generally with maturities of less than three months), highly liquid investments readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nMarketable securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n8",

The amount paid per security in 2020 was \u20ac60.60, paid in two installments (\u20ac27.25 and \u20ac33.35).\n\nThese participating securities are not redeemable and the interest paid on them is reported under financial costs.\n\n## 9.3.6 Financing programs\n\nThe Group has a number of medium- and long-term financing programs (Medium-Term Notes) and short-term financing programs (Commercial Paper).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the state of these programs is as follows:\n\n| (in EUR million)      | Authorized drawings    | Authorized limits at Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Balance outstanding at Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Balance outstanding at Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Medium Term Notes     | 1 to 30/uni00A0years   | 15,000                                      | 11,149                                        | 11,129                                        |\n| NEU CP                | up to 12/uni00A0months | 4,000                                       | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n| US Commercial Paper   | up to 12/uni00A0months | 815*                                        | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n| Euro Commercial Paper | up to 12/uni00A0months | 815*                                        | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n\nIn accordance with market practices, Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP), US Commercial Paper and Euro Commercial Paper are generally issued with maturities of one to six months. They are treated as variable-rate debt since they are rolled over at frequent intervals.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "## 9.3.7 Syndicated lines of credit\n\nCompagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain has two syndicated lines of credit that are intended to provide a secure source of financing for the Group (including as additional backing for its NEU  CP,  US  Commercial  Paper  and  Euro Commercial Paper programs):\n\n- a  \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion  syndicated  line  of  credit,  maturing  in /uni25A0 December/uni00A02024, after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options;\n- a  second  \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion  syndicated  line  of  credit  also /uni25A0 maturing in December/uni00A02024 after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options.\n\nBased on the Group's current credit rating for long-term debt, the two facilities are not subject to any covenants. Neither of these two lines of credit was drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nAnother  short-term  line  of  credit  was  arranged  on March/uni00A022, 2020  for  an  initial  amount  of  \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, maturing  in  March/uni00A02021. This  line  was  canceled  on September/uni00A016, 2020.\n\n## 9.3.8 Receivables securitization programs\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  two  receivables  securitization programs,  one  through  its  French  subsidiary  Point.P Finances  GIE,  and  the  other  through  its  US  subsidiary, Saint-Gobain Receivables Corporation.\n\nThe  French  program,  covering  an  amount  of  up  to \u20ac500/uni00A0million, represented \u20ac500/uni00A0million at both December/uni00A031, 2020 and December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\nBased  on  observed  seasonal  fluctuations  in  receivables included in the program and on the contract's features, \u20ac280/uni00A0million of this amount is classified as long term and the remaining balance as current.\n\nThe  US  program  was  set  up  on  July/uni00A030,  2020  for  a maximum amount of USD/uni00A0400/uni00A0million. Its value amounts to \u20ac144/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## 9.3.9 Collateral\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, \u20ac1/uni00A0million of Group debt is secured by various non-current assets (real estate and securities).\n\n## 9.3.10 Factoring\n\nThe Group has set up several trade receivables factoring programs. Based on an analysis of the risks and rewards as defined by IFRS/uni00A09, the Group has derecognized virtually all of the receivables sold under these programs. A total of \u20ac368/uni00A0million  factored  receivables  were  derecognized  at December/uni00A031, 2020, compared to \u20ac471/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2019.\n\n## 9.3.11 Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group analyzed the impact of the reform of interbank offered  rates  (IBOR)  on  its  financial  instruments.  No significant impact was identified for the instruments used. On November/uni00A019, 2020, the Shareholders' Meeting ratified an  amendment  to  the  1984  participating  securities' issuance  contract.  Pursuant  to  this  amendment,  the interest  on  these  securities  will  now  be  calculated  by reference to six-month Euribor and no more to six-month EUR Libor.\n\n## Financial instruments 9.4\n\nThe Group uses interest rate, foreign exchange, energy, commodity and equity derivatives to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and energy, commodity and equity prices that may arise in the normal course of business.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A032 and IFRS/uni00A09, all such instruments are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value, irrespective of whether or not they are part of a hedging relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting under IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  both  derivatives  that  are designated  and  qualified  as  fair  value  hedges  and derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting during the period are taken to the income statement (in business  income  and  expense  for  operational  foreign exchange  derivatives  and  commodity  derivatives  not qualifying  for  hedge  accounting,  and  in  net  financial income and expense for all other derivatives). However, in the case of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the  effective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  arising  from changes in fair value is recognized directly in equity, and only the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement.\n\n- Fair value hedges /uni25A0\n\nFair  value  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly for derivative instruments which swap fixed rates against variable rates (fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps). These derivatives hedge fixed-rate debts exposed to a fair value risk. In accordance with hedge accounting principles, debt included in a designated fair value hedging relationship is remeasured at fair value and to the extent of the risk hedged. As the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item offsets the effective portion of the gain or loss on the fair value hedge, the income statement is only impacted by the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n- Cash flow hedges /uni25A0\n\nCash  flow  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly  for  derivative  instruments  which  fix  the  cost  of future investments (financial assets or property, plant and equipment) and the price of future purchases, mostly gas and  fuel  oil  (commodity  swaps)  or  foreign  currencies (foreign  exchange  forwards).  Transactions  hedged  by these  instruments  are  qualified  as  highly  probable.  The application  of  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  allows  the Group to defer the impact on the income statement of the effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these derivatives  by  recording  them  in  a  hedging  reserve  in equity. This reserve is reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs and the hedged item itself affects income. In the same way as for fair value hedges, cash flow hedging limits the Group's exposure to changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivatives  to  the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n- Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting /uni25A0\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for  hedge  accounting  are  recognized  in  the  income statement. Instruments concerned are primarily foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards.",

The fair value of instruments not quoted in an active market, such as derivatives or financial assets and liabilities, is determined by reference to commonly used valuation techniques such as the fair\n\nvalue  of  another  recent  and  similar  transaction,  or discounted cash flow analysis based on observable market inputs.

Gains and losses on disposals of treasury stock are recognized directly in equity and have no impact on net income for the period.\n\nForward purchases of treasury stock are treated in the same way. When a fixed number of shares is purchased forward at a fixed price, this amount is recorded in 'Other liabilities' against a deduction from equity under 'Retained earnings and net income for the year'.\n\nSaint-Gobain  shares  held  or  controlled  by  Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain and Saint-Gobain Corporation are shown as  a  deduction  from  equity  under  'Treasury  stock'  at acquisition cost.\n\nThe liquidity agreement signed with Exane BNP Paribas on November/uni00A016,  2007  and  implemented  on  December/uni00A03, 2007 for a period up to December/uni00A031, 2007 has been automatically renewed since that date.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031, 2020,  2,650,208/uni00A0shares  were  held  in treasury (December/uni00A031, 2019: 2,595,723/uni00A0shares).

Income tax resulting from changes in tax rates is recognized in income, except where it relates to items initially recognized in equity.\n\nIn  the  balance  sheet,  changes  in  the  net  deferred  tax assets and liabilities break down as follows:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                                                  | Net deferred tax asset (liability)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| NET VALUE AT JANUARY/uni00A01, 2019                                               | 411                                  |\n| Deferred tax (expense) benefit                                                    | (30)                                 |\n| Changes in deferred taxes relating to actuarial  gains and losses (IAS/uni00A019) | 27                                   |\n| Liability method on actuarial gains and losses                                    | 5                                    |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for  hyperinflation                       | (15)                                 |\n| Assets and liabilities held for sale                                              | (1)                                  |\n| Changes in Group structure and other                                              | (12)                                 |\n| NET VALUE AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2019                                             | 385                                  |\n| Deferred tax (expense) benefit                                                    | (7)                                  |\n| Changes in deferred taxes relating to actuarial  gains and losses (IAS/uni00A019) | 4                                    |\n| Liability method on actuarial gains and losses                                    | 16                                   |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation                        | (1)                                  |\n| Assets and liabilities held for sale                                              | (3)                                  |\n| Changes in Group structure and other                                              | (89)                                 |\n| NET VALUE AT DECEMBER/uni00A031, 2020                                             | 305                                  |\n\nChanges in Group structure relate mainly to the first-time consolidation of Continental Building Products.\n\nThe table below shows the main deferred tax components:\n\n| (in EUR million)                                                                          | Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Pensions                                                                                  | 465                    | 474                    |\n| Brands, customer relationships and  intellectual property                                 | (432)                  | (411)                  |\n| Depreciation and amortization, accelerated  capital allowances and tax-driven  provisions | (644)                  | (689)                  |\n| Tax loss carry-forwards                                                                   | 440                    | 546                    |\n| Other                                                                                     | 476                    | 465                    |\n| NET DEFERRED TAX                                                                          | 305                    | 385                    |\n| Of which:                                                                                 |                        |                        |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                                       | 665                    | 833                    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                                  | (360)                  | (448)                  |\n\nDeferred taxes are offset at the level of each tax entity, i.e. , by  tax  group  where  applicable  (mainly  in  France,  the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands).\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u20ac665/uni00A0million were recognized at December/uni00A031, 2020 (\u20ac833/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2019), primarily  in  France  (\u20ac157/uni00A0million), the  United  States (\u20ac64/uni00A0million), Germany (\u20ac188/uni00A0million) and Italy (\u20ac59/uni00A0million).

They are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and written down to the extent that it is no longer probable that there will be sufficient taxable income against which the temporary difference can be utilized. In determining whether  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards, the Group applies a range of criteria that take into account the probable recovery period based on business plans and the strategy for the long-term recovery of tax losses applied in each country.\n\nThe  Group  recognized  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards  for  a  net  amount  of  \u20ac440/uni00A0million  at December/uni00A031, 2020 and \u20ac546/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2019.

In these countries, tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. Nevertheless, after analyzing each situation, the Group may decide not to recognize them.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020,  deferred  tax  assets  whose recovery is not considered probable totaled \u20ac374/uni00A0million (December/uni00A031,  2019:  \u20ac412/uni00A0million)  and  a  provision  had been accrued for the full amount.

Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain ('the Group') for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December/uni00A031, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## 2. Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors, for the period from January/uni00A01, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014.\n\n## 3. Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment were significant at December/uni00A031, 2020, representing \u20ac10,028/uni00A0million, \u20ac2,505/uni00A0million and \u20ac11,072/uni00A0million, respectively. These assets may be impaired due to internal or external factors, including decisions to change the Group's strategy in certain markets, a decline in Group performance, changes in competition, unfavorable market conditions particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic",

        "page_content": "and changes in legislation or regulations. These changes are likely to have an impact on the Group's forecast cash flow and, consequently, the assets' recoverable amounts.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management using the method described in Note/uni00A06.5 to the consolidated financial statements led to the recognition of impairment losses of \u20ac958/uni00A0million in the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020 (including impairment on assets held for sale), as indicated in Note/uni00A04 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nDetermining  the  assets'  recoverable  amounts  is  a  key  audit  matter  given  the  potentially  significant  nature  of  any impairment and the high degree of estimation and judgment required by Management in assessing impairment losses. Management exercises judgment when making assumptions regarding future changes in sales (in both volume and value terms), profitability, investments and the other cash flows required to operate the assets, and when determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to future cash flows.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the procedures implemented within the Group for impairment testing purposes particularly with regard to take into account the impacts of the health crisis of Covid-19 on the parameters activity and profitability, and tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by the Group to ensure the quality and reliability of the aforementioned  procedures  and  their  consistency  with  data  from  the  budget  and  the  medium-term  business  plan prepared by Management.\n\nWe also assessed the consistency and relevance of Management's approach to determine the cash-generating units for asset impairment testing. We adapted our audit approach to the risk of impairment, which varies depending on the cash-generating unit.\n\nOur  valuation  specialists  performed  an  independent  analysis  of  certain  key  assumptions  used  by  Management  for impairment testing purposes, in particular the discount rate, by referring to both external market data and comparable company analyses.\n\nFor a selection of cash-generating units, we analyzed the consistency of future cash flow projections with regard to past performance and our knowledge of the business, confirmed by interviews with the Heads of the relevant Segments and Businesses and qualitative and quantitative parameters relating to the depth and potential duration of the health crisis triggered by Covid-19.\n\nWe carefully examined the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity. We performed our own sensitivity analyses of certain key variables of the measurement model to assess the materiality of their potential impact on the recoverable amounts of the most high-risk assets.\n\nWe verified that the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the measurement of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment, the underlying assumptions and sensitivity analyses were appropriate and in particular that, given the recent context related to Covid-19, the sensitivity ranges communicated have been extended.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and litigation related to asbestos\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to various legal risks, including asbestos-related litigation in the United States and Brazil.\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements, provisions amounting to \u20ac1,187/uni00A0million were recognized at December/uni00A031, 2020 for contingent liabilities and litigation. Significant contingent liabilities, whose amount or timing cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability, are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith  regard  to  asbestos-related  risks  in  the  United  States  and  Brazil,  determining  and  measuring  the  provisions recognized for contingent liabilities and litigation and assessing the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are a key audit matter given the amounts involved and the high degree of estimation and judgment required by Management in determining those provisions. Judgment is required, in particular, to assess the status and resolution of the ongoing legal proceedings (in particular the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 in the United States and class actions in Brazil): duration, cost, estimation of the number of current and future cases covered, definition of the damages by the judicial authority, etc .\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nTo obtain an understanding of contingent liabilities and litigation regarding asbestos in the United States and Brazil and the related judgments made, we held discussions with Management and lawyers chosen by Management, at the Group and country level as well as at the main subsidiaries concerned. We also contacted certain law firms and external experts chosen by Management to assist them with the monitoring of these risks.\n\n## We:\n\n- examined the minutes of the Board of Directors' meetings and the Group's risk mapping prepared by Management and /uni25A0 presented to the Audit and Risk Committee;\n- familiarized  ourselves  with  the  procedures  implemented  by  Management  when  measuring  the  provisions  for /uni25A0 asbestos-related risks in the United States and Brazil and determining the disclosures thereon in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- assessed the permanence of methods and performed a critical review of internal analyses relating to the probability /uni25A0 and possible impact of these contingent liabilities and new items of litigation by examining the available information relating to the proceedings (correspondence, judgments, notifications, etc .). We also reviewed the responses to the confirmation letters of the law firms chosen by Management, particularly in terms of their experience at resolving comparable situations in the past. We also used our professional judgment to assess the positions adopted by Management, to see where they fell within risk assessment ranges and the consistency of those positions over time;\n\n8",

The profitability of these entities varies depending on supplier discounts received, which lower the cost price of negotiated goods. As indicated in Notes/uni00A04.1.2, 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the recognition of supplier discounts specifically affects 'Cost of sales' in the consolidated income statement as well as 'Inventories' and 'Other receivables' in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nGiven the diversity of products and suppliers in the Distribution business, supplier contracts are numerous, complex and varied. They give rise to several supplier discounts, some of which are subject to volume conditions or targets, granted at various levels (local, regional, national and international). Measuring accrued supplier discounts is a key audit matter as the monitoring thereof is complex and requires estimates to be made by Management. Determining the amounts of supplier discounts to be taken into account when measuring inventories held by the Distribution entities is also a significant audit matter.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe gained an understanding of the process used by Management to estimate accrued supplier discounts at the reporting date and performed tests on the effectiveness of the controls performed by Management.\n\nWe also assessed, on a multi-year basis, the consistency of the supplier discount rates obtained per entity and country, confirmed by interviews with Management. We assessed the way in which the consequences of the health crisis of Covid-19 were taken into account in the determination of these supplier discounts. Using a sample, we remeasured the supplier discounts obtained based on the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements and volumes purchased. We also retrospectively cross-checked cash and credit notes received after the reporting date against the receivables recognized and asked a sample of suppliers to directly confirm the discount amounts due for the fiscal year.\n\nWith regard to the accuracy of the supplier discounts taken into account when measuring inventories held by the Distribution entities, we assessed that the accounting methods were applied consistently across all the entities. Using sampling techniques, we cross-checked the measurement of certain inventory items against supplier invoices, estimating supplier discounts granted subsequently.\n\nWe assessed that the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding supplier discounts were appropriate.\n\n## 4. Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe  have  no  matters  to  report  as  to  their  fair  presentation  and  their  consistency  with  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article/uni00A0L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code  de  commerce )  is  included  in  the  Group's  management  report  (or  in  the  Group's  information  given  in  the management report), it being specified that, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\n## 5. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A0222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company's management informed us of its decision to postpone the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No/uni00A02019/815 of December/uni00A017, 2018 to years beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2021. Therefore, this report does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article/uni00A0L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ).\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain by the Shareholders' Meeting held on June/uni00A026, 1986 for Petiteau Scacchi and subsequently PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on June/uni00A010, 2004 for KPMG Audit.\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2020  PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit  and  KPMG  Audit  were  in  the  thirty-fifth  and  seventeenth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively.",

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 7. Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to /uni25A0 fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are /uni25A0 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related /uni25A0 disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit /uni25A0 evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  Statutory  Auditor  concludes  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements /uni25A0 represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities /uni25A0 within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n8",

Other intangible assets, consisting of computer  software,  are  measured  at acquisition cost and amortized over periods of three, five or ten years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost (purchase  price  plus  incidental  expenses),  except  for assets acquired prior to December/uni00A031, 1976, which have been revalued.\n\nThey  are  depreciated  over  their  estimated  useful  lives using the straight-line or declining-balance method. The most commonly used useful lives are as follows:\n\n- Buildings /uni25A0\n\n40/uni00A0to 50/uni00A0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- Improvements and additions /uni25A0\n\n12 years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- Fixtures and fittings /uni25A0\n\n5 to 12/uni00A0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- Office furniture /uni25A0\n\n10 years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- Office equipment /uni25A0\n\n5 years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- Vehicles /uni25A0\n\n4 years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- IT equipment /uni25A0\n\n3 years\n\nStraight-line or\n\ndeclining\n\nbalance\n\n## Financial investments, investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and other investment securities\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  investments  in  subsidiaries  and affiliates are stated at cost including incidental expenses. Periodically, and  particularly when  an  inventory  is performed, the net carrying amount of the investments is compared with their fair value (value in use). Fair value is estimated based on various criteria: the Company's equity in the underlying net assets, proportion of consolidated net  assets,  net  present  value  of  future  cash  flows, excluding  interest  expense  but  after  tax,  based  on business  plans  (or  long-term  budget  projections),  or  a multiple of a normative performance basis.\n\nWhen the fair value of the investments falls below their cost, a provision is set aside for impairment. No unrealized capital  gain  is  recorded  if  fair  value  exceeds  cost,  and unrealized capital gains and losses are not offset.\n\nTreasury  shares  held  by  the  Company  at  year-end  for allocation upon exercise of stock options are recorded in the  balance  sheet  under  'Other  investment  securities'. They are carried at the lower of cost, market price or the option exercise price when it is probable that the options will be exercised.\n\nTreasury shares held for cancellation are carried at cost and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is set aside for impairment when their realizable value is less than their book value.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities mainly include units in money market funds (OPCVM and FCP) and are stated at the lower of acquisition cost and market value at year-end.\n\nThis  item  also  includes  treasury  shares  held  by  the Company  other  than those classified as financial investments.\n\nThese securities are valued in accordance with the first in/first out (FIFO) method.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome and expenses in foreign currencies are recorded at the euro exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables,  payables  and  bank  balances  in  foreign currencies are translated at the year-end exchange rate, along with the related hedging instruments, and differences  arising  on  translation  are  recorded  under translation gains or losses. Provisions are booked for any exceptional  unrealized  translation  losses  that  are  not hedged.\n\n## Risk management/Financial instruments\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  managed  with  the  main  objective  of ensuring the timely rollover of the Group's financing at an optimal  cost.  Long-term  debt  therefore  systematically represents a high proportion of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such a way that replacement capital market issues are spread over time.",

        "page_content": "Currency, interest rate, and commodity (energy and raw materials) price risks resulting from the Group's international  activities  are  hedged  by  Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain, mainly on behalf of subsidiaries. On its own behalf and for its subsidiaries, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain also hedges the risk of fluctuations in the Saint-Gobain share price that could affect the cost of performance unit plans.\n\nCurrency risks are hedged mainly by fixed-term forward purchase and sale contracts and currency options. Foreign currency  receivables  and  payables  hedged  by  forward purchase and sale contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at the hedging rate.\n\nThe portion of the unrealized gain or loss on currency options qualifying for hedge accounting that represents the  extrinsic  (time)  value  is  taken  to  income,  and  the portion that represents the intrinsic value is recorded in the  balance  sheet.  Only  unrealized  losses  on  currency options  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe  Company  uses  mainly  interest  rate  swaps  and cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Financial income  and expenses on interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are recognized in the income statement on a symmetrical basis against income and expenses on the hedged items.\n\nThe portion of the unrealized gain or loss on interest rate options qualifying for hedge accounting that represents the  extrinsic  (time)  value  is  taken  to  income,  and  the portion that represents the intrinsic value is recorded in the balance sheet. Interest rate options that do not qualify for  hedge  accounting  are  recognized  in  the  income statement at market value.\n\n## Operating income/(loss) NOTE 2\n\n## Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe Company was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020. However, trading in the second half of the year was almost back to normal levels.\n\nIn this context, the measures taken by the Company to address the crisis caused by the pandemic were the result of  swift  decisions  taken  in  line  with  the  Saint-Gobain Group's  key  priorities.  These  included  keeping  a  close watch on the Company's cash levels, with strict measures put  in  place  to  reduce  costs  and  investments  and  to maintain a tight rein on working capital, in addition to the specific  action  taken  to  strengthen  the  Group's  cash position. The Company did not choose to defer any tax or social security payments as permitted by the law.\n\n## Net financial income NOTE 3\n\nNet  financial  income  decreased  by  \u20ac145.9/uni00A0million  to \u20ac727.5/uni00A0million in 2020 from \u20ac873.4/uni00A0million in 2019.\n\nThe  year-on-year  change  is  mainly  attributable  to  the \u20ac124.3/uni00A0million fall in investment income: while dividends received  from  subsidiaries  remained  broadly  stable  at\n\nThe commodity (energy and raw materials) price risks of subsidiaries  are  hedged  by  the  Company,  mainly  using energy  and  raw  materials  swaps.  Financial  income  and expenses on these swaps are recognized in the income statement on a symmetrical basis against the income and expenses on the hedged items.\n\nThe risk of fluctuations in the Saint-Gobain share price that could affect the cost of performance unit plans is hedged using cash-settled equity swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain applies regulation No./uni00A02015-05 of July/uni00A02, 2015  issued  by  the  French accounting standards-setter ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC) on forward financial instruments and hedging operations.\n\n## Tax consolidation agreements\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain is the parent company of a tax consolidation group under the group relief regime provided for in Articles/uni00A0223 A et seq. of the French Tax Code.\n\nThe tax consolidation agreements between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its subsidiaries provide for tax neutrality for  consolidated  subsidiaries.  In  their  relationship  with Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  the  consolidating  parent company, the subsidiaries discharge their taxes as if they had been taxed on a stand-alone basis. When loss-making companies  leave  the  Group,  they  are  not,  in  principle, entitled  to  any  payments  for  losses  transferred  to  the consolidating  parent  company  during  the  consolidation period.\n\nThe  impacts  of  the  pandemic  -  though  much  less significant in the second half - were taken into account when measuring assets at the reporting date.\n\n## Earnings trends\n\nThe operating loss improved by \u20ac10.5/uni00A0million to \u20ac48.7/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac59.2/uni00A0million in 2019, owing mainly  to  a  reduction  in  pension  and  other  employee benefit costs. In 2019, the sharp decrease in the discount rate  used  to  measure  employee  benefit  obligations generated a significant accounting expense.\n\n\u20ac718.2/uni00A0million, 2020/uni00A0profit transferred from subsidiaries of the German branch was down \u20ac125.6/uni00A0million owing to the economic climate resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic in first-half/uni00A02020.\n\n8",

Total cumulative tax losses (including losses arising  from  tax  rules  on  the  deductibility  of  financial expenses) were estimated at \u20ac1,068/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain's permanent German establishment, which is the head of the Group's Organschaft local  tax  consolidation  regime,  reported  a profit on tax consolidation in 2020.

reflects the definitive recognition within assets of installations corresponding to capitalized expenditures related to the construction of the new Saint-Gobain tower which are the responsibility of the lessee. These expenditures were reclassified to 'Other' when the tower was effectively brought into service at the end of the first lockdown. The assets began to be depreciated as of June/uni00A01, 2020.",

These plans do not give rise to the delivery of shares, but entitle grantees to receive cash compensation deferred over the long term (exercise period between four and ten years after  the  grant  date),  the  amount  of  which  will  be determined by reference to Saint-Gobain's share price.\n\nNo  long-term  compensation  plan  in  the  form  of performance  units  has  been  set  up  since  2016,  as  all beneficiaries received rights to performance shares (see above).\n\nThere were no unvested performance unit plans at either December/uni00A031, 2019 or 2020.\n\n## Compagnie de Saint-Gobain 10.7 Group savings plan (peg)\n\nThe Group Savings Plan ( Plan \u00c9pargne Group - PEG) is an employee stock purchase plan open to all Group employees in France and most other countries where the Group is present. Eligible employees  must  have  completed  a minimum of three months' service with the Group. Eligible employees are able to invest in Saint-Gobain shares at a preferential subscription price. These shares are held either directly or through the employee saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject to a mandatory five- or ten-year lock-up, except following the occurrence  of  certain  events.  The  Board  of  Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription price to the Chief Executive Officer of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. It corresponds to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20 trading days preceding the date of the decision, subject to a 20% discount, in accordance with applicable laws, the Shareholders' Meeting Resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors.",

The Board of Directors made partial use of this authorization on November/uni00A026, 2020 by granting 1,268,295  performance  shares  (including  147,500  for Executive Directors) (see section/uni00A010.5);\n- issue, on one or several occasions, up to 12,022,500 /uni25A0 new  shares  to  members  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan (22nd Resolution/26-month authorization commencing June/uni00A06,  2019).  On  August/uni00A013,  2020,  the  Group  made partial use of this authorization by issuing 6,099,996/uni00A0shares to employees.\n\nIf all outstanding stock options whose type has not yet been  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  were  to  be exercised via the issue of new shares, this would potentially have the effect of increasing the number of shares outstanding to 533,278,346/uni00A0shares. In addition, if the authorizations described above were to be used in full by the Board of Directors, this would potentially have the effect of increasing the number of shares outstanding to 654,219,560/uni00A0shares.\n\n77,516/uni00A0securities are still outstanding, with an aggregate face value of \u20ac77.5/uni00A0million.\n\nInterest comprises (i) a fixed portion of 7.5% paid per year applicable to 60% of the nominal amount of the security, and (ii)/uni00A0a/uni00A0variable/uni00A0portion applicable to the remaining 40% of the nominal amount of the participating security, which is linked to consolidated net income of the previous year and to the reference six-month Libor EUR rate/uni00A0+7/8%. The amount paid per security in 2020 was \u20ac60.60, paid in two installments (\u20ac27.25 and \u20ac33.35).\n\nFollowing the reform of interest bank offered rates (IBOR), the November/uni00A019, 2020 Shareholders' Meeting ratified an amendment to the 1984 issuance contract for participating securities.  Pursuant  to  this  amendment,  the  interest  on these securities will now be calculated by reference to six-month Euribor and not six-month EUR Libor.\n\nNone of these securities are redeemable and the interest is classified as a component of finance costs.\n\n8",

These expenses are shown on the 'Deferred charges' line of the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A09 'Deferred charges').\n\n## Perpetual bonds 13.1\n\nIn 1985,  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  issued  25,000 perpetual bonds  with  a  face  value  of  ECU/uni00A05,000 (\u20ac5,000/uni00A0today).\n\nA total of 18,496 perpetual bonds have since been bought back  and  canceled,  and  6,504  perpetual  bonds  are outstanding  at  December/uni00A031,  2020,  representing  a  total face value of \u20ac33/uni00A0million.\n\nThe  bonds  bear  interest  at  a  variable  rate  (average  of interbank rates offered by the five reference banks for six-month euro deposits). The amount paid out per bond in 2020 was \u20ac3.18.\n\nThe bonds are not redeemable and interest on the bonds is classified as a component of finance costs.\n\n## Financing programs 13.3\n\nThe Group has a number of medium- and long-term financing programs (Medium-Term Notes) and short-term financing programs (Commercial Paper).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, the state of these programs was as follows:\n\n| (in EUR million)      | Authorized drawings    | Authorized limits at Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Balance outstanding at Dec./uni00A031, 2020   | Balance outstanding at Dec./uni00A031, 2019   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Medium-Term Notes     | 1 to 30/uni00A0years   | 15,000                                      | 11,149                                        | 11,129                                        |\n| NEU CP                | up to 12/uni00A0months | 4,000                                       | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n| US Commercial Paper   | up to 12/uni00A0months | 815*                                        | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n| Euro Commercial Paper | up to 12/uni00A0months | 815*                                        | 0                                             | 0                                             |\n\nIn accordance with market practices, Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP), US/uni00A0Commercial Paper and Euro Commercial  Paper  are  generally  issued  with maturities  of  one  to  six  months.  They  are  treated  as variable-rate debt since they are rolled over at frequent intervals.\n\n## Syndicated lines of credit\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain has two syndicated lines of credit that are intended to provide a secure source of financing for the Group (including as additional backing for its NEU  CP,  US  Commercial  Paper  and  Euro Commercial Paper programs):\n\n- a  \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion  syndicated  line  of  credit,  maturing  in /uni25A0 December/uni00A02024, after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options;\n- a  second  \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion  syndicated  line  of  credit  also /uni25A0 maturing in December/uni00A02024 after the exercise of two one-year rollover options.\n\nBased on the Group's current credit rating for long-term debt  issues,  the  two  facilities  are  not  subject  to  any covenants. Neither of these two lines of credit had been drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nAnother  short-term  line  of  credit  was  arranged  on March/uni00A022, 2020  for  an  initial  amount  of  \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, maturing  in  March/uni00A02021. This  line  was  canceled  on September/uni00A016, 2020.\n\n## Main changes in bond debt 13.2 in 2020\n\nOn April/uni00A03, 2020, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain issued:\n\n- \u20ac750/uni00A0million worth of 1.75% fixed-rate bonds, maturing /uni25A0 on April/uni00A03, 2023;\n- \u20ac750/uni00A0million worth  of  2.375%  bonds,  maturing  on /uni25A0 October/uni00A04, 2027.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain redeemed:\n\n- \u20ac1,000/uni00A0million worth of 0% bonds on March/uni00A027, 2020 at /uni25A0 maturity;\n- two floating-rate/uni00A03-month Euribor/uni00A0+0.23% private /uni25A0 placements on June/uni00A025, 2020 at maturity, amounting to \u20ac180/uni00A0million and \u20ac300/uni00A0million.",

A provision is recognized whenever a risk is identified and the related cost can be estimated reliably.\n\n## Information on fees paid to/uni00A0the/uni00A0statutory/uni00A0auditors NOTE 18/uni00A0\n\nTotal  fees  (excluding  VAT)  paid  and  payable  to  the Statutory  Auditors  in  2020,  as  reflected  in  the  income statement for the year, may be broken down as follows:\n\n- statutory audit fees:/uni00A0\u20ac1.8/uni00A0million; /uni25A0\n- fees for audit-related advice and services:/uni00A0\u20ac0.3/uni00A0million. /uni25A0\n\nNon-audit services provided by the Statutory Auditors to Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  relate  mainly  to  audit procedures carried out as an independent third party on the management report on CSR/uni00A0information, due diligence in the context of planned acquisitions or divestments, and procedures related to the issuance of comfort letters in the case of new bond issues.\n\n8",

Violation of competition law exposes the Group to fines and, in certain countries, potential criminal sanctions on the Group and its employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to have a significant impact on the Group's reputation, financial situation and operating results.\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has long applied the principle of zero tolerance. A competition law  compliance  program  has  been  in  place  within  the Group since 2007.\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November/uni00A02011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May/uni00A02014, the Commission Secretariat issued a notice of complaints against Sanitas\n\n## Management compensation\n\nTotal gross compensation and benefits paid in 2020 by the  French  and  foreign  companies  in  the  Group  to members  of  the  Executive  Committee  as  it  stood  at December/uni00A031, 2020 (excluding any long-term compensation) amounted to \u20ac13.3/uni00A0million (2019: \u20ac11.4/uni00A0million), including  \u20ac5.2/uni00A0million in gross  variable compensation (2019: \u20ac3.7/uni00A0million). No severance payments were  made  in  2020  to  members  of  the  Executive Committee as it stood at December/uni00A031, 2020 (as in 2019).\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  and  other  post-employment benefit obligations (defined-benefit obligations/uni00A0- (DBO) in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to Group management totaled \u20ac46.3/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019:/uni00A0\u20ac41.5/uni00A0million).\n\nCompensation paid to members of the Board of Directors for 2020 totaled \u20ac1.0/uni00A0million (2019: \u20ac1.1/uni00A0million).\n\nTroesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe  total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is CHF/uni00A080/uni00A0million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF/uni00A028.8/uni00A0million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May/uni00A02, 2016 and continues to firmly refute the claims made.  The  hearing  took  place  before  the  Federal Administrative Court on January/uni00A021, 2020 and the date on which  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  will  issue  its decision is not yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December/uni00A031, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nOn July/uni00A028, 2014, the French Competition Authority sent a statement  of  objections  to  Saint-Gobain  Isover  and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (as parent company of the Saint-Gobain Group). A hearing took place on May/uni00A011, 2016, whereupon the Competition Authority sent the case back for  further  investigation  in  light  of  the  arguments  put forward by Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de/uni00A0Saint-Gobain. In October/uni00A02018, Saint-Gobain Isover and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain received a second statement of objections, in which the Competition Authority alleges anti-competitive practices in the building insulation products market, between 2001 and 2013.",

By decision dated January/uni00A014, 2021, the French Competition Authority considered that the alleged anti-competitive  practices  were  not  established  and dismissed all the objections notified.\n\nThe period opened for lodging an appeal is pending as of the closing date of these financial statements.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March/uni00A02013  a damages  claim  on  Saint-Gobain  Isover,  the Centre Scientifique  et  Technique  du  B\u00e2timent ,  and  the  FILMM before the Paris Civil Court ( Tribunal de grande instance ) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority.  In  an  order  dated  December/uni00A016,  2014,  the pre-trial  judge  declared  a  stay  of  proceedings  while waiting for the decision from the Competition Authority, procedure which remains stayed as of the closing date of these financial statements.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation 20.2\n\nCurrent legal actions related to asbestos are described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, seven further individual lawsuits were filed in 2020 by former employees (or persons claiming through them) of Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM -/uni00A0which in the past had carried out fiber-cement operations -/uni00A0for asbestos-related occupational diseases that affect or have affected them. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 837 such lawsuits had been issued against the two companies since  1996  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary compensation over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 800 of these 837/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed in terms of both liability and quantum. In all  these  cases,  the  employers  were  held  liable  on  the grounds of 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nCompensation paid by Everite and Saint-Gobain PAM in settlement of these lawsuits totaled approximately \u20ac6.2/uni00A0million as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to \u20ac5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nConcerning  the  37/uni00A0lawsuits  outstanding  against  Everite and  Saint-Gobain  PAM  as  of  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the procedures relating to the merits of all the cases were at different  stages,  with  five  in  the  process  of  being investigated by the French Social Security authorities and 32 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ) or Appeal Courts.\n\nIn addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, 258 similar suits had been filed since the outset of the litigation by current or former employees, or persons claiming through them, of 13 French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies  that  are  no  longer  part  of  the  Group),  in particular  by  current  or  former  employees  who  used\n\nequipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect  themselves against heat from furnaces.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, 224/uni00A0lawsuits had been completed. In 141 of these cases, the employer was held liable for 'inexcusable fault'.\n\nAt the same date, compensation paid by these companies totaled  approximately  \u20ac8.7/uni00A0million  as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020 (compared to \u20ac8/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\nAs regards the 34/uni00A0suits outstanding as of December/uni00A031, 2020,  five  cases  were  still  being  investigated  by  the French Social Security authorities, 28 were being tried including 22 pending before the Civil Courts ( Tribunaux judiciaires ), five before the Appeal Courts and one before the Cour  de  cassation . Lastly,  one  action  has  been cancelled but the plaintiff may request its restoration at any time within a two-year period following its cancellation.\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's French subsidiaries, including six that operate or have operated facilities in France classified as containing asbestos, are the subject of damages claims that are different from those described above.\n\n'Facilities classified as containing asbestos' are defined as industrial  facilities  that  have  been  closed  or  are  still operating, which previously manufactured materials containing  asbestos  or  used  protection  and  insulation equipment containing asbestos and that are included by ministerial decree on the official list of facilities whose current or former employees  are  entitled to the early-retirement benefit paid to asbestos workers (ACAATA).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, a total of 824/uni00A0lawsuits had been brought  by  current  or  former  employees  claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of  their  alleged  exposure  to  asbestos.  None  of  these plaintiffs were suffering from an asbestos-related disease and  some  of  them  were  not  receiving  the  ACAATA benefit.  Of  these  824/uni00A0suits,  721  have  been  definitely completed, representing a total amount of compensation of \u20ac7.6/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 (as at December/uni00A031, 2019). The  remaining  103/uni00A0lawsuits are pending before the Amiens Appeal Court.\n\nIt should be clarified that the above figures do not take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nThe  provision  related  to  asbestos-related  litigation  in France amounted to around \u20ac5.5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020  (compared  to  \u20ac4.1/uni00A0million as  of December/uni00A031, 2019).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Action taken to achieve equitable and permanent Resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC based in North Carolina, that holds the legacy asbestos liabilities of the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter/uni00A011 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US/uni00A0Bankruptcy Court for the Western  District  of  North  Carolina  in  Charlotte.  The purpose  of  the  filing  is  to  achieve  a  certain,  final  and equitable Resolution of all current and future claims arising from asbestos-containing products manufactured and sold by the former CertainTeed Corporation.\n\n8",

        "page_content": "Compagnie de Saint-Gobain 2020 annual financial statements (parent/uni00A0company)\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section/uni00A0524 (g) of the US/uni00A0Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve a fair and equitable Resolution of its asbestos-related  liabilities.  Upon  establishment  of  the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will  be  able  to  receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system; at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently and finally resolve DBMP LLC's asbestos liability.\n\nDuring the course of this bankruptcy process, which is expected to take approximately 3 to 8/uni00A0years, all asbestos litigation will be stayed and all related costs suspended, providing  DBMP  LLC  with  the  time  and  protection  to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis action was taken as a result of the increasing risks presented in the US tort system. Despite the passage of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity for claimants to assert legitimate claims of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former CertainTeed Corporation, naming practices in the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims  against  DBMP  LLC,  with  no  foreseeable  end  in sight. In addition, there has been, in general, an escalation of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\n## Impact on the Group's financial statements\n\nFollowing the commencement of the proceeding under Chapter/uni00A011  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January/uni00A023, 2020, the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular the provision for asbestos-related litigation in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements. Nonetheless, because of a funding agreement between CertainTeed LLC and DBMP LLC by which CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter/uni00A011 case and, ultimately, the 524 (g) trust,  in  both  cases  solely  to  the  extent  DBMP  LLC  is unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group  recorded  in  its consolidated  financial  statements  a  debt  against  DBMP LLC  amounting  to  USD/uni00A0432/uni00A0million  as  of  December/uni00A031, 2020. The Group's consolidated income for 2020 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter/uni00A011 proceeding described above. As a result of this bankruptcy proceeding, all legal costs  and  indemnity  payments  related  to  DBMP/uni00A0LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in relation to such claims have been taken in 2020 (USD/uni00A099/uni00A0million, corresponding to \u20ac88/uni00A0million, in 2019).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former  employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from asbestos-related occupational illnesses are offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambouc  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  A  first instance decision was rendered in connection with the first suit in July/uni00A02020, rejecting the claims of the plaintiffs. The latter have nevertheless appealed the decision. The suit\n\nrelated to Recife is still at an early stage and there is no court decision issued so far.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages, in favor of employees, former employees and their respective families, as well as subcontractors who were exposed to asbestos. A first instance decision was rendered  in  September/uni00A02020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted  to  the  plaintiffs,  for  an  amount  reduced  to BRL/uni00A05/uni00A0million (\u20ac0.8/uni00A0million). Brasilit has  appealed  the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues to comply with all of its legal obligations with regard to medical assistance for its current and former employees.\n\nIn November/uni00A02017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban asbestos definitively across the country. Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes 20.3\n\n## PFOA matters in the United States\n\nLevels of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in excess of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or state maximum contaminant levels for drinking water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured by these plants. SG PPL is a processor of PTFE which it purchases from third party suppliers and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls,  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded both completed and on-going construction of water  line  extensions  in  certain  communities  in  the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going  and  the  scope  of  responsibility  for  SG  PPL arising  from  environmental  remediation  and  clean-up obligations at these sites has not yet been established. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders with the environmental regulators in New York in 2016, in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which SG PPL has agreed to complete investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current and former facilities and in the case of Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG PPL.",

The Inquiry is conducting its work in two Phases: its phase/uni00A01 report was published on October/uni00A030, 2019 and phase/uni00A02 commenced in January/uni00A02020 and is expected to continue into 2022. A criminal investigation into the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored, and the implications for Celotex are unlikely to be known for some time. Civil proceedings in\n\nconnection with Grenfell Tower brought against Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December/uni00A031,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry - have been issued and have been, or are expected to be, stayed prior to the service of full pleadings, in view of the ongoing Public Inquiry. No figure has yet been put on the quantum claimed.\n\nThe extent to which Celotex may incur civil or criminal liability  in  connection  with  the  production,  marketing, supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently  unclear,  and Celotex Limited and Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes 20.5\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other claims made by their employees or by the tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses.  Apart  from  the  proceedings  and  litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no  other  government,  court  or  arbitration  proceedings exist  (including  pending  proceedings  or  proceedings where  the  Company  and/or  the  Group  might  be threatened)  which  could  have  or  have  had,  in  the  last 12/uni00A0months, a significant impact on the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or Group.\n\n8",

Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n8",

Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are initially stated at cost and are impaired based on their value in use, corresponding to the amount the Company would be prepared to pay for the investment if it were to acquire it. A decline in the performance of certain subsidiaries or affiliates or risks relating to the international locations of those companies could lead to impairment losses.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of the value in use of these investments, which is performed each year by Management using the multi-criteria approach described in Note/uni00A01 to the financial statements, to be a key audit matter in light of the potential materiality of any impairment and the high degree of estimation and judgment required from Management to assess impairment losses, especially in the context of Covid-19's crisis. Management's judgment is based in part on assumptions relating, on the one hand, to the multiples applicable to the valuation of the investments and, on the other, to future changes in the cash flows relating to the investments, as well as to the calculation of the appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management have not led to book complementary impairment losses for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe examined the impairment test procedure applied by the Company's financial management team, especially the consideration of the impacts of the Covid's 19 health crisis, verified the consistency of the method used and tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by Management to ensure the quality and reliability of the procedure.\n\nWe carried out an independent analysis of certain key assumptions used by Management to perform the tests, pertaining, as appropriate, to the multiple deemed applicable to the valuation of the investments or to the discount rate and average perpetual  growth  rate  used  to  project  future  cash  flows,  referring  both  to  external  market  data  and  analyses  of comparable companies.\n\nFor each investment selected for our tests of detail, we corroborated the calculation parameters applied in Management's multi-criteria approach with the accounting and budget data available for that investment. Where projected future cash flows were used, we analyzed the consistency of the projections with past performance and our knowledge of the Company's business, supported by interviews with managers from the various businesses, we also analyzed qualitative and quantitative parameters related to the depth and the potential length of the Covid-19's crisis and, in so far as they were available, external data relating to markets or competitors. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity.\n\nWe verified the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements concerning the valuation of financial investments to ensure their appropriateness.\n\n## 4. Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article/uni00A0D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe  attest  that  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate  governance  sets  out  the  information  required  by Articles/uni00A0L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article/uni00A0L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover  bid  or  exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to  Article/uni00A0L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de commerce ), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.",

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A0222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company's management informed us of its decision to postpone the presentation of the financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No/uni00A02019/815 of December/uni00A017, 2018 to years beginning on or after January/uni00A01,  2021.  Therefore,  this  report  does  not  include  a  conclusion  on  the  compliance  with  this  format  of  the presentation  of  the  financial  statements  intended  to  be  included  in  the  Annual  Financial  Report  mentioned  in Article/uni00A0L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ).\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain by the Shareholders' Meeting held on June/uni00A026, 1986 for Petiteau Scacchi and subsequently PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on June/uni00A010, 2004 for KPMG Audit.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and KPMG Audit were in the thirty-five year and the seventeenth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively.\n\n## 6. Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 7. Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, /uni25A0 designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are /uni25A0 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related /uni25A0 disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n\n8",

A copy may also  be  obtained  upon  request  from  the  Clerk  of  the Commercial  Court  of  Nanterre  and  at  the  Company's headquarters.\n\n## Corporate name, form, head office and duration (Articles/uni00A01, 2, 4 and 5)\n\nA French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme governed by the provisions of Articles/uni00A0L.210-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain's  head  office is Tour Saint-Gobain, 12, place de l'Iris, 92400/uni00A0Courbevoie, France (tel: +33 (0) 1 88 54 00 00). It is registered with the Trade and Companies Register of Nanterre under No./uni00A0542 039 532.\n\nThe Company was founded in 1665 and registered with the Trade  and  Companies  Register  on  July/uni00A021,  1954  for  a period that will expire on December/uni00A031, 2040, unless it is subject to early dissolution or extension.\n\n## Corporate purpose (Article/uni00A03)\n\nThe Company's corporate purpose is, in summary form, to conduct and manage, in France and internationally, any and all industrial, commercial, financial, securities and real estate transactions related to its manufacturing and contracting activities, through French or foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise.\n\n## Fiscal year (Article/uni00A019)\n\nIts fiscal year runs from January/uni00A01 to December/uni00A031.\n\n## Share capital and disclosure thresholds (Articles/uni00A06 and 7)\n\nAt  December/uni00A031,  2020,  the  share  capital  was  set  at \u20ac2,130,734,852.00, divided among 532,683,713/uni00A0shares with a par value of \u20ac4 each, entirely paid in and all of the same type.\n\nThe bylaws (Article/uni00A07.4) require shareholders to disclose to  the  Company  within  five  trading  days  any  direct, indirect or joint interest representing at least 0.50% of the capital or voting rights, or any multiple of this percentage.\n\nThe same disclosure requirement applies when a direct, indirect or joint holding  falls below  any  of  these thresholds.\n\nFailure to comply with these disclosure rules may result in the undisclosed shares exceeding this percentage being stripped of voting rights for a period of two years from the date when the non-disclosure is remedied, at the request of one or more shareholders representing at least 3% of the capital or voting rights, as recorded in the minutes of the General Meeting.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Company  may  request  information regarding the composition of its shareholding structure and the ownership of its shares in accordance with current laws and regulations.\n\n## Share rights (Article/uni00A08)\n\nEach share entitles the owner to ownership of corporate assets and liquidation proceeds in an equal proportion to the share capital it represents.\n\nWhenever  it  is  necessary  to  hold  a  certain  number  of shares in order to exercise a right, it is for the owners who do not possess such number to assume responsibility, as necessary, to create the corresponding grouping up to the required number of shares.\n\nEach  share  entitles  the  holder  to  vote  at  the  General Meetings  under  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  bylaws (see Article/uni00A018 below).\n\nShare ownership automatically requires compliance with the  Company's  bylaws  and  the  decisions  taken  by  the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Company Management (Articles/uni00A09 to 12, 14 and 15)\n\nThe  Company  is  administered  by  a  Board  of  Directors comprised of at least three members and no more than eighteen members, subject to the exceptions provided for by law in the event of a merger.\n\nDirectors  are  elected  for  a  four-year  term  which  is renewable,  subject  to  the  age  limits  for  holding  office, which are 70 for a Director and 68 for the Chairman of the Board  of  Directors.  The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors may also hold the position of Chief executive officer of the Company, if agreed by the members of the Board. In this situation, their job title shall be Chairman and Chief executive officer. The age limit for holding office as Chairman and Chief executive officer is 65 (the same as for  the  Chief  executive  officer  and  Chief  Operating Officers).\n\nOne Director representing employee shareholders shall be appointed  by  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  under the conditions of quorum and majority applicable to any appointment  of  a  Director,  from  among  the  employee shareholders  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  from  among  the members  of  the  Supervisory  Boards  of  the  corporate mutual funds of the Company's Group Savings Plan. It shall be  governed  by  all  legal  and  statutory  provisions applicable  to  the  Directors  appointed  by  the  General Shareholders' Meeting as well as those specific to it.\n\n## Appointment procedure:\n\nCandidates  for  the  office of Director representing employee shareholders shall be presented to the General Shareholders' Meeting, in accordance with the following procedures:\n\n- one  candidate  shall  be  appointed  from  among  its /uni25A0 members by the Supervisory Board of the corporate mutual fund of the Company's Group Savings Plan.

If  the  conditions  for application of the law are not met, the term of office of the employee  Directors  (including  a  Director  representing employee shareholders) shall end upon completion of the meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  that  confirms  the Company's exit from the scope of application of the law.\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the Company's overall business strategy and examines any issues related to the efficient operation of business.\n\nThe  Board's  activities  are  organized  and  led  by  the Chairman of the Board.\n\nBoard meetings may be held using videoconferencing or other interactive telecommunication technology, under the conditions stated by law.\n\nEach  Director  appointed  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting must own at least eight hundred shares, with the exception  of  employee  Directors  and  the  Director representing employee shareholders.\n\n## General Management (Articles/uni00A013 and 15)\n\nAt the choice of the Board of Directors, the Company's General Management is assumed either by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, in this case in his capacity as Chairman  and  Chief  executive  officer,  or  by  the  Chief executive officer.\n\nThe  Chief  executive  officer,  chosen  by  the  Board  of Directors, whether or not from among its own members, is vested  with  the  broadest  authority  to  act  under  any circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company  within  the limits  of  the  corporate  purpose  and  subject  to  such powers  as  the  law  expressly  attributes  to  General Meetings and to the Board of Directors. He represents the Company in its relations with third parties.\n\n## General Meetings and voting rights (Article/uni00A018)\n\nAny shareholder may participate in General Meetings in person or by proxy, provided that his/her/its shares have\n\nbeen formally recorded in the accounts, subject to the applicable legal provisions.\n\nWhere  decided  by  the  Board,  shareholders  may  be convened to and vote at a General Meeting by any form of electronic  communication.  All  shareholders  may  give proxy to another person or entity to represent them at a General Meeting, subject to the applicable legal provisions. Legal entities shareholders are represented at a General Meeting by their legal representative or by any person designated by such legal representative.\n\nAt all General Meetings, voting rights are exercisable by the beneficial owner of the shares. Each shareholder has a number of voting rights corresponding to the number of shares held, without limitation.\n\nHowever,  double  voting  rights  are  allocated  to  fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same holder for at least two years.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  case  of  a  capital  increase  through capitalization  of  reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums, registered shares allocated free of charge to a shareholder carry double voting rights from the date on which they are issued  on  the  basis  of  shares  already  held  by  the shareholder carrying such entitlement.\n\nDouble voting rights are forfeited when the shares are converted to bearer form or sold. However, double voting rights are not forfeited when title is transferred by way of an  inheritance  or  as  a  result  of  the  liquidation  of  the marital estate or an inter vivos donation to a spouse or a relative in the direct line of succession, and the transfer is not taken into account for the purpose of calculating the two-year qualifying period.\n\nShareholders  may  vote  by  mail  in  accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Allocation and appropriation of net income (Article/uni00A020)\n\nAn appropriation of at least five per cent is deducted from net  income,  less  any  losses  carried  forward  from  the previous year, and  allocated to the reserve fund prescribed  by  law.  This  appropriation  is  no  longer mandatory once the reserve fund reaches a sum equal to one  tenth  of  the  share  capital.  It  is  reactivated  if  the reserve comes to be lower than this tenth.\n\nDistributable income corresponds to net income for the year less any losses carried forward from prior years and less any amounts to be credited to reserves in application of  the  law  or  the  Company's  bylaws,  plus  retained earnings.\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting may appropriate this distributable income as follows:\n\n- all or part of this amount to any contingency or special 1. reserves or to retained earnings, based on a recommendation of the Board of Directors;\n- if these appropriations do not absorb the total amount 2. of distributable income,  shareholders  are  paid  a non-cumulative first dividend equal to five per cent of the paid-up par value of shares, without being entitled to claim such payment from appropriations from the distributable income of subsequent years;\n- if any funds remain after paying these appropriations, 3. they are divided among the shareholders.\n\nThe General Meeting approving the financial statements for the fiscal year may decide to offer shareholders the option  of  receiving  all  or  part  of  the  dividend  (or  any interim dividend) in cash or in shares.\n\n9",

The internal rules were last updated by the Board of Directors on July/uni00A030, 2020.\n\nThe provisions of the Board of Director's internal rules are reproduced in their entirety below, except for the provisions that concern Board Committees, which are set out in Chapter/uni00A05, Section/uni00A01.2.3(b). Paragraphs shown in italics below provide commentary.\n\n'These internal rules aim to set out the organization and functioning of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's Board of Directors.\n\nThey are to be applied in conjunction with the rules and  duties  laid  out  in  those  applicable  legal  and regulatory provisions and the Company's bylaws which have not been reproduced below.\n\nThey  implement  the  recommendations  published  by the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  for French listed companies.\n\n## I. Meetings of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  holds  at  least  seven  scheduled  meetings each year. At each year-end, an annual work program is drafted and distributed to Directors for the following year. The draft minutes of each meeting are sent to the Directors at the same time as the agenda for the next meeting. They are approved at that meeting and the final minutes are then sent with the agenda for the following meeting.\n\nExcept  for  meetings  held  to  approve  the  annual financial  statements  of  the  Company,  the  annual consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  annual management report, Directors who take part in a Board  meeting  using  videoconferencing  or  other telecommunication  technology  without  any  break  in transmission,  enabling  them  to  be  identified  and  to participate actively in the discussion, are deemed to be present for calculation of the quorum and voting majority.\n\n## II. Prior and permanent information for Directors\n\nEach time a meeting is called, Directors are provided with a selection of financial analyses and a range of press  articles  concerning  the  Saint-Gobain  Group published in the period since the last Board meeting.\n\nThe text of explanations and presentations scheduled on the agenda for a meeting is sent to the Directors prior to the meeting.\n\nThe draft annual report for the Saint-Gobain Group and the  draft  Group  and  Company  annual  and  interim financial statements are sent to the Directors prior to the meeting at which they are to be considered.\n\nThe  information  file  handed  out  to  the  Directors  at each meeting includes, among other things, an analysis of the Saint-Gobain Group's operating income and its net debt at the previous month-end, as well as details of the Saint-Gobain share performance compared with the CAC/uni00A040 and an industry index.\n\nOne Board meeting is held at a different Saint-Gobain Group  site  each  year,  to  give  the  Directors  an opportunity to also visit the site concerned.\n\nBetween meetings, the Directors receive copies of all press releases issued by the Company, along with any relevant information about events or transactions that are material for the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nDirectors  have  the  right  to  ask  for  any  other documents that they consider necessary in order to\n\nmake  an  informed  contribution  to  the  Board's discussions; the request is made to the Chairman and Chief executive officer, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nDirectors may also ask to meet senior executives of the Saint-Gobain Group and to request that no Executive Directors are present; in the latter case, notice shall first  be  given  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  executive officer, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\n## III. Deliberations of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board examines all issues that fall within its remit, as specified in the applicable laws and regulations and the  Company's  bylaws,  particularly  on  the  following subjects:\n\nThe Board meets annually to review and approve the budget for the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nIt reviews and approves the strategic orientations of the  Saint-Gobain  Group  at  least  once  a  year  and monitors their implementation, taking into account the social and environmental challenges of its business.\n\nAll capital expenditures, restructuring, disposals, acquisitions and financial investment and divestment projects in individual amounts greater than \u20ac150/uni00A0million must be submitted to the Board for prior approval, along with any material transactions that fall outside the Group's stated strategy.\n\nFor urgent matters where there is not enough time to call a Board meeting, the Chairman and Chief executive officer provides the Directors with all relevant information by the most efficient method in order to obtain their opinion.\n\nOnce a year, the Board of Directors dedicates an item on its agenda to a discussion about its operation. In addition, an  assessment  of  its  organization  and operation is carried out periodically at the initiative of the  Lead  independent  Director;  this  assessment  is added to the agenda of a subsequent meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Board  also  reviews  each  Director's situation in relation to the independence criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, based on a report prepared by the Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee. The results of the review are reported to shareholders in the annual report.\n\nNon-Executive Directors may meet during or after a Board meeting, without the Executive Directors being present, so that they can assess the performance of the Executive Directors and consider the future line-up of Saint-Gobain Group's General Management.\n\n## IV. Board Committees\n\nThree  Board  Committees  exclusively  composed  of Directors  -  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  and  the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee - prepare the Board of Directors' tasks and deliberations in their respective areas.",

        "page_content": "## CSR information 2.\n\n## Note on methodology 2.1\n\nThe content of the CSR chapters of this document reflects broad consultation with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nInternally, countries or clusters of countries entities, BU of SHP and corporate support functions (Human Resources, Responsible Purchasing, Financial Communications, Responsible Development, EHS, etc.) have been asked to contribute, in order to enhance the report with examples.\n\nExternally, stakeholders are regularly consulted on general policy or various specific aspects of Saint-Gobain's social responsibility. These consultations assist in developing the Group's CSR reporting and communications.\n\n## Reference bases 2.1.1\n\nThe  guidelines  used  for  social  reporting,  EHS  reporting and the definition of indicators have been drawn up in accordance with the United Nations Global Compact and applicable French legislation.\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  global  reference  framework,  these standards  are  also  based  on  indicators  from  the  GRI (Global  Reporting  Initiative),  SASB  or  other  relevant standards depending on materiality issues.\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  Group's  Social  Affairs  Department, which  is responsible for social reporting, regularly collaborates  and  exchanges  information  with  leading contributors of the Human Resources Department in order to improve the doctrine and reporting processes.\n\nFor EHS reporting, working groups suggest developments in the  new  EHS  indicators,  to  monitor  changes  in international standards, and enhance feedback from the sites. These proposals are then discussed and validated at steering committee level twice a year.\n\nThe published data on Saint-Gobain's CSR, which follow the GRI methodology, comes from three different Group reporting systems:\n\n- the Smart'R management tool for employee reporting /uni25A0 and the annual social report;\n- management and reporting system for managerial staff, /uni25A0 called PeopleGroup;\n- the EHS (Environment, Health, Safety) reporting system /uni25A0 known as Ga\u00efa.\n\n## Social reporting 2.1.2\n\n## Basis 2.1.2.1\n\n## Scope of reporting\n\nThe Group's social reporting management tool, Smart'R, has 670 consolidated entities at the end of 2020.\n\n- This tool includes the employees of fully consolidated /uni25A0 Group companies. It forms the basis for calculation of the consolidated total number of employees and the distribution of employees by gender, region, geographic area, socio-professional category and contract type.\n\nNewly  integrated  companies  are  accounted  for  in accordance with their financial integration, and companies sold during the past year are not included.\n\n- In order to simplify data collection, for non-interfaced /uni25A0 entities with less than 500/uni00A0employees, only the number of employees and hours worked are reported in our reporting tool. Thus, indicators concerning staff movements, absences and compensation are calculated on 96.7% of the Group's perimeter.\n- The annual social reporting provides an overview of the /uni25A0 Group's social performance. The calculation of social indicators is based on the entire scope of the annual campaign, unless stated otherwise.\n\n## Management tool 2.1.2.2\n\nSmart'R  is  a  decision-making  tool,  introduced  by  the Human  Resources  department  in  order  to  provide computer-based data on employees.\n\nSince January/uni00A02017, Smart'R has integrated payroll details on a monthly basis. Automated collection is in place for more than 92% of the Group's employees. Manual data collection  is  necessary  for  entities  not  integrated  into shared  service  centers  (8%  of  employees  are  not interfaced).\n\nWe  are  setting  up  interfaces  as  soon  as  it  becomes relevant and technically possible to do so, but some data is still entered manually, particularly for the newly acquired companies.\n\nDetails of the annual social reporting were collected and entered into Smart'R. All data consolidation is carried out at the Saint-Gobain Group level.\n\nThe data on the organization and scope of the Group is updated in Smart'R each month, based on the changes in scope such as acquisitions, sales or mergers, dealt with in the Group's financial consolidation report.\n\nSmart'R allows social reporting to take place. In fact, the social data required for the analysis is extracted by means of  the  MicroStrategy  reporting  system,  supported  by Smart'R.\n\nThe GRI-HR questionnaire is completed each year by the Human Resources Departments of the Countries and the Activities in France  in  order  to  collect  qualitative indicators, and consult internal stakeholders when drafting the Report.\n\n## Continuous improvement 2.1.2.3\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  Group  has  taken  a  voluntary  and progressive  approach  to  enhancing  the  reliability  of  its social data, through:\n\n- continuous exchanges of information with the human /uni25A0 resources  managers  in  each  country  and  of  the activities in France  and  also  with  the  reporting contributors  to  ensure  proper  understanding  and application  of  the  rules  for  calculating  the  social indicators defined in the Group's doctrine, available in French and in English;\n\n9",

Smart'R's purpose is to collect data from payment systems at the end of each month. Since the closing payment dates are different depending on the countries, some indicators are solely calculated over 12 rolling months in order to accommodate  the  potential  discrepancies  emerging from these different closing dates.\n\n## Data consolidation 2.1.2.4\n\nThe reporting process is organized into four stages:\n\n- monthly  incorporation  into  Smart'R  of  interface  files /uni25A0 originating from Shared Service Centers and questionnaire for non-interfaced entities;\n- collection of the annual social data in questionnaires, /uni25A0 performed  by  contributors  at  company  level.  This represents additional data not present in Smart'R, such as indicators regarding social relations (e.g. number of agreements signed);\n- verification and consolidation within the Group's Social /uni25A0 Affairs Department;\n- the reporting allows spreadsheets to be generated as /uni25A0 management tools for the Group's Human Resources Department and at all levels of the structure, at all levels of the structure, both at company and regional levels.\n\n## Absenteeism and temporary employment 2.1.2.5\n\nAbsence or temporary employment data of certain entities are sometimes difficult to collect in view of local contexts. Absenteeism  rate  is  therefore  calculated  over  a  more limited  scope  than  that  of  the  annual  social  reporting campaign.\n\nAbsenteeism  rate  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and corresponds to the total number of hours of absence over the total number of theoretical hours worked. The reasons for  absence  taken  into  account  in  this  indicator  are absences for  illness,  absences  relating  to  occupational accidents (or travel), absences  due  to  strike  and unjustified absences. Authorized or anticipated absences (e.g. leave, family events) are not included in this indicator.\n\nIn some countries, entities have been excluded from the indicator's calculation  because  of  the  lack  of  data explained  by  a  variety  of  reasons  (no  interfaces,  local\n\nregulation, etc.). The following countries are concerned by this exclusion: United States, Canada, South Africa, Japan, several entities in India, one in Norway, two in Switzerland, and one in Indonesia, as well as non-interfaced entities with less than 500/uni00A0employees.\n\nThe  temporary  employment  rate  is  expressed  as  a percentage and corresponds to the total number of hours worked by temporary employees out of the total number of hours worked for the Group. Temporary employment does not include subcontractors and service providers.\n\nIn  several  countries,  entities  were  excluded  from  the calculation of the indicator due to lack of data for various reasons (local regulations, accounting difficulties, etc.).\n\nThe country and the entity concerned by this exclusion are South Africa and an entity in Norway.\n\n## Training indicators 2.1.2.6\n\nTraining activities carried out at the sold entities are taken into account in the calculation of the training indicators. The completion rates for mandatory e-learning (Adhere, Comply and ACT) include this year training initiated and carried out during the year as well as cases of initiated training that have not been fully completed, depending on changes in the scope of the Transform & Grow program.\n\n## Difficulties and restrictions 2.1.2.7\n\nThe main difficulty lies in the variety of countries in which the Group is active. The guidelines for the calculation of social  reporting  indicators  are  distributed  each  year  to contributors, but the indicators are sometimes interpreted according to local contexts (national laws or practices).\n\nThis is the case, among other things, for training concepts. Four entities in the United States were excluded from the perimeter  of  calculation  for  training  indicators,  due  to non-reliable  data.  The  non-interfaced  entities  with  less than 500 employees are also excluded from the perimeter.\n\n## EHS reporting 2.1.3\n\n## Basis 2.1.3.1\n\n## Scope of reporting\n\nThe EHS reporting covers 1,461/uni00A0entities corresponding to all the Group's facilities. All entities belonging  to consolidated  companies  in  which  Saint-Gobain  held  a stake of 50% or more at balance sheet date are monitored. This includes, where possible, facilities that came on-stream or were acquired during the year and excluding facilities that were closed or sold.\n\nThe  entities  are  defined  by  the  type  of  establishment according  to  the  following  categories:  factory,  sales branch  or  group  of  stores,  office,  warehouse,  Research and Development Center, mines and quarries, building site.",

Depending on the questionnaire, they also cover temporary employees and subcontractors (Safety and Safety-On-Line questionnaires).\n\nSafety data are reported on a monthly basis and comprise all accidents occurring during the month and their severity level.  The  system  covers  approximately  97%  of  the Group's employees. Full coverage is not achieved because of the maximum of two years' grace for newly acquired establishments to be included in Ga\u00efa.\n\nFurthermore, the Security reporting does not only include the  Group's  employees,  but  also  temporary  staff  and permanent  subcontractors  over  the  entire  perimeter, except some subcontractors from the distribution depending on the countries.\n\nOne-time  reporting  also  allows  entities,  through  the Safety-On-Line  system,  to  systematically  report  any occupational accident, with or without lost time, including fatal incidents, and to explain the circumstances.\n\nThe industrial hygiene and health questionnaire and the General questionnaire are completed annually.\n\nThe Environment questionnaire is also completed annually, by 829/uni00A0entities. The consolidated data from these entities corresponds  to  the  'Group  scope'.  An  'environmental scope' has been established. The sites of this perimeter have  been  selected  to  focus  efforts  on  establishments having the greatest impact, and to improve data legibility and progress toward goals. The activities have therefore validated certain criteria (energy and water consumption, quantity  of  non-recovered  waste,  etc.)  enabling  clear identification and monitoring. This scope includes 465/uni00A0entities.\n\nThe EvE standard for environmental events management identifies and manages events that could potentially occur at the sites.\n\nEHS financial data (expenses and capital expenditure) are tracked  in  the  SIF,  the  Group's  financial  reporting  tool since 2013.\n\n## 2010-2025 and 2017-2019 objectives 2.1.3.2\n\nThe Group has set medium-term objectives, up to 2025, based on the 2010/uni00A0results. To achieve them, intermediate\n\nobjectives  are  established  for  a  three-year  period.  The baseline year for the intermediate objectives is the year prior to the period start. The current period 2020-2022 therefore uses 2019 as its base year.\n\nBased on the results from the baseline year, every three years the Group updates the scope of 'concerned sites' for which environmental results are tracked for the next three  years  (2011-2013/2014-2016/2017-2019/2020-2022/ 2023-2025).\n\nThe  published  results  for  this  scope  therefore  have  a comparable scope for the three years within the period: sites closed or sold are removed from current year and baseline year, but no acquisitions are taken into account. They are included in the subsequent period.\n\nIn  addition,  for  the  indicators  tracking  environmental objectives, results are published using comparable production  to  the  baseline  year.  This  means  that 2020-2022 emissions and consumption are recalculated based on 2019/uni00A0production.\n\nProgress  achieved  over  these  five  three-year  periods (between  2010  and  2025)  will  be  cumulated  to  assess whether the 2025/uni00A0objectives have been achieved based on the 2010/uni00A0results.\n\n## Data consolidation 2.1.3.3\n\nThe  EHS  reporting  protocol  is  available  in  French  and English. The reporting process (both monthly and annual) involves three stages:\n\n- data input, performed by the EHS correspondent(s) at /uni25A0 the reporting unit concerned;\n- data verification, by the EHS Directors of each Region; /uni25A0\n- data  consolidation  by  the  Group's  EHS  Department /uni25A0 management.\n\n## Difficulties and restrictions 2.1.3.4\n\nSince the launch of the Group's reporting tools, the quality of  the  reports  has  continuously  improved  thanks  to effective feedback and better use of the systems by the specialized teams. These factors allow the Group to prevent  potential  errors  such  as  differences  in  units  of measurement  between  businesses  and  countries,  and difficulties in interpreting technical terms.\n\n9",

The indicators regarding trade purchases are calculated based on trade purchases realized in 2019.\n\n## Trade reporting perimeter 2.1.4.1\n\nThe indicators described in Chapter 3, Section 1.5.2.2 and published in Chapter 4, Section 2.4 are calculated based on the following perimeters:\n\n- European  partner  suppliers  are  strategic  suppliers /uni25A0 benefitting from a European master agreement. These suppliers  represent  51%  of  total  purchases.  These suppliers  sign  a  master  agreement  including  the Suppliers Charter;\n- the main suppliers are those with whom more than 3 /uni25A0 million euros of annual purchases are realized, among them  are  European  partners  and  local  brands'  main national suppliers (France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and United Kingdom). These identified suppliers cover over 76% of total trade purchasesl. These suppliers are included  in  the  CSR  risk  management  (risk  analysis, practices  assessment,  mitigation  actions)  and  are considered  in  suppliers'  distribution  by  level  of  CSR performance.\n\n- private labels' suppliers are those with whom /uni25A0 Saint-Gobain  Sourcing  (in  India  and  China)  develops products commercialized with a brand of the Group. They  represent  a  limited  proportion  of  total  trade purchases. They are considered in the results of audits on site.\n\n## Eligible perimeter non-trade purchases 2.1.4.2\n\nSuppliers of non-trade purchases perimeter considered in the  indicators  are  the  suppliers  of  over  100  thousands euros in annual purchases who have not been subject to a waiver (supplier owned by a state government or in a position  of  sole  sourcing)  and  that  do  not  concern spendings linked to industries that are not managed by the  Purchasing  Department  (banks,  insurances,  legal departments).\n\nThis perimeter represents 80% of the Group's non-trade perimeter total spending.\n\nCSR  performance  levels  of  documentary  reviews  were reviewed  in  2020  by  taking  into  account  new  trends (emergence of new regulations, increase of stakeholders' expectations, greater customer requirements) in order to review  the  minimum  expected  requirements  regarding CSR from suppliers identified as potentially risky following the risk analysis.",

It  is  the  product  of  a consultation  with  the  Group's  internal  stakeholders  and takes  into  account  Saint-Gobain's  new  organization, effective  as  of  January/uni00A01,  2019.  It  presents  the  Group's sustainable  growth  generation  process  through  its  key resources and its main pillars of value creation.\n\n## CSR risk and opportunity analysis\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  conducted  its  study  of  the  risks  and opportunities  related  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility (CSR)  within  the  framework  of  the  priority  challenges presented  in  the  materiality  analysis  (see  Chapter/uni00A03, Section 1.1.1).\n\nThus, a universe of the 15 most important CSR risks and opportunities for Saint-Gobain was built by factoring in the Group's strategy, objectives and operations as well as its main environmental, social and societal challenges. In an effort to harmonize the vocabulary and vision on these\n\nchallenges,  a  table  presenting  a  risk  or  opportunity's definition, potential impacts for stakeholders on the one hand  and  for  Saint-Gobain  on  the  other  hand,  was provided.\n\nThese risks and opportunities were then rated according to stakeholders' expectations in order to combine internal and external visions of the organization, according to the methodology shared with internal audit and control. While the  risk  assessment  methodology  follows  the  process developed by the internal control, the value scales were adapted to non-financial impacts and a long-term time scale.  The  interviews  were  conducted  from  May  to September/uni00A02018 with two criteria to assess: impact and criticality. Members of the Executive Board participated in these evaluations.\n\nNine CSR/uni00A0risks and opportunities were identified as the most important:\n\n- diversity within the organization and inclusion; /uni25A0\n- energy efficiency and carbon intensity of operations; /uni25A0\n- business ethics; /uni25A0\n- management of skills and talents; /uni25A0\n- responsible supply chain management; /uni25A0\n- integration of recycled materials; /uni25A0\n- energy  and  carbon  performance  of  products  and /uni25A0 services;\n- health and safety at work; /uni25A0\n- product safety. /uni25A0\n\nThe  identification  of  these  risks  is  a  key  step  in  the construction of the Group's CSR roadmap (see Chapter/uni00A02, Section 2.2.1.2).\n\n9",
